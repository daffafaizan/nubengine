    
      The study is designed as an international, multicenter, open-label, two-arm, prospective
      phase III study to compare the treatment of polatuzumab vedotin plus rituximab, ifosfamide,
      carboplatin and etoposide (Pola-R-ICE) with the combination of rituximab, ifosfamide,
      carboplatin and etoposide (R-ICE) alone as salvage therapy in patients with primary
      refractory or relapsed DLBCL.

      The study will involve study sites in Germany, UK, Spain, and Austria. It is planned to
      include 324 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to receive either treatment in the
      experimental arm (Pola-R-ICE) or in the standard arm (R-ICE) to end up with 308 evaluable
      subjects for the randomized part of the trial. Further 10 patients will be treated with
      Pola-R-ICE during the safety run-in phase.

      The study consists of a screening/inclusion visit, three chemotherapy cycles, an end-of -
      treatment visit (EoT), and follow-up visits. For each subject, the total duration of the
      study will be approximately 3 months of treatment plus at least 21 months follow-up. The
      study will end when the last included patient will have passed the last follow-up visit
      (LPLFU). For the study as a whole, the primary outcome will be evaluated when the last
      included patient will have completed the 21 months follow-up period or has left the study
      prematurely.
