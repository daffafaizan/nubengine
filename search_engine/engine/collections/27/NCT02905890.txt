      acquisition. BV has been described as a dysbiosis, or a microbial imbalance, and is treated
      with metronidazole; however, once treated, it often recurs rapidly. Developing robust
      treatment strategies to prevent recurrent BV is important for HIV prevention in key
      populations at high risk for HIV infection.

      There is evidence that hormonal contraceptives, including depot medroxyprogesterone acetate
      (DMPA), decrease BV recurrence; however, there is also evidence that DMPA increases the risk
      of HIV infection. Encouraging women to start or switch to an alternative progestin injectable
      such as norethisterone enantate (NET-EN) may mitigate HIV risk whilst decreasing the risk of
      recurrent BV. To date, there are no published studies that have investigated the effect of
      NET-EN on vaginal microbiota.

      The proposed study will investigate the effect of NET-EN and DMPA on recurrent BV, vaginal
      microbiota and inflammatory markers among women at high risk for HIV in the Good Health for
      Women Project in Kampala, Uganda. Consenting and eligible women will be treated for BV, and
      randomised to either NET-EN plus condoms or condoms only. Women currently using DMPA will be
      enrolled as an observational comparison arm. All participants will be interviewed and
      examined; samples for vaginal microbiota, sexually transmitted infections, and inflammatory
      markers will be obtained. Women will be followed up after 1 week, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6
      months. The primary outcomes will be differences in vaginal microbiota clusters, time to
      recurrent BV, and inflammatory markers. Qualitative research will be carried out to assess
      the acceptability of, and adherence to, NET-EN.
