      survival in patients with Her-2 positive metastatic breast cancer, but newer combinations
      with less toxicity and cross resistance are needed. Early clinical studies have suggested
      that the combination of vinorelbine, carboplatin and trastuzumab can be active against
      metastatic breast cancer, with less toxicity. In this phase II single center trial, 39
      patients will be enrolled to evaluate the activity and safety of this combination.
