    
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by pruritis and
      eczematous lesions with a worldwide prevalence of 15-20%. The burden of disease is highest in
      the most developed nations and predominantly affects children, with 50% of cases arising in
      the first year of life, and most others arising in the first 5 years. There is a well-known
      increased susceptibility to skin infection with S. aureus in patients with AD, and such
      infections are associated with clinical deterioration. While it is routine to evaluate for S.
      aureus colonization in the anterior nares, there is recent evidence suggesting that rectal
      colonization may be more significant. The significance of colonization site has not been
      evaluated in the AD population.

      Additionally, while topical antibiotics are a mainstay of treatment in AD, there is no
      routine data on the resistance to these agents.

      Our aim is to characterize the S. aureus colonization patterns in children with AD, including
      site of colonization and antibiotic resistance. We will analyze routinely-collected skin
      culture specimens from children with AD seen at our center and determine antibiotic
      susceptibility profiles. The significance of colonization site will be analyzed.
