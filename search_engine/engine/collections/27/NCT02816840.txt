      radiotherapy. 180 patients will be enrolled in the trial and randomly divided into three
      groups. Three arms are respectively treated with CT、18F-FDG PET/CT、18F-FDG PET/MRI. The
      images were passed in three-dimensional treatment planning system, using software manually
      fusion and reconstruction of PET and CT. All patients adopt IMRT for the radiotherapy with
      70Gy-80Gy. Three months after radiotherapy, solid tumer size for the prostate cancer will be
      assesed with PET / CT or CT. Early radiation reactions are evaluated by the United States
      RTOG (RTOG) acute response evaluation criteria, and late radiation reaction are evaluated
      with RTOG and the European Radiation Therapy Oncology Organization (EORTC). Before and after
      radiotherapy treatment,the tumor-associated marker of PSA will be monitored and the patients
      are regularly followed-up in the next three years.
