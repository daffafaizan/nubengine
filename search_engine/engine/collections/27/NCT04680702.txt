    
      Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is defined as a cluster of cardio metabolic risk factors that
      include central obesity low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C),
      hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and hyperglycaemia. Metabolic changes in childhood track
      into adulthood, predisposing these individuals to type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular
      diseases.

      The underlying prevalence of MetS in adolescents depends on the set of MetScri:eria used,
      with overall ranges in the US from 1.2%-9.8% using modified ATP-III criteria (Adult Treatment
      PanelII) to 4.5%-8.4% using the IDF adolescent criteria . Assessments among school-aged
      children and early adolescents islower (0.2%-1.2%) which is likely because of the strong
      effects of puberty on insulin resistance.

      There is no consensus regarding the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in children and
      adolescents. It is evident that each component of the syndrome must be identified as early as
      possible in order to prevent definitive lesion Pediatric and adolescent metabolic syndrome
      (MetS) criteria adapted from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel
      III (ATP lll),

        1. Central Obesity (WC): WC ≥ 90th percentile .

        2. High BP (mmHg) : Systolic or diastolic DBP≥ 90% for age, sex, height

        3. High Triglycerides (mg/dL) : TG ≥ 110 mg/dL (≥1.24 mmol/L) .

        4. HDL ≤ 40 mg/dL(<1.03 mmol/L).

        5. High Fasting Glucose :≥100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or known T2DM. Individuals need to have at
           least three abnormalities in MetS components to be classified as havingMetS SiMSscore
           was used as a simple and accurate method for Quantifying Metabolic Syndrome in adults ,
           Developed siMS score was calculated using formula: siMS score = 2*Waist/Height + Gly/5.6
           + Tg/1.7 + TAsystolic/130-HDL/1.02 or 1.28 (for male or female subjects,
           respectively),However studies on siMSscor in pediatric was done .

      PsiMSscore(pediatric sims score) calculated using formula: (2xWaist/Height) +
      (Glucose(mmol/l)/5.6) + (triglycerides(mmol/l)/1.7) + (Systolic BP/130)-(HDL(mmol/l)/1.02
