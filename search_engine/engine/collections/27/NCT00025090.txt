        -  Compare the response rates in patients with primary epidermoid anal cancer treated with
           radiotherapy and fluorouracil with either mitomycin or cisplatin and with or without
           maintenance therapy.

        -  Compare local control and prevention or delay of disease dissemination in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of
      four treatment arms.

      All patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. All patients also
      receive fluorouracil IV continuously over days 1-4 and 29-32.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitomycin IV on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1 and 29.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive mitomycin as in arm I and maintenance therapy comprising
           fluorouracil IV continuously over days 1-4 and cisplatin IV on day 1 beginning 4-8 weeks
           after completion of primary therapy and repeating once 3 weeks later.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive cisplatin as in arm II and maintenance therapy as in arm III.

      Patients are followed at 2 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
