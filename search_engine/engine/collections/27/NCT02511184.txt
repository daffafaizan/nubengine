    
      The patients will be screened for up to 28 days before they start treatment to determine if
      they meet eligibility criteria. The screening procedures will include physical examination,
      blood work and radiological scans.

      In the dose finding phase, patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive crizotinib at
      the dose level assigned that will be taken on daily basis and pembrolizumab 200 mg
      intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.

      Once a Crizotinib dose level is decided, the dose expansion cohort will start enrolling
      patients who meet eligibility criteria.

      All patients will be followed up every three weeks. Blood samples will be drawn to test for
      safety and tumor activities and radiological scans will be performed on certain timepoints to
      determine the antitumor activities.

      There will be a quality of life questionnaire administered at certain time points during the
      study.

      The study will have a quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry
      procedures. There is a plan to visit the investigator site for routine monitoring and
      auditing.

      The team will conduct source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or
      representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (e.g.,
      medical records, paper or electronic case report forms, or interactive voice response
      systems).

      The study will also include a statistical analysis plan describing the analytical principles
      and statistical techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary
      objectives of this study, as specified in the study protocol or statistical plan.
