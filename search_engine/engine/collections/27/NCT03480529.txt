      responsible of a wide range of rare immunological side effects. Those are poorly described,
      due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition of several of these
      adverse events. This study investigates the main characteristics of patients affected by rare
      immunological side effects (of which systemic lupus, immune arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
      Hepatitis, capillary leak syndrome) imputed to drugs. A causality assessment according to the
      WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center) is systematically applied.
