      after design, carried out from December 2016 and May 2017.

      Intervention consisted of the administration of powdered ginger extracts in the form of
      capsules at a dose of 2g/day, for a period of 6 weeks. Before and after intervention, the
      following were done by the participants: bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), blood
      pressure measurements, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, lipid profiles, liver function tests,
      kidney function tests and full blood counts. These were followed by morphological workup
      including Electrocardiograms (ECGs), transthoracic heart ultrasounds and Ambulatory Blood
      Pressure Measurements (ABPM), also done before and after intervention.

      Clinical evaluation with fasting blood sugar control and blood pressure controls were done at
      day 21 for safety purposes.
