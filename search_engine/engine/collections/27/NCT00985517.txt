      engineered to carry the human gene for neurturin, a neurotrophic (growth) factor. Similar to
      other growth factors (such as GDNF), neurturin is capable of restoring function and
      protecting brain cells from further damage. The virus used in CERE-120 is not known to cause
      disease in people.

      CERE-120 is delivered directly to the brain cells most affected in Parkinson's disease - the
      dopamine producing neurons. CERE-120 is injected during brain surgery. Once in place,
      CERE-120 continuously produces neurturin.

      During the first, open-label, part of the study (Phase 1), subjects with Parkinson's disease
      received CERE-120 at one of two dose levels. In the second part of the study (Phase 2),
      subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive CERE-120 or a "sham" surgery where no medication was
      injected.

      Participants in both phases of the study were followed for up to five years after surgery.
