    
      16 children between the age of 11-16 years will be recruited through Manchester Centre of
      Genomic Medicine NF1 Database. The participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups- active
      and sham treatment based on a computer generated random allocation list. The assessors will
      remain blind to treatment allocation.

      On day 1, parents will be requested to complete well validated and standardised
      questionnaires. Baseline recording of the brain activity EEG(Electroencephalogram) will be
      measured and the baseline cognitive assessments will be completed on the participants. tCDS
      will be administered for 20 minutes alongside a simultaneous training task for working
      memory. Days 2, the tDCS (active or sham) will be delivered simultaneous with the training
      task for 20 minutes. On day 3, the tDCS intervention will be delivered followed by repeating
      the outcome measures similar to day 1.

      A questionnaire investigating side-effects be will be completed by participant after each
      stimulation.Participants will be invited back to the lab 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the end
      of intervention to assess the longevity of any treatment effects.
