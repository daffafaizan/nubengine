      65 years of age fall each year. In Sweden 627 persons out of 100 000 is treated in hospitals
      because of injury after a fall. In Malm√∂, the figure is 883 persons out of 100 000. However,
      not all falls lead to a fracture. Dizziness has been identified as a risk factor for fall and
      vestibular asymmetry has been found among patients with fall-related wrist fractures as well
      as among patients with hip-fracture.

      Vestibular rehabilitation programs were first developed in the forties, originally used for
      peripheral vestibular disorder, in order to facilitate recovery. Modern research has widened
      the use of vestibular rehabilitation to patients with other causes of dizziness than
      peripheral vestibular disorders. Since wrist fracture is a risk factor for hip-fracture, much
      effort is focused on preventing falls for risk-groups. Therefore, it would be interesting to
      find out if it is possible to influence vestibular asymmetry with vestibular rehabilitation.

      The aim of this study is therefore to find out if vestibular rehabilitation can have any
      effect on vestibular function among patients with fall-related wrist fracture.
