      National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network
      (NRN) Centers (approximately 44 sites) in the United States. Infants meeting the study
      selection criteria and for whom informed consent is obtained will be randomized to receive
      either 80 mg inositol/kg/day or placebo, administered in divided doses every 12 hours (40
      mg/kg/dose). Study drug will be administered daily, starting within 12 to 72 hours of birth
      and continued until the earliest of 34 weeks PMA, 10 weeks chronologic age, or the time of
      hospital discharge or transfer. Inositol or placebo will be administered IV until enteral
      feedings reach 120ml/kg/day (or sooner if the infant is no longer receiving IV fluids), at
      which time the same dose and formulation will be administered enterally every 12 hours.

      For publication purposes, the analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will consider the
      entire study population. In support of a new drug application (NDA) for use of myo-Inositol
      5% Injection to increase survival without severe ROP through the determination of acute/final
      ROP status, the analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will be conducted for the entire
      study population and separately within pre-specified regulatory sub-studies created by
      administratively splitting infants enrolled at each study center into two sub-studies.

      Assessments performed during the study include customary newborn intensive care procedures
      including repeat eye examinations until ROP status is final (which often extends after
      discharge), measurements of growth, cranial ultrasounds or other imaging per usual practice,
      and the collection of clinical diagnoses throughout hospitalization to evaluate other common
      morbidities of extreme preterm birth. Adverse events will be recorded from time of treatment
      initiation until 7 days after the last dose of study drug, and concurrent medications will be
      recorded from 24 hours prior to randomization until 7 days after the last dose of study drug
      or until discharge or transfer if sooner. Using the separate NICHD Follow-up protocol, longer
      term data will be collected at 22-26 months corrected age, including growth,
      neurodevelopmental testing, overall health status, rehospitalizations, surgeries and
      diagnoses, including ophthalmic diagnoses and treatments since discharge.
