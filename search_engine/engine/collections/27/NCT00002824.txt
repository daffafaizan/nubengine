      vector carrying the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (H5.010RSVTK) followed by
      intravenous ganciclovir in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. II. Estimate the maximum
      tolerated dose of H5.010RSVTK in these patients. III. Describe the toxic effects of
      H5.010RSVTK. IV. Assess the efficiency of gene transfer and duration of transgene expression
      in these patients. V. Assess quantitative and qualitative glucose metabolic activity of
      tumoral sites by positron emission tomography. VI. Analyze the immunologic response to
      adenovirus transduction in these patients. VII. Determine the benefit and toxicity of
      multiple doses of H5.010RSVTK in patients with resectable tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study. All patients receive stereotactically injected
      H5.010RSVTK (a recombinant adenovirus vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine
      kinase gene). Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of H5.010RSVTK until the
      maximum tolerated dose is reached. Ganciclovir is then given on the third post-injection day.
      Patients with unresectable tumors receive ganciclovir for 14 consecutive days. Patients with
      resectable tumors receive ganciclovir for 7 consecutive days before undergoing craniotomy
      with optimal debulking and injection of a second dose of the adenovirus vector followed by
      ganciclovir for 14 more days. Patients are followed monthly for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients (9 with resectable tumors and 9 with unresectable
      tumors) will be entered over 3 years.
