      complications between two techniques of nerve localisation for nerve blocks of the lower
      limb. We have developed a real-time, image guided approach to nerve blocks of the lower
      extremities in three locations: the femoral nerve in the groin and the sciatic nerve in the
      buttock and/or popliteal fossa. We have used ultrasound imaging to locate and asess the
      nerves of the lower extremities and to use it as a real-time guidance for performance of
      lower extremity blocks in patients undergoing orthopaedic procedures. The results of our
      previous study will be presented as a case series reporting anatomical appearance of the
      nerves studied, time for block performance and success rates. In this study we aim to compare
      these parambeters between standard and ultrasound techniques of lower extremity block, to
      show any advantage.
