        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
           irinotecan with or without oxaliplatin.

        -  Compare the response rate, time to tumor-related worsening of symptoms, time to disease
           progression, onset and duration of responses, and duration of disease stabilization in
           these patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to Karnofsky performance status (50-60% vs 70-100%), number of metastatic organs
      involved (1 vs 2 or more), lactic dehydrogenase (no greater than 1.5 times upper limit of
      normal (ULN) vs greater than 1.5 times ULN), and prior fluorouracil chemotherapy (adjuvant vs
      first-line treatment for metastatic disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes followed by irinotecan IV over
           30 minutes on day 1.

      Courses repeat in each arm every 3 weeks for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days, every 4 weeks for 3 months, and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 596 patients (298 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 18 months.
