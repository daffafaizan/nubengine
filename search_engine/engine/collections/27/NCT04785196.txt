      MTD/RP2D of APG-115 in combination with toripalimab. Dose levels/schedule of APG115 will be
      tested: 50mg, 100mg, 150mg, and 200mg, QOD with 2 weeks on 1 week off as a cycle of 21 days
      (3 weeks), toripalimab will administrated with label dose.

      Part 2 is the phase II portion of the study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of
      the RP2D of APG-115 in combination with label dose of toripalimab in patients with advanced
      liposarcoma. In this part, Simon's two-stage design (Simon R (1989). Controlled Clinical
      Trials 10: 1-10.) will be used. The null hypothesis that the true response rate of
      combination is 30% or lower will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the first
      stage, 19 patients will be accrued. If there are 3 or fewer responses in these patients, the
      study will be stopped. Otherwise, 15 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 34.
      The null hypothesis will be rejected if 7 or more responses are observed in 34 patients. This
      design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 90%.
