        -  Compare the disease-free and overall survival rates of patients with colon cancer
           treated with laparoscopic-assisted colectomy vs open colectomy.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in terms of early and late morbidity and 30-day
           mortality of these patients.

        -  Compare the differences in costs and cost effectiveness between these treatments in this
           patient population.

        -  Compare the differences in quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, primary surgeon, site of primary tumor (right vs left vs sigmoid), and
      American Society of Anesthesiologists disease classification (I and II vs III). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

      The extent of colon resection is identical for both arms.
