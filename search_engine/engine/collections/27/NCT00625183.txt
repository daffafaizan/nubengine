      Primary

        -  To determine the complete pathological response rate of the combination of capecitabine,
           oxaliplatin, selenomethionine, and radiotherapy in patients with stage II or III rectal
           adenocarcinoma.

        -  To determine the T-downstaging rate with this regimen in patients with stage II or III
           rectal adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety of this regimen by assessing toxicity and dose intensity of the
           various components of this regimen.

        -  To determine the rate of local relapse.

        -  To determine the rate of distant relapse.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy comprising oral selenomethionine twice daily
      for 1 week prior to radiotherapy and then once daily for 6 weeks. Patients also receive
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1-7 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-5 for 6
      weeks and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Within 4-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo curative-intent
      surgery. Beginning 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients may receive up to 9 courses of standard
      adjuvant combination chemotherapy (FOLFOX).

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and weekly during treatment and analyzed by
      absorption spectrophotometry for selenium measurement of drug concentration. Pharmacokinetic
      studies are also performed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years.
