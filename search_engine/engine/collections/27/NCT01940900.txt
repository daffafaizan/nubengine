    
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following dose groups:

        -  Fovista® 1.5 mg/eye + Lucentis® 0.5 mg/eye

        -  Fovista® sham + Lucentis® 0.5 mg/eye

      Subjects will be treated for a total of 24 months with active Fovista® or sham in combination
      with Lucentis® with the primary endpoint at 12 months.

      Primary Efficacy Endpoint:

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change in visual acuity (ETDRS letters) from
      baseline at the month 12 visit.

      Safety Endpoints:

      Safety endpoints include adverse events, vital signs, ophthalmic variables [ophthalmic
      examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), fluorescein angiogram (FA), optical coherence
      tomography (OCT)], ECG, and laboratory variables.

      Approximately 622 subjects will be randomized into one of the two treatment cohorts (311
      patients per dose group).
