      to study external wounds, which can currently be measured for length by width using a ruler.
      WMMS operates by taking simultaneous visual and thermal images of the external wound site and
      the associated body surface. These images are evaluated by utilizing the WMMS ImageReview
      measuring and monitoring software. WMMS ImageReview software allows for LxW (length by width)
      and surface area (cm squared),as well as perimeter (cm) external wound measurements of the
      visual image. WMMS ImageReview software also allows for the display of thermal intensity
      variation data for the associated body surface of the corresponding thermal image.

      This study is primarily designed to utilize the Coefficients of Individual Agreement (CIA)as
      a means of establishing the equivalence of area measurements utilizing the WMMS ImageReview
      software LxW technique and the current "gold standard" LxW manual ruler technique.

      A secondary objective measures the thermal intensity variation data of the external wound bed
      by overlaying the corresponding "Visual External Wound Trace"from the visual image onto the
      thermal wound bed.
