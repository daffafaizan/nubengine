    
      The Brain Injury Inpatient Guide for Families and Caregivers (BIIG-FACS), developed by J.
      Niemeier and J. Kreutzer, is a comprehensive intervention to meet the needs of family members
      and significant others of patients who are undergoing acute brain injury rehabilitation.
      Program development was guided by considerable clinical experience, research review, and
      solicited consumer feedback.

      The intervention has been manualized to facilitate efficient and effective administration.
      Now, a rigorous investigation involving randomized assignment to treatment and control groups
      is needed to empirically examine outcomes. Helping family members to cope more effectively
      has the potential to improve outcomes for persons with ABI. Strengthening families can enable
      persons with ABI to live more independently, achieve greater community integration, and live
      healthier lives. The investigation serves as a logical next step forward in advancing our
      understanding of standardized interventions designed to serve the family unit.
