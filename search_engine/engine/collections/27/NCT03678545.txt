      the efficacy of dupilumab vs. placebo in EG. Qualifying subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      either study drug (dupilumab) or placebo, and will receive 600 mg once followed by 300 mg
      doses every two weeks of study treatment for a total of 6 injections. After the 6th injection
      subjects may continue into an open-label treatment phase in which dupilumab will be
      administered every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks.

      Approximately nine sites associated with the Consortium of Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal
      Disease Researchers (CEGIR) will take part in the study.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of repeat subcutaneous (SC)
      doses of dupilumab, compared with placebo, to reduce eosinophilic inflammation in the
      gastrointestinal tract of patients with EG.
