    
      Primary Objectives

      To determine the safety and tolerability of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in
      patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified MBC.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the anti-tumor effect of fulvestrant, palbociclib and erdafitinib in
           patients with ER+/HER2-/FGFR-amplified MBC.

        -  Pharmacokinetic assessments of erdafitinib

      Correlative Objectives

        -  To determine the therapeutic predictive role of FGFR1-4, CCND1-2, CDK4 and CDK6
           amplifications, and RB1 and ESR1 mutations on clinical outcome

        -  To determine if the FGFR1 amplification levels is an early surrogate of response

        -  To determine if the cfDNA results at disease progression show new genomic alterations
           potentially associated with resistance to CDK4/6 and FGFR inhibition

        -  To determine pharmacodynamic biomarkers of FGFR inhibition
