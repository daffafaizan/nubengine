      study involved three maternities in Auvergne region (Issoire, Thiers, Saint-Flour).
      Precarious women living in rural areas are included. They will be followed during a period of
      two months after childbirth. The main assessment criterion is the adequation rate between
      antenatal care for those women and the HAS recommendation's.

      The amount necessary to highlight a significant difference is 190 patients (IC 95% [0.429 -
      0.571] ; risk = 5 % ; Adequation rate = 50 % ; lost to follow-up rate = 10 % ; deprivation
      rate = 27 %).

      The secondary criteria of judgment are the reasons for not realized antenatal and postnatal
      cares, the difficulties of realized antenatal and postnatal cares, the strategies developed
      to overcome them, the term and health status of the child birth (Apgar score, birth weight),
      the health status of the child birth and his mother during the two post-partum months (HAS
      recommendation's).
