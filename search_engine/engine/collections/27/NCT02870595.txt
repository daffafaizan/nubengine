      The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive 1% lidocaine injections for digit
      blocks of the finger will experience less pain when the injection is accompanied by the use
      of a micro-vibratory stimulator (MVS) compared with patients who receive injections without
      the MVS.

      Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the pain rating scale from an exposure
      group (digit block injection with the aid MVS) and the control group (traditional injection).
