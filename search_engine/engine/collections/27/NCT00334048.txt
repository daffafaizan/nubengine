      experience sexual dysfunction at distressing levels, with reported rates varying
      considerably. When sexual dysfunction is assessed prospectively using structured
      questionnaires, high levels of dysfunction have been found. SSRIs including paroxetine,
      sertraline, and other medications, have been shown to have a similar frequency of sexual side
      effects and in a recent prospectively designed study 50% of men taking sertraline reported
      that they were only "slightly" (18%) or "not at all" (32%) satisfied with their sexual
      functioning. It is reported that sexual side effects of antidepressant treatment frequently
      result in noncompliance with and/or premature discontinuation of treatment. A recent study
      showed that the dopamine agonist Requip (Ropinirole) reduced the amount of SSRI-associated
      sexual dysfunction. The proposed study will utilize a placebo control group in a crossover
      design to determine the effect on sexual dysfunction of adding Requip (Requip CR formulation)
      to the patient's SSRI treatment.

      30 patients experiencing sexual dysfunction attributable to SSRI treatment for depression
      will be entered into this study. All patients will receive 6 weeks of treatment with
      Ropinirole and 6 weeks with placebo in a crossover fashion. Assessments of sexual functioning
      and depression will be made at each visit.
