      considered first-line agents in late life bipolar disorder, side effects are common, and many
      individuals with bipolar disorder continue to have symptoms in spite of medication treatment.
      A continuing unmet need is the availability of medications that are generally well- tolerated
      and effective in later life bipolar disorders.

      Antipsychotic medications such as Abilify are known to be effective for related conditions
      such as schizophrenia and are also used by some physicians in clinical settings in
      combination with mood stabilizing medications (Lithium, Depakote and others) to treat
      symptoms of bipolar disorder. Currently Abilify is approved by the FDA to treat schizophrenia
      and to treat bipolar disorder.
