      cancer and cervical cancer. Because most patients with advanced ovarian cancer can not get
      the ideal tumor cell reduction surgery, and multi-drug resistance often emerges after
      repeated chemotherapy，recurrent and metastatic ovarian cancer has become one of the major
      diseases that threaten women's health. There is strongly necessary to explore effective
      therapeutic drugs and means to improve prognosis of these patients and improve the quality of
      life. The study，as a double blind clinical trial ,is to investigate the efficacy and safety
      of apatinib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer,who has received second-line
      chemotherapy regimens and failed. A total of 60 patients with performance status 0-2 were
      enrolled in this study, and were randomly divided into two groups--one group of 40 patients
      receiving apatinib，and another of 20 patients receiving placebo.
