      soft contact lens study will determine the feasibility of this design by determining which
      parameters of the shape of the Apioc Contact Lens design will yield a successful fit across
      subjects. We will also determine the percentage of subjects who can be successfully fitted
      with the Apioc Contact Lens Design. Because the feasibility of the lens design may be
      dependent upon age, a total of 50 subjects (10 subjects each across 5 decades of life) will
      complete the study. The data will be collected in a single visit for most subjects. A few
      subjects may be asked to return for a second visit if additional contact lens parameters need
      to be ordered to achieve a successful fit. The key assessments for this study will be
      demonstration of feasibility of fit, documentation of movement in all gazes, including
      translation, and subjective reports of comfort. Subjects will only wear contact lenses while
      in the office.
