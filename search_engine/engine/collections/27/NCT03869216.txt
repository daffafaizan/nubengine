      patients and their providers engage in a shared-decision making process about the benefits
      and harms of PSA-based screening. As characterized by the USPSTF, these conversations are
      particularly important for African American men given increased ambiguity due to the lack of
      PSA-based research specific to this population and increased risk of prostate cancer
      mortality attributed to late stage at diagnosis and more aggressive prostate cancer
      phenotypes seen in African American men.

      The goal of this randomized behavioral clinical trial is to advance the translation path of
      implementing the decision-making process in clinical encounters by evaluating the efficacy of
      an educational intervention for African American males to increase shared decision making
      about PSA-screening versus usual care. The intervention will use multimedia educational
      training materials to increase understanding of prostate cancer, PSA-based screening, and
      shared decision making among patients and PCPs
