    
      This is a phase 1/2a clinical trial in subjects who are diagnosed with prostate cancer to
      evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 in the treatment of localized prostate
      cancer.

      Subjects enrolled will be diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (clinical stage T1/T2)
      having a Gleason score of 6 to 7 (3+4 or 4+3). Subjects will receive up to four (4)
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided IT treatments with Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 into the prostate
      approximately 6-weeks apart. Each treatment cycle will be performed using a minimum of three
      track injections through the prostrate using a total of 3 mL volume. Approximately 2 mL of
      the total volume will be injected into the most dense areas of cancer based on biopsy and MRI
      mapping (fusion biopsy) and 1 mL total volume will be injected into the opposite lobe of the
      prostate or other areas to ensure complete saturation of the prostate over multiple
      injections.

      Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are progressing at any time after the
      second injection of Ad5-SGE-REIC/Dkk-3 may be discontinued and will be treated according to
      standard medical practice.
