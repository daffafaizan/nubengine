    
      This is a prospective, single center, non-randomized, open-label, single arm study in which
      we will gather data and physician input for the assessment and further development of the
      KODEX - EPD functions for assessing tissue pressure, tissue thickness, lesion transmurality.
      The study will include up to 30 subjects. We will enroll patients with atrial flutter and
      patients with atrial fibrillation who are scheduled to undergo RF ablation of the
      cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI). Both male and female subjects who meet all eligibility criteria
      and give written informed consent will be enrolled in the study. We will be assessing the
      feasibility of the KODEX-EPD tissue pressure (TP), tissue thickness and lesion transmurality
      applications.
