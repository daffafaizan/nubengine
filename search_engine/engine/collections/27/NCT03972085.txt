      Electrotherapy procedures, manual therapy techniques, kinesiotherapy and specific exercises
      are among those that are frequently used. In neural mobilization techniques, which began to
      gain popularity in 1990s, neural tissue and the surrounding structures are glided or
      tensioned to mobilize them. Neural mobilization is thought to have a positive effect on
      symptoms by inducing intraneural circulation, axoplasmic flow, and neural visco-elasticity
      and sensitivity associated with the connective tissue. There are studies in which this
      modality has yielded therapeutic success in terms of both pain and functionality,
      particularly in lumbar region and lower limb disorders where neural mechanosensitivity is
      increased.
