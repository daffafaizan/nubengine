      Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) with Pulsar-18 thin struts bare metal stent, as low as reasonably
      achievable (ALARA), while benefiting from the antirestenotic properties of Paclitaxel.
      However, in order to optimally apply this selective stenting approach, it is needed to
      clearly identify when a stent is indicated. Angiographic images, even with additional
      projections, are sometimes insufficient to clearly determine if a dissection is flow-limiting
      and the subsequent stent requirement. There is currently no definition nor validated method
      to define flow-limiting dissection in the peripheral arteries. Even though it has been widely
      used, the classification developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to grade
      coronary artery dissection as A to F19, based on angiographic appearance cannot be
      extrapolated to peripheral arteries.

      Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the incremental value of several
      adjunctive procedural assessments to standard angiography to identify flow-limiting
      dissection and residual stenosis, and better inform the operator on the stent requirement. In
      addition, the study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the REACT algorithm.
