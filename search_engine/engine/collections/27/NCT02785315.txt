      confirmed by physicians, will receive 12 weekly 90-minute cognition interventions in a group
      of 6-8 persons. All participants will be randomly assigned to the following groups: 1)
      Remediation approach: various cognitive strategies will be taught, and exercises involving
      the practice of these strategies to enhance the attention, memory, processing speed, and
      executive functions. 2) Combination of rehabilitation and remediation approaches: The first
      half of each session will focus on the remediation approach as described above. The second
      half of the session will apply rehabilitation approach. The investigators will use group
      discussion to discuss everyday situations with memory problem and specific strategies
      (internal and external) related to real-life situations. The investigators will also include
      one individual session in the 12 group sessions.

      All participants will be assessed at 3 time points: before intervention, right after
      intervention, and 12 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcomes are the ADL functions
      evaluated by subjective and objective measures, and cognitive function evaluated by tests of
      attention, memory and executive function. The secondary outcomes include the depression, the
      quality of life of the participants, and the caregivers' load. The intervention effects will
      be further analyzed by the caregivers' attitude regarding to the level of ADL assistance.
