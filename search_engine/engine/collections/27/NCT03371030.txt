      occur in patients with conditions such as diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or
      alcoholism. Diagnosis of nonunion is based on the absence of radiographic signs of union at 6
      months. Treatment should be individualized but options are reconstructive procedures or wrist
      arthrodesis. In volar plating and often by the fracture injury itself, the complete pronator
      quadratus is stripped off the volar radius. Thus, the intraosseous collateral circulation
      must be sufficient for clinical healing. Any operative approach to the distal radius fracture
      should not compromise both volar radial and the dorsoulnar arteries.

      While the branches to the pronator quadratus must be sacrificed in a palmar approach, the
      distal perforator can and should be spared. This is true even in the flexor carpi radialis
      extended approach. In distal radius fractures, when the normal outward flow of blood through
      the cortex is blocked, the periosteal arterioles have more ability than medullary arterioles
      to function and proliferate.
