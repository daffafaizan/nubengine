      treatment for painful oral lesions in HIV-infected patients. Limited data suggest that this
      drug may be effective when given systemically, but is accompanied by a high incidence of side
      effects. Administration of the drug topically onto the lesion should result in high local
      concentrations within the lesion thereby suppressing tumor necrosis factor which is thought
      to be related to the size and severity of the lesion. Subjects will be randomly allocated to
      one of three possible groups: systemic administration of thalidomide, topical administration
      of thalidomide, and placebo. The dose of thalidomide will be determined in a dose escalation
      pilot study prior to the main study. Healing, pain, and the incidence of side effects will be
      assessed at baseline and weekly for up to eight weeks. Successful demonstration of an
      enhanced therapeutic effect or reduced toxicity may provide a basis for the development of
      novel routes of administration and drugs for the treatment of painful oral lesions associated
      with HIV infection and other diseases.
