      Primary

        -  Determine 2-year overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed, bulky stage II or
           stage III or IV peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with cisplatin,
           etoposide, gemcitabine, and methylprednisolone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the response rate (complete unconfirmed response, complete response, and
           partial response) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes, etoposide IV over 30-60 minutes, and
      methylprednisolone IV over 5 minutes on days 1-4. Patients also receive gemcitabine IV over
      30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-6 weeks, 3 months, and then
      every 6 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
