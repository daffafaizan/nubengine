      outcome measures to changes in group social interaction. Following amendments to the pilot
      protocol, twelve new participants with severe ABI were recruited from a residential
      post-acute rehabilitation centre in April 2015. An experimental parallel group design was
      used to compare a peer-led group intervention to a staff-led social activity group.
      Participants were randomised to a peer-led intervention (n=6) or a staff-led social activity
      group (usual care) (n=6). The groups met twice a week for 8 weeks. A peer with severe ABI was
      trained separately to facilitate interaction in the peer-led group. The training took place
      in 16 individual sessions over 4 weeks. Group behaviour was measured twice at baseline, after
      intervention and at maintenance (4 weeks) using measures meeting reliability, validity and
      responsiveness criteria tested in the pilot study.
