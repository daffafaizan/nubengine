    
      Aim 1: Develop a longitudinal database of patients with SWS Clinical sites will collect
      longitudinal data retrospectively on measures of clinical symptoms and medications/treatments
      for study subjects who participated in the existing BVMC2/SWF registry and consent to
      participate in BVMC3 study. Retrospective data will be used to create a longitudinal
      dashboard where practitioners can identify predictors of atrisk patients who are most likely
      to have a serious neurological symptom and the current treatments. Prospective data
      collection: Clinical sites will collect longitudinal data prospectively for at-risk patients
      who present with a new, severe neurological symptom.

      Aim 2: Examine longitudinal Quantitative MRI Baseline MRI datasets will be collected and
      Limited Data Sets (LDS) will be generated and uploaded to a central imaging database from all
      participating centers. Subsequent MRI scans will be collected for patients who experience
      acute exacerbation of clinical symptoms, including seizures, headaches, or stroke-like
      episodes. Integrated imaging data, detailed treatment data, and detailed clinical data
      including neurological symptoms, seizures, and headache history will be analyzed.

      Aim 3: Collect and Store Blood Samples for Analysis All patients enrolled in BVMC3 study will
      have blood samples sent to and stored at University of California San Francisco (UCSF).
      Enrolled patients presenting with stroke-like episodes, stroke, headache, or seizure will
      have a second blood sample taken at the time of the neurologic symptom and a third sample
      taken 6 months later, or even later if symptoms have not resolved within 6 months. Multiplex
      angioma and inflammatory marker array will be assessed on all 3 samples from patients at the
      same time.
