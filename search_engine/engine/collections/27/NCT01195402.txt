      capabilities and quality of life in COPD patients. Clinically relevant effects have been
      achieved by training programs of differing design regarding setting (inpatient vs. outpatient
      vs. home-based), duration (short-term vs. long-term) and intensity (high vs. low intensity).

      While there is sufficient evidence to propose pulmonary rehabilitation its use is generally
      low in clinical practice. One reason may be that it is unlikely that costly programs are
      offered to a significant proportion of eligible patients. The ideal training program will
      therefore at the same time accomplish the greatest improvements regarding physical
      capabilities and quality of life and sustain them for the longest period at the lowest cost.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate whether a continuous, low-intensity,
      low-cost, physiotherapist-led outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program is a able to
      achieve significant long-term improvements of exercise tolerance and quality of life in
      moderate to severe COPD patients at a lower cost level than previously published programs.
