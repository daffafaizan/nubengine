      been used for decades. It is defined as the application of chemical agents, of variable
      strength, on the skin that results in controlled destruction of the epidermis and dermis. The
      induced exfoliation is followed by dermal and epidermal regeneration from adjacent epithelium
      and skin adnexa, which results in improved surface texture and appearance of the skin. This
      is a simple and cost-effective procedure with several dermatological applications.

      Salicylic acid is a 2-hydroxybenzoic acid used for superficial peeling due to its strong
      keratolytic and comedolytic properties. It promotes shedding of epidermal cells and due to
      its lipophilic properties can penetrate comedones and pores to prevent clogging and
      neutralize bacteria. It promotes desquamation of the upper lipophilic layers of the stratum
      corneum. These chemical properties explain its popularity and success in acne patients. Also,
      it has well-documented anti-inflammatory properties.

      Silymarin is a standardized extract from S. marianum seeds, is traditionally used as a
      hepatoprotective agent for its potent regenerative properties. Lately, Silymarin is utilized
      in dermatological and cosmetic preparations for its antioxidant effect anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory properties.

      Various studies have been created to evaluate the efficacy of Silymarin in UV protection,
      prevention against skin cancer and against actinic keratosis.

      Silymarin showed efficacy the treatment of Rosacea, Melasma, Vitiligo, Psoriasis, atopic
      dermatitis and contact dermatitis . Other studies showed that Silymarin has anti aging
      properties and potential action for wound healing .
