      and serious conditions of the gastrointestinal tract such as a bleeding peptic ulcer. As
      such, more than 80% of patients who present to US ED's with suspected bleeding in their upper
      GI tract require hospitalization, procedural sedation by an anesthesiologist, and a
      traditional tube-based upper endoscopy by a gastroenterologist. While this traditional
      process is safe and effective, it is not efficient for our low-risk patients and not timely
      for our high-risk patients. The opportunity to bring Video Capsule Endoscopy to the
      front-lines of US medical care will revolutionize how we manage upper GI bleeding and shed
      light on critical diseases that have heretofore been hidden from most providers. This trial
      is an important step toward demonstrating that VCE is a safe and effective tool to
      risk-stratify upper GI bleeding and improve quality of emergency care for all patients.
