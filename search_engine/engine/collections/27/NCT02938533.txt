      intervention based on the concepts of social norms and priming. The intervention included
      visual feedback about clinic-level retention in care, a self-relevant prime, and useful
      take-home items with the priming image. The intervention was developed using tools from
      marketing research and patient-centered design. The hypothesis was that the intervention
      would improve retention in care and adherence to ART among patients living with HIV infection
      (PLHIV). The intervention was implemented at two HIV primary clinics in Shinyanga, Tanzania
      in 2-week intervals for six months. The investigators reviewed medical records of a random
      sample of exposed and unexposed adult PLHIV to compare retention and the proportion of
      patients with medication possession ratio (MPR) â‰¥95% after six months.
