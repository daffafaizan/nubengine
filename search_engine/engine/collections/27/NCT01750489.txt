      dyspnoea are linked to heightened sympathetic activation at rest and during exercise in
      patients with COPD. Furthermore, the effect of unloading the respiratory muscles by using
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) will be assessed. Fifteen stable COPD patients without NIV
      will be matched to 15 healthy control subjects (with sufficient microneurography recording).
      Furthermore COPD patients on regular NIV will be studied. Each participant will undergo
      symptom limited bicycle exercise and a handgrip protocol. Microneurography will be used to
      quantify sympathetic activity by the transcutaneous registration of postganglionic
      sympathetic efferents.
