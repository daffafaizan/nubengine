      one asthma attack per year. Recent studies found that 60% of moderate asthmatics and 70% of
      severe asthmatics report using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to self-treat
      their asthma symptoms.The exact mechanism of action of these agents is unclear but may
      involve attenuation of allergic response, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and/or
      direct effects on airway smooth muscle which are responsible for airway narrowing in asthma.

      Studies done in mouse models of asthma and directly on airway smooth muscle cells demonstrate
      that ginger blocks one of the critical inflammatory pathways in asthma and thus leads to
      reduced airway inflammation and relaxation of airway smooth muscle. Clinical trials with
      chronic oral ginger therapy in humans have demonstrated safe consumption of 2 grams per day
      for 28 days with demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in colon cancer and inflammatory
      bowel diseases. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that oral ginger at a dose of 2 grams per
      day will reduce airway inflammation and will reduce serum levels of asthma related
      inflammatory markers.
