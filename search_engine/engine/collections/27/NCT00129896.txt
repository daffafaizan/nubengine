      11%. The investigators expect to achieve an increase of 14% on this rate; that is, they
      expect a pathological response rate of 25%. With a= 0.05 and Î²=0.2, 18 patients are initially
      needed. If at least 3 pathological complete responses are achieved, recruitment will continue
      to up to 53 patients. At least 10 pathological complete responses are needed to probe the
      hypothesis. Considering a 10% post-randomization drop-out rate, a total of 59 patients must
      be recruited for the trial.
