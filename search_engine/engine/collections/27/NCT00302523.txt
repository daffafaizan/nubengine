      Over the past decade, a number of studies have reported therapeutic efficacy for treatment
      with Cyclosporine-A (CSA) in patients with nephrotic syndrome including patients with
      membranous nephropathy. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new
      calcineurin immunosuppressive drug, tacrolimus (FK506), in reducing the amount of protein in
      the urine in patients with membranous nephropathy. Forty patients with biopsy-proven
      membranous nephropathy will be recruited. Candidates must have completed at least six month
      of treatment with a stable dose of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). They will be screened with a medical history, physical
      examination, blood tests, and an examination for infection, cancers, and other conditions
      that can cause membranous nephropathy. The investigators plan to conduct an open-label study
      of the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus in the treatment of membranous nephropathy. They
      will be treated with oral tacrolimus for 6 months, followed by 6 months of maintenance.
      Proteinuria, renal function will be monitored. Complete remission is defined as 24-hour
      urinary protein excretion to less than 0.4 mg/day. This study will explore the potential role
      of tacrolimus in the treatment of membranous nephropathy, which is usually resistant to
      conventional therapy.
