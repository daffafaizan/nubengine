      Hospital of Bonsucesso for medical indication or own will, obeying the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. After signing the informed consent, they will be evaluated clinically and
      laboratorially, according to the routine of preoperative exams and pre-anesthetic outpatient
      evaluation. Patients will be allocated to one of two groups: control group (30 patients), who
      will receive pretreatment by venous infusion of saline solution; And magnesium group (30
      patients) who will receive pretreatment by intravenous infusion of magnesium sulfate 60 mg /
      kg according to the random number sequence generated electronically through the QuickCalcs
      program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) Because it is a double-blind study, both the
      researcher and the patient will not know which of the groups will be studied.

      The principal investigator will be responsible for the delivery of sealed envelope containing
      the sequence of cases allocated in each of the groups to another anesthesiologist who will
      prepare the solution (saline or magnesium sulphate) and will record in a specific file in
      which group the volunteer was Allocated. Again the envelope will be sealed for tabulation
      later, without the knowledge of the researcher. The same principal investigator will be in
      charge of the measurement and recording of the data collected.
