      and is commonly considered a sign of intrauterine infection. Despite studies showing that
      most causes of maternal intrapartum fever are non-infectious, intrapartum fever often prompts
      the diagnosis of chorioamnionitis/intrauterine infection, or what is now known as 'triple I'
      (intra-amniotic infection or inflammation). Diagnosis of triple I is primarily based on
      clinical findings such as maternal fever, maternal leukocytosis, uterine tenderness,
      foul-smelling or purulent amniotic fluid, and fetal tachycardia. A minimum of two of these
      criteria for diagnosis, although this distinction is somewhat artificial as fetal tachycardia
      is highly associated with maternal fever. The poor performance of clinical signs and lack of
      effective biomarkers to identify neonatal infection results in over treatment of both mothers
      and infants.

      Avoiding antibiotic use in mothers and infants is desirable in order to avoid unnecessary
      separation after birth, decreasing cost and interventions in newborns, and to avoid altering
      the infant's microbiome (the bacteria newborns carry on their skin, mucosal membranes, and in
      their gut at the time of birth). Infants with altered microbiomes may be at risk for skin,
      pulmonary, and gastrointestinal disorders. The investigators in this trial are randomizing
      women with fever during labor who are felt to be a low risk for true infection to antibiotic
      treatment compared to no antibiotics in order to determine if antibiotics can be safely
      avoided for these women and their infants.
