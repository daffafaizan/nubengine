    
      The open label, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      smartphone App in the management of the high-risk population of cardio-cerebrovascular
      diseases. The trial with 2 main objectives: (1) to provide personalized intervention by
      smartphone App to improve the patients' self-management at least 6 months and (2) to
      determine whether the "co-prevention and co-management" model based on Internet + for at
      least 3 years is superior to routine management model at least 3 years on the outcomes of the
      incidence and mortality of atherosclerotic cardio-cerebrovascular events in the high-risk
      population of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases.

      The trial plans to enroll around 8840 patients in four family physician teams. The four teams
      will be randomly assigned at 1:1 to the intervention group or the control group. Patients are
      assigned related group according to their family physician. All patients need to complete the
      questionnaire and clinical examination. Family physicians and patients in the intervention
      group need to use the smartphone App of this study, doctors use App to provide personalized
      health education, risk assessment, follow-up and reminders to patients. At the same time,
      patients could upload self-test data (such as blood pressure, blood glucose, heart rate and
      weight) and medical institution examination data (such as blood lipids, ECG,
      echocardiography, etc.) through App, while receiving routine treatment. Patients in the
      control group just receive routine treatment and routine management.
