      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of homoharringtonine in patients with transformed
      phases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). (Phase I completed as of 2/11/2004.) II.
      Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the response
      duration in patients with chronic phase CML treated with this drug.

      IV. Compare the pharmacokinetics of this drug administered as a continuous infusion vs
      subcutaneously in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, dose-escalation study. (Phase I completed as of 2/11/2004.)

      Remission induction therapy: Patients receive remission induction therapy comprising
      homoharringtonine IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1 and then subcutaneously (SC) twice
      daily on days 2-14 for course 1. Subsequent courses of remission induction therapy comprise
      homoharringtonine SC twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment continues monthly for at least 2
      courses.

      Maintenance therapy: Patients with complete hematologic remission receive maintenance therapy
      comprising homoharringtonine SC twice daily on days 1-7 monthly for 3 years in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of homoharringtonine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional cohort of 25-30 patients with chronic phase
      chronic myelogenous leukemia receives remission induction and maintenance therapy as above at
      the MTD. (Phase I completed as of 2/11/2004.)

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
