    
      The study aim is to evaluate and compare the use of acellular dermal matrix, a material used
      for treating gum recession, in two study populations, namely thin or thick gingival biotype.
      Short term outcomes and the long term stability of ADM in recession repair between thick and
      thin biotypes will be evaluated.

      There will be two study groups, namely thin and thick groups. The included subjects will be
      divided in two groups according to gingival thickness: Thin gingival biotype group (TnB): <
      0.8 mm, thick gingival biotype group (TkB) â‰¥ 0.8 mm. Each subject will be in one of the two
      groups only.

      Randomization will not be used to assign the subjects to the study groups, because the
      intervention will be the same for both groups, namely ADM applied beneath a coronally
      advanced flap.

      The short term (3 months, 6 months post-surgery) outcomes and the longer term (12 months, 24
      months and 48 months post-surgery) outcomes will further be compared within the groups and
      between the groups.
