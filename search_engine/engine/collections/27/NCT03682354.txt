      recovery.Multimodal analgesia have shown good efficacy but without reaching full pain relief.

      The primary goal of this study is to observe the effect of ultrasound-guided erector spinae
      plane block in comparison with intercostal nerve block combined with patient-controlled
      intravenous analgesia in video assisted thoracic lung surgery.
