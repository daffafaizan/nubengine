    
      All patients with colon cancer who are intended for curative surgery without neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy who are >=60 years old will be screened with an ergospirometry. The ones that
      have a ventilate anaerobic threshold (VAT) of less than 11 mg/ml/kg will be included in the
      study as they are considered extra frail and have a previously proven high risk for
      complications. These patients will be randomized to standard care or an intervention of
      prehabilitation consisting of immunonutrition (protein supplement, multivitamin supplement,
      Selene etc) and an exercise regimen with 4x1 hours per week of cycling on an ergometer. The
      exercise regimen will be performed in a group of patients and will be led by a physical
      therapist to ensure compliance. The resistance of the ergometer will be standardized
      according to the patient's VAT.

      The primary outcome measures will be number of and severity of postoperative complications.
      Secondary outcome measures include quality of life during prehabilitation with repeated
      measurements during 5 years after surgery, disease-free survival and overall survival.
