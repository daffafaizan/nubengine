      stenting have looked at small numbers of subjects and did not mandate previous statin therapy
      or high dose loading of clopidogrel before stenting, both of which can also help lower the
      rate of peri-procedural myonecrosis.

      Our aim is to assess the above mentioned therapy in patients on optimal treatment with
      statins, dual antiplatelet agents and standard of care anti-coagulants.
