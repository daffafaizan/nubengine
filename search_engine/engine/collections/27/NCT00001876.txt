    
      Pulmonary fibrosis is an extra-articular manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis whose etiology
      remains uncertain. Although the clinical course of many individuals with this disorder can
      mimic that observed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the natural history of
      fibrotic lung disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis remains largely undefined. It is
      the intent of this clinical protocol to (1) estimate the prevalence of pulmonary fibrosis in
      individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, (2) define the natural history of pulmonary fibrosis
      in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, (3) estimate the survival rate of individuals with
      pulmonary fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, and (4) examine pulmonary physiologic,
      radiologic, and biochemical markers that predict the development or progression of fibrotic
      lung disease.
