      dosage, or augment with a second agent, prior to considering switching agents altogether
      (Rosenbaum et al, 1995). Combination of an SSRI/SNRI with other agents such as tricyclic
      antidepressants (TCAs) or lithium are examples of popular strategies (Fava et al, 1994). In
      many instances, augmentation with multiple psychotropic agents may not be desirable, because
      of risk of side effects or drug-drug interactions.

      In view of their benign adverse effect profiles, non-pharmacological interventions such as
      psychotherapy and mind-body intervention have been used to augment treatment for treatment
      resistant depressed patients. Preliminary studies have shown that meditation is beneficial
      for the treatment of depression (Smith et al., 2007; Sephton et al., 2007; Finucane and
      Mercer, 2006; Astin et al., 2003; Speca et al., 2000).

      Tai Chi training consists of a sequence of slow, soft, and graceful movements derived from
      the martial arts. It is considered as a moving form of yoga and meditation combined. Tai Chi
      has been considered as one form of oriental healing arts, like acupuncture, which fosters the
      circulation of this 'chi' or energy within the body. By doing so, the health and vitality of
      the person are enhanced. Tai Chi, with its slow movement synchronized to the person's
      breathing, has been known to lead to a calm and tranquil mind when the person is focused on
      the precise execution of these exercises.
