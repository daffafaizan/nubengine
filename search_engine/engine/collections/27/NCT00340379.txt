    
      Psychotic depression is a well-established DSM-IV diagnostic subtype indicating the presence
      of hallucinations and/or delusions as part of the clinical presentation. Currently the
      treatment of choice for psychotic depression is either electroconvulsive therapy or
      combination of antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. Ziprasidone will be compared to
      standard of care treatment comprising a combination of an antidepressant, sertraline and an
      antipsychotic, haloperidol, over a 12-week period. An additional 12-week extension phase is
      also included for responders to the initial study.
