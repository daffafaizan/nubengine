    
      The chronic retinal stimulation system is an implantable electronic device designed to
      provide electrical stimulation of the retina in order to elicit visual percepts in blind
      subjects.

      This chronic feasibility study will evaluate the ability of subjects to resolve multiple
      percepts and patterns under various stimulus conditions and optimize the effectiveness of
      electrical stimulus parameters with an initial chronic design.
