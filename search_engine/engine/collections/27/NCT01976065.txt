    
      This is a multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a regenerative
      endodontic procedure using tissue engineering principles (REGENDO), or a revascularization
      (REVASC) endodontic procedure, when compared to the standard apexification treatment using
      mineral trioxide aggregate barrier-MTA apexification (APEX), produces a significantly better
      composite clinical outcome for the treatment of immature permanent teeth with pulpal
      necrosis. This study will use an antibiotic mixture called Triple Antibiotic Paste (TAP),
      consisting of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and minocycline, in the tooth for disinfection of
      the root canal in study arms REGENDO and REVASC. The FDA has issued an Investigational New
      Drug (IND) number allowing use of the triple antibiotic mixture in this trial. Other dental
      materials used in this study have already been FDA approved for use in humans to provide a
      matrix for the promotion of tissue growth in the root canal space. The study will also
      attempt to identify the type of bacteria within the root canal space and surrounding tissues
      by analyzing a small sample collected on a cotton-tip applicator. This clinical trial hopes
      to determine which of the three treatment methods helps the tooth to grow stronger and
      survive for at least two years after treatment.
