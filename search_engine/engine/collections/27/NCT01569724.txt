      gastrointestinal lymphomas. Bexarotene is licensed for the treatment of epidermotropic
      cutaneous T cell lymphoma .The most common side effect of bexarotene is hypertriglyceridemia
      (82%) associated with hypercholesterolemia (30 to 40%). Central hypothyroidism is also
      present in 40-80% of cases. These adverse effects are dose-dependent. The management of
      hyperlipidemia induced by bexarotene is difficult. The mechanism of lipid disorder induced by
      bexarotene is not well known. Associated carbohydrate metabolism disorder could be present
      and play a role in the bexarotene-induced hyperlipidemia.

      The main objective is to estimate the frequency of a carbohydrate disorder in patients with
      hypertriglyceridemia (TG> 1.5 g / L) induced by bexarotene treatment of cutaneous T cell
      lymphoma, previously free of diabetes, thyroid dysfunction and dyslipidemia.
