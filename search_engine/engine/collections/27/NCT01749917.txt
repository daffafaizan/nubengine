      previous studies with limitation in the performance of activities of daily living and,
      consequently, with a decrease in quality of life. The possibility that a brief intervention
      improves eye-hand dexterity in Parkinson's, may be a therapeutic option to improve the
      performance of activities of daily living. The investigators also conducted an intervention
      based in proprioceptive exercises and balance tasks to improve functionality.
