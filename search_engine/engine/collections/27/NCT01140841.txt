      treatment with dopaminergic agents like levodopa, the mainstay of treatment, is effective in
      the early phases of the disease, their benefits decrease with disease progression, and
      problems such as dyskinesia and on-off phenomenon begin to manifest. In this study,
      fipamezole, a new antagonist of an adrenergic receptor, is being investigated to better
      understand the safety and side-effect profile in patients with Parkinson's Disease.

      The sampling method used was simple random sampling.
