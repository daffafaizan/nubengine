      much of daily living activities are conducted only by the other hand, leaving the person
      effective one-handed. Nonetheless, reduced hand use can be improved for extended amounts of
      time with specific forms of physical therapy, as long as persons with MS have the ability to
      perform the training tasks.

      This study will randomize persons with MS who have relatively reduced use of one of the hands
      to either CI therapy or CAM treatments. Treatment in either program will be for 2 consecutive
      weeks, 3.5 hours per day (Monday-Friday), under the direct supervision of a specially trained
      therapist. Before starting, participants will also undergo comprehensive medical and physical
      exam screening and brain MRI scan. The same evaluations will be performed after treatment to
      learn whether any of these have changed as a result of treatment.
