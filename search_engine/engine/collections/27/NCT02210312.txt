      depressive symptoms in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

      A total of 300 consecutive patients and 80 healthy controls will be enrolled in this study.
      Patients will be followed up at 7 days, 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. The co gnitive
      function will be tested and compared to tests done before surgery. Postoperatively - from the
      day of operation until the 7th day (except day 6) - grade of sedation, agitation, signs of
      delirium, pain, cardiac, respiratory, renal and infectious complications will be monitored.

      Next to preoperative depressive symptoms we will also evaluate a diagnosed depression,
      anxiety, pain, health-related quality of life, physical comorbidities, adrenal cortical
      insufficiency, type of anaesthesia, intraoperative blood loss, organ complications,
      postoperative delirium, baseline cognitive functioning and the number of
      operations/anaesthetics in the study period after the initial operation as further potential
      predictors of POCD.

      In addition, laboratory values and certain medications will be documented. These include:
      anaemia, hypercalcaemia, thyroidal gland hormones, electrolytes, creatinine, urea, glomerular
      filtration rate and cortisone therapy.
