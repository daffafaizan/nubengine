      adult cancer survivors by increasing their adherence to recommended sun protection.

      This study will assess two versions of the SunSmart video intervention. These are: 1) The
      INFORMATION VIDEO providing basic information about UV risks, including secondary skin cancer
      and the benefits of sun protection (SP), as well as specific SP recommendations and steps to
      integrate SP as part of routine self-care for the healthy cancer survivor; and 2) THE
      INFORMATION + APPEARANCE VIDEO which will include the full information video, along with an
      additional embedded video segment emphasizing negative appearance consequences of UV
      exposure. Primary aim of the study is to assess the impact of the video intervention on sun
      protection intentions and behavior in young adult cancer survivors compared to a control
      intervention. Secondary aims are to describe the impact of the appearance information when
      included in the SunSmart intervention, to investigate the extent to which the intervention
      changes sun protection through hypothesized mediating variables, and to describe the
      consistency of sleep behaviors over time in cancer survivors.
