    
      The specific aim of this study is to perform a randomized controlled study to compare the
      effects of cyclosporine v. placebo on changes in myocardial functioning associated with open
      heart surgery for isolated valvular or coronary artery bypass procedures.

      The research question is:

      Compared to placebo, does administration of cyclosporine just before surgery improve
      myocardial functioning in terms of:

        -  Transthoracic ECHO (TTE) assessment of ejection fraction

        -  Cardiac index (CI), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2), systemic vascular resistance
           (SVR)

        -  Length of stay

        -  30-d mortality

        -  Angina Scale

        -  SF-36 measure of quality of life

        -  Measures associated with myocardial function:

             1. Cardiac Index

             2. Blood glucose level

             3. Serum Troponin I level

             4. Free Fatty Acid levels

             5. Serum CPK-MB levels

             6. Serum phosphoratase levels
