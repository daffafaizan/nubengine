    
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with cancer principally in
      association with central vein catheters (CVC). The clinical benefit of antithrombotic
      prophylaxis for CVC-related VTE in cancer patients remains unclear.The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the administration of Bemiparin in cancer patients
      with a central venous catheter (CVC). This study is designed as a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study. On the day of CVC insertion, eligible patients are
      randomly assigned to receive subcutaneously either bemiparin (3,500 UI/day) or placebo by
      using preloaded syringes for 45 days.

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the combined incidence during the double blind
      treatment period of Clinical or symptomatic CVC-DVT verified objectively (Doppler
      ultrasonography or phlebography)and subclinical or asymptomatic CVC-DVT confirmed by elective
      bilateral Doppler ultrasonography performed 45Â±5 days after randomization.
