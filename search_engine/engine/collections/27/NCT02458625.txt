      fatigue, cognitive impairment and syncope in severe cases. International guidelines recommend
      to use intravenous iron sucrose to treat intermediate and severe anemia until the target
      hemoglobin is achieved. However, patient's compliance after delivery is low, making the
      administration of several doses difficult. In those cases oral iron supplements might be
      used. In the present study the investigators will compare the efficacy of two iron
      administration protocols to treat post partum anemia - a single dose of intravenous iron
      sucrose versus a single dose of iron sucrose and 6 weeks of treatment with oral iron
      supplement.
