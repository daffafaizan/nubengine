      failed to respond to these conservative treatments. The patients with systemic problems which
      affect bone and joints,psychological problems ,history of maxillofacial fractures and
      orthognathic surgery were excluded from the study. A total of 60 patients with TMJ internal
      derangement with failed conservative management, were subjected to TMJ arthrocentesis. All
      arthrocentesis were performed by the same maxillofacial surgeon. Subjects were randomly
      allocated into two groups (30 cases in each group). Subjects in the group 1 received
      irrigation with Ringer solution and in the group 2 ,subjects underwent irrigation with Ringer
      solution with corticosteroid (Dexamethasone ) .Two examiners evaluated Temporomandibular
      disorder's signs ( mouth opening,click , crepitus and pain) before, one month and 6 months
      after arthrocentesis.
