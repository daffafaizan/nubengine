      a high prevalence of moderate to severe sleep apnea is expected. Studies based on
      interstitial glycemic measurement demonstrate a reduction in glucose levels when treating
      sleep apnea with CPAP. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of CPAP in improving glycemic control
      has been questioned as most studies have failed to demonstrate a reduction in hemoglobin A1c
      (HbA1C) level over time. Most of these studies have limitations such as a short follow-up or
      a suboptimal fulfillment of CPAP treatment. We hypothesize that treating moderate to severe
      sleep apnea with CPAP will improve glycemic control (measured by HbA1C) at 14 weeks in good
      compliers and that this improvement will be sustained at one year. We aim to test this
      hypothesis in consecutive type 2 diabetes patients on stable treatment with HbA1c ≥7% in
      routine outpatient visits in our Diabetes, Nutrition and Endocrinology Unit. After providing
      informed consent, patients will be screened for sleep apnea by nocturnal oximetry followed by
      a diagnostic respiratory polygraphy. Those patients with obstructive sleep apnea with an
      apnea-hypopnea index ≥20 will be invited to enter the study. After a 3-month observation
      period without any intervention to rule out a potential influence of entering the study on
      HbA1C levels, patients will be treated with CPAP. HbA1C levels will be measured at baseline,
      after 14 weeks, and thereafter every 14 weeks until completing one year of treatment. Other
      endocrine, metabolic and cardiovascular risk variables will be determined at baseline and at
      14 weeks of the intervention.
