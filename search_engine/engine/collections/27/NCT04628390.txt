    
      This is a parallel, double-blind, controlled, single-center clinical trial conducted in
      systemically healthy subjects requiring orthodontic treatment without extractions at the
      start of treatment in Bogot√°, Colombia.

      Sixty patients (60) will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio, to either of the two arms of this
      trial.

      This study will consist of a single visit by the patient, in this visit the assembly and
      activation of the upper and lower orthodontic appliances will be carried out.

      Measurements of the primary outcome variable will be done remotely through a virtual pain
      monitoring questionnaire through a visual analog scale (Baseline, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48
      hours, 72 hours).

      After Screening a computer-generated scrambling code will be used for allocation in blocks of
      6 to the two treatments.

      The identity of included patients will not be provided to the trial team, in order to
      preserve the blinded aspect of the trial. The identity of the research treatment associated
      with each randomization number will be hidden from the trial team and patients. The final
      analysis is scheduled for when 100% of the patients (60 subjects) reach the 72-hour
      evaluation.
