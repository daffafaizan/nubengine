      a tissue sample. Women in the study will already be scheduled for colposcopy to detect or
      treat cervical lesions. (A colposcopy is an exam of the vagina and cervix using a magnifying
      lens.)

      Microscopic images will be taken during the routine colposcopy in the outpatient clinic. A
      disinfected probe will be inserted into the vagina and placed against the cervix. . The probe
      sends out laser light and detects reflected light from the tissue. Images of cervical tissue
      will be formed and displayed on a computer monitor. 1-3 regions of the cervix will be imaged
      (2 abnormal and one normal), and each will take about 1-2 minutes.

      Each imaged site will be biopsied. The biopsies will be analyzed by the research pathologist.
      The results will be available to participants in the event that care needs to be given. Total
      participation in this study will be only a few minutes.

      This is an investigational study. About 72 women will take part in this study. About 18 will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
