      deposition of hemosiderin after the damage of microvascular. Aspirin is the most widely used
      anti-thrombotic drug in the secondary prevention of patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic
      stroke. Studies have shown that conventional doses of aspirin can increase the incidence of
      intracranial hemorrhage in ischemic stroke patients with cerebral microbleeds. For such
      patients, how to carry out effective and safe anti-thrombotic therapy is still unclear.

      The AIM study aims to provide reliable data on the effects of low-dose Aspirin (50mg target
      recruitment 200) in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke and cerebral microbleeds
      compared to conventional dose (100mg target recruitment 200). Patients presenting with acute
      (<3 weeks) non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke and microbleeds (â‰§1 microbleeds in SWI scans)
      will be randomly assigned to the secondary stroke prevention therapy of low-dose or
      conventional dose aspirin for 6 months.
