      bleeding in cardiac surgical patients compared with conventional blood coagulation test.
      However, the role of rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in predicting perioperative
      bleeding and transfusion requirements in pediatric patients who undergoing surgery for
      congenital heart disease. Therefore, the investigators attempt to evaluate the predictability
      of intraoperative rotational thromboelastometry for perioperative bleeding and transfusion
      requirements in pediatric cardiac surgical patients by comparing with conventional
      coagulation test. The investigators also attempt to evaluate the correlation between ROTEM
      parameters, platelet count, and results of conventional coagulation test results.
