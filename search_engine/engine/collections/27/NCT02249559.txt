      subthalamotomy due to the presence of unilateral rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia and/or
      dyskinesias (as opposed to axial symptoms such as walking) but who are suboptimal candidates
      for deep brain stimulation (DBS) because of advanced age (>74), medical comorbidities
      precluding surgery, or patient aversion to DBS, and who show more than 30% improvement in
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score in the ON versus OFF medication state.

      Secondary objectives will focus on the efficacy of Gamma Knife (GK) subthalamotomy for
      Parkinson's disease (PD), as determined by changes in the patient's clinical status and any
      improvement following the treatment. A full neurologic exam as well as a screen for
      depression will be administered at every postoperative visit. The patient's neurologic
      function will be assessed with a full neurological examination and objectively quantified
      using the UPDRS focusing on the contralateral side, as well as overall UPDRS.

      The clinician will complete a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and Mini-Mental State
      Examination (MMSE) at each visit to record overall impression of the patient's disease
      progression and severity, and to evaluate cognitive function. Pre- and post-treatment
      assessment of the Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD) (quantification of medication regimen
      in levodopa equivalents) will be obtained and recorded to evaluated the efficacy of gamma
      knife subthalamotomy (GKS) as a treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). A Parkinson's Disease
      Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) to determine the patient's independence and quality of life will be
      filled out at each visit. Finally, the patient will complete a Beck Depression Inventory at
      each clinic visit to monitor for development or progression of depressive symptoms.
