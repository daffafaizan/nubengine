      wound infection. In this study the dosage of cefuroxime was adjusted to the BMI:

      less than 30kg/m*m: 1,5g 31-50kg/m*m: 3,0g more than 50kg/m*m: 4,5g

      Cefuroxime was applicated 30 to 60 minutes before the begin of surgery. Drug Levels in blood
      and fat tissue were measured at skin cut (30-60 minutes after application of Cefuroxime), 45
      minutes after skin cut (75-105 minutes after minutes after application of Cefuroxime) and at
      the end of surgery (up to 150 minutes after application of Cefuroxime) .

      The hypothesis of this study is that adequate drug levels are reached in all groups.
