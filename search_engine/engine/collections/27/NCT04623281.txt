    
      Pilot-scale, single-arm,observational study to assess the utility and acceptability of a
      wearable hydration monitor in haemodialysis patients compared with bioimpedance and
      haemodialysis machine data.

      The Sixty device uses diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to measure fluid status.

      20 patients will be assessed during the study observation period.

      10 patients undergo an observation period of approximately three weeks. The patients will be
      asked to wear the Sixty device during dialysis and at night throughout the study observation
      period.

      Following the completion of this 3 week observation period, an additional 10 patients will
      wear the Sixty device as per the protocol for 3 weeks.

      Haemodialysis parameters will be assessed as usual during the study.

      Bioimpedance measurements will be taken pre and post-dialysis once weekly during the mid-week
      dialysis session:

      Patient-reported symptoms related to haemodialysis will be recorded, including symptoms of
      hypervolaemia and hypovolaemia.
