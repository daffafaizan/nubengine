      predicted to be the third leading cause of death by 2020. COPD is a common, preventable
      treatable disease that is characterized by an airflow limitation which is not fully
      reversable.Not only the long-term exposition to noxious particles and gases contributes to
      the development of COPD, but also so many others factors such as genetics and cigarette
      smoking. It has been shown that cigarettes are harmful and contributed to different extra
      pulmonary disorders. Indeed, it induced a systemic inflammation that was considered as a key
      process in the pathogenesis of COPD and triggered the activation of inflammatory cells and an
      abnormal increase of circulating cytokines such as CRP, interleukin (IL6), IL8, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and leptin.
