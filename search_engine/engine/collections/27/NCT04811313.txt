      in certain subspecialties. AFs have been studied extensively in adults undergoing various
      orthopedic procedures including spine and total joint arthroplasty, and have been proven to
      reduce blood loss and reduce the risk of blood transfusion. Similarly, AFs are used in
      pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery as well as craniofacial operations. Tranexamic
      acid (TXA) is a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent that works by reversibly blocking
      plasminogen and thereby promoting hemostasis through the prevention of fibrin degradation.
      Current literature investigating the safety and effectiveness of TXA in children undergoing
      orthopedic procedures is limited.

      We hypothesize that patients treated with TXA will have reduced blood loss and transfusion
      requirements compared with those who did not receive TXA.
