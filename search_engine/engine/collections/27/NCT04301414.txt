    
      This is a single-center, randomized, two-arm, study evaluating the safety, feasibility and
      immunogenicity of neoadjuvant degarelix(Arm A) or BMS-986218 plus degarelix (Arm B) prior to
      radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer (neo-RED-P). Our
      primary objective is to characterize safety, tolerability, and feasibility of degarelix with
      or without BMS-986218 in the neoadjuvant setting. The trial will monitor toxicity and safety,
      as well as surgery related adverse events. The secondary objectives will be to evaluate an
      immune response consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of BMS-986218, depletion of
      Tregs, and to assess the pathologic complete response rate, PSA response rate and time-to-PSA
      recurrence following treatment.
