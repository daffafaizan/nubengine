      obesity-related complications including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers etc. Health
      care providers believe that obesity has a negative effect on patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery, with overweight and obese patients being more likely to experience adverse
      post-operative outcomes. The body mass index (BMI) is the single most used measure for
      determining obesity classification in clinical practice, without accounting for a patient's
      level of cardiopulmonary fitness or muscle mass.

      Study Design: Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years undergoing elective cardiac
      surgery will be consented to participate in this prospective observational trial. Patients
      are invited to participate in measures of obesity, functional capacity and exercise capacity
      assessments, quality of life questionnaires, and blood and tissue sampling for biomarker
      analysis.

      Endpoints: Measures other than BMI that could be predictive of short-term and long-term
      post-operative outcomes. Outcomes of interest include: prolonged length of ventilation,
      hospital length of stay and all-cause mortality.

      Summary: The results of this trial will potentially identify an improved definition of
      fitness capacity for obese cardiac surgical patients and biomarkers alone or in combination
      that could identify the potential for adverse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery. This study will help clinicians better segregate and treat patients pre-operatively
      based on fitness levels and associated biomarkers.
