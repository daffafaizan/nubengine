      I. To determine the optimal dose of anti-viral veto cells, defined as the dose which achieves
      engraftment without severe graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) at 42 days after non-myeloablative
      megadose T cell depleted haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity. II. Response rate. III. Time to progression. IV. Infections. V. Immune
      reconstitution. VI. Overall survival up to 1 year.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cytokine-treated veto cells.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) intravenously (IV) over
      4 hours on days -9 to -7 and fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3, then undergo total
      body irradiation (TBI) on day -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours on days +3 and +4 and
      cytokine-treated veto cells IV over 30-60 minutes on day +7.

      After completion of stem cell transplant, patients are followed up once a week for 4 weeks,
      once a month for 3 months, and then periodically for one year.
