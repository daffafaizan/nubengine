      study with an open-label extension period of up to 156 weeks, for a total duration of up to
      270 weeks in patients with IgAN who have persistent overt proteinuria and remain at high risk
      of disease progression despite being on a stable dose (or doses) of an angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) that is (are) a maximum
      tolerated dose that is at least one half of the maximum labeled dose (MLD) (according to
      approved labeling. Approximately 380 patients aged â‰¥18 years will be enrolled in the study
      globally. The investigational drug (sparsentan) is a dual acting angiotensin receptor blocker
      and endothelin receptor antagonist. The active control is irbesartan.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the potential benefit of sparsentan on kidney
      function by analyzing change in proteinuria (protein in urine) and estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) as compared to current standard treatment.

      Patients enrolled in the PROTECT study (Protocol 021IGAN17001) will be those at high risk of
      progressing to renal failure. They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either
      sparsentan or irbesartan, as the active control (current standard treatment) at the Day 1
      (Randomization) visit. Study medication (sparsentan and irbesartan) will be administered as a
      single oral morning dose.

      The primary analysis is change in proteinuria (urine protein/creatinine ratio) from baseline
      at Week 36 in sparsentan-treated patients as compared to irbesartan-treated patients.
