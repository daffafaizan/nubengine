      concern. This devastating event is largely preventable with anticoagulant therapy. Therefore,
      the early detection and accurate diagnosis of arrhythmia are crucial for prevention of
      adverse outcome. However, because atrial fibrillation is often intermittent and mostly
      asymptomatic, it is difficult to capture an excise event.

      Conventional electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring devices including multi-lead portable ECG
      monitoring device, event-detection monitoring device, and implantable ECG monitoring device
      are useful for early detection of atrial fibrillation, but these devices have various
      drawbacks such as requirement of multiple out-patient visits and need of invasive
      implantation of devices.

      A new wearable patch-type device, ATP-C120 (ATsens, Seongnam, Korea) is a novel, single-lead
      ECG monitoring device and can continuously monitor the ECG signal for upto 11 days. It has
      recently demonstrated its diagnostic capability and safety compared to the conventional ECG
      monitoring systems . Yet, it has not widely used in real-world. So, this study is designed to
      experiment its diagnostic capability of new-onset atrial fibrillation in high risk patients.
      Several studies reported that validated CHA2DS2-VASc score has high performance in predicting
      new-onset atrial fibrillation and there are over 10 percent of new-onset atrial fibrillation
      in patients whose calculated CHA2DS2-VASc scores are â‰¥ 2. Thus, through this study, the
      investigators sought to evaluate the validation of early detection of new-onset atrial
      fibrillation by ATP-C120.
