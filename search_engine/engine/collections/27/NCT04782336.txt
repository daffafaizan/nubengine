    
      INFORM is a sample collection study targeting a population of patients attending their
      designated care or testing facility, suspected of having a respiratory illness typical of
      Influenza, RSV or COVID-19 and undergoing a Standard of Care (SOC) test on the day. Or those
      who have been in recent contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Participants may be of any
      age, there is no upper or lower age limit.

      An additional Group (B), has been incorporated into the study, enabling collection from the
      asymptomatic population, in order to acquire negative samples (when required), to further aid
      the development and on-going calibration of the LumiraDx assays. This group will be
      considered for new site's, who do not routinely provide SOC Testing. Inclusions 1 & 2 will
      therefore not be applicable to this group. Paediatric participants will not be recruited into
      Group B.

      Depending on the facility's viability and agreed contracting, the following study samples
      will be collected per patient:

      Adult Population: Two (2) Nasal, AND/OR Two (2) Throat Swabs AND/OR, One (1) Saliva Sample

      Paediatric Population: Two (2) Nasal, OR Two (2) Throat Swabs AND/OR, One (1) Saliva Sample

      Once required samples and data have been collected, participation is complete. No follow-up
      or subsequent patient involvement is required.
