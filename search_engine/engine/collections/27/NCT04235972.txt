    
      The surgery performed in the Orthopaedics and Traumatology department of the University
      Hospital of Rennes, has 2 notable points: its technique and its equipment.

        -  The procedure is based on the staples 4Fusion1 (Stryker/Memometal), which is still
           poorly assessed in the literature.

        -  The surgical procedure has several technical specificities: intra osseous cartilage
           freshening and preservation of the lunotriquetral ligament if intact.
