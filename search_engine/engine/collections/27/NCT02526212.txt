      groups with BMT patients and providers, and will use this data to develop a manualized
      group-based BMT intervention (G-BMT). Investigators will then conduct a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) of the G-BMT intervention within primary care to preliminarily test its efficacy,
      acceptability, and feasibility. Participants who have persistent opioid abuse while receiving
      BMT in primary care will be randomized to the G-BMT intervention (40 participants in 5
      groups) or to intensify BMT (treatment as usual) with their individual primary care physician
      (40 participants).

      Hypothesis: In a 16-week RCT of G-BMT, participants who receive the G-BMT intervention (vs.
      treatment as usual) will have higher abstinence rates (primary outcome, efficacy), fewer HIV
      risk behaviors (efficacy), and greater satisfaction with treatment (acceptability) and
      adherence to medical visits (feasibility).
