    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To expand upon the list of molecular correlates indicated in clinical trial ECOG-E3303,
           including EGFR expression, EGFR phosphorylation, map kinase, AKT, and STAT3.

        -  To correlate the status or expression level of each biomarker with clinical outcome
           (response, progression-free survival, overall survival).

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor and blood specimens are analyzed for human papilloma virus and p16
      status; EGFR gene amplification; levels of ERCC1, XPF, and c-Met proteins; expression and
      activation of several signaling pathways including PI3 kinase gene and mTOR; levels of ErbB2,
      ErbB3, P70S6 kinase, S6 , and Akt; expression of amphiregulin (AR), TGF-alpha (TGF-Î±),
      heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), EGF, epiregulin and c-Met ligand, and
      hepatocyte growth factor by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), automated in situ
      quantitative measurements of protein analysis (AQUA), IHC, PCR, and ELISA.
