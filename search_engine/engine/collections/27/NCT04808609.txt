      it is estimated that between 40-70% smoke cigarettes, at least three times the prevalence
      (14%) observed in the general U.S. adult population. Consequently, PLWH experience
      substantial tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. In PLWH, after achieving and maintaining
      a suppressed viral load, smoking cessation is the next most important health behavior to
      maximize both quality of life and life expectancy. Given the high prevalence of cigarette
      smoking among PLWH and the benefit of smoking cessation, there is an urgent need for swift
      action to intervene to reduce tobacco use rates. However, evidence to improve tobacco
      cessation among PLWH is inadequate. Given the need for improving smoking cessation in PLWH,
      and the great promise of mHealth tools, this research study will assess smoking behaviors in
      people living with HIV and the subsequent efficacy of mHealth intervention for improving
      tobacco cessation.
