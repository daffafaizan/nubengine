      supportive care (BSC) and includes pain-relieving medicines called analgesics. This type of
      treatment can help in some cases; however, some analgesics require a healthy liver to work
      properly. This means that there are many patients who have a hard time managing their liver
      cancer pain/discomfort with BSC alone.

      Sometimes radiation therapy is given in the "palliative" setting meaning it is designed to
      treat the pain/discomfort and not necessarily to shrink or eliminate the tumour. Palliative
      radiation therapy is often given when patients have painful bone tumours, but is not yet
      widely used to treat liver pain/discomfort. Palliative radiation therapy is usually given in
      smaller amounts and less frequently than other kinds of radiation therapy.
