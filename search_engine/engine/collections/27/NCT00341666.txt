      concurrently with malarial parasites. In Mali, lymphatic filariasis co-exists in several
      regions highly endemic for malaria. Because of the chronicity of filarial infections and an
      associated bias towards the development of an adaptive immune response dominated by Th2
      cytokines, a pre-existing filarial infection has the potential to alter the immune response
      towards incoming malarial parasites, clearance of which are considered to be dependent on a
      robust Th1 response. Conversely, immune responses to filarial parasites may be modulated in
      the presence of malarial parasites. The goal of this study is to determine the effect of
      concurrent infections with malarial and filarial parasites on innate and adaptive immune
      responses to homologous and heterologous antigens. We will characterize the responses of
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells to antigens derived from both filarial (Wuchereria
      bancrofti) and malarial (Plasmodium falciparum) parasites in groups of individuals with or
      without filarial infections and follow them through a malaria transmission season, when they
      are repeatedly exposed to malarial parasites, to determine how co-infection with the filarial
      parasite affects the cellular and humoral responses to malarial and filarial antigens. These
      studies may provide the basis for modifying treatment strategies of mass treatment of malaria
      in regions co-endemic for lymphatic filariasis.
