      patients worldwide. Approximately 80% of NSCLC were inoperable. Concurrent chemo-radiation
      therapy (CCRT) is a standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC who are not candidates for
      surgery. Nevertheless, the prognosis of patients with locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC) is
      still poor. Local control (LC) after CCRT is one of the most important prognostic factors.
      Local failure is common after standard-dose chemoradiation for NSCLC. Studies of stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) have shown a steep dose response in treating early-stage lung
      cancer. Improving the total dose and shortening the overall treatment time may be effective
      for improving the LC rates. However, problems remain due to the toxicity to adjacent critical
      structures (e.g,lung,heart, esophagus), the target volumes usually limits the doses escalated
      that cannot be safely delivered by conventional radiotherapy techniques. In order to avoid
      the acute and late radiation toxicity of normal tissues, different dose prescriptions can be
      delivered to different target volumes in the same fraction, which deliver a higher dose to
      the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) and a relatively lower dose to the subclinical disease. The
      technique is called simultaneous integrated boost intensity modulated radiotherapy
      (SIB-IMRT).

      Investigators hypothesized that use of SIB-IMRT technology can safety increasing the
      radiation dose and benefit for inoperable NSCLC patients.
