      prevention or cure. Thus, the burden of dementia on caregivers is also increasing. Hispanics
      have a higher prevalence of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), have higher caregiving
      burden, and may have less economic resources to cope with the caregiving burden. However,
      there is a paucity of evidence on the effectiveness of caregiver interventions in Hispanics.
      We propose to compare 2 interventions with evidence of efficacy, the New York University
      Caregiver intervention (NYUCI) and the translated Resources for Enhancing Caregivers Health
      (REACH OUT). The NYUCI is a family centered counseling intervention that focuses on reducing
      negative family interactions and improving family support of the primary caregiver. REACH OUT
      focuses on caregiver skills training through action-oriented formal problem solving, goal
      setting, and written action plans. The effectiveness of the NYUCI and the REACH OUT has never
      been compared. Thus, there is no way for caregivers to decide which intervention to choose.
      In addition, there is a paucity of data on the effectiveness of both interventions in
      Hispanics.
