      AU/mL, 600 AU/mL and 2000 AU/mL at 15-minute interval was performed, respectively. The
      immediate responses to NAPT-DP were assessed using symptoms score, peak nasal inspiratory
      flow (PNIF) and acoustic rhinometry (ARM). The nasal tryptase and sIgE-DP were measured at
      baseline, 15 min and 1 h after positive NAPT-DP. Allergic rhinitis (AR) patients were used as
      positive control.
