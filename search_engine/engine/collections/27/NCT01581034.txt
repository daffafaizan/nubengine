      This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial investigates the effect of a 6 week
      intake of PADMA 28 on the endothelial function, biomarkers and the autonomic nervous systems
      in patients with coronary artery disease. PADMA 28 contains 20 herbs from Tibet. The
      endothelial function will be measured by EndoPAT 2000, the autonomic nervous system by an
      ambulatory electrocardiography during the orthostatic reaction and the biomarkers will be
      analyzed with taking a blood sample. The investigators hypothesize that PADMA 28 has a
      beneficial effect on endothelial function, arterial stiffness, the autonomic nervous systen
      and the blood inflammatory markers in patients with coronary artery disease compared to
      placebo treatment.

      Objective

      To assess the effect of PADMA 28 on endothelial function, autonomic nervous system and
      biomarkers in patients with coronary artery disease.

      Methods

      80 patients with coronary artery disease will be recruited for the study. To measure
      endothelial function, the investigators use EndoPAT 2000. The autonomic nervous system will
      be analysed with ambulatory electrocardiography.
