    
      NSCLC patients with metastatic disease who have failed at least one prior treatment and have
      a minimum of two metastatic lesions (at least one measurable), are eligible if they have an
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1.

      Non-ablative radiotherapy (6GyX5) is directed to one lesion during a first immunotherapy
      treatment with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (± 24hrs from first RT dose). On day 22 the combined
      treatment of ipilimumab plus nivolumab will start (nivolumab 240mg q 2 weeks, ipilimumab
      1mg/kg q 6 weeks), and administered until evidence of progression.

      Patients are re-imaged at Week 9 (day 70 ± 7) to evaluate for response (defined as an
      objective response by RECIST of the measurable metastatic sites outside the radiation field).
      This response will be evaluated assessing clinical and positron emission computed tomography
      (PET/CT) responses in the non-irradiated measurable metastatic sites using RECIST 1.1.
