      stavudine/zidovudine and lamivudine with nevirapine. Approximately 20-30% of the patients on
      this regimen experience drug toxicity within the first six months of treatment.

      The tenofovir based regimen is one of the least toxic regimens with less than 5% of patients
      experiencing toxicity. Tenofovir based regimen is not considered as the first choice for ART
      in the Indian governmental program, because it is more expensive than the other drug
      regimens, in spite of better clinical outcomes in resource limited settings. The cost of
      treatment with stavudine/zidovudine is presumed to be less expensive and is the preferred
      first line treatment, but we believe that although the direct cost to the government is less,
      patients on zidovudine/stavudine regimen have to spend more money for additional hospital
      visits and admissions, laboratory investigations and other medications due to ART induced
      toxicity.

      There are no published data including economic, clinical and quality of life outcomes to
      compare the two regimens from India. Hence, this unblinded randomized pragmatic comparative
      effectiveness study will seek to identify the best treatment for HIV patients based on the
      incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes.

      The clinical outcomes include viral suppression, change in the CD4 and proportion of patients
      with toxicity and opportunistic infections. Direct costs for the treatment will be
      calculated. The QOL scores will be estimated and compared between the regimens using
      questionnaires. QOL scores and direct cost will be used as utilities for calculating ICER.
