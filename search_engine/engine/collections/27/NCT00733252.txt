        -  Correlate optical coherence tomography images of the airway with airway histology.

        -  Develop an imaging technique to detect premalignant airway epithelial changes (carcinoma
           in situ, dysplasia) to study the transformation process as well as intervene and prevent
           the development of lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: Bronchoscopic imaging and optical coherence tomography are performed on lung tissue
      samples collected during surgery. All imaged areas are marked. The marked areas are then
      excised and fixed in formalin for histopathologic analysis.
