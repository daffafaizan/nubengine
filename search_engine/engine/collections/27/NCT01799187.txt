      with periapical periodontitis in certain criterion. The investigators will divide the
      patients into two groups randomly. One group will get treated with revascularization while
      the other with apexification. The investigators want to evaluate the short-term and long-term
      effects of the two groups to get a conclusion of the clinical value of revascularization.
