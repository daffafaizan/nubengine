      tool that accurately identifies the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) in pneumonia
      patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) treated with high-flow nasal cannula
      (HFNC).

      Materials and methods This is a 4-year prospective observational 2-center cohort study
      including patients with severe pneumonia treated with HFNC. High-flow nasal cannula failure
      was defined as need for MV. ROX index was defined as the ratio of pulse oximetry/fraction of
      inspired oxygen to respiratory rate.
