      allocated into two groups: A (n= 8 volunteers) and B (n=8 volunteers). The study will include
      a total of four arms.

      By administration of test meals #1 (iron in alginate beads) and #4 (iron in a capsule) the
      possible protective effect of alginate on iron absorption will be investigated. By
      administration of test meal #2 (iron in alginate beads + calcium capsule)and #3 (iron in a
      capsule + calcium in a capsule)the study will investigate whether alginates can bind calcium
      (a well-known iron inhibitor) in vivo, thus diminish the potential negative effect of calcium
      on iron absorption.

      Only half (8) of the volunteers will undergo treatments including calcium. Therefore group A
      will undergo all 4 tests, whereas group B will undergo 2 out of 4 tests.

      The four test meals will be administered a week apart following an overnight fast. On each
      occasion blood sampling will take place over a period of 6h with samples taken via a cannula
      at t=0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min. Serum samples will be
      analysed for iron content allowing calculation of iron absorption.

      The assumptions made for the power calculation to estimate the number of volunteers are that
      a difference of 2.5% in iron absorption in the presence and absence of alginate ( test meal
      #1 and test meal #4) will be nutritionally significant. A minimum of 12 volunteers would be
      required to complete the study to detect a difference of 2.5% at a significance level of 0.05
      for 80% power. A minimum of 8 volunteers would be required to detect a significant difference
      in iron absorption of 3.3% between a test meal containing 20mg of iron as iron gluconate with
      calcium and a test meal containing 20mg of iron as iron gluconate with calcium and alginate
      beads (test meals #2 and #3). This assumes a power of 80%, a level of significance of 0.05
      and standard deviation of differences (within pairs) of 2.8%
