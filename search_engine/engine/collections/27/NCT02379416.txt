    
      Background:

      -The BCR-Abl kinase inhibitor nilotinib demonstrated greater than additive activity in
      combination with the anti-tubulin agent paclitaxel in preclinical xenograft models,
      justifying the clinical evaluation of this combination for its antitumor activity

      Objectives:

        -  To establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nilotinib
           plus paclitaxel in patients with refractory solid tumors, both in adult subjects >=18
           years of age and in pediatric/adolescent subjects 12-17 years of age

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel when administered in combination with
           nilotinib

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of the combination on biomarkers of apoptosis,
           DNA damage response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition

      Eligibility:

        -  Study participants must have histologically confirmed solid tumor that has progressed on
           standard therapy known to prolong survival or for which no standard treatment options
           exist

        -  Age greater than or equal to 12

        -  No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study
           (6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C).

        -  Adequate organ function

      Study Design:

        -  This is an open-label Phase I trial

        -  During dose escalation, the starting dose of nilotinib will be administered at 300 mg
           orally BID from cycle 1 day 2 and paclitaxel will be administered IV at 60 mg/m2 at dose
           level 1 on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles. For cycle 2 on, nilotinib will be
           administered from day 1. Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design, with dose limiting
           toxicities defined during cycle 1.

        -  Up to 33 adult patients will be accrued to a PD expansion phase at the MTD to further
           assess pharmacodynamic endpoints in tumor and CTCs.

        -  As of Amendment O (May 2020), patients ages 12-17 will be accrued to a separate
           pediatric expansion cohort to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
           pharmacodynamics of this combination for pediatric patients.
