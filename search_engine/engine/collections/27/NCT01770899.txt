      continue to be a significant cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. Montelukast holds an
      established role in the pediatric outpatient management of asthma and while two promising
      studies in adults have demonstrated its potential use as an adjunctive therapy for acute
      exacerbations, its similar use in pediatrics has yet to be established. This pilot study is
      designed as a prospective, double blinded, randomized, controlled, clinical trial comparing
      the use of oral montelukast plus standard of care vs. standard of care alone in children
      admitted for status asthmaticus to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The primary
      outcome the investigators are interested in is the time to reach a Modified Pediatric Asthma
      Score (PAS) of < 5, which, per the clinical protocol for the treatment of status asthmaticus,
      is the time when patients are able to come off continuous bronchodilator therapy. If oral
      montelukast, given with other standard therapies, can reduce the treatment, emotional, and
      financial burden (e.g., shortened intensive care stay) associated with severe, acute asthma
      exacerbations in children, it would provide a significant therapeutic advantage, potentially
      improving both the morbidity and burden of pediatric asthma.
