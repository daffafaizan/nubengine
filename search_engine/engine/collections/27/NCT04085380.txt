      the departments of the centers involved under the supervision of the Infection Control Team.

      All patients hospitalized more than 24 hours, on a given day are eligible for the protocol,
      except the patients unable to answer the questionnaire.

      After collecting the non-opposition of the patient, patients will be screened by rectal swab
      and a questionnaire will be completed.

      Each sample will be analyzed to detect eXDR carrying patients.

      The carrying patients will be followed during 6 months to estimate the proportion of the
      population which developped a bacterial infection. This information will be collected by a
      retrospective telephone survey of carrying patients.
