      pain relief during your labor, is the identification of the epidural space in your lower back
      with a needle, followed by passing a thinner and longer needle through the first needle. This
      second needle will enter the patient's "spinal" (intrathecal) space by passing through the
      dura (thin covering separating the epidural space from the spinal space). The spinal
      (intrathecal) space is identified by flow of spinal fluid. The dura is the envelope around
      the spinal cord and the intrathecal space which is filled with spinal fluid. Medication will
      be injected at once into the spinal space, the thinner needle removed and a fine tube
      (catheter) will be threaded through the first needle into the epidural space. This catheter
      is in the epidural space and medication can be given through this catheter later on (hence
      the term combined) if needed. This study is a comparison of three different dosages (1.25mg,
      1.66mg and 2.5 mg) of the local anesthetic (Bupivacaine) that we frequently use in the
      spinal, mixed with 20 mcg of Fentanyl (also routinely used in standard of care practice), and
      of its effects on the patient's blood pressure (risk of maternal's drop of the blood pressure
      with possible bad effects on the blood flow to the baby), on the patient's baby's heart rate
      (risk of slowing down of the baby heart rate as a consequence of decreased blood flow to the
      baby), and the patient's pain relief (higher dose of medications are usually more effective
      for maternal pain relief but have side effects that can be bad for the mother and the baby).
      The doses of Bupivacaine the investigator routinely use on the labor and delivery floor go
      from 1.25 to 2.5 mg depending on clinician preferences. These doses are considered standard
      of care in the literature.
