      light, or light that is generated encompassing the entire visual spectrum. Some tumors such
      as carcinoma in situ may not be visible using white light and require patients to undergo
      random bladder biopsies in order to find the cancer. Recently the development of photodynamic
      agents have been shown to enhance these procedures to accomplish better resection and
      identify over-looked tumors. However, these methods often require the instillation of dyes
      into the bladder as well as specialized cystoscopes. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is now
      available which uses a special filter to limit the light to only certain wavelengths which
      allows the identification of areas of increased vascularity or abnormalities without the need
      for dyes. NBI has been investigated in gastro-intestinal disease and found to be beneficial.
      Early reports in urology suggest that this technology may reduce the number of tumors that
      are missed which could impact the recurrence rate of bladder tumors, but this is not known at
      this time.
