      stiffness of arteries and/or cause the arteries to not work as well and if MDOs impact blood
      pressure over a 24 hour period of time.The investigators also want to determine if children
      with mood disorders have any risk factors or blood tests that can predict how stiff arteries
      are or how well arteries function and if these are associated with cardiovascular disease
      risk. The investigators also want to determine if children with mood disorders have greater
      adverse childhood experiences, worse emotional regulation and poorer quality of sleep. The
      investigators hope that information from this study could help in earlier detection of
      cardiovascular disease risk in children.
