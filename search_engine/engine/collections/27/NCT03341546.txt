      anterior-posterior or lateral depth using the radiographic image and the known exposure
      factors with which it was undertaken. This model has been tested using single composition
      phantoms and found to be accurate. If it was found to be accurate for real clinical
      examinations, this would automate the measurement of patient size and give institutions the
      estimate of patient size required for local paediatric patient dose audit. In turn, this
      would provide the national data required to propose national reference values for paediatric
      x-ray examinations, which would give all institutions an important comparator for their
      performance. This would lead to optimisation in those sites most requiring it; nationally,
      paediatric x-ray imaging would improve in time.

      This pilot study is necessary to determine if the computational model is accurate enough to
      be relied upon. Accuracy will be determined by comparing the estimate made by the
      computational model for each patient with an actual measurement of the patient's
      anterior-posterior abdomen depth made at the time of the examination.
