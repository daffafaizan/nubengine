      Includible patients are observed for 5 weeks on their usual treatment (twice or thrice daily
      hydrocortisone). Assessments of QoL, in terms of EMA assessments, to be used as baseline
      measurement in the study, are collected for 20 days preceded by a 5 days technology
      adaptation phase. Thereafter participants are shifted to modified release hydrocortisone
      (Plenadren) once daily (OD), on a dose as per Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).
      Assessments of QoL to be used as outcome of intervention in the study are performed after
      12.5 weeks after initiation of Plenadren intervention treatment, in order to take into
      consideration the period of re-adjustment of the body after the switch from conventional
      hydrocortisone to Plenadren. As done at the baseline observation, EMA measurement is preceded
      by a five days technology adaptation phase. At the end of the intervention treatment period,
      the patients will be shifted to their usual hydrocortisone treatment and will be followed at
      the outpatient clinic according to the directives of the clinic. Biochemical parameters;
      blood samples, DEXA scan, 24 hour blood pressure and salivary cortisol, will be assessed at
      baseline and after 16 weeks, as part of the safety evaluation of Plenadren.
