      antibacterial properties. This randomized, placebo controlled, randomized split-mouth
      clinical study evaluates the effects of ozone therapy on clinical and biochemical parameters.
      Total of 20 participants completed the study (10 males, 10 females). Periodontal parameters,
      including plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing depth (PD), percentage of bleeding
      on probing, percentage of pockets deeper than 5 mm and clinical attachment level (CAL), and
      percentage of ≥3 mm clinical attachment level. Periodontal parameters were evaluated at
      baseline and 3 months following periodontal therapy. All participants were treated
      non-surgically. Topical gaseous ozone was applied into periodontal pockets twice a week for 2
      weeks during active periodontal therapy. Gingival crevicular fluid pentraxin-3 (PTX-3),
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) were evaluated.
