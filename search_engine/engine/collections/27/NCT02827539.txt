      LessRay to decrease overall radiation exposure during surgical placement of a spinal
      stimulator. A secondary objective is to analyze the efficacy of utilizing enhanced low
      radiation imaging in a fluoroscopically intensive pain procedure.

      The population group will be 65 patients from Duke University Medical Center and Duke Raleigh
      Hospital who meet the medical criteria for the surgical placement of a spinal cord stimulator
      epidural array. They will be divided equally into 2 arms: Research and Control and randomized
      by a non-surgeon on the study team. That information will be recorded and placed in a sealed
      envelope. On the day of surgery the envelope will be delivered to the OR and opened following
      "time-out". At the time the envelope is opened in the OR the patient is acknowledged to be
      evaluable for failure or success of LessRay during the surgical procedure if they are in the
      research arm. The control arm cohort will proceed with the surgery as typical without
      LessRay.

      The data from the two groups (Research vs. Control) will be analyzed using a two tailed
      t-test with p<.05. The risks associated specifically with the implementation of this study
      are with respect to loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep the
      information confidential
