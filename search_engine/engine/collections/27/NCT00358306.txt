      injury. There is some evidence that even if there appears to be great improvement of kidney
      function, an injury can put patients at risk for long-term problems with their kidney
      function and increase their risk to have high blood pressure. We want to collect information
      from participants to help explain why this injury can cause future problems, including
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) which may help us prevent these health problems.
