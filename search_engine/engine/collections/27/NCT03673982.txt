      are increasing [1]. Admission restores nutrition in a timely manner [2], but psychosocial
      problems remain and relapse following discharge is common [3]. The mortality post discharge
      is high [4]. We have found that relapse and bed use post discharge are reduced by a parenting
      intervention giving the family skills to manage eating disorder behaviours [5].

      Innovation: Through a process of co-production, in collaboration with service users and their
      families, we have developed tools exemplifying emotional coaching behaviour change strategies
      for patients and their carers (texts, DVDs and podcasts; iCASK programme). These aim of these
      tools is to improve the transition to outpatient care. These are hosted on a user-friendly,
      confidential and NHS-compliant platform.
