    
      HAM is a chronic disease of the spinal cord, caused by a virus called HTLV-I. Natural Killer
      cells provide rapid responses to viral-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after
      infection, and respond to tumor formation. In this trial, the investigators aim to study the
      therapeutic safety and the effect on HTLV-1 virus. This in turn will improve the knowledge
      and understanding of the disease and should lead to better therapy.

      In a single-center, one year open-label trial, 5 HAM patients will be treated with single
      intravenous injection of NK cells (0.9~1*10^9). Then, the the clinical effect was evaluated
      by dynamic analysis of Osame's Motor Disability Score and other related physiological
      indices, such as HTLV-1 antibody titer in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.
