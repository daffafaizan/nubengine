      in real-world conditions. The investigators aim to monitor multiple sensing modalities (e.g.,
      heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity level, spirometry, coughing sounds)
      in order to find reliable signatures of impending asthma exacerbation and systematically
      explore any challenges on the use of wearable technologies. A variety of off-the-shelf
      devices as well as the prototype HET platform developed by the NCSU ASSIST center will be
      used for data collection.

      The investigators plan to engage adolescents (ages 14-18) for a period of up to four months
      of monitoring. They will be asked to wear the wrist monitoring device for at least 8 hours
      daily and chest monitoring devices for at least 12 hours a week, to take daily measurements
      using a spirometer, and answer weekly questionnaires online and virtual interviews (at
      1-week,1-month and 3-months) about their asthma control and experiences with the devices.

      Wearable devices are increasingly popular with young people and are capable of providing
      dynamically calculated up-to-the-minute measurements of a number of physiologic parameters,
      including heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, activity levels, and cough.
      The cough sounds the investigators hope to capture during a forced-cough recording and while
      sleeping can be used as biomarkers for early detection of exacerbation. These changes could
      be used to predict an asthma exacerbation, and provide the wearer with instant feedback
      allowing the user to intervene early and prevent progression to more severe symptoms. Young
      adults are likely to adopt wearable technologies to facilitate chronic disease management,
      making this an ideal age group to examine the utility of wearable devices to detect early
      physiologic predictors of an impending exacerbation.
