      groups: TRT and CBT versus TRT and EMDR. Evaluations will take place at baseline before
      therapy starts, at the end of the treatment, after 3 months (10 treatment sessions) and 3
      months after therapy ends. The Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) will be used as the primary
      outcome measurement. Secondary outcome measurements will be the Visual Analogue Scale of
      Loudness (VAS), Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),
      Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ), psychoacoustic measurements and Event-related potentials
      (ERP). The objective is to evaluate whether the bimodal therapy TRT and EMDR can provide
      faster and/or more relief from the annoyance experienced in chronic tinnitus patients' daily
      lives compared to the bimodal therapy TRT and CBT.
