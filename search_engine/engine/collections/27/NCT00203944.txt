      many of these infants and children have experienced institutionalization and poor caretaking
      before their adoption, international adoptees have special medical and emotional needs that
      must be met by both their parents and pediatricians. Currently, most clinical information
      about these children has focused on their physical health status so that protocols for
      evaluation and treatment can be established. Some systematic research has also focused on
      their overall developmental status including both cognitive and motor capabilities. These
      studies show that most of the children are developmentally delayed upon arrival to the U.S.
      Furthermore, follow-up studies have found international adoptees to score (on the average)
      significantly lower in cognitive functioning than their nonadopted peers even after spending
      substantial time in their adopting homes and falling mostly within the normal range. Not
      surprisingly, children's level of functioning at older ages is related to the length of time
      spent in institutional care.

      These findings are consistent with an emerging literature on the lingering effects of early
      adversity on children's development. Potent adverse circumstances may include the unbuffered
      effects of poverty, experience in an institutional setting, physical or sexual abuse, and
      parental negligence Regardless of the source, children who are not protected from these
      disadvantageous situations demonstrate changes in their behavior as well as their
      biophysiological regulation.
