      related outcomes and reduce the risk of relapse and recidivism for opiate addicted prisoners
      reentering into the community after release from correctional facilities. In this study the
      investigators examine a medication-assisted therapy (extended release naltrexone) that is
      likely to be acceptable to correctional facilities and opioid addicted prisoners and that can
      improve the outcomes achieved by the usual detoxification/treatment referral approach. The
      results may be used to facilitate policy changes that involve adding extended release
      naltrexone to correctional facility formularies for use before reentry, and collaborating
      with one or more outpatient treatment providers to maintain continuity of care. Two hundred
      (200) opioid addicted prisoners currently incarcerated in the Philadelphia Prison System, who
      meet study admission criteria and express an interest in extended release naltrexone
      treatment, who give informed consent and will be scheduled for release within 14 days of
      being randomized into the study will be enrolled. These 200 subjects will be stratified by
      sex (male/females), will be 18 years or older, and are not sentenced).
