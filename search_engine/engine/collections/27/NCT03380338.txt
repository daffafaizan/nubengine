      mellitus (DM) type 2, causing an increase in glucose tolerance.

      One of the mechanisms through which these treatment modalities work might be explained
      through changes in the gut microbiota. Recent studies show that the chronic inflammatory
      status causing insulin resistance in DM type 2, is triggered by an increase in circulating
      bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Strict lifestyle intervention, such as exercise, so
      called Diabetes Bootcamp (DB), may manipulate the gut microbiota, reducing circulating LPS,
      causing an improvement of the insulin-mediated
