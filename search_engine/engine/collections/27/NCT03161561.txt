      pre-existing UK-based clinical cohorts of patients with COPD. This involves collection of
      epidemiological and physiological data from patients and controls to enable a complete
      definition of disease phenotype. Work package two will examine microbiological and innate
      immune parameters in this cohort to define whether innate immune defects underpin the
      susceptibility to infectious exacerbation and progression of airways disease. It will perform
      microbiological characterisation of each group and will look at the behaviour of groups who
      have frequent infectious exacerbations of disease as compared to those that do not. Work
      package three will measure lung injury and work package four will define physiological
      characteristics including chest wall muscle function in the cohort.

      Our work will sit within work package two. Researchers will collect data from patients within
      the cohort and in patients whom they may recruit locally and add to the cohort. Researchers
      will also share samples with other work packages (academic and industry based collaborators)
      as required to enable correlation of our findings with other investigators in our work
      package or other work packages. This project, which sits within work-package two will measure
      the capacity of primary phagocytes (neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages) isolated from
      COPD patients' blood or alveolar macrophages isolated from patients' lungs to carry out key
      host defence functions and compare these to similar cells isolated from age and sex-matched
      non-smokers or smokers without COPD as controls.
