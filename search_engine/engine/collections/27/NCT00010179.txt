      liposome, in terms of clinical/radiological response and CA125 tumor marker, in patients with
      previously treated advanced or recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Compare the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and possible pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships of these
      treatment schedules in these patients. III. Compare the time to progression in patients
      treated with these treatment schedules.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to time
      from last prior chemotherapy (less than 6 months vs 6 months or more) and number of prior
      chemotherapy regimens (1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Arm II: Patients receive
      lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response
      (CR) receive 2 additional courses after documented CR. Patients achieving partial response
      (PR) receive 4 additional courses after documented PR or until disease progression at
      investigator's discretion. Patients with stable disease continue therapy for a maximum of 6
      courses. Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until disease relapse or
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-74 patients (20-37 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 10 months.
