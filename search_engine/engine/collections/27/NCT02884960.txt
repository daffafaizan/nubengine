      option for patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids. Studies evaluating the outcomes after
      this procedure have established that the use of polyvinyl alcohol particles and Embosphere
      Microspheres is associated with best clinical and imaging outcomes. Embozene Microspheres
      represent a new embolic agent that is being evaluated for use for the treatment of
      symptomatic fibroids. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
      of Embozene Microspheres compared with Embosphere Microspheres for the treatment of
      symptomatic uterine fibroids.

      A total of 118 patents with symptomatic uterine fibroids will be enrolled at 6 sites. A
      questionnaire designed to assess symptom severity and health-related quality of life in
      patients will be administered to patients at the time of enrollment. In addition, a
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination will be performed to confirm
      the diagnosis of fibroids. Patients will then undergo the uterine fibroid embolization
      procedure. The embolic agent used for the procedure (Embosphere Microspheres or Embozene
      Microspheres) will be randomly assigned. Patients will be seen 1 month, 3 months, and 6
      months and contacted 12 months after the procedure so that the same questionnaire can be used
      to assess clinical outcomes. In addition, an MRI will be performed 3 months after the
      procedure to determine the imaging response to treatment.
