      therapy (ART), complications of long-standing HIV infection and treatment, including renal
      disease, have become increasingly important. Aging, concomitant metabolic diseases, and use
      of potentially nephrotoxic ART lead to higher risk for renal disease in HIV-infected
      persons.WHO encourage TDF as first line ARV regimen. The data on TDF related renal toxicity
      in Asian population is limited.

      For this cohort, we plan to look at these topics:

        1. proximal tubular dysfunction between TDF and non-TDF user

        2. incidence and predictor of TDF related renal toxicity

        3. TDF plasma concentrations

        4. Pharmacokinetic of TDF when used with boosted DRV, boosted ATV, and boosted LPV in Thai
           population

        5. Bone density and vitamin D in patients with and without hypophosphatemia.

        6. Pharmacogenomic of TDF in Thai population
