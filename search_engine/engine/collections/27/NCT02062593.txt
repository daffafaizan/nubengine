      comparison of the treatment of stable angina with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      and optimal medical therapy (OMT) versus a sham procedure and OMT. Two hundred patients with
      stable angina and one or more angiographically significant coronary stenosis of 70% or more
      in a single vessel that is suitable for angioplasty will be recruited. Baseline investigation
      of functional capacity and myocardial ischaemic burden will be performed. This will be
      followed by a coronary angiogram and invasive physiological investigation followed by
      randomisation to PCI or a sham procedure. Follow-up investigation of functional capacity and
      myocardial ischaemic burden at 6 weeks will then be performed.
