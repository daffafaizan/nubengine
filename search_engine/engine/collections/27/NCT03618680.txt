      mobility and report poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness . It is reported in the
      literature that children with JIA suffer from poor sleep, parasomnias, daytime sleepiness,
      sleep fragmentation, cyclic alternating patterns increase, and sleep-disordered breathing
      compared to healthy children. Sleep was disturbed in almost half of the patients with both
      JIA and juvenile dermatomyositis, and that sleep disturbance and fatigue were both correlated
      with disease activity. Increased pain is associated with more sleep disturbance and more
      fatigue, and these appear to negatively influence quality of life.

      So, in this study, fatigue and sleep in Turkish patients with JIA will be investigated by
      using specific surveys and also secondarily it will be examined possible relationships
      between disease activity, pain and functional ability in children and adolescents with JIA.
