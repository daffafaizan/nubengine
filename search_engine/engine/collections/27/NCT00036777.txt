      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicity and other toxicities of
      UCN-01 when combined with carboplatin.

      II. Preliminarily evaluate the antitumor effect of the combination of carboplatin and UCN-01.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of UCN-01 and carboplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour followed by UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and UCN-01 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
