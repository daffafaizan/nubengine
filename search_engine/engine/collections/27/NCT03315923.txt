      nervous system. Active secondary progressive MS means progressive accumulation of disability
      after an initial relapsing course which is also associated with clinical relapses and/or
      new/enlarged Gad-enhanced brain lesions. This form of the disease leads to high rates of
      morbidity and mortality among patients. Different immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory
      agents are recommended by researchers to decrease relapses and improve disability among MS
      patients. The effect of these medications on different phenotypes of MS are mostly
      investigated solely and very small number of comparative studies are conducted to evaluate
      the superiority of these medications on each other.

      Glatiramer acetate is one of the known MS medications which is being used to control relapses
      from a long time ago and different clinical trials have shown its partial efficacy among MS
      patients. On the other hand, rituximab is one of the medications which is recently suggested
      for treatment of MS and currently phase II clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the
      efficacy of this medication among patients. As previously stated, there is a lack of clinical
      trials to compare the efficacy of suggested medications among secondary progressive patients.
      To fill this gap, we aimed to compare the efficacy of these two medications on disability,
      annualized relapse rate, and Gad-enhanced brain lesions among patients with active secondary
      progressive MS through a randomized clinical trial during a one-year follow-up period.
