    
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to compare the time to hemostasis at the
      aortic anastomotic suture line in subjects receiving Progel (Test group) to that in subjects
      receiving Gelfoam Plus (Control group) on anastomotic suture lines involving the aortic
      valve, ascending aorta, or aortic arch while on cardiopulmonary bypass.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the time to achieve hemostasis at the aortic
      anastomotic suture line from the time surgical clamps are released to cessation of leakage at
      the treated anastomotic site with either Progel (Test) or Gelfoam Plus (Control).
