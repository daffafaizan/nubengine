      acute confusional state. Further, current evidence suggests that delirium may worsen the
      prognosis of dementia, may alter the clinical course and trajectory of cognitive decline, and
      may be associated with substantially worse long-term outcomes. This study was a prospective
      cohort study design involving 165 hospitalized subjects with dementia who were 65 and older
      and included a three month follow up period. Aims for the study included: 1) to identify risk
      factors for DSD, and 2) to describe post-hospital outcomes and the trajectory of cognitive
      decline for DSD, which will justify the development of appropriate preventative and
      management strategies for delirium in patients with dementia. Delirium was assessed daily
      from admission to discharge and then at one and three month follow-ups. The potential risk
      factors being examined were 1) polypharmacy (central nervous system-active medications,
      number of medications, new medications added), 2) physical stressors (urinary tract
      infection, pain, dehydration), and 3) environmental stressors (bedrest, restraints, room
      changes). Outcomes were assessed by research study staff blinded to the study aims.
