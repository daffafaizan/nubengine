      therapy for cancers of the prostate, cervix, uterus, bladder and other malignancies in the
      pelvic area. Around 20 % of radiation patients develop radiation proctitis. There is a
      significant lack of trial treatments for radiation proctitis, even more, the studies often
      are small and single center designed or case series. In 2 recent reviews pointing out the
      management of radiation proctitis (2018 and 2016) a summary of current options in therapy
      according to current scientific knowledge is given. Unfortunately, these studies are about
      interventional options with the serious risk of complication. Only little data and lack of
      significance in smaller series on conservative strategies are given.

      The goal of the trial is to implement a specific medication in the management and every grade
      of radiation proctitis - concomitant to eventual need of MMPF is described with potent
      anti-inflammatory mucosal capacity reducing bleeding, pain and urgency symptoms in patients
      with hemorrhoidal and/or postoperative symptoms. By using a placebo instead of comparative
      oral medications (with low evidence) this study might illustrate clinical significance of
      expected results as well as information on the natural history of radiation proctitis.

      The goal of the study is to compare the number of necessary interventions required to stop
      bleeding in chronic radiation proctitis in patients receiving MMPF in comparison to patients
      in the control group receiving Placebo within 12 months of medical treatment.
