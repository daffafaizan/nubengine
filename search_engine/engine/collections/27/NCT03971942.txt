    
      Attention Bias Modification Training was a modified dot-probe task. In the neutral attention
      bias, 90% of the targets in the training group appear in the neutral word position and 10% of
      the targets appear in the negative word position, while 50% of the targets in the placebo
      group appear in the neutral word position and 50% of the targets appear in the negative word
      position. In the positive attention bias, 90% of the targets in the training group appear in
      the positive word position and 10% of the targets appear in the neutral word position, while
      90% of the targets in the placebo group appear in the neutral word position and 10% of the
      targets appear in the positive word position. The investigators assess attention bias scores,
      depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, rumination and self-report attention control ability at
      1-week, 2-week, 4-week, 7-week, 3-month, 4-month, 5-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups
      after training.
