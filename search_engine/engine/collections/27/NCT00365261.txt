      improvements have come about in recognizing and treating cancer related pain, less progress
      has been made in treating fatigue. Interventions to improve sleep may offer benefit in terms
      of pain and fatigue.

      One of the less commonly recognized side effects of opiate use is sleep disruption.

      Experimentally-induced sleep disruption lowers the threshold for detection of painful
      stimuli. Thus, although opiates are obviously helpful for pain, they do so at certain
      "costs": they increase next day fatigue, constipation, and have other side effects; they
      disrupt sleep which further increases next day fatigue; and finally, by virtue of their sleep
      disruptive properties, they lower the threshold for pain stimuli.

      Cancer patients requiring chemotherapy commonly require PCA because of oral mucositis. The
      objective of this study is to assess whether opiate usage may be reduced and complaints of
      fatigue and pain be lessened if patients had better sleep.
