      planed to undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autograft by remnant
      preserving and other twenty patients undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using
      autograft by resecting anterior cruciate ligament. The clinical outcome is comparative
      preoperative, postoperative 6weeks, 3months, 6months and 1years. And clinical score consists
      of Visual Analog Score, lachman test, anterior laxity, Lysholm knee score, international knee
      documentation committee score. Femoral and tibial tunnel location will be analyzed by
      three-dimensional computed tomography using Bernard quadrant method after surgery.

      The present study aimed to determine and compare (1) the accuracy of tibia and femoral tunnel
      location and (2) postoperative functional outcome after anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction between remnant preserving group versus remnant resecting group.
