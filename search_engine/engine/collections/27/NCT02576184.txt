      placement during stoma reversal after TME for rectal cancer.

      Patients are randomized in 3 groups : no mesh, synthetic mesh (Parietex, Covidien), biologic
      mesh (Cellis, Meccelis). Meshes are placed in retromuscular position after diverting
      ileostomy closure.

      Primary endpoint is radiological incisional hernia rate, assessed on CT-scan, at the end of
      follow-up Secondary endpoints include postoperative morbidity, postoperative pain,
      postoperative quality of life, long-term clinical incisional hernia rate.
