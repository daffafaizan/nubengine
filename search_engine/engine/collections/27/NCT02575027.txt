      I. To determine the accuracy of dose delivery and patient comfort with treatment time.

      II. To evaluate normal tissue dose volume statistics and compare to standard planning.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 4pi radiation simulation and planning followed by 5 to 10 daily fractions of
      4pi palliative radiotherapy. If an acceptable plan cannot be achieved using 4pi planning,
      then the patient will be treated with standard radiation therapy planning for palliative
      re-irradiation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks.
