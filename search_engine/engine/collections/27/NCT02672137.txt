      knowledge translation (KT) vs usual care. Prior to randomization, we reviewed charts of 100
      consecutive acute coronary syndromes (ACS) patients at each participating hospital in 2009.
      During one year, hospitals randomized to KT completed: 1) revision of the most recent
      American Heart Association Guidelines of ACS management, 2) focus groups to identify and
      solve local care gaps, and 3)local champion team to promote evidence-based medical therapy
      (EBMT). At the end of 12-month of KT/usual care, we reviewed discharge prescriptions of 100
      consecutive ACS patients at each participating hospital (year 2012).

      EBMT was pre-defined as in-hospital anticoagulation and discharge prescription of dual
      anti-platelets, beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin pathway modulating agents (for
      patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function). Refusal, impaired cognitive
      function, allergy or intolerance of patients to any of EBMT were considered valid reasons for
      withholding EBMT.
