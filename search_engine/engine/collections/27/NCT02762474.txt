      407000 deaths and the eighth most common cancer worldwide. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      remains the mainstay of treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Paclitaxel combined
      with radiotherapy was high efficiency and achieved encouraging results. Compared with
      paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel has a low toxicity, low allergy and the tolerance is better than
      paclitaxel. According to the pre-clinical results, investigators designed a prospective
      study, which is combined nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for
      the patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, and evaluated the tolerability and
      efficacy. we design enrolled 30 patients, the end point included toxicity, progression-free
      survival and overall survival.
