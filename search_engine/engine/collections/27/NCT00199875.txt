    
      Patients were enrolled sequentially into cohorts of 3 to 6 patients until determination of
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ^90Y-DOTA-cG250, defined as the dose level below the dose
      at which â‰¥ 2 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). In an attempt to mitigate
      liver uptake and toxicity, patients initially received a nontherapeutic injection with
      ^111In-DOTA-cG250 at an imaging dose of 5 mCi of ^111In + 10 mg of cG250 on Day 1. Whole body
      and blood measurements of radioactivity were obtained on at least 3 occasions for 1 week to
      determine targeting and dosimetry. Provided that protocol-specified criteria were met,
      including targeting to lesions > 2 cm detected on computed tomography (CT) scan, a single
      dose of therapeutic ^90Y-DOTA-cG250 was administered on Day 8, 9, or 10. The starting dose of
      ^90Y-DOTA-cG250 was 0.2 mCi/kg of ^90Y + 10 mg of cG250 administered as an intravenous (IV)
      infusion, with escalation of the ^90Y dose in subsequent cohorts in 0.05 to 0.1 mCi/kg
      increments.

      Patients were treated in an outpatient setting and were observed for at least 2 hours
      following each infusion, at which point vital signs and blood samples were obtained. Patients
      were followed for 6 to 8 weeks post-treatment (or after recovery from toxicity) with imaging,
      biochemical, serological, and hematologic tests to determine the safety of ^90Y-DOTA-cG250
      and to inform dose-escalation decisions. Extent of disease evaluations, preferably by
      positron emission tomography (PET)/CT or standard CT, were performed at baseline and 6 to 8
      weeks post-treatment (or after recovery from toxicity). Long-term follow-up was performed,
      when possible, every 12 weeks thereafter for up to 2 years.
