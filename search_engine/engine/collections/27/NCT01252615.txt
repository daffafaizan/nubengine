      patient only intervention on recovery outcomes of patients and partners after ICD
      implantation. By interventing with both ICD patients and their partners, we expect to further
      improve outcomes of patients and aid in recovery of partners. Over a five year period we will
      test the effects of a 12 week patient+partner intervention against a patient only
      intervention in the first year subsequent to ICD implantation, using a 2 group (N=150/group)
      randomized clinical trial design. Relevant data will be collected on ICD patients and
      intimate partners at hospital discharge, 1, 3, 6, 12 months post-ICD implantation. The four
      major outcomes are: physical functioning, psychological adjustment, health care utilization,
      and relationship impact. The primary analysis of treatment effect is the change in outcome
      variables from baseline to 3 months for the patient and partner. Secondarily, exploring long
      term effects of the intervention, theoretical elements, and the intervention effects by ICD
      implant reason will be determined.
