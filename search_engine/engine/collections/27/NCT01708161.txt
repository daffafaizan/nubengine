      estimate the MTD(s) and/or identify the recommended phase II dose(s) (RP2Ds) for the
      combination of BYL719 and AMG 479 (ganitumab), followed by the phase II part to assess the
      clinical efficacy and to further assess the safety of the combination in selected patient
      populations. The dose escalation part of the study were to be guided by a Bayesian Logistic
      Regression Model (BLRM).

      Once MTD/RP2D had been determined, patients were to be enrolled in two Phase II arms.
      Patients with PIK3CA mutated or amplified hormone receptor positive breast carcinoma were to
      be enrolled in Arm 1; patients with PIK3CA mutated or amplified ovarian carcinoma were to be
      enrolled in Arm 2. Patients were to be treated until progression of disease, unacceptable
      toxicity develops, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurred first. All patients
      were to be followed up. At a minimum, patients must have completed the safety follow-up
      assessments 30 days after the last dose of the study treatment.
