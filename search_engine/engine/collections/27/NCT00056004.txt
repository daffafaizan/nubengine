        -  Determine the efficacy of zileuton, in terms of number of sites and grade of dysplastic
           lesions in the bronchial epithelium, in patients with documented bronchial dysplasia.

        -  Correlate the regression of bronchial dysplasia (number and grade) and improvement in
           sputum cytology with the modulation of molecular biomarkers in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the overall toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the 6-month natural history of bronchial dysplasia in patients who are
           randomized to receive treatment with a placebo.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to smoking status (current vs recently quit smoker), and prior cancer
      (none vs lung or head and neck). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral zileuton 4 times daily for 6 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily for 6 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 134 patients will be accrued for this study.
