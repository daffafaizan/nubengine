    
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Nerivio for the acute treatment of
      menstrual migraine (pure menstrual migraine or menstrually-related migraine).

      Up to 500 US-based adults aged 18-55 years old who have been prescribed the Nerivio device
      and have used it at least 4 times between October 2019 and December 2020.

      Informed consent must be obtained from the participant before any protocol-related activities
      are performed. The consent language will appear as the first page of the survey, and
      participants will click either "agree" or "disagree" to the consent statement; those who
      click "agree" will proceed to the survey, those who click "disagree" will be brought to an
      exit page.

      Users of Nerivio whose details are in the sponsor's database will be contacted by email
      (provided by the patient during the sign-up process in the Nerivio app required to use the
      device) and/or through an app notification and will be asked to complete a 5-minute online
      survey assessing satisfaction, effectiveness, and safety. Participants will sign an informed
      consent form which will appear as the first page of the survey using open-ended questions,
      multiple choice questions and Likert scales. Participants will be directed to provide honest
      opinions regarding the device use for menstrual migraine. No additional information will be
      collected, and no medical records will be used in this investigation.
