      metabolic syndrome and 16 healthy control subjects. According a double crossover design, each
      subject received two oral forms of L-arginine (A and B) in random order, and participated in
      a exploration day on the first day of arginine administration and after one week of
      supplementation with this arginine form. The two weeks of arginine supplementation were
      separated by a washout period of 2 weeks at least.

      Each exploration extended over 24 hours after administration of the first arginine dose.
      Blood tests were performed at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 h after administration of the
      first dose. During explorations after the supplementation period, we also collected urine (0,
      2, 4, 8, 12, 24 h after the first dose).
