        -  To evaluate any objective tumor responses to PEG-BCT-100 in HCC patients receiving
           weekly doses of PEG-BCT-100 alone.

        -  To perform PK and PD analysis

        -  To measure Quality of Life of the patients

      Secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To define any toxicity associated with the metabolic and cellular alterations of ADD
           relative to dose and PK of PEG-BCT-100 (rhArgIpeg5000).

        -  To confirm the safety and anti-tumor activity of PEG-BCT-100 at the preferred dose
           (1600U/kg) in 50 patients (at least 18 evaluable subjects) with advanced HCC.

        -  To measure duration of response including Overall Survival and Time to Progression
           analysis
