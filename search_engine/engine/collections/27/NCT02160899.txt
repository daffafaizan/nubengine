    
      Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetic variant of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in which the
      apolipoprotein B (apoB) -100 component of LDL is linked by a disulfide bond to
      apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], the distinct protein component of Lp(a) that is mainly
      responsible for its signature structural and functional properties. Lp(a) is now recognized
      as an important genetic risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke and aortic stenosis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if ISIS-APO(a)Rx can reduce the production of
      apolipoprotein(a), or apo(a). This study will enroll 50 participants with Lipoprotein(a) ≥50
      and <175 mg/dL and 10 participants with Lipoprotein(a) ≥175 mg/dL.
