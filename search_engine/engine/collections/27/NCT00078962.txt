      and gemcitabine in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      Secondary I. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 2-16 of course 1 and on days 1-16 of all
      subsequent courses and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 and on
      days 2, 9, and 16 of all subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of GTI-2040 and gemcitabine until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, 10 additional patients are treated at that dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-20
      months.
