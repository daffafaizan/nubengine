      characterized by progressive muscle weakness with onset in early adulthood. The causative
      gene, GNE, codes for the bifunctional enzyme uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine
      (UDP-GlcNAc)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) kinase (GNE/MNK), which catalyzes the
      first 2 steps in the biosynthesis of sialic acid. The subsequent paucity of sialic acid
      production is presumed to cause decreased sialylation of HIBM muscle glycoproteins, resulting
      in muscle deterioration. In this Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      escalating single-dose study, we propose to provide ManNAc (N-acetyl-D-mannosamine
      monohydrate) orally as a liquid solution to 3 cohorts of 6 subjects (Cohorts A, B, C) at
      doses of 3,000 mg, 6,000 mg, and 10,000 mg ManNAc, respectively, or up to the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of orally administered ManNAc to HIBM subjects, to
      identify the MTD of a single dose of orally administered ManNAc to HIBM subjects, and to
      explore the effect of a single dose of ManNAc on potential pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of
      HIBM. All subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive ManNAc (n equals 4) or
      placebo (n equals 2) and the decision to dose-escalate will be the responsibility of the
      Safety Review Committee (SRC). Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AEs), clinical
      laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, and electrocardiograms (ECGs). PK will
      be assessed for both ManNAc and sialic acid.
