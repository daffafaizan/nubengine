      I. Determine the objective response rate and duration of objective response in patients with
      HER2/neu-positive advanced gallbladder or biliary tract cancer treated with trastuzumab
      (Herceptin).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. II. Assess the
      progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
