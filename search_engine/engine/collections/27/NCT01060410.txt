      an alkylating agent, cyclophosphamide is able to induce several side effects, including
      thinned hair, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, infection, myelosuppression, etc. However,
      the remarkable variability of the reactions to the drug -- the incidence of side effect or
      the outcome of the treatment -- has been observed among patients. Cyclophosphamide is a
      pro-drug, which require some enzymes in the liver to transform it into an active chemical to
      arouse alkylating function. And then it undergoes a series of detoxification steps catalyzed
      by the specific metabolic enzymes. This study is designed to explore the genetic variation
      among individuals in the key processes of the activation and elimination of cyclophosphamide
      in order to find out whether these genetic factors are associated to the side effects or
      efficacy. The further understanding into the factors concerning on the drug might imply
      possible solution to minimize the incidence of side effects in patients of systemic lupus
      erythematosus.
