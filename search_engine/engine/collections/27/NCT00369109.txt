      Primary

        -  Determine the level of p-Chk1 and phospho-histone 2AX (p-H2AX), an indicator of DNA
           damage, and possibly downstream pathway markers in hair follicles from skin biopsies of
           patients treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride or irinotecan hydrochloride for advanced
           solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the method for measurement (immunohistochemistry).

        -  Measure inter- and intra-patient variability for the biomarker.

        -  Partially characterize the dynamic time course of p-Chk1 and p-H2AX after administration
           of a DNA-damaging agent.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo collection of 2 skin biopsies with hair follicles at 4 and 8 hours or at 4
      and 6 hours after the start of irinotecan hydrochloride or gemcitabine hydrochloride
      treatment on day 1 of course 1. Repeat biopsies will be taken at 4, 6, or 8 hours after the
      start of irinotecan hydrochloride or gemcitabine hydrochloride on day 1 of 2 successive
      courses.

      Tissue is examined by immunohistochemistry and possibly other methods for changes in p-Chk1
      and pH2AX.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
