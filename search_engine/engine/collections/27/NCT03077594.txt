      endoscopic mucosal impedance catheter), intercellular space as measured with transmission
      electron microscopy and tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 in patients undergoing surveillance
      following successful endoscopic therapy (defined as two negative endoscopic surveillance
      histology for intestinal metaplasia).

      Mucosal impedance will be measured by an endoscopic probe. Research biopsies will also be
      obtained for measurement of tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 and intracellular space with
      transmission electron microscopy.

      Volumetric laser endomicroscopy will measure the precise thickness of and area of subsquamous
      structures underneath the neosquamous epithelium.
