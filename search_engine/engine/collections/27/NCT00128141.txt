      than 32 weeks will be randomized in two groups: standard care that will receive the usual
      treatment applied to all infants admitted to our unit and a second groups that will receive
      standard care plus maternal tactile and kinesthetic stimuli that will be taught to the
      mothers. Randomization will be performed among those that accept to participate in the study.
      Growth (birth, length and head circumference), age of life to start receiving enteral
      feedings, length of hospital stay, time to recover birth weight will be recorded and compared
      between both groups.
