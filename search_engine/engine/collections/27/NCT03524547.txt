      oral-pharyngeal-laryngeal axis, certain curvature of endotracheal tube is needed for the
      successful intubation using the videolaryngoscope.

      Participants in both groups will be intubated with videolaryngoscope (McGrath MAC®). Stylet
      will be inserted in the endotracheal tubes and will be bent to a specific shape by the
      assigned group. In the J-shaped tube group, endotracheal tube will be molded to a shape
      similar to the blade of the videolaryngoscope (McGrath MAC®). In the 60-degrees-curved tube
      group, endotracheal tube will be bent 60 degrees. Time to intubation, intubation attempts and
      ease of intubation wil be assessed.
