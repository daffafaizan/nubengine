        -  Evaluate the efficacy of irinotecan based chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIA
           non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Investigate the phenotypic changes induced in the tumor by this treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive IV cisplatin over 30 minutes followed by IV irinotecan over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 3 courses until disease
      progression. Once potential candidates for resectability are determined, patients undergo
      thoracotomy or concurrent chemotherapy/radiation therapy within 6 weeks of completing the
      last course of chemotherapy. Following resection, patients responding to chemotherapy receive
      3 additional courses of IV carboplatin and paclitaxel over 3 hours. Patients may undergo
      local irradiation beginning with the second course of carboplatin and paclitaxel.
      Chemotherapy ceases if disease remains stable after 8 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year after treatment, then every 6 months
      thereafter for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 20 patients over 18 months.
