      matched controls) demonstrate: 1) decreased bone strength and quality disproportionate to the
      decrease of bone density and 2) abnormalities in the steroid metabolome correlate with the
      degree of abnormalities in bone parameters. In a cross-sectional study of 75 patients with
      MACS and 75 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, we will determine the relationship of the
      steroid metabolome to measurements of bone density, quality and strength, bone turnover
      markers, as well as body composition. All patients will be interviewed in regards to their
      health, to include questions on bone health, frailty, cognition (NIH toolbox), and quality of
      life. We will measure 1) BMD (bone mineral density) at the lumbar spine, hip and radius and
      body composition using dual-energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA), 2) radial and tibial bone
      microstructure by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), 4)
      bone turnover markers (osteocalcin, PINP, CTx, sclerostin). 5) Age reader measurement, 6)
      hand grip measurement, 7) 6 minute walk test. All patients will provide a 24 h urine for
      steroid metabolome analysis. For primary outcomes, we will determine if steroid metabolome
      profiling better predicts abnormal bone strength (as measured by trabecular bone
      volume/tissue volume [BV/TV] ratio).
