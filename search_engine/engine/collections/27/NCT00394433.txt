      Primary

      To determine the 10-month progression-free survival rate for the combination of TPC and
      Bevacizumab in patients with metastatic esophageal or gastric cancer

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate (RECIST) and median duration of response

        -  To determine overall survival

        -  To determine toxicity

      Exploratory

        -  To explore if 7/7 and 7/6 UGT1A1 polymorphisms correlate with grade III/IV
           irinotecan-related diarrhea and neutropenia when irinotecan is given at relatively low
           dose to patients with esophageal and gastric cancer

        -  To correlate expression of tumoral and serum VEGF with response and survival

        -  To correlate TGF alpha levels and tumor microvessel density with clinical activity

        -  To examine circulating endothelial cells (CECs) as surrogate markers of antitumor
           activity of bevacizumab

      DESIGN This trial will use a single stage design to differentiate a >/= 50% rate of 10-month
      progression-free survival from a </= 30% rate. The proposed regimen would be promising if at
      least 15 of 35 patients were alive and progression-free at 10 months.
