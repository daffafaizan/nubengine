    
      Subjects presenting with Class II or III heart failure with a left ventricular ejection
      fraction of ≤ 40% and NT-proBNP ≥ 400 will be considered for the study. Subjects who meet the
      initial screening requirements will undergo non-invasive imaging of the carotid anatomy to
      assess adequacy of the anatomy to allow placement of the MobiusHD device. Eligible subjects
      will receive an implant placed in the internal carotid artery.

      Following implantation of the device, subjects will be seen at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and
      24 months.
