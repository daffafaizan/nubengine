      patients with IIIb/IV and refractory non-small cell lung cancer will be enrolled for testing
      the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PB103 (NK cells). For assessment of safety and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PB103, three-dose levels of PB103 will be administered to
      enrolled patients based on the 3+3 dose-escalation design. MTD is deﬁned as one dose level
      below the dose at which dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) is observed in <33% of the
      participants. DLT is deﬁned as grade 4 toxicities (hematological toxicities), grade 3
      toxicities (non-hematological toxicities), or acute GvHD more than grade 2. Once MTD is
      determined, 12 patients at MTD dose will be enrolled for assessment of safety and efficacy of
      PB103 at phase IIa.
