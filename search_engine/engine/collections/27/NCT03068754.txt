      decline in adult participants with ALS. Approximately 213 participants will be enrolled.

      Following a screening period of up to 28 days, participants with ALS and symptom onset
      (defined as first muscle weakness or dysarthria) â‰¤ 2 years prior to the Screening Visit will
      be randomized on a 2:1 basis to receive subcutaneous (SC) Acthar 0.2 mL (16 Units [U]) daily
      (QD) or SC matching placebo 0.2 mL QD for 36 weeks, followed by a 3-week taper.

      Participants who complete the 36 week double-blind treatment period are eligible to enter an
      Open Label Extension phase in which all participants will receive Acthar 0.2 mL (16 U) daily.
