    
      This is a First-in-Human, open-label, multiple ascending dose escalation and dose expansion
      study of THOR-707 in adult subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The objectives
      of the dose escalation phase are to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of THOR-707
      as a monotherapy (Part 1) and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (Part 2); to
      evaluate safety/tolerability of THOR-707; to evaluate anti-tumor activity of THOR-707; to
      evaluate pharmacokinetics of THOR-707; and to evaluate various immunological biomarkers pre-
      and post-treatment with THOR-707. The objectives of the dose expansion phase (Part 3) are to
      further evaluate safety and anti-tumor activity of THOR-707 (administered at the RP2D) as a
      monotherapy and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor or an anti-EGFR antibody in select
      populations of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
