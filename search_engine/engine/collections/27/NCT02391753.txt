      trial were examined within 36 h of delivery and at 3rd months after delivery.Parameters such
      as age, episiotomy, mode of delivery, duration of labor, birthweight and antenatal biparietal
      diameter (BPD) measures were obtained from the clinical files. The length of the first stage
      of labor was calculated from the beginning of regular and at least three strong uterine
      contractions in 30 min according to the women's statements, tocography and palpations to full
      dilatation. All static ultrasound volume acquisitions were performed by the same experienced
      sonographer trained in pelvic floor ultrasound within 36 h of delivery. Same patients invited
      for second evaluation.Two 3-D volumes (one at rest, one on Valsalva maneuver) were recorded
      in the supine position after voiding.The effectiveness of valsalva was ascertained by
      observing 2-D ultrasounds before acquiring volumes.. LAM thickness is determined at the plane
      of minimal hiatal dimensions rather than 1-1.5 cm above the actual LAM hiatus where LAM
      thickness is maximal as described by Dietz et al.(15). The following parameters were assessed
      for this study: maximum diameters of the LAM hiatus (anteroposterior and transverse) at rest
      and on Valsalva maneuver; area of the LAM hiatus at rest and on Valsalva; and pubovisceral
      muscle thickness (left and right of the rectum), difference in anteroposterior and transverse
      diameter of hiatus and LAM hiatus area between rest and Valsalva
