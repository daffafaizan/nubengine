      In recent studies, there has been shown that a large amount of neutrophil elastase release
      from neutrophils could induce the development of deep venous thromboembolism and femoral
      nerve block may reduce the incidence of the development of deep venous thromboembolism. In
      addition, inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1(IL-1), IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis
      factor(TNF) were associated with deep venous thromboembolism. Thus, the investigators
      hypothesised that preemptive analgesic of femoral nerve block could prevent deep venous
      thromboembolism due to inhibiting the excessive release of neutrophil elastase and
      inflammatory cytokines.
