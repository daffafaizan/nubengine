      United States. Toxicity requires cytochrome P-450 bioactivation of APAP. Children are less
      susceptible to APAP toxicity; the current theory is that they have different metabolism than
      adults. However, children's liquid preparations of APAP contain excipients which have been
      shown to inhibit APAP bioactivation in vitro and in rodents. Children tend to ingest liquid
      preparations, which could potentially explain their decreased susceptibility instead of an
      intrinsically different metabolism. Further, our review of Poison Center epidemiologic data
      shows that liquid preparations are less toxic in adults. Our hypothesis is that excipients in
      liquid preparations inhibit the bioactivation of APAP. The design is a pharmacokinetic
      cross-over study in humans. Healthy adult subjects will be recruited for administration of
      therapeutic doses of APAP in capsule and liquid formulations. Plasma via a heplock will be
      collected at serial time points up to 8 hours and assayed for APAP and its metabolites. After
      a washout period, subjects will receive the same dose of APAP in the alternate preparation.
      The pattern of metabolites, indicating the activity of the bioactivating enzymes, will be
      compared. A significant difference in P-450 metabolites will support the hypothesis and
      provide preliminary data for studies in patients who have ingested potentially toxic doses of
      APAP. Ultimately, this work could support development of novel antidotal therapy for APAP
      overdose.
