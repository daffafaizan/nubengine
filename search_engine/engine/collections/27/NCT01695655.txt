      prior to penetrating keratoplasty. They will be examined by the full protocol preoperatively,
      and postoperatively at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. During these visits slit lamp
      biomicroscopy will be used to study CN patterns, and take slit lamp photographs if there is
      any neovascularization detected, permitting us to develop algorithms of CN characteristics
      that are predictive for corneal allograft rejection and failure. The corneal tissue removed
      during these patients' surgeries will be evaluated histopathologically to identify
      inflammation and neovascularization to confirm and compare to what is seen clinically. There
      will be two short questionnaires conducted at each visit to assess stress levels.
