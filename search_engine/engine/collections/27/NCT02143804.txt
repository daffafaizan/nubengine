      failed BCG therapy. Most patients with NMIBCis (Cis, Cis with Ta and/or T1, high grade Ta or
      T1 with frequent or uncontrolled recurrences) who have failed BCG intravesical therapy
      (standard of care) usually have no other choice but to proceed to cystectomy. Cystectomy is a
      surgery associated with major morbidity, mortality and quality of life issues. Morbidity and
      long term tedious medical care will be for the rest of the patient's life span. Most patients
      at this stage do not show signs of disease progression into the muscle layer or of
      metastasis, making surgery a very difficult decision. CG0070, if successful in this trial,
      will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this patient population in need. For the
      present study, Cis or Cis with Ta and/or T1 patients can only be enrolled if they have failed
      the BOND study and are medically unfit for surgery. Furthermore, patients with high grade Ta
      or T1 disease who have failed both BCG and chemotherapy treatments are also prone to disease
      progression. Since these patients are not eligible to be enrolled in the BOND trial, the
      present study will serve as an alternative to access CG0070 experimental treatment.
