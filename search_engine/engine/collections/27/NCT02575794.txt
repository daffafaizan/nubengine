      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of terameprocol given orally on days 1-5
      every 28 days in patients with high grade glioma. (Part 1)

      II. To evaluate terameprocol tumor to plasma ratios in resected high grade gliomas following
      5 days of oral terameprocol administration. (Part 2)

      III. To assess the maximum duration of terameprocol that can be safely administered on a
      continuous basis. (Part 3)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) of oral terameprocol.

      II. Evaluate the toxicities of oral terameprocol.

      III. Assess progression-free survival.

      IV. Estimate overall survival.

      V. Assess tumor response.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the contribution of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9)
      genotypes on the variability of oral terameprocol pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive terameprocol orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, every 2 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.
