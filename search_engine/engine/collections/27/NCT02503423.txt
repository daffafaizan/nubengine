    
      ASTX660 is a synthetic small molecule dual antagonist of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
      protein (cIAP) 1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) that has been shown to
      have potent proapoptotic and tumor growth inhibitory activity in nonclinical models. The
      Phase 1 portion of the study (completed) will determine the MTD, RP2D, and recommended dosing
      regimen. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate activity in selected tumor types. Subjects will
      continue to receive their assigned treatment throughout the study until the occurrence of
      disease progression, death, or unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, or until the study is
      closed by the sponsor.
