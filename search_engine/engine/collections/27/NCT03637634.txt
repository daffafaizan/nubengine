    
      The study will focus on the following objectives:

        -  Characterize survivors' health with respect to disease- and treatment-related factors.

        -  Investigate the consequences of various intensities of exposure to chemotherapy and/or
           radiation on health outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular, reproductive, second cancers, etcâ€¦).

        -  Compare the mortality experience of survivors with the general population.

        -  Characterize the health-related behaviors, patterns of medical care, and medical
           follow-up needs of survivors.

        -  Describe patterns of familial aggregation of cancer, including known (and variations of)
           cancer family syndromes.

        -  Collect and store biologic samples (saliva, blood, second tumor tissue) to correlate
           with health outcomes and use for future research.
