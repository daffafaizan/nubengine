      analysed to investigate the effects of maternal eating on maternal and child outcomes (diet,
      eating, weight, metabolic). The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a
      longitudinal, prospective study designed to examine the effects of environment, genetics and
      other factors on health and development.All pregnant women living in the geographical area of
      Avon, UK, who were expected to deliver their baby between 1st April 1991 and 31st December
      1992, were recruited. 14,541 women were enrolled. Amongst these pregnancies, there were a
      total of 14,676 fetuses, resulting in 14,062 live births and 13,798 children who were alive
      at 1 year of age and were singletons. The ALSPAC study website contains details of all the
      data that is available through a fully searchable data Dictionary
      (http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).

      Missingness will be assessed and standard data analytical techniques such as MI will be
      used.Crude and adjusted logistic, linear, and multinomial regression models will be employed.
