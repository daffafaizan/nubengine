      composed by pediatric and adult patients in anesthesia and intensive care in need of close
      blood pressure monitoring.

      After informed consent from the patients themselves, patient and parents and sometimes only
      parents.

      The device measuring PTT is the prepared and calibrated with existing arterial blood
      pressure. Data is then recorded via the storage capacity of the device and via videocamera.
      The videocamera is used to identify large disturbances in data registration. This is to
      identify confounding data and in the end calibrate the device to be more accurate.

      Data from the PTT device and the camera is then downloaded to the study computer and to an
      external hard drive in order to create redundancy in data storage.

      Data is then analysed to compare the difference between data recorded from the PTT device and
      arterial pressure respectively. Aim is to be able to collect sufficient data to be able to
      decide wether to recommend or advice against clinical use.

      Patient data is registered and then handled by our departmental clerk. Data is stored for ten
      years.
