      contribute to the progression of microvascular disease and myocardial fibrosis in ESRD and
      that agents designed to restore normal aldosterone and NO homeostasis will improve
      microvascular and diastolic cardiac function in the heart of individuals with dialysis
      dependent ESRD. We will test 2 specific agents: The mineralocorticoid receptor blocker
      spironolactone; and L-arginine, an agent which improves NO bioavailability. Two specific aims
      will be addressed using a prospective, double-blinded, 2x2 factorial trial in dialysis
      dependent patients with ESRD. Subjects will be randomized to placebo, spironolactone plus
      placebo, L-arginine plus placebo, or combination spironolactone and L-arginine therapy.
      Diastolic cardiac function will be assessed using tissue Doppler index (TDI) determined
      mitral annular velocities (E') on LV echocardiography, and microvascular supply will be
      assessed using CFR-the ratio of hyperemic to resting myocardial blood flow-measured by
      positron emission tomography (PET) scans at baseline, 2 weeks and after 9 months of
      randomized therapy.

      This randomized trial of spironolactone and L-arginine will provide important data about the
      contributions of aldosterone and NO to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in ESRD,
      will demonstrate the therapeutic potential of L-arginine and spironolactone as as targeted
      cardiovascular therapies for use in ESRD, and will provide important insights into the
      underlying pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in ESRD. The results generated will
      provide the data needed to design large-scale trials testing whether spironolactone or
      L-arginine can improve mortality or cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD.
