      After evaluation testing, patients will be randomly assigned (similarly to a coin toss) to
      one of two possible follow-up groups. One would be a regular post-surgery care group (control
      group), the other will have in addition a support by geriatric nurse practitioner
      (intervention group).

      Patients who are assigned to the intervention group: once they arrive home, in addition to
      their normal post-surgery care, will receive a once a week home visit by a geriatric nurse
      practitioner (GNP). The GNP will also call the patient once a week in between. The GNP will
      check any problem patients may have during their recovery and provide or organize care for
      it. The GNP has a checklist of problems to address so that we can reliably reproduce our
      intervention in other patients. The GNP will work together with the patient's various doctors
      and caregivers, as well as a geriatric team. Some of the visits or the telephone calls maybe
      tape-recorded so that the research team can evaluate the information provided to the patient.
      We will record any complication patients might have from surgery.

      No matter which treatment group the patient is assigned to, at the end of a 4 weeks period,
      we will repeat the tests we did at the beginning to see how they change.
