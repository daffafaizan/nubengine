    
      CTA and PET Substudy:

      A subset of patients enrolled into the main CAIN3 study will undergo a CTA. At sites where
      both CTA and PET imaging modalities exist, patients will be asked to undergo both tests. The
      CTA and PET scans can be done separately on 2 imaging beds on different days or performed on
      the same imaging bed, resulting in a combined CTA and PET scan being done in one scheduled
      visit. All imaging will be done within 90 days after the follow up IVUS.

      The choice of radiotracer used (NaF or FDG) for PET imaging will be dependent upon site and
      availability on the day of the scan. A total of 120 patients will be enrolled in this
      substudy with approximately 50-60 undergoing CTA and PET.
