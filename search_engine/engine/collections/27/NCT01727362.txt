      the opportunity to get acupuncture in addition to conventional therapy to maintain quality of
      life and to reduce the side effects of the chemotherapy such as gastrointestinal disorders.
      In this randomized trial we aim to investigate the effectiveness of additional acupuncture
      compared to routine care in patients with breast cancer.
