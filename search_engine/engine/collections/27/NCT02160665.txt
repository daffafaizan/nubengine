      Tazarotene Cream, 0.05% in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Subjects will be randomly assigned
      in a 1:1:1 ratio to Test, Reference, or Vehicle.

      Subjects will be admitted into the study after informed consent has been obtained and all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met. At each visit, the same investigator (whenever
      possible) will grade the clinical signs of plaque psoriasis at the designated target lesion
      site using the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), an Investigator's Global Assessment
      (IGA) of disease severity will be performed (IGA scores range from 0 = none to 5 = very
      severe), and application site reactions (erythema, dryness, burning/stinging, erosion, edema,
      pain, and pruritus) will be assessed. In addition, the involved body surface area (BSA) will
      be determined at Visit 1 and Visit 4. Safety will be assessed by monitoring all adverse
      events (AEs) at each visit and a telephone contact at Day 7 (+ 4 days)
