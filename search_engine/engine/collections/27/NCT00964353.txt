      cost-effectiveness of strategies that use genetic testing in the management of
      anticoagulation among racially diverse hospitalized patients. The project has four specific
      aims.

      Aim 1: To contribute patients initiating therapy at the University of Chicago Medical Center
      (UCMC) and affiliated hospitals to a genetic registry of a racially diverse set of patients
      undergoing warfarin therapy.

      Aim 2: To perform a randomized trial to determine the efficacy, costs and cost-effectiveness
      of existing pharmacogenetic algorithms for the management of warfarin therapy among
      hospitalized patients of all races.

      Aim 3: To develop clinical pharmacogenetic algorithms for the management of warfarin therapy
      among hospitalized African American patients.

      Aim 4: To perform a randomized trial to determine and compare the efficacy, costs and
      cost-effectiveness of existing clinical and non-racially tailored pharmacogenetic algorithms
      to racially tailored pharmacogenetic algorithms for the management of warfarin therapy among
      hospitalized African American patients.
