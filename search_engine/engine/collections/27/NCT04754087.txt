      based on removal or intended removal of the study device and will be determined using Kaplan
      Meier method. The safety of the system will be assessed by monitoring the frequency and
      incidence of adverse events. Relation of the events to either implant or instrumentation
      should be specified.

      The secondary endpoints are the assessment of performance and clinical benefits by recording
      patient-reported clinical outcomes measures (PROMs) as well as radiographic outcomes (if
      available).
