      subcapsular, or a combination) were implanted unilaterally (in one eye only) or bilaterally
      (in both eyes) with the HMTIOL. A total of 7 study visits were planned, including a
      preoperative visit, operative visits for each eye, and 4 follow-up visits at 1 day, 1 week, 1
      month, and 3 months postoperative. The total duration of participation for each subject was
      up to 6 months, including the preoperative period (up to 3 months).
