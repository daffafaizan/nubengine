      Treatment sites are randomized to receive either hexylaminolaevulinate 0.2% or
      methylaminolaevulinate ( 16% MAL) as photosensitizers (0.25mm-thick layer). A web-based
      validated program (Research Randomizer) generated a randomized list to define the treatment
      sides. The randomization results were kept blinded from the investigators who conducted the
      follow-up visits, from the pathologist, and the patients. Pre-treatment procedures include
      application of sunscreen for 15 minutes and curettage of the treatment area. Illumination is
      performed using 2 hours daylight-exposure. Efficacy is assessed clinically, and
      histologically at 3 and 12 months by blinded observers. Pain during and after treatments and
      adverse reactions at one week are recorded.
