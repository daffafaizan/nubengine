      techniques is accelerating. Radiologists and other clinicians are being inundated with
      radiologic data. Computer aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) have the potential to improve
      patient care by increasing sensitivity of diagnostic tests, reducing false positives and
      improving physician efficiency. Computer aided detection and diagnosis have been under
      development for many years yet there is still much work to be done to move it from the bench
      to the bedside. The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate techniques for CAD
      using the existing radiologic data available in the Clinical Center's Department of
      Diagnostic Radiology. Such techniques include but are not limited to automated detection of
      melanoma, bone metastases and pulmonary emboli. The outcome of this study will be algorithms
      and software that accurately detect lesions on radiologic studies.
