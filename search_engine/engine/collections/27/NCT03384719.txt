      children. There is evidence to support that milk protein increases growth in children in both
      high and low-income countries. Therefore milk protein is often used in food aid for
      undernourished children in low-income countries. The study investigates if plant protein can
      partially replace milk protein without affecting growth promotion negatively. Plant protein
      could potentially reduce food aid costs and at the same time be a more sustainable protein
      source.

      The PROGRO study is a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial. The effect of consuming 35 g pure
      milk protein/day is compared to intake of 35 g milk and rapeseed protein/day (ratio 30:70 and
      54:46, respectively) in 7-8 year old healthy Danish children. The intervention period is 4
      weeks and measurements and blood sampling are performed at baseline, week 1 and week 4. A
      3-day weighed dietary intake is recorded before each visit. The primary outcome is
      Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).
