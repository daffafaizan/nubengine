      anthracyclines or anthracenediones. In addition, patients with relapsed disease, who have
      received prior maximum doses of anthracyclines, have tolerated high doses of pixantrone with
      minimal added cardiotoxicity. Pixantrone is currently being studied in a Phase III study in
      3rd line aggressive NHL.
