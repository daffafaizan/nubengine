    
      Primary Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of oral CLEAR therapy in patients with
      confirmed progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis.

      Hypothesis: The CLEAR regimen will improve the absolute FVC percent predicted in chronic
      pulmonary sarcoidosis participants by augmenting T cell responses through the normalization
      of p56Lck expression and IL-2 production.
