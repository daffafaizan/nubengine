      subjects once per month. One malaria-positive subject from among the 20 will be asked to
      donate 5cc of blood, also no more frequently than once per month. The blood will be placed in
      a water-jacketed heated membrane feeding device that will be positioned on top of a cage of
      mosquitoes. The mosquitoes are attracted to the warmth and drink the blood through the
      artificial skin-like membrane. The goal of the research is to study the infected mosquitoes.
      No studies will be carried out on the human subjects. The point of human subjects involvement
      is to obtain the naturally malaria-infected blood for feeding of mosquitoes. After blood
      feeding, the mosquitoes are held in an environmental chamber for one week, at which time they
      are dissected to count numbers of malaria parasites developing on the mosquito stomach wall.
      This number constitutes the quantitative phenotype, and we extract genomic DNA from the
      carcass for genetic marker typing, which constitutes the genotype. Genetic linkage analysis
      identifies markers near genes that control parasite number, thus resistance or susceptibility
      to parasite infection.
