      malignant mesothelioma treated with ecteinascidin 743. II. Determine the toxicity profile of
      this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships
      of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the duration of response, time to disease
      progression, 6-month progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and overall
      survival of patients treated with this drug. V. Assess the quality of life of these patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV over 3 hours on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses after achieving CR. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at the
      beginning of each course of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24
      months.
