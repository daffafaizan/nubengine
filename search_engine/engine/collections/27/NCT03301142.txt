      treatment of women with stress urinary incontinence. A randomized controlled clinical trial
      is proposed involving 40 women diagnosed with stress urinary incontinence randomized into two
      groups: 1) treatment with application of Erbium Laser: YAG 2940nm, SMOOTH mode, one session
      per month for three months (n=20); 2) treatment with kinesiotherapy for three months with
      supervision twice a week (n=20). At baseline assessment, patients shall undergo anamnesis,
      general physical and gynecological exam, assessments of the pelvic floor based on the
      modified Oxford scale and of the presence of prolapse using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse
      Quantification (POP-Q) system. The following exams shall also be performed: Type 1 urine,
      urine culture, urodynamic study and 1-hour Pad test. Participants shall complete both the
      King's Health Questionnaire and Incontinence Quality of Life Questionnaire (IQOL).
      Post-treatment, patients will be assessed during follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months by
      physical exam and application of the questionnaires. The Pad test will be re-administered at
      6 and 12 months. Data will be grouped and statistically assessed.
