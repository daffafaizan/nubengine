      due to repeated or aggressive curettages and/or endometritis. As a result, there is a loss of
      functional endometrium in multiple areas and the uterine cavity is obliterated by
      intrauterine adhesions, which results in amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, infertility and recurrent
      pregnancy loss. Transcervical resection of adhesion (TCRA) is the main treatment for
      Asherman's syndrome, so far the effect is usually poor in moderate to severe refractory
      cases.

      Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) are derived from human amniotic epithelium. hAECs
      retain the characteristics approximating to embryonic stem cells. Animal experiments have
      shown that the endometrial thickness and fertility of mice were significantly improved after
      intrauterine therapy with amniotic epithelial cells. To further explore the role of hAECs in
      Asherman's syndrome patients, this project plans to evaluate the safety of hAECs provided by
      Chongqing iCELL Biotechnology Co.,Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Shanghai iCELL Biotechnology
      Co.,Ltd., and find an effective treatment protocol.
