      combination regimen, oprozomib doses were to be escalated in sequential cohorts of 3
      participants with expansion to up to 6 participants if a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was
      observed in 1 of the first 3 participants. The doses of lenalidomide, cyclophosphamide, and
      dexamethasone were to remain fixed in all dose cohorts.

      The phase 2 portion of the study was to include up to 35 additional participants in each of
      the 2 combination regimens, treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oprozomib that
      was identified during the phase 1b portion of the study in order to better characterize
      safety and tolerability, and antimyeloma activity.

      This study was stopped by sponsor decision during the dose escalation in phase 1b prior to
      initiation of phase 2.
