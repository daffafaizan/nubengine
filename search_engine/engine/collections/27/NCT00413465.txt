      diabetes. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind the development of acute renal failure in
      connection with sepsis is not completely understood. One among many possible explanations is
      a change in renal hemodynamics. However, it is still largely unknown what happens to the
      renal plasma flow during human sepsis. In this study we give endotoxin injection (0,3 ng/kg)
      to type 2 diabetics and healthy controls as an experimental model of sepsis. Renal plasma
      flow and glomerular filtration rate are measured by DTPA-renography 1 day before before and
      1,25 and 6,5 hours after injection of endotoxin. Furthermore WBC,
      plasma-cytokines,VCAM-1/ICAM-1, endothelin-1, Thromboxane B2, angiotensin 2, renin and PAI-1
      are measured on an hourly basis up to 8 hours after endotoxin injection.
