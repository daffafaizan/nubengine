      "IMPRoving Expression of Skills and Strengths In Interviewing in a Virtual Environment"
      (IMPRESSIVE) which targets social competency skills needed for successful job interviewing.
      Specifically, 2 VR tools are utilized in the IMPRESSIVE intervention. The first tool is
      VR-Job Interview Training (VR-JIT), a VR program which offers the opportunity for repeated
      practice with a virtual human interviewer. Preliminary evidence suggests that the VR-JIT is
      successful in adults with ASD1 and schizophrenia14 in improving interview abilities. However,
      the efficacy of VR-JIT has not been evaluated in adolescents with ASD. This represents a
      significant void in our knowledge, as we do not know whether this program is effective for
      youth. In addition to VR-JIT, a newly developed VR tool is included in the currently proposed
      intervention: the Kessler Foundation STRength IDentification and Expression tool (VR-STRIDE).
      KF-STRIDE is focused on improving the ability to express personal strengths during the job
      interview, a skill that is not taught with VR-JIT. The proposed IMPRESSIVE intervention,
      which combines the learning of 2 critical abilities (social skills and strength
      identification), has never been examined in individuals with ASD. Thus, the current proposal
      will be the first to examine the efficacy of these 2 combined tools in this at-risk
      population.
