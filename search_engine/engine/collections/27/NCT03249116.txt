      anxiety, and (2) determine if the anxiolytic effect of social and physical interaction is
      moderated by level of pre-existing social anxiety. To achieve these aims, 75 adolescents (age
      13-17) will undergo a well-validated laboratory-based social evaluative stressor, the Trier
      Social Stress Task for Children, and be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) no
      interaction with a dog (control condition), 2) social interaction only (no physical
      interaction) with a therapy dog; or 3) social interaction plus physical interaction with a
      therapy dog. Using a multivariate approach, three levels of outcome data will be collected:
      a) self-reported experience (anxiety), b) autonomic physiology (heart rate), and c)
      behavioral performance (error rates on mental math task). In addition, the interactions will
      be videotaped and behavioral coding will be used to explore the specific social behaviors
      between the participant and the dog that may predict anxiety reduction (such as frequency or
      type of social referencing or physical contact).
