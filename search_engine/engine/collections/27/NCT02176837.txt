      admitted to the hospital and who meet entry criteria will be offered enrollment into the
      study. The patients will be enrolled promptly after detection of the presence of cerebral
      vasospasm. Subjects will receive sodium nitrite infusion.

      One dose cohort is planned, 64 nmol/min/kg sodium nitrite (0.1325 mg/hour/kg; 0.0442
      ml/hour/kg at a concentration of 3mg/ml).
