      when they exercise intensively. We also demonstrated that a single dose of Mestinon helped
      people make normal levels of growth hormone when they exercised in our laboratory. We wanted
      to know if 6 months of exercise with concurrent Mestinon therapy would make growth hormone
      (and related markers) normal and improve fibromyalgia symptoms.
