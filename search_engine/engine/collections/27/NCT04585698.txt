      just before starting their treatment and 1 month after (corresponding to the efficacy peak).
      Hot and cold stimulations will be delivered with the ATS probe from the Medoc Pathway on the
      forehead and on the hand (palmar face) to determine painful threshold to warm/cold stimuli. A
      blink reflex will be generated with a concentric electrode placed over the eyebrow and with
      active/earth electrodes linked to the EMG machine for the recording. For the nociceptive
      flexion reflex, a cutaneous stimulation will be applied on the arm and the response recorded
      on the corresponding muscles.
