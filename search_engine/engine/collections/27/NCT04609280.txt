      squamous cell carcinoma (p16+OPSCC) exhibit favorable overall survival (OS) rates of 70-100%
      at 3 years. These outcomes are dependent on disease burden and patient characteristics and
      independent of treatment modality. Significant treatment related side effects exist despite
      advances in radiotherapy (RT) technology, surgical techniques, and supportive care. In
      addition to common acute toxicities, the favorable OS of patients with p16+OPSCC potentially
      places them at increased risk for developing long-term treatment-induced side-effects.
      Therefore, it is important to establish novel management approaches that maintain excellent
      current clinical outcomes while effectively reducing acute and long-term side effects.

      One such approach of limiting RT-induced toxicity is to decrease the amount of normal tissue
      that receives radiation through judicious reduction of RT treatment volumes. Treatment of
      elective nodal volumes increases dose to numerous organs at risk (OARs). Patients with
      well-lateralized tonsil tumors and limited neck disease can effectively be treated with
      ipsilateral nodal radiotherapy. However, based on recent phase III trials, contralateral
      (C/L) elective nodal radiation is performed for the majority of patients with p16+OPSCC
      increasing acute and long-term toxicities. Therefore, judicious data-driven approaches for
      decreasing the number of elective ipsilateral and contralateral nodal levels treated is
      necessary to limit RT-induced side effects. This protocol tests the hypothesis that treating
      only the high-risk sub-volumes of levels II and III would be effective in maintaining
      regional control in the elective neck while decreasing xerostomia (dry mouth) and dysphagia
      (swallowing difficulties).
