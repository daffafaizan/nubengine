      industry in an attempt to reduce some of the risks involved in tobacco use (see Breland et
      al., 2002b). Evaluating the effects of these products is crucial to public health, as past
      industry-sponsored efforts at harm reduction (e.g., so-called "light" and "ultra-light"
      cigarettes) were not evaluated and failed to reduce carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine, and
      carcinogen exposure in smokers; these efforts thus failed to reduce the harms of smoking
      (Stratton et al., 2001). This study is part of an on-going, NIH-funded program of research to
      develop a science-based model that uses outcome measures relevant to evaluating current
      tobacco industry-sponsored smoking harm reduction efforts systematically and efficiently.
