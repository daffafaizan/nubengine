      glucose levels are measured by taking blood samples using a lancet. During the study, blood
      glucose levels will be increased by drinking a beverage containing sugar.

      Up to five visits to the NCRAR will be needed over a six-month period to complete the study.
      Each visit lasts either two or four hours, and will be scheduled at your convenience. You
      will be paid $20 for the first 2-hour screening visit and $50 for each 4-hour visit. You will
      be paid $30 if you are selected to participate in a 2-hour Attention Correlation Test that a
      sub-set of 10 participants will complete.
