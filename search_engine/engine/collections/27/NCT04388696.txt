      adolescent relationship abuse prevention program, Sisterhood 2.0, among African American high
      school-age females in a community-based setting. The Sisterhood 2.0 curriculum was adapted
      from Program M, created in 2006 by Promundo to address health and empowerment of young women
      aged 15-24. The curriculum engages young women in questioning rigid and non-equitable
      stereotypes about masculinity and femininity and how these rigid stereotypes affect their
      health and well-being. This study will pilot test, using a quasi-experimental design, the
      participant satisfaction with the program through measures of attendance and retention, and
      be compared to a job skills development curriculum. This study is significant because there
      are too few evidence-based sexual violence and adolescent relationship abuse prevention
      program in the U.S., none that are specifically tailored for African American adolescent
      females, and there are no evidence- based programs implemented in community settings that
      target both sexual violence and adolescent relationship abuse and adolescent sexual health.
