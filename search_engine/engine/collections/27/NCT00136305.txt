      of medication based on the frequency and intensity of symptoms. Written asthma action plans
      (AAP's) are commonly used to provide a set of instructions to help parents and children
      implement these complicated regimens. However, written AAP's require substantial literacy
      levels, so for younger children, low-literacy families, or non-English speaking families, a
      pictorial version of the AAP may be more understandable and useful. The study aims to
      validate a newly developed, fully pictorial AAP in terms of its relative impact on parent-
      and child-reported knowledge of the action plan, medication use, and parent- and
      child-reported satisfaction, when compared to a standard-care written AAP.
