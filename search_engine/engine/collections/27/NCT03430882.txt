      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of sapanisertib (TAK-228
      [MLN0128]) plus paclitaxel, when given with carboplatin, and to determine the optimal dose
      triplet, or maximum tolerated dose (MTD), in patients with advanced cancers refractory to
      standard therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical tumor response of this combination. II. To assess toxicity of this
      combination. III. To assess progression free survival. IV. To assess molecular signatures
      predictive of sensitivity and resistance.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-4, 9-11, and 16-18,
      paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive sapanisertib PO QD on
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
