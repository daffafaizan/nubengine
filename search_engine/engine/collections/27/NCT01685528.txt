      Based Primary Care (HBPC) Veterans. Content will be modular to meet the needs of both anxious
      and depressed participants. Modular skills-based treatment has been used successfully with a
      range of clinical problems (Chorpita et al., 2004; Henin et al., 2001; Wetherell et al.,
      2009, 2011), including our own group's work treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in
      primary care (Calleo et al., in press) and anxiety-depression in patients with chronic
      illness (Cully et al., 2010). To further support a patient-centered treatment approach,
      patients will have the opportunity to include R/S. Research points to the importance of R/S
      in coping with illness, with 50-90% of patients reporting using their belief systems to
      enhance coping skills (Koenig & Adams, 2008). Along with content modifications, delivery of
      treatment should complement the needs of HBPC Veterans. Providing one initial in-home
      session, followed by telephone contact for subsequent sessions, allows cost effectiveness to
      be taken into consideration; and greater numbers of rural HBPC patients will have access to
      the intervention.

      Treatment will involve approximately 6 to 8 weekly sessions lasting approximately 30-40
      minutes each. After the first in-person session, all sessions will be delivered via
      telephone. At least one booster call (15-20 minutes) will occur during the month following
      completion of active treatment. All participants will complete assessments at baseline, 8
      weeks, and 12 weeks.
