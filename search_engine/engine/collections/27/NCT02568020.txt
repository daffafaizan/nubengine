           and analyzed a computer-based nutritional evaluation with Dieta software.

        2. Biochemical data: blood samples will be collected at baseline and every 3 months of
           routine examination, such as blood routine, biochemistry, HbA1c, Serum IGF-1, CRP, will
           be measured. Homeostatic model assessment score (HOMA-IR) was recorded.

        3. Skeletal muscle assessment: the parameters of skeletal muscle will be assessed before
           and after dietary intervention for 12 months. Body weight, height, Body mass index,
           skeletal muscle mass will be measured by Body composition analyzer. Quadriceps strength
           will be assessed with a seated leg press exercise instrument (Keiser Sport, Fresno, CA,
           USA) using the five repetition maximum technique. Knee and hip extension power (rate of
           generating force) will be assessed with a validated leg power instrument (University
           ofNottingham Medical College, Nottingham, UK). Fatigability will be assessed with the
           same bilateral leg press exercise used in strength testing.
