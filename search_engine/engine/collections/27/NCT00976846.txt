      increased removal of ÃŸ2-Microglobulin with olHDF in post dilution mode together with a
      markedly increased removal of small molecules (urea, creatinine, phosphate). The loss of
      albumin will depend on the treatment modalities. However, the albumin permeability is
      tolerable over the whole range of total filtration rate selected and applied to the patients.

      Together with the albumin loss into the filtrate/dialysate a small amount of albuminbound
      substances is detectable.

      Parameters of micro-inflammation can be influenced by an increasing convective part of the
      treatment.
