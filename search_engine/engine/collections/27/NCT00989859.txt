      rate monitor. However, to measure oxygen saturation, a quantitative value of the strength at
      two wavelength regions (green and red) is required. It is also not known if the normal
      ambient light is spectrally appropriate to analyze the video signals for oxygenation. With
      the current prototype of our system, we can monitor heart rate reliably and estimate oxygen
      saturation in adults, using normal artificial light or daylight, entering through a window.
      Heart rate and oxygen saturation will be extracted from the plethysmographic signal off the
      cheek, forehead or hand while the respiration rate may be retrieved from the plethysmographic
      signal off the chest area.
