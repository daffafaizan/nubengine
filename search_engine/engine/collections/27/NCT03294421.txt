      randomized into two groups. In the first group, microsurgical tympanomastoidectomy will be
      performed; while combined technique will be performed in the other group. The combined
      technique improves the visualization of the middle ear canal and the mastoid. Herewith, the
      best visualization of the surgical site facilitates the full removal of the cholesteatoma. In
      addition to that, the combined technique is less invasive than the standard one, since less
      bone debridement is required to access the surgical site.

      The outcomes of the study will be evaluated through follow up medical appointments and exams.
      The patients will be followed by monthly medical appointments with otoscopic evaluations for
      diagnose of possible recurrence of the disease or residual cholesteatoma. Also, audiometry
      exams will be performed in the third, sixth and twelfth months. Image exams such as nuclear
      magnetic resonance may be performed at the end of this period to evaluate relapse of the
      disease if the otoscopic evaluation is inconclusive.
