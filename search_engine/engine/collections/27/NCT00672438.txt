      in humans displays substantial familial aggregation, and is, in fact, heritable. These
      studies will use a classical twin paradigm to determine the role of genetics and the
      environment in influencing analgesia and a range of other opioid effects.

      Specific Aims: (1) Determine the degree to which opioid analgesic responses show familial
      aggregation and make preliminary estimates of heritability using both a heat and cold pressor
      pain model, and (2) determine the degree to which non-analgesic opioid responses show
      familial aggregation and make preliminary estimates of heritability. Side effects such as
      sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, and pruritus, as well as the positive affective
      response, a measure of abuse potential, will be monitored. Monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic
      (DZ) twin pairs (125 total pairs) will be tested under controlled pain laboratory conditions
      for their responses to opioid infusion using the complementary pain models while monitoring
      side effects and additional psychometric indices of mood, sleep, and abuse potential. The
      selected models provide unique mechanistic information because they involve different
      peripheral and/or central pain pathways. DNA samples will be collected for zygosity testing
      and banked for future studies.
