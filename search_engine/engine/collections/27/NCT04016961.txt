      at significant risk for long term functional impairment, highlighting the importance of
      maximizing the effectiveness and utilization of inpatient rehabilitation therapies. The
      proposed study seeks to explore the value of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) during inpatient
      rehabilitation following pediatric ABI. Investigators will employ a within subjects
      cross-over trial; all participants will have a volunteer dog involved in 50% of their
      physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) sessions over a 2-week study period. AAT
      will consist of integration of a dog from the hospital volunteer dog program in PT and OT
      sessions, while the non-AAT condition will be treatment as usual (TAU) as identified by the
      patients' treatment team. Information regarding patient engagement/participation in therapy,
      affect, and physiological variables will be collected during each session. Session notes will
      also be coded for additional qualitative information. Qualitative feedback from patients and
      families, therapists, medical teams, and dog handlers will also be collected throughout the
      project to examine feasibility and satisfaction with the intervention as well as potential
      barriers and areas for improvement. Investigators will 1) examine the effect of AAT on level
      of patient participation and patient affect during PT and OT sessions, 2) Explore the effect
      of AAT on functional outcomes using a historic cohort comparison group, and 3) explore the
      physiological response of patients, and examine a number of variables (injury type/severity,
      child sex and anthropomorphism, therapist factors, and dog handler factors) to begin to
      determine which patients are most likely to benefit from AAT during inpatient rehabilitation
      for ABI.
