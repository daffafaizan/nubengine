      decompensation and improves quality of life in indicated patients. However, many do not
      benefit due to failure to deliver the left ventricular (LV) lead via coronary sinus (5-10%)
      or lack of symptomatic improvement (30-40%).

      The purpose of the ALSYNC Study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of LV endocardial
      (LVE) pacing using a Model 3830 lead implanted by a novel pectoral atrial transseptal lead
      delivery system.
