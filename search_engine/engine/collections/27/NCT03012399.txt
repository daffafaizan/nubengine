      I. Determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
      hypnosedation (HS) during breast cancer surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the preliminary efficacy of HS with local anesthesia versus (vs) opioid based
      general anesthesia (GA) on reducing self-reported anxiety, pain, nausea, vomiting,
      cancer-related symptoms, and surgical complication rates.

      II. Preliminarily evaluate changes in immune markers (natural killer cell function,
      cytokines, and resolution of inflammatory response markers) and endocrine function
      (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol).

      III. Preliminarily identify changes in neurological activity as assessed through
      electroencephalogram (EEG) activity.

      IV. Preliminarily evaluate the group differences in medical costs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo hypnosedation performed by a mind-body specialist before surgery
      begins and continuing until after surgery is complete.

      GROUP II: Patients speak to a mind-body specialist before surgery and prior to receiving
      general anesthesia.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14.
