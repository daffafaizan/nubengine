      HER-2 overexpressing advanced breast cancer. The end-points will include the comparison of an
      array of histologic and molecular markers from sequential core biopsies of primary breast
      cancers of patients receiving Herceptin.

      The other aim of this study would be to determine clinical response to therapy with Herceptin
      and Taxotere.
