      a kidney graft. The disease processes behind graft dysfunction are unclear. However, chronic
      kidney graft dysfunction is likely to be caused by certain definable factors. Such factors
      may include collagens III and IV, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, T and B cell surface
      markers, cell cycle proteins, fibronectin, and laminin. Determining what disease processes
      and which specific factors are most responsible for kidney graft dysfunction may help in
      designing future interventional trials for kidney transplant patients. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether clinical, laboratory, and histologic studies at the time of
      initial graft dysfunction will clarify the processes and factors that lead to deterioration
      and loss of a kidney graft. This is an observational study that will enroll participants who
      have recently received kidney transplants (prospective cohort) and participants who have had
      kidney transplants for a longer period of time and are now experiencing kidney graft
      dysfunction (retrospective cohort).

      The duration of this trial may differ between participants, depending on when deterioration
      of kidney graft function occurs. Participants will be followed until graft loss or death.
      There are no exclusive study visits associated with this study. Study data are gathered from
      routine laboratory follow-up tests completed at the participant's local medical center and
      from information obtained at the time of kidney biopsy. Participants may need to undergo a
      kidney biopsy as clinically indicated. At the time of biopsy, participants will also undergo
      urine and blood collection.
