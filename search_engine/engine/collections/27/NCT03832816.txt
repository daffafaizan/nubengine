      Unit (BPRU). In this between-subjects study, participants will be randomized to complete 1 of
      8 possible acute drug administration sessions in which participants will administer THC
      alone, CBD alone, THC and CBD together, or placebo. Following drug administration,
      participants will complete a performance session and complete a battery of questionnaires
      assessing subjective drug effects, mood, affect, and mental state. Vital signs and hormone
      levels will also be assessed before and after drug administration. The study will help the
      investigators understand the individual and interactive effects of THC and CBD, the two most
      common cannabis constituents.
