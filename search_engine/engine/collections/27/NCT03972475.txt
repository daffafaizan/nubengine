      organ dysfunction in the ICU. However, the risks of giving patients too much fluids resulting
      in fluid has been gaining increased focus during recent years. Numerous studies regarding the
      amount of resuscitation fluid given to ICU patients have been performed, as well as
      investigations regarding factors that trigger the decision to deliver a fluid challenge to
      the patients. Likewise, multiple studies reveal that a more restrictive use of resuscitation
      fluids often lead to a better outcome for our patients.

      However, data regarding the amount of maintenance fluids and the effect of maintenance fluids
      on fluid balance and consequently outcome remain sparse. One major difficulty is that there
      is no universal definition of the term maintenance fluid. Some researchers include all fluids
      that is not considered resuscitation fluids, i.e. fluids given to administer drugs, to keep
      peripheral and central venous catheters functioning, administration of basal fluid needs and
      nutrition, while others exclude fluids covering basal needs and nutrition from the
      definition.
