      recurrent retinal detachment in patients with or at high risk for developing PVR. This is a
      prospective study to evaluate a low dose of oral isotretinoin in this regard. There are two
      arms to the study: 1) eyes with recurrent retinal detachment due to existing PVR, and 2) eyes
      with primary detachment and features associated with a high risk of PVR formation. Eligible
      and willing patients will receive a 12-week course of isotretinoin, and will be followed for
      retinal attachment rate, and PVR and/or ERM (epiretinal membrane) formation.
