      I. Safety of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab-ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide
      (R-ICE).

      II. Establishment of maximum tolerated dose of ibrutinib with R-ICE.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of ibrutinib in combination with R-ICE. II. Clinical response
      rate of ibrutinib+R-ICE.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ibrutinib.

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, rituximab intravenously
      (IV) on day 1, ifosfamide IV on day 3, carboplatin intravenously piggy back (IVPB) on day 3,
      and etoposide IVPB on days 2-4. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 52 weeks.
