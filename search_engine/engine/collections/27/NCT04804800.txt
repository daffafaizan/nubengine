      distortions. Patients perceive themselves to be bigger than they really are. Body distortions
      are responsible for anorexic behavior reinforcing loops. It is then necessary to target this
      behavior and develop appropriate therapies taking into account the perceptual (implicit) and
      conceptual (explicit) phenomenon of body representations.

      The current treatment programs which are recommended by the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) in
      France focus on the somatic, nutritional, individual and family psychological aspects. These
      recommendations hardly mention the bodily distortion phenomenon which frequently leads
      patients to relapse into the disease.

      The 3D body scanner enables to get awareness of the body through visual feedback allowing the
      patient to get a reassuring overview of her weight development.

      This projects aims to combine virtual visual impulses and multisensory recalibration (touch,
      proprioception, vestibular sensations) in order to compare the body distortions evolution in
      anorexic patients with or without a multimodal care program including Virtual Reality from
      its own body scan coupled or not to a multisensory remediation.
