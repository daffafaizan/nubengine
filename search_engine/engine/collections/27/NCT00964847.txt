    
      The study is a non-blinded, randomized controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of
      24 weeks of a structured yoga exercise program (YP) versus a blood pressure education and
      walking program (BPEP) versus the combined intervention on reducing mild to moderate high
      blood pressure in adults with pre-hypertension or stage 1 hypertension. This will be done
      through a single center trial using a parallel design. All potential subjects will be
      screened first by telephone and then by 2 outpatient visits at the Clinical and Translational
      Research Center (CTRC) at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Eligible subjects
      will then make 3 visits to the CTRC where they will be admitted overnight to have
      non-invasive 24-hour recordings of BP, as well as have periodic blood, urine and saliva
      collections. The entire study duration is 28 weeks (24 weeks post-randomization) and includes
      a total of 7 evaluation visits (including 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging visits) and
      a termination visit. Subjects will be randomized to YP, BPEP or the combined intervention of
      YP and BPEP.
