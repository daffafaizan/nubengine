    
      The driving exercises to be used are based upon standard Veterans Affairs-based driver
      assessments which have a well-established safety record and have been applied to a wide-range
      of medically-related and post-deployment driving issues.

      Specifically, the driving exercises will embed a test-intervene-test session plan within a
      structured hierarchy of four progressively more challenging civilian driving tasks
      administered on successive weeks. Participants will drive local roads and highways familiar
      to Veterans Affairs - Palo Alto Health Care System Certified Driving Rehabilitation
      Specialists (CDRS). These courses have known characteristics as regards civilian driving
      challenges and OEF/OIF-relevant "trigger" stimuli. Graduation from one course to the next
      will take place only with permission from the CDRS who has accompanied the participant on the
      prior exercise. Based upon their self-reports of driving-related distress, we expect such
      distress to arise during the driving exercises. At such times, participants will be
      instructed to park in the next available safe parking location. They will be induced to
      rapidly achieve reduced autonomic arousal through use of a graphics-rich biofeedback
      procedure and simultaneously engage in the generation and rehearsal of cognitive reappraisal
      scripts under the coaching of project therapist also in the vehicle. These individualized
      procedures are expected to quickly lower emotional reactivity to subjectively adverse driving
      events and conditions. The participant will then drive the course a second time. Each session
      will finish with a graphical comparison of pre- and post-intervention vehicle and control
      surface movement parameters, visual attentional control, autonomic arousal and subjective
      driving distress.
