      noxious stimulus which results in a severe hemodynamic pressor response. Many strategies have
      been reported to blunt this undesirable pressor effect. This prospective, double blind, and
      randomized study is the first to evaluate the effect of MgSo4 on attenuation of hemodynamic
      pressor activity after head clamp application during craniotomies.

      Methods: This randomized, double blind, and prospective study was done in Neurosurgical
      department at ElSahel Teaching Hospital in Cairo from February 2016 till august 2017. All
      adult patients aged from 18 to 60 years of both genders, ASA physical status I and II
      scheduled for craniotomies were assessed to enter this study. Seventy one patients were
      assessed preoperatively, sixty of them were enrolled and assigned in two groups (n=30 each).
      Group M received 50 mg/kg MgSo4 in 100 ml 0.9 sodium Chloride 15 minutes prior to anesthesia
      induction over 15 minutes. Group S received 100ml 0.9% Sodium Chloride over the same period
      with the same rate.Mean HR was recorded as a primary outcome , meanwhile; MAP and the need
      for a bolus dose of fentanyl was considered a secondary outcome.
