      Specific Aim 1: Measure change in weight in adults with CF related wasting following GH
      therapy.

      1.1) Monitor weight gained or loss from baseline. 1.2) Assess changes in fat free mass from
      baseline by bioelectrical impedence analysis.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate overall quality of life (QOL) in adults with CF related wasting
      treated with GH therapy.

      2.1) Perform CF disease-specific and general QOL analysis via CF QOL questionnaires.

      2.2) Monitor compliance with therapy via subject report.

      Specific Aim 3: Monitor impact of GH therapy in relation to CF related diabetes onset or
      control.

      3.1) Measure impact on insulin sensitivity in non-diabetes subjects 3.2) Observe change in
      exogenous insulin requirements and glycemic control in subjects with diabetes.

      Specific Aim 4: Quantify impact of anabolic therapy on manifestations of underlying diagnosis
      associated with CF.

      4.1) Observe changes in lung function from baseline during GH therapy. 4.2) Determine changes
      in overall muscle strength via hand grip and six minute walk.

      4.3) Evaluate changes in serum markers.
