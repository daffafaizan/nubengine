      the association of thyroid hormone level with melasma severity.

      This study aims to find the difference in the levels of thyroid hormone in varying severity
      of melasma.

      This was a descriptive-analytic study used a cross-sectional method that was performed in
      2019 at two different dermatology and venerology clinics in Indonesia, Cipto Mangunkusumo
      Hospital Jakarta and Gatot Subroto Army Hospital Jakarta.

      Forty eight patients participated in this study, 50% diagnosed with mild melasma and 50% with
      moderate-severe melasma. Subjects are chosen consecutively based on mMASI and Janus II
      measurement. The level of serum FT4 and TSH were then measured in both groups of the
      patients. The data is tabulated and a comparative analysis of serum FT4 and TSH levels with
      mild and moderate-severe melasma is done. In addition, this study also analyzes the level of
      serum FT4 and TSH with the result of Janus II facial analysis system scoring. The same method
      of analysis was done to know the association between mMASI and examination by using Janus II
      facial analysis system.

      This study aims to find the difference in the levels of thyroid hormone in varying severity
      of melasma.
