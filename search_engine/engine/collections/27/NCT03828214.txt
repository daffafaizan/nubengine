      short of achieving desirable walking outcomes for most people who experience stroke. Robotic
      methods to assist walking, such as the Honda Walking Assist Device (HWA) Robot from Honda R &
      D Americas Inc., are being explored as a means of improving the recovery of walking post
      stroke. Prior to examining the effectiveness of exoskeletal robots for walking recovery it is
      important to understand their effect on kinematic and muscle responses during walking.
      Kinematic and muscle responses at the hip during walking with the HWA were recently
      described.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of walking with the HWA on body segments
      remote from the hip. These segments include knee, ankle, trunk and arm. The non-invasive
      measures used will include: walking kinematics (measurement of joint angles using cameras),
      muscle activity (Electromyography), ground reaction forces (detected by a force plate in the
      floor) and spatiotemporal characteristics (such as walking speed). Measures will be collected
      under three conditions: 1) walking at self-selected pace (control), 2) walking at
      self-selected pace with the HWA (4 Newton-meter assist mode for hip flexion and extension),
      3) walking immediately following HWA use (aftereffect).
