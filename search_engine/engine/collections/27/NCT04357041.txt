      those who are following the shelter- in- place order due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Demographic data of individuals participating in the study will be recorded. During this
      12-month protocol, participants will be contacted through email to complete online
      questionnaires on weekly basis for 8 weeks, and then once every 4 weeks until the end of the
      study. Subjects will record their one-day food intake, physical activity, sleep, and stress
      and anxiety level, which takes ~1 hour to complete.

      Subjects will be recruited through our CNRC databases of individuals who come to our clinic
      in the past 1 year, online advertisement, and word of mouth. A phone and/or email will be
      administered to ensure their eligibility using our standard tools and protocols. People who
      are willing and able to participate and meet the basic screening eligibility will be
      contacted through email for informed consent and the continuing of the study.
