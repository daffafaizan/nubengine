    
      Our primary objective is to determine, in obese and overweight children aged 10 to 18 years
      with vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL), the efficacy of
      enhanced vitamin D3 supplementation in improving vascular endothelial function, arterial
      stiffness, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome risk status; and to assess whether
      these effects are dose-dependent. As a secondary objective, we will examine the vitamin D
      supplementation-induced effect on adipokines and inflammatory markers relevant to CVD risk.
      In a double-masked, controlled trial, we will randomize 252 eligible children to receive
      either 600 IU (conventional supplementation), or 1000 IU or 2000 IU (enhanced
      supplementation) of vitamin D3 daily for 6 months.

      In terms of reporting of results, the following pre-specified outcomes are included in the
      primary manuscript (PubMed PMID:31950134 -- see Reference section for citation details)

        1. Waist Circumference

        2. Serum High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol

        3. Serum Triglycerides

        4. Inflammatory markers (Plasma TNF-alpha, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and IL-6)

        5. Adiopkines (Plasma Leptin and Adiponectin)

      Plasma nitric oxide metabolites were not measured.
