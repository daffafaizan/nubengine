      NIRSS are continuously monitored.

      The patients are in semi seated (30Â°) position. Once a day they are in supine (0Â°) for 30
      minutes. We record every parameters before and at the end of this supine period.

      After time domain and frequency domain signal processing, this parameters are compared to
      deduct clinical relevant conclusions.
