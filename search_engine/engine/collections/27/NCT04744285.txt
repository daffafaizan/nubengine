    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess how adding messaging to cigarette packages about filter vents and filters
      influences respondents awareness of filter ventilation, beliefs about the function of filter
      vents and filters, smoking behavior, ratings of cigarette satisfaction, smoking topography,
      exposure to nicotine and carbon monoxide, perceptions about the risk of smoking, and
      intention to stop smoking.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 conditions.

      CONDITION I: Participants receive regular package cigarettes for 2 weeks. Participants attend
      3 video sessions over 0.5 hour each at baseline, 1, and 2 weeks respectively for data
      collection.

      CONDITION II: Participants receive cigarettes with neutral message "Nothing about this
      product's color or name means that it will protect a smoker from the health risks of smoking"
      on package for 2 weeks. Participants attend 3 video sessions over 0.5 hour each at baseline,
      1, and 2 weeks respectively for data collection.

      CONDITION III: Participants receive cigarettes with compensation message "This product has a
      ventilated filter. Filter vents increase how deeply a smoker inhales without them knowing,
      which can increase the health risks of smoking" on package for 2 weeks. Participants attend 3
      video sessions over 0.5 hour each at baseline, 1, and 2 weeks respectively for data
      collection.

      CONDITION IV: Participants receive cigarettes with blocking message "This product has a
      ventilated filter. Be sure not to block the vent holes with your fingers or lips, which can
      increase the health risks of smoking" for 2 weeks. Participants attend 3 video sessions over
      0.5 hour each at baseline, 1, and 2 weeks respectively for data collection.
