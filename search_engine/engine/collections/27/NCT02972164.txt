        1. Adapt and pilot a school-based intervention that combines behavioral and cognitive
           approaches to promote healthy lifestyle among 9-12 year old children in select Qatari
           schools in the first year;

        2. Integrate behavioral economics and cognitive behavioral therapy (MINDSPACE) in a
           multi-cohort prevention/intervention study targeting at risk Qatari school children at
           the vulnerable age range of 9-12;

        3. Select and use technological tools for enhanced outcomes and adoption of the
           intervention nationally;

        4. Package study findings into a lifestyle change intervention for national implementation
           in collaboration with Hamad Medical Corporation and the Supreme Education Council.

      Data from this project could provide the basis for a national program to stem the rise of
      obesity in Qatar through lifestyle changes and reduce related health conditions.
