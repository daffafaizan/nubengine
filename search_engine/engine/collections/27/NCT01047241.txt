      pharmacological interventions. Pediatric formulations that permit accurate dosing, are
      accepted by children and a have a rapid onset of analgesia are lacking. The objectives were
      to investigate a pediatric formulation of intranasal sufentanil 0.5 mcg/kg and ketamine 0.5
      mg/kg for procedural pain and to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. Fifty
      children (â‰¥10 kg) scheduled for a painful procedure were included in this prospective
      nonrandomized open-label clinical trial. Thirteen of these children had central venous access
      for drug assay sampling; enabling a compartmental PK analysis using nonlinear mixed-effects
      models. Pain intensity before and during the procedure was measured using age-appropriate
      pain scales. Heart rate, oxygen saturation and sedation were recorded.
