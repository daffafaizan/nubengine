    
      This is a randomized, multi-center, parallel-group Phase I study with a primary objective to
      evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD) of Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) after a single
      subcutaneous (SC) injection of 150mg/mL or 300mg/2mL Depo-Provera CI in the abdomen of women
      of reproductive age with a confirmed ovulatory baseline cycle.

      Secondary study objectives are:

        -  To evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MPA after a single SC injection of
           150mg/mL or 300mg/2mL of Depo-Provera CI to two injections of Depo-subQ 104 administered
           3 months apart

        -  To evaluate the relationship between serum MPA concentration and suppression of
           ovulation

        -  To evaluate and compare the safety, tolerability and acceptability of a SC injection of
           DMPA of different frequencies, doses and volumes
