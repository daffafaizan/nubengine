      of Stage 2/3 AKI and are followed in a focused post-AKI clinic. Patients will be randomize to
      either; a. LPD-K diet containing 0.6 g protein/kg per day, phosphorus 5-10 mg/kg/day,
      Ketosteril 1 capsule per 5 kg body weight/day divided over three doses (max 8 capsules per
      dose) or b. ad lib diet. Ketosteril should be takes daily during meals and the tablets must
      not be chewed. Ingestion during meals facilitates proper absorption and the metabolisation
      into the corresponding amino acids.

      After the initial assessment, those randomized to LPD-K will be on this diet for a maximum of
      90 days. Additional interventions will include dietary counselling and questionnaire in both
      groups. We would aim for maintaining serum bicarbonate levels â‰¥ 22meq/L in both groups.

      Evaluation of renal function will be performed using blood and urine tests. In addition,
      specimens will be collected in a bio-repository, and tested for biomarkers of renal
      structural damage. Comprehensive nutritional assessment will be performed by a dietitian,
      along with bioelectrical impedance measurements, blood and urine tests. 24-hour urine urea
      nitrogen and food records will be used to estimate the protein intake of each individual.
      Quality of well-being will be assessed using a standardized tool such as Euro Quality of Life
      (EQ-5D), Charlson Index, and Short Form 8 (SF8) or equivalent. Relevant clinical events
      (adherence to follow-up, death, hospitalization, renal recovery, repeat AKI episodes) will be
      tracked throughout the study.
