      becomes difficult because the head must be positioned in the neutral position. Most of all,
      with a semi-rigid neck collar that maintains the neutral position of the head and neck,
      movement is limited and the mouth is not well-opened make the environment of tracheal
      intubation worse, which result in hypoxia or throat complications related to general
      anesthesia. Fortunately, it is possible that the development of video laryngoscope assists
      tracheal intubation easier for patients who have the limited movement of the cervical spine.
      However, the preferred intubation style and instrument selection for each operator are
      varied; the established method is required. In the case of tracheal intubation using a video
      laryngoscope, both techniques, one is 'conventional technique' in which intubation is
      performed by placing the blade tip on the vallecula and the other is 'sliding technique'
      performed by sliding the blade under the epiglottis, are commonly conducted by
      anesthesiologists. Investigators would like to compare if the sliding technique can improve
      the condition of tracheal intubation in patients wearing semi-rigid neck collars in cervical
      spine surgery.
