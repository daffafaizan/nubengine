    
      We are proposing a randomized trial of Peg-Intron 0.5mcg per kg weekly versus colchicine
      0.6mg bid in prior non-responders to Interferon, Rebetron, PegIntron, or PegIntron &
      Ribavirin or any third agent such as Pegasys, CellCept, Amantadine with advanced
      fibrosis/cirrhosis. The specific aims of this proposal are to evaluate the role of long term
      Peg-Intron therapy on the natural history of patients with advanced chronic HCV infection
      with a primary focus on prevention of hepatic decompensation, progression of fibrosis and
      hepatoma development.

      The study design will focus on 3 monthly clinical evaluation for decompensation of liver
      function, rigorous clinical screening for development of hepatocellular cancer and liver
      biopsies for determination of progression of liver fibrosis every second year.
