      an antioxidative phenol, has been demonstrated that mitigate the brain I/R in rats.

      As for sevoflurane, some investigation indicated that sevoflurane is able to reduce oxidative
      stress in cell(except neuronal cell lines ) and rodent models, but the antioxidant effect did
      not found in human minor incision surgeries, furthermore, oxidative stress was raised in the
      major surgeries including orthopedic surgeries, hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and
      thoracotomy
