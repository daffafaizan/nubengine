      human papillomavirus(HR-HPV) is the definite cause,especially the infection of human
      papillomavirus 16/human papillomavirus 18(HPV16/HPV18). Some researches indicate the virus
      load may relate the extent of the disease, but the sample capacity is not enough to receive a
      conclusive conclusion. And a specific quantity or a range of virus load which closely relates
      to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2(CIN2) or worse is not studied. The aim of the study
      is to prove the association between the virus load and development of cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasias by detecting 14 types HR-HPV, and find the specific quantitative
      value or the range to assist physician to diagnose.

      A detect reagent named Dalton hybrid 3(DH3) is used in the study, the mechanism of which is
      HPV DNA hybrid capture technology, the experimental process include seven steps,
      denaturation, hybridization, the formation of DNA-RNA heterozygote, capture, detect, rinse
      panel, read data.

      Study design: The organizations of the study contain ten hospitals in Liaoning province in
      China,patients accord with inclusion criteria(N=10000) sign informed consent and fill out a
      information form. Gynecologist collect cervical cell with sampling instrument. Detecting the
      virus load of HPV16/HPV18 and other 12 types HR-HPV, the positive result is cut-off
      â‰¥1.0pg/ml, HPV16/HPV18(+) need colposcopy. The abnormal result of colposcopy requires biopsy,
      the participant who has abnormal result of biopsy need operative treatment. Follow-up
      observation of all participants lasting 5 years are required.
