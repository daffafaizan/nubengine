      48 hours. These patients will be screened for predetermined exclusion criteria. Eligible
      patients will have their IVCCI measured and baseline peak and plateau pressures noted. For
      those patients meeting a second set of criteria, a common ventilator maneuver will be
      preformed. The positive end-expiratory pressure will be increased by 5-10 cm/H20 pressure.
      This procedure will be aborted if ANY safety criteria are exceeded. During the interval, the
      IVCCI will be re-measured, the ventilator settings will be recorded, and the ventilator will
      be return to the initial settings. Since changes of these same magnitude are made daily in
      clinical practice, the risks to the patients in this study will be minimal and no more than
      that experienced in the course of usual care.
