      rise, and it is a common malignant tumor that harms the health of Chinese residents. Now NCCN
      guidelines recommend targeted drugs for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer mainly
      including cetuximab and panizumab whic targeting EGFR , as well as the bevacizumab and arber
      regofini, etc which targeing anti-angiogenic.Cetuximab and panizumab are only effective in
      patients with RAS wild type.

      Previous studies have shown that In patients with synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer,
      RAS status is highly consistent in primary focus and metastasis, so NCCN guidelines recommend
      RAS testing of primary or metastatic tissue is feasible .However, there are also some reports
      that the difference of RAS status between primary and metastatic lesions was up to 22%.In
      additiont,there are few studies on whether the gene profile of the metastatic lesion is the
      same as that of the primary lesion in patients with postoperative heterogeneous metastasis in
      patients with stage III colorectal cancer.

      Therefore, it has important clinical significance to compare the difference of gene profile
      between metastatic lesion and primary lesion in patients with postoperative metastasis of
      stage III colorectal cancer.
