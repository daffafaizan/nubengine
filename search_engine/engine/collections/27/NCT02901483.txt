    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase 1b (dose escalation portion): To assess the safety profile and determine the Dose
           Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and to define the recommended volumes (doses) of PEP503.

        -  Phase 2 (expansion portion): To evaluate the anti-tumor activity in terms of the rate of
           locoregional control at one year and to evaluate the safety profile.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Phase 1b: To characterize the body kinetic profile of PEP503.

        -  Phase 2: Objective tumor response, progression free survival rate at 1 year and
           pathological response (pR).

      The target population is composed by patients who have pathologically confirmed squamous cell
      carcinoma of oral cavity with disease clinically staged as T4b who are not candidates for
      surgical resection or T3-4 who decline surgery or medical inoperable, or oropharynx,
      hypopharynx, or larynx with disease clinical staged as T3-4, without metastasis disease. ECOG
      performance status 0 or 1 and adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function.

      Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) - The DLTs are related to PEP503, injection procedure, or
      concurrent chemo radiation therapy and occur in the DLT evaluation period. The DLT evaluation
      period starts from the intratumor injection of PEP503 to 4 weeks after the completion of
      radiation treatment.

      There are 6 levels (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4, Level 3a and Level 5) in this phase
      1b study. PEP503 will be given at the fixed concentration of 53.3g/L. The starting volume of
      PEP503 to be injected is 5% (Level 1) of the tumor volume confirmed by MRI.
