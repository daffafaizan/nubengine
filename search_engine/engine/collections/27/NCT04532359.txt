      also in patients presenting cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract.

      Systems for measuring implant stability using resonance frequency analysis exist and are used
      clinically by some practitioners, such as the OstellÂ® system from W&H. These systems make it
      possible to determine the osseointegration of the implant, and thus the appropriate time to
      insert the implant, by comparing the value obtained with average values.

      Implant survival rates are lower for implants placed in irradiated bone, with an implant
      stability quotient value identical to implant placement but lower after osseointegration.
      Only one study shows implant stability quotient values> 60 with a success rate of 100% at 41
      months on implants placed in patients having received radiotherapy. However, no clinical
      study has investigated the kinetics of osseointegration and the stability of implants placed
      on a microanastomosis fibula flap as part of aesthetic and prosthetic reconstruction after
      cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract.
