    
      Approximately 36 healthy subject volunteers will be exposed to seven test products (study
      treatment gel and six control products) simultaneously for 21 consecutive days. The seven
      test products will be applied using a 7-channel patch assembly that will be affixed to the
      infrascapular areas of the back of each subject for approximately 24 hours daily.

      The subject will return to the clinic to undergo a skin irritation assessment at
      approximately 24 hours after the time the patch assembly was initially affixed.

      During the visits, doctors or trained staff members will examine the signs of irritation (if
      any) of the skin where the test products are applied. The skin irritation assessment will
      primarily characterize the test products individually in terms of symptomatology using a
      7-point categorical scale ranging from 1 (glazing and/or wrinkling) to 7 (erosion and/or
      vesiculation).
