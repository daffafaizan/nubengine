           the heart muscle. Rapid reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium using percutaneous
           coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard treatment for acute myocardial infarction
           (MI) to rescue the ischemic myocardium and reduce infarction size.

        -  There are two types of stents:

             1. Drug-eluting stent which achieving local drug delivery to the injured blood vessel
                at the time of intervention, a drug is released from a polymer coating or loaded
                directly onto the stent (2). This is the best one.

             2. Bare metal stent is the old one and not effective as DES in reducing vascular
                restenosis by suppressing smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation.

        -  The management of long coronary lesions by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has
           become increasingly important because of the rising incidence of long or complex lesions
           in aging populations (3) Stent length has been considered as an important predictor of
           adverse events after PCI. The exact impact of lesion length on the short- and long-term
           clinical outcomes of DES implantations is not clear yet.

        -  Myocardial necrosis complicates one-third of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
           and may adversely affect the outcome(4)
