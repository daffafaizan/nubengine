      attending an outpatient clinic at St. James's Hospital. This will be accomplished by
      ascertaining the cardiopulmonary fitness, physical activity, and muscle strength and
      endurance of this population.

      Secondary objectives of this study will be to explore the relationship between physical
      performance indices and sleep quality, functional ability and quality of life in this
      population.
