      of cardiovascular events, including ischemic heart disease and stroke. In 2016, the U.S.
      Preventive Services Task Force recommended initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary
      prevention of cardiovascular diseases and colorectal cancer in adult aged 50 to 59 years who
      have a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease risk, are not at increased risk of
      bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose
      aspirin daily for at least 10 years. In addition, a meta-analysis reported that long-term
      aspirin use was associated with reduced the risk of gastrointestinal cancers including
      colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and gastric cancer.However, most studies that reported
      the cancer prevention effect of long-term aspirin use were conducted as the secondary
      analysis or subgroup analysis of primary studies investigating the aspirin use for
      cardiovascular disease prevention. Thus, there is a limitation that appropriate sample sizes
      and follow-up periods for the cancer prevention effect of aspirin were not considered. In
      2018, we reported that H. pylori treatment reduced the development of metachronous gastric
      cancer after endoscopic resection in early gastric cancer patients. However, metachronous
      gastric cancer could develop after successful H. pylori eradication with an annual incidence
      of 1%-3%. Therefore, we designed a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial to evaluate whether long-term low-dose (100 mg) aspirin uses prevents gastric cancer in
      early gastric cancer patients without H. pylori infection.
