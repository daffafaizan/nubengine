           calculating placental volume and measuring vascular indices, has created an excellent
           opportunity to study early changes in the uteroplacental circulation space, which
           includes the maternal spiral arteries and the intervillous space. This technology may
           allow a more direct evaluation of the abnormal placentation process thought to herald
           the development of preeclampsia.

        -  The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of placental volume and 3D vascular
           indices as reliable predictors of early preeclampsia in comparison to uterine artery
           Doppler
