    
      This is a single blind, randomized, prospective study comparing SURGICEL Powder with SURGICEL
      Original (control arm) as an adjunct to achieve hemostasis in the control of capillary,
      venous, and small arterial hemorrhage when ligation or other conventional methods of control
      are impractical or ineffective during surgery (open, laparoscopic, or thoracoscopic) in
      Chinese adult subjects.

      After application of either SURGICEL Powder or SURGICEL Original, the target bleeding site
      (TBS) will be assessed for hemostasis (no detectable bleeding) at 3, 5, and 10 minutes from
      application and prior to initiation of final fascial closure on open surgery or port site
      closure in laparoscopic or thoracoscopic procedures.

      All enrolled subjects will be observed post-operatively through discharge and followed up at
      30 days (+14 days) and at 6 months (+/-30 days) post-surgery via phone call or office visit.
