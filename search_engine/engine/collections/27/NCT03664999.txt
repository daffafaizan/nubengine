      complement components C1 inhibitor, C1 inhibitor activity, C3, C4 during the labour in a
      group of women with physiologic pregnancy and in a group with a risk of complications
      (pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, placenta praevia, placental abruption, IUGR, previous post
      partum hypotony).

      We will focus on women undergoing the Caesarean delivery. We will also measure D vitamin
      levels and ACE levels and search for some contexts.
