      Primary

        -  To measure levels of circulating tissue factor (TF) in patients with newly diagnosed
           multiple myeloma at several time points before, during, and after the administration of
           chemotherapy and/or antiangiogenic agents.

      Secondary

        -  To measure the correlation of TF with two markers of coagulation activation (i.e.,
           D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin [TAT] complexes) and two markers of endothelial
           activation (i.e., soluble E-selectin, soluble thrombomodulin) in these patients.

        -  To measure and compare (descriptively) our microparticle-associated TF procoagulant
           activity assay with two other assays using samples from these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then periodically during
      treatment. Circulating tissue factor (TF) activity levels and coagulation and endothelial
      activation (by ELISA) are measured. Medical charts are reviewed for sociodemographic and
      medical information.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 months.
