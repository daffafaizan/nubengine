      been until recently that scientists began exploring the psychiatric implications of naturally
      occurring lithium in the water supply.

      As stated in the article, Foods Rich in Lithium And Lithium Supplements:

      "Research suggests that locations with the highest concentration of lithium tend to have the
      lowest rates of depression and violent crime. These studies have been conducted across the
      globe in different climates with different natural habits and diets. Researchers have
      therefore concluded that this phenomenon is fairly universal."

      A study in the United States agrees with these findings. According to Everything Addiction:

      "In a 1990 study of 27 Texas counties, researchers found an "inverse association of tap water
      lithium content in areas of Texas with the rates of mental hospital admissions, suicides,
      homicides, and certain other crimes." It was also discovered that young men incarcerated for
      violent crimes in some parts of Texas had disproportionately low lithium levels. Schrauzer
      and Shrestha discovered that the negative correlation was confirmed," especially in the
      south-central region of the state where high suicide mortality rates correspond to low
      lithium concentrations."'

      Another study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry had similar results. Researchers
      at Oita University examined the suicide rates in Japan's Oita prefecture. The team discovered
      that cities with higher levels of natural lithium in the public water supply had lower rates
      of suicide overall.
