      intact so that the kidney function is maintained as far as possible. The more radical
      procedure would be the complete removal of the kidney, which is not examined in this trial.

      Surgery will be randomized either to an open technique involving a large incision or the
      robotic assisted technique with a few small incisions (keyhole surgery). With robotic
      assisted surgery the movements of the surgeon are translated into the movement of the
      instruments.

      It is not clear which of the two procedures, open or robotic assisted, has less
      complications. It is expected that these are different due to the different level of
      invasiveness and the level of direct access to the organ. This study aims to show that
      robotic assisted surgery results in less complications than open surgery.
