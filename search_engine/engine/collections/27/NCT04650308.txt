      effect on body metabolism related to obesity is still questionable. The purpose of this study
      was to determine the levels of neuropeptide Y in healthy people and to see differences in
      gender and anthropometric parameters. The hypothesis of this study was that there would be
      differences in neuropeptide Y levels in groups with gender and anthropometric parameter
      differences. This study was a cross-sectional study involving 62 study subjects, male and
      female, who did not have chronic diseases or metabolic disorders. This research was conducted
      from April to September 2020. The parameters examined in this study were neuropeptide Y
      levels and anthropometric parameters. The statistical analysis performed was the Mann-Whitney
      test to see the differences between groups. The mean age of the research subjects was 40.48 Â±
      10.85 years, with the same ethnic distribution. The distribution of men and women was more
      women than men. Based on anthropometric examination, it was found that obesity nutritional
      status was more common in the female group than in the male group; however, serum
      neuropeptide Y levels were found to be significantly different between male and female groups
      (male group was higher).
