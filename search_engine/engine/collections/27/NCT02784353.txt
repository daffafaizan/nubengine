      application of ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery), the improvement of QOL(quality of
      life) has been known as one of important factor for the management of HBP malignancies as
      well as survival, and the improvement of QOL, itself, affect the survival.

      There are several reports that perioperative rehabilitation affect positively for the outcome
      of surgery and QOL in surgical patients. However, in the HBP field, there are rarely studied
      for this concept.

      This study aim to investigate that the application of rehabilitation program for the surgery
      of HBP malignancies affect on short-term outcome and lead the improvement of QOL.
