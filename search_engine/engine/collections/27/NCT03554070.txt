      For ThuFLEP, we use the Urolase system (NTO IRE-POLUS, Russia) and a 600 mcm fiber. The
      thulium fiber laser is set with a mean output power of 60 W and energy of 1.5 J. Tissue
      morcellation is completed with the Piranha Morcellator (Richard Wolf, Germany).

      At the end of the procedure a 22 French three-way Foley catheter is placed. IPSS, Qmax, QoL,
      prostate volume are recorded at 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery. IIEF-5 are recorded at 3 and
      6 months after surgery.
