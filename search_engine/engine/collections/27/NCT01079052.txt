      high-calorie breakfast. Thirty minutes after the start of the breakfast, subjects were
      administered a single oral dose of famotidine tablets, USP 20 mg or PepcidÂ® AC Acid reducer
      famotidine tablets 20 mg (containing famotidine 20 mg) under low-light condition during each
      period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature and under
      supervision of trained study personnel.

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study for all the subjects.
