      physical deconditioning, leading to reduced fitness and increased risk of obesity,
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. This study will characterize the activity
      and fitness levels and cardiovascular disease risk profile in 30 chronic, generalized
      myasthenic subjects. Hypotheses are that a) subjects with myasthenia gravis are physically
      inactive with reduced fitness level and high incidence of obesity and poor cardiovascular
      disease risk profile, and b) a 3 month multi-modal home exercise program that includes
      aerobic, resistive, and pulmonary training components will improve physical activity,
      strength, fitness, dyspnea, body composition and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Specific
      aims are to a) define the baseline physical activity and fitness levels and prevalence of
      insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in stable sedentary myasthenic subjects, b) determine
      whether a 3 month moderate intensity home exercise program is safe and feasible in
      deconditioned, stable myasthenic subjects and c) whether a 3 month comprehensive home
      exercise program can enhance fitness, strength, and lung function to improve physical
      activity and reduce cardiovascular disease risk.
