      GSK598809, on smoking behavior when treatment is started immediately following the quit date.
      To do this, we propose to conduct a 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof of
      mechanism study in 90 adult smokers. Participants will complete baseline evaluations. They
      will receive manualized cognitive behavioral therapy, beginning prior to the quit date, and
      will set a quit date for the day before their week 2 study visit. They will be given short
      acting NRT (gum or lozenge) to use on their quit date. They will be asked to arrive for the
      week 2 visit with 18-24 hours abstinence and an expired air CO â‰¤ 10ppm. Those who do so will
      be randomly assigned to receive double blind GSK598809 or identical placebo for six weeks.
      Participants will begin double blind GSK598809 or placebo, both in conjunction with prn NRT
      up to 8 mg per day for two weeks. Participants will then continue double blind GSK598809 or
      placebo in the absence of NRT for 4 more weeks. At the end of this period (week 8 of the
      study), participants will then be followed 2 weeks after discontinuation of double blind
      treatment to complete the 10 weeks of the study.
