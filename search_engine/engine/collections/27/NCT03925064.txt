      an overall prevalence of 3-7 % during pregnancy. The myocardial tissue is the most likely
      structure affected by hyperglycemia. The myocardial performance index (MPI) is a pulsed wave
      Doppler-derived index of global myocardial function. It is defined as the sum of the
      isovolumetric contraction time (ICT) and isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT) divided by the
      ejection time (ET) The fetal right heart contributes more to the cardiac output than the left
      heart; therefore, it is important to assess the right ventricular function. The investigators
      will measure right ventricular MPI in diabetic and normal pregnancies.
