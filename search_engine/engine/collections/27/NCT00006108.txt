      combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with metastatic breast
      cancer. II. Determine the response rate of these patients to this treatment regimen. III.
      Determine the median time to treatment failure in these patients with this treatment regimen.
      IV. Determine the incidence of cardiac toxicity in these patients with this treatment
      regimen. V. Assess the quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of capecitabine. Patients receive trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15; paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 2;
      and oral capecitabine on days 3-16. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The
      MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicities. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued. Quality of life is
      assessed at baseline and after 3 courses of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for the phase I dose escalation
      portion of this study. A total of 28-41 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of
      this study.
