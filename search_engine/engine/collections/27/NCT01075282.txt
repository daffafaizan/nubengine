    
      Rescue therapy refers to 1 of 2 types of additional therapy, each given for a different
      reason: any additional therapeutic intervention in participants who developed persistent,
      severe hyperglycemia despite full compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, or
      initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication following study drug
      discontinuation. Participants who received rescue therapy were included in the analysis
      population, but only measurements obtained prior to the beginning of rescue therapy were
      included in specified efficacy analyses.
