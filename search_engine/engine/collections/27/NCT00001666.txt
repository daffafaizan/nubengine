      (TMS) at 1 Hz on the excitability of the seizure focus in patients with poorly controlled
      epilepsy refractory to pharmacological treatments. 1 Hz TMS is a rate proven to induce long
      term depression in animal models and reported to decrease the excitability of both human and
      animal cerebral cortex.
