      including higher rates of low birthweight and preterm birth. Mindfulness interventions,
      dietary education, and smoking cessation education have all been effectively employed to
      reduce hypertension, but have infrequently targeted women of childbearing age in community
      settings. This study will screen African-American women of childbearing age for hypertension,
      and invite women with hypertension to participate in a seven-session intervention to reduce
      blood pressure. The investigators will track their perceived stress and their blood pressure
      levels over the next 6 months. Half of the women who participate will be given a blood
      pressure cuff and taught to measure their own blood pressure. More frequent tracking of blood
      pressure will be done in these women.
