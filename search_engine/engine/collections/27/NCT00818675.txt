      open-label lead-in treatment of ridaforolimus. After this 8 week period patients will be
      re-assessed for disease status. Patients who are stable after 8 weeks are randomized in a
      double-blind fashion to continue treatment with ridaforolimus or to a placebo until disease
      progression. (Those patients who have stable disease but are randomized to placebo may
      cross-over to open-label ridaforolimus at the time of disease progression.)

      Those patients with tumor shrinkage during the open-label lead-in treatment will continue on
      open-label ridaforolimus, while those patients who have disease progression at 8-weeks are
      taken off-study.
