      stress management eliminates chronic inflammation pain within fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis,
      and rheumatoid arthritis.

      METHODS: One thousand seventeen hundred and twenty (1,720) participants with chronic
      inflammation-containing diseases, were brought to a minimum symptom state using
      daily-administered cortisol tablets. Thereafter, participants used 5-day, small-dosage
      cortisol regimens to quench subsequent disorder exacerbations to maintain the minimum symptom
      state. Stressors as emotional traumas, infections, allergies, and injuries were minimized to
      reduce cortisol consumption and participant discomfort. This protocol is compliant with
      current United States Food and Drug Administration recommendations for cortisol use applied
      to corticosteroid-responding disorders.
