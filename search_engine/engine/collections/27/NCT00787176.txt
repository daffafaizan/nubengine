      at the time of request for labor analgesia. All subjects received a maintenance infusion of
      Lactated Ringers(LR). For candidates in Groups A or B, an intravenous bolus of 1000 mL of LR
      was initiated. Candidates in Groups C and D did not receive any additional fluid. If
      randomized to group A or C, the oxytocin management was continued as per the normal active
      management of labor protocal (AMOL). If randomized to groups B or D, the dose of oxytocin
      that was being administered was halved and not increased until 60 minutes after the
      initiation of epidural analgesia. Fetal heart rate monitoring and frequency of uterine
      contractions were recorded by external tocodynamometry.
