      of patients who have already undergone lower extremity amputations so as to include
      biological actuators that will enable the successful employment of next generation lower
      extremity prostheses, diminish/eliminate phantom limb pain, restore proprioception and
      regenerate lost muscle mass. The specific aims of the project are as follows:

        1. To develop a standardized operative technique for both above knee (AK) and below knee
           (BK) amputation revision procedures that includes AMIs to restore musculotendinous
           proprioceptive capabilities

        2. To assess the capacity for these actuators to provide enhanced motor control and sensory
           feedback, as well as ablate phantom limb symptomatology and augment residual limb muscle
           mass

        3. To determine the reinnervation time course and longevity of these biological constructs

        4. To validate the functional and somatosensory superiority of the proposed revision
           technique over standard approaches to BKA and AKA

        5. To develop a modified acute postoperative rehabilitation strategy suited to this new
           surgical approach
