    
      This is a multi-center study which will enroll up to 120 patients. Subjects will undergo a
      Chartis Assessment prior to EBV treatment. The Chartis assessment will determine the presence
      or absence of collateral ventilation, a potential determining factor in the success of EBV
      therapy. This study is not randomized; all subjects are eligible to receive EBV Treatment,
      regardless of Chartis Assessment outcome. Follow-up data will only be collected on those
      patients that meet the Chartis inclusion criteria.
