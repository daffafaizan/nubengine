      glucose, insulin and QT in healthy participants with and without LY2409021. Part B of this
      study is a randomized, 3-period, crossover design, in which participants and investigators
      are blinded to placebo and LY2409021, and will assess the electrophysiological effects of a
      single supratherapeutic dose of LY2409021 compared to a positive control (moxifloxacin) and
      placebo.
