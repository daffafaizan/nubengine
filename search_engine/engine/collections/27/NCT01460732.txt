      Microlife WatchBP Home-Nocturnal oscillometric device, in order to measure their BP two times
      with one-minute interval, in the morning between 6 and 9 am and in the evening between 6 and
      9 pm respectively for six days. These six days shall be normal working days, selected be the
      patient, within a time-frame of two weeks approximately. Patients should be sitting for at
      least five minutes and calm. During three out of those six days, they will apply and activate
      the same device, in order to take BP measurements while they will be asleep. Those
      measurements are going to be taken automatically by the device, the first 2-hours after the
      activation and another two with one-hour interval. Measurements will be averaged as awake and
      asleep BP values, with a potential to derive, if so wished, separate averages of
      awake-morning and awake-evening BP values.

      Microlife WatchBP O3 Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement (ABPM) device will be applied by a
      doctor to each patient and it will be removed the next day by a doctor. BP measurements will
      be performed every 20 minutes for 24 hours. BP measurements taken during awake and asleep
      hours for each patient, will be analyzed separately.

      Additionally, triplicate sitting Clinic Blood Pressure measurements, with one-minute
      interval, will be performed with the Microlife WatchBP Home-Nocturnal device during each
      patient's visit at the Hypertension Center. Patients will visit Hypertension Center three
      times, one to apply the ABPM device and one to remove it and provide the Microlife WatchBP
      Home-Nocturnal device and another one to bring it back. This will take approximately two
      weeks.
