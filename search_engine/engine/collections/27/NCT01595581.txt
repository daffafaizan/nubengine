    
      Overall Objective: The overall objective of this study is to determine if 8 weeks of
      testosterone first administered 2 weeks prior to surgery, can improve the outcome of anterior
      cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.

      Overall Hypothesis: Standard-of-care rehabilitation with the addition of testosterone
      administration will augment muscle mass, strength, and physical function following ACL
      reconstructive surgery compared to standard rehabilitation alone.

      Significance: Muscle mass and strength are greatly reduced following ACL surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that administration of testosterone will minimize these reductions
      or potentially increase muscle mass and strength. In doing so, testosterone may hasten a
      patient's return to physical activity. If testosterone improves recovery after ACL surgery,
      the same treatment may be used for other injuries that involve trauma and muscle atrophy.
      Furthermore, this study will examine the effect of trauma with or without testosterone on
      myogenic regulators in muscle tissue taken during ACL surgery-providing possible mechanistic
      insights for the clinical outcomes.
