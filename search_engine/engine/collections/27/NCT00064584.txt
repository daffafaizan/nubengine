    
      This is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalating study at five clinical sites to determine dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and the effect on
      the peripheral and bone marrow blast count of an oral 28-day course of CT53518 in patients
      with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome. This study will confirm
      the tolerability and assess the effects on the peripheral and bone marrow blast count of an
      oral 28-day course of CT53518 at or near the maximum tolerated dose in patients with AML
      displaying a specified mutation of the FLT-3 gene, internal tandem duplication (ITD).
