      clinically-relevant. Prior research in this area has described the information needs of
      breast cancer patients at different time points as they proceed through the radiotherapy
      treatment process. Of high importance seems to be addressing patients' information needs
      through sensory and procedural information as a mechanism of anxiety reduction.

      The study team created an immersive VR-based education program that enables breast cancer
      patients to experience the procedure and emotions associated with radiation therapy prior to
      their actual treatment by offering controlled virtual exposure to the clinical environments
      involved in the treatment process. An educational video on the process of receiving radiation
      therapy is considered standard education at the majority of the clinical sites involved in
      this study.

      Participants enrolled in this study will be randomly assigned to either the VR-based
      education group or the video education group. Participation in this project will provide
      insight into aspects of patient education that are most effective at reducing anxiety and
      stress levels and meeting patients' information needs when undergoing radiation therapy
      treatment.
