      Although beta-blockers are known to prolong survival for patients with reduced left
      ventricular ejection fraction, their use in the community and the VA is suboptimal.

      Objectives:

      To determine if a reminder attached to the echocardiography report would increase the use of
      beta-blockers among patients with depressed left ventricular function.

      Methods:

      We are randomizing consecutive patients undergoing echocardiography at one of three VA
      echocardiography laboratories with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<40%) and no
      echocardiographic contraindication to beta-blockers (e.g. aortic stenosis) to a reminder for
      use of beta-blockers or to no reminder. The reminder gives starting doses for two commonly
      used beta-blockers (carvedilol and metoprolol). Patients are excluded from the analysis if
      they leave the health care system or die within three months of randomization. The primary
      outcome is a prescription for a beta-blocker between three and nine months following
      echocardiography

      Status:

      The project is complete.
