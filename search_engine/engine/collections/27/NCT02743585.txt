        1. Rapid pathogen identification from blood cultures, including early identification of
           resistance (via specific genetic markers or phenotypic tests), will allow timelier
           initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy and improved patient outcomes

        2. Rapid organism identification from blood cultures will allow timelier initiation of
           effective and optimal antibiotic therapy; minimizing the use of unnecessary antibiotics,
           including combination therapy

      Devices to be studied for this proposed study:

        1. BCID panel (Biofire Diagnostics Inc., bioMerieux) : The BCID panel is an FDA-approved
           nucleic acid amplification test (based on nested polymerase chain reaction) which
           detects Gram positive, Gram negative, the major Candida species and antimicrobial
           resistance markers (mecA for methicillin resistance, van A/B for vancomycin resistance,
           blaKPC for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)) directly from positive blood
           cultures in < 1 - 1.5 hours

        2. Rosco Diagnostica extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase screen kit
           (Rosco Diagnostica): These kits are CE-marked (Approved in the European Union) rapid
           chromogenic tests for ESBL/ carbapenemase detection from both blood cultures and
           cultured bacterial colonies.
