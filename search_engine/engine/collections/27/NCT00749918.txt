      baseline 22 time point mFSIGT was performed. Subjects were then treated with cholecalciferol
      (vitamin D3) supplementation - 10,000 IU/day - for 28 consecutive days. mFSIGT was then
      repeated measuring glucose, insulin and c-peptide at all time points. 25-OH vitamin D, PTH,
      and calcium were also measured at time point 0 pre and post vitamin D supplementation. Data
      was analyzed using the Bergman/Boston minimal model for insulin homeostasis with MinMod
      Millennium software.
