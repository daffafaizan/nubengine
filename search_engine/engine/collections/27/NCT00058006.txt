        -  Compare the rate of new malignancies (recurrences and second primary tumors) in patients
           with early-stage head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer treated with
           celecoxib vs placebo.

        -  Compare the event-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug vs
           placebo.

        -  Determine the toxic effects associated with long-term use of celecoxib in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate cyclooxygenase-2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta expression and
           CYP2C9 and TGF-beta genotypes with the rate of new malignancies and survival of patients
           treated with this drug vs placebo.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to smoking history (active smokers [including those who quit within
      1 year of diagnosis] vs former smokers vs non-smokers), tumor type (lung cancer vs head and
      neck cancer), and stage (I vs II for head and neck cancer or T1 vs T2 for lung cancer).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In both arms, treatment continues for
           24 months in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years or until disease recurrence.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 121 patients (approximately 60 per treatment arm) will be
      accrued for this study.
