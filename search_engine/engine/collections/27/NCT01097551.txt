      hypertension will be compared with 20 sex and aged-matched healthy control subjects. To
      assess the presence of retinal endothelial dysfunction, the variations of the diameters of
      the retinal vessels will be assessed using the Dynamic Vessel Analyzer, before and after
      flicker light stimulation, sublingual nitroglycerin, neosynephrine eyedrops, and isometric
      contraction. To assess the presence of peripheral endothelial dysfunction, the
      microcirculation of the forearm skin will be studied using iontophoresis with acetylcholine
      delivery, and heat delivery, both coupled with blood flow measurement using laser Doppler. An
      intravital capillaroscopy of the phalanx skin will be performed. The serum levels of CRP,
      ICAM-1, VCAM-1, VEGF, angiopoietin 2 and endostatin will also be measured.
