    
      The PRO-Kinetic study is a multi-center, prospective, consecutive non-randomized study
      enrolling 200 patients with single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries meeting the
      entry criteria. Those who provide informed consent will be enrolled to receive the
      PRO-Kinetic stent. Telephone follow-up will be performed at 1 month for all enrolled
      patients. After 6 months 100 patients will have an angiographic follow-up and 100 patients
      will be checked by telephone again. Additionally, a clinical telephone follow-up will be
      performed in all patients after 12 months.

      This study is designed to yield data on the clinical safety and efficacy of the PRO-Kinetic
      stent in the coronary artery application. The Target Vessel Failure Rate after 6 months shall
      be below 18 % (max. 35 Serious Adverse Events and Expedited Events) to show a
      safety/performance profile that could be considered in the range of the currently available
      bare metal stent systems
