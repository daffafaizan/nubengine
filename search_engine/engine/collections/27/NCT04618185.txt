    
      This is an observational study to observe the effects of Kaftrio (Elexacaftor / Tezacaftor /
      Ivacaftor) on the gut in people with CF.

      Participants will attend 3 times (pre-Kaftrio, at 12 weeks of Kaftrio and at 24 weeks of
      Kaftrio) for MRI scanning at the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, after an overnight fast.
      On this day, participants will be asked to withhold any medicines directly altering bowel
      habit such as laxatives. They will continue to take pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and
      other medications for CF.

      The Investigators will use the same MRI protocol as described in GIFT-CF (NCT03566550 and
      NCT04006873). Participants will have their first MRI scan fasted. After the first scan, they
      will eat a first standardised meal . They will then have 7 MRI scans at half hourly intervals
      and 3 MRI scans at hourly intervals. Participants will be given a second standardised meal
      after their ninth MRI scan. Each MRI scan will last approximately 15 minutes. After each MRI
      scan, participants will complete a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire
      (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale). In between scans, participants will have access to
      an adjacent room with Wifi and television access.

      They will also complete gut symptom questionnaires relating to the preceding 2 weeks and a 3
      day food diary. They will also provide a sputum and stool sample.

      Infection control requirements mean that only 1 participant will attend for MRI scanning per
      day. Extra COVID-19 precautions will also be taken throughout scan days.

      ***Please note, due to the timing of EMA approval for Kaftrio and ethics approval for the
      study granted on 21st Ocober 2020, the clinicaltrials.gov registration was created on 21st
      October 2020 and approved by the clinicaltrials.gov PRS team on 4th November 2020.***
