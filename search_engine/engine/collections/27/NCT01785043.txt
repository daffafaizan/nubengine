    
      Randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active controlled, phase IV study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of a 3 month treatment period with Liraglutide to Sitagliptin in type 2
      diabetes patients not well controlled at the maximum tolerated dose of metformin.The study
      has been designed with a random design as it is one of the most important techniques for
      avoiding bias in clinical trials. The study will follow a parallel group, open-label design
      as liraglutide is administered by subcutaneous injection and sitagliptin orally in tablets. A
      double-dummy design has been rejected because it is highly complicated in a phase IV study,
      and any bias of an open-label design has a lower impact on objective variables (as it is our
      primary endpoint) and it could be compensated with the proposed random design.Sitagliptin has
      been selected as the active control as it is one of the prescribed treatments for type 2
      diabetes patients not well controlled at the maximum tolerated dose of metformin.

      The study objectives will be assessed after 3 months of therapy as it is considered a
      suitable timing for identifying short-term changes on flow-mediated vasodilation
