      Philadelphia type. Previous studies by our lab have excluded FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, the
      causative genes of most hereditary craniosynostosis syndromes. In the five generation kindred
      previously reported we have conducted a genome-wide linkage analysis. We have identified four
      regions linked to this disorder, namely on 2q, 12q, 20q and 22q. Interestingly, syndactyly
      1A, a phenotypically similar disorder, demonstrates an overlapping linkage region in two
      studies. Screening of candidate genes in the redion has excluded ten candidate genes,
      including IHH, IGFBP2 and IGFBP5.

      This protocol is primarily for research purposes. Research subjects may receive benefit from
      knowing that this research may help other families in the future. Results will be discussed
      with the primary physician who is a trained medical geneticist. We will emphasize that these
      are only preliminary findings, that they are not CLIA-approved, and must not be disclosed to
      the patient or included in the medical record. Repeat testing in a CLIA-approved lab would be
      required before the specific genetic information could be shared with the patient and family.
