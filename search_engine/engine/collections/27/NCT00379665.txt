      direct intratumoral injections result in a decrease in the endobronchial obstructed airways
      and if the therapy is well tolerated, there will be immediate clinical benefit to this
      minimally invasive method, the most obvious being an improved quality of life. Approximately
      2 mg cisplatin per cubic centimeter of tumor are injected into each tumor through a flexible
      bronchoscope. A total of four to six injections are administered one week apart. Response to
      therapy is assessed based on improvement in intraluminal obstruction by tumor, as assessed by
      endobronchial observation.
