      receiving) study will evaluate efficacy/safety of pimodivir in combination with SOC treatment
      versus placebo in combination with SOC treatment in adolescent (13 to 17 years), adult (18 to
      65 years), and elderly (greater than [>] 65 but less than or equal to [<=] 85 years)
      non-hospitalized participants with influenza A infection who are at risk of developing
      complications. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: screening phase, double-blind
      treatment period (5 days), a post treatment follow-up period (23 days). Study evaluations
      include efficacy, clinical and virological outcomes, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, safety and tolerability. The duration of participation in
      the study for each participant is 28 days.
