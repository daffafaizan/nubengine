      medial compartment knee OA and varus alignment receiving optimized non-surgical treatment
      plus High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) to similar patients receiving optimized non-surgical
      treatment only. All participants will receive non-surgical treatment that will be
      individualized to the patient and include medications, physiotherapy and nutritional
      seminars. The non-surgical treatment will include supervised physiotherapy and nutritional
      seminars once per week for 12 weeks, will be accompanied and followed by a home program, and
      follow-up appointments for potential modification every three months for the duration of the
      study. Participants randomized to surgery will also undergo medial opening wedge HTO after 12
      weeks of optimized non-surgical treatment. Both groups will follow the same schedule of
      clinic visits throughout the 24 month follow-up period. MRI-derived measures of articular
      cartilage morphology, biological markers of articular cartilage degradation and synthesis,
      gait biomechanics and patient-reported outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24
      months follow-up.
