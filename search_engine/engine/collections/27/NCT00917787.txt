      analyze markers of inflammation in blood and in induced sputum for the purpose of identifying
      molecular markers of specific asthma phenotypes. Our specific interest in demonstrating that
      periostin levels are higher than normal in blood. We already have solid preliminary data to
      support this hypothesis, and our goal here is to replicate preliminary findings and extend
      them by examining further the characteristics of the asthma subgroup with elevated periostin
      levels. In this regard, we propose detailed phenotyping of the asthmatic subjects and the
      healthy controls, including measures in induced sputum, exhaled air and detailed physiologic
      measures including measures of airflow, lung volumes, and methacholine responsiveness. In
      earlier work we have found that periostin is a marker of Th-2 driven asthma, and we will use
      the data collected here to further explore this possibility. The biospecimens collected here
      will also allow us to expand existing plasma, DNA, RNA, and sputum samples in the UCSF Airway
      tissue bank, so that we can continue to build this resource for future research questions.
