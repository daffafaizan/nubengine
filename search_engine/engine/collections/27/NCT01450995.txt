      head. Other symptoms associated with a migraine headache may include nausea, vomiting, and
      sensitivity to light and sound. A migraine can last a few hours or up to one or two days.

      Triptan medications are currently thought to be safe and effective for acute migraine
      treatment. Treximet(tm) is a triptan tablet containing a combination of sumatriptan 85mg
      (Imitrex) and naproxen sodium 500 mg.

      This combination has two methods of action for relieving a migraine headache. It targets the
      nerves and blood vessels involved in a migraine, and relieves inflammation that may cause
      migraine pain. Treximet(tm), is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of taking Treximet(tm) as
      a combination pill to taking two Aleve(r) tablets and 100mg of Imitrex(r) as separate tablets
      taken at the same time.
