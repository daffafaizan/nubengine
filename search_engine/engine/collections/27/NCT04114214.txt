      each year. The incidence of sepsis is increasing and is now a more common cause for hospital
      admission than acute myocardial infarction and stroke.

      However this apparent improvement in sepsis outcomes may also be due to changes in definition
      and reporting of sepsis. The latest Sepsis-3 definition outlines sepsis as life-threatening
      organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to infection. Trends on sepsis incidence
      and outcome were based on previous definitions of sepsis. Furthermore, changes in coding
      practices and documentation for hospital claims may cause misleading changes in incidence and
      outcomes. Electronic health record clinical data provides more reliable data on sepsis
      epidemiology than diagnostic coding accounts for. Our understanding of sepsis epidemiology is
      based on studies from high income western countries. Even within these countries, health
      expenditure and resources vary which may affect sepsis outcomes. Current data on the burden
      of sepsis from the rest of the world is insufficient. Hong Kong is well poised to provide
      these lacking data on the epidemiology of sepsis. More than 90% of inpatient care is provided
      by the public healthcare system and would be captured by the electronic Clinical Management
      System. The purpose of this study is to develop an objective sepsis identification tool using
      electronic health records to study the epidemiology of sepsis in Hong Kong.
