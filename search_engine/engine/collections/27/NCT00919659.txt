      pts suffering APC and progressive cachexia. This assay is based on a bioelectrical impedance
      analysis (BIA) as a proven tool for nutritional investigation in patients with chronic
      disease. Phase angle, determined by BIA, has been found to be a prognostic indicator in
      several chronic and malignant conditions, such as HIV, liver cirrhosis, chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.
