      peripheral level, related to appetite other than solely gut peptides. The literature points
      towards a rather loose coupling when it comes to high intensity exercise and the suppression
      of food intake, without a clear explanation of the cause of exercise induced anorexia. This
      study is aimed to investigate high-intensity exercise and its effects on appetite and satiety
      hormones, inflammation, stress and eating behaviors on appetite and food intake.

      The objective of the current study is to investigate the factors contributing to
      exercise-induced anorexia in lean and obese children, and maximize its translation into
      post-exercise suppression of food intake and promotion of negative energy balance
      particularly in obese children. It is hypothesized that high-intensity exercise would promote
      a greater suppression of food intake through suppression of appetite ratings via
      physiological mechanisms depending on stress and inflammation rather than gut peptides.
