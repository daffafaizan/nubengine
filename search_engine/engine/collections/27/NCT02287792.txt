      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare disease, often difficult to diagnose with a high
      mortality rate. Extra-cardiac manifestations, which can occur in 30 to 80% of cases, impact
      the outcome of the disease. Identifying these manifestations may help confirm an uncertain
      diagnosis and optimize patients' management.

      18-FDG PET/CT imaging, widely used for cancer staging, may also detect hyper-metabolic areas
      related to extracardiac infectious complications of IE. It provides the opportunity to detect
      all extracardiac IE infectious complications through a single examination. The impact of
      18-FDG PET/CT imaging on the management of IE has yet to be completely evaluated.

      Hypothesis:

      18-FDG PET/CT implementation could result in both shortening of the initial diagnostic
      work-up of IE and therapeutic optimization.

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the impact of 18-FDG PET/CT on patients' management, as measured by changes in IE
      therapeutic plans.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the impact of 18-FDG PET/CT on the Duke-Li criteria for IE diagnosis

        -  To evaluate the performance of 18-FDG PET/CT in detecting valve damages and extracardiac
           complications induced by the IE

        -  To evaluate whether 18-FDG PET/CT may help identify the infection's portal of entry

        -  To evaluate whether the detection of extracardiac complications by FDG PET/CT is
           associated with the 6-months survival rate

        -  To identify clinical and biological determinants of extracardiac IE localizations and
           prognosis

        -  To determine the inter-reader interpretation of the18-FDG PET/CT results and the
           reproducibility in preparation and acquisition method
