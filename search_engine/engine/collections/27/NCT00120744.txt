      Vomiting may limit the success of oral rehydration in children with gastroenteritis and
      dehydration. Limited data suggest that while oral ondansetron may reduce vomiting from
      gastroenteritis, emergency department revisits may increase.

      Methods:

      The investigators conducted a prospective, double-blind randomized trial at a pediatric
      emergency department in 214 dehydrated children, aged 6 months to 10 years with
      gastroenteritis and mild to moderate dehydration as assessed by a dehydration score. They
      were randomly assigned to receive treatment with an ondansetron oral disintegrating tablet or
      placebo. Oral rehydration was administered according to a standard protocol. The primary
      outcome was the proportion of children who vomited during oral rehydration therapy. The
      secondary outcomes were the mean number of episodes of vomiting, and the proportion of
      children treated with intravenous rehydration or hospitalized.
