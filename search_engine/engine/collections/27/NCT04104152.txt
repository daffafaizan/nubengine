      their eligibility and, based on meeting eligibility requirements, will be enrolled into the
      study on the same day of the Screening Visit.

      Once enrolled, the subjects will be randomized to either the 5.0% nicotine ENDS products or
      the 2.4% nicotine ENDS products. Once randomized to the nicotine level, subjects will be
      assigned to one of the four flavor variants based on alignment with their preferred UB
      flavor.

      Subjects will be provided an orientation to the product and the Product Use and Behavior
      (PUB) instrument and provided with enough cartridges (sufficient for three weeks of product
      use [125% their reported weekly use of their UB]) to last the 3-week period of the study.

      The subjects will take the products home and use them ad libitum for a 1-week acclimation
      period followed by a 2-week product use period. During this time product use will be captured
      by the PUB instrument and their data uploaded to the cloud regularly.

      At the conclusion of the 3-week ambulatory period, the subject will return to the clinic,
      return the ENDS power unit, used and unused ENDS cartridges, and the PUB instrument (and all
      cables/charger), have his/her health status reevaluated, complete the Product Evaluation
      Scale (PES) questionnaire and will then be discharged from the study.
