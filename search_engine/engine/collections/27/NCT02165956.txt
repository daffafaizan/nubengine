    
      This is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, prospective, parallel-group, double-blind
      study to evaluate the effect of a new infant cereal supplemented with prebiotics, probiotics,
      vegetable proteins and a special blend of starches on weight gain and intestinal microbiota
      in healthy infants from 6 to 12 moths of age. Patients will be randomized to receive either
      the new infant cereal or a standard cereal.
