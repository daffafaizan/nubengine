      been studied and increasingly utilized as a method to allow for the improved post-operative
      analgesia of epidural analgesia without infusions.

      At Wake Forest University, the investigators have been using EREM, since late 2004, as part
      of multimodal analgesia in patients having gynecologic surgeries and hip arthroplasties. The
      investigators initially decreased our dosages from those recommended (15 mg for lower
      extremity surgery and 10-15 mg for abdominal surgery), because side effects (nausea, vomiting
      and hypotension) were felt to be limiting to recovery. The investigators now use 4-7.5 mg in
      most patients, with 7.5 mg being the exception and have achieved better results. For hip
      arthroplasties, the investigators currently use 4-5 mg and have performed two retrospective
      chart reviews on this use; both suggesting that this approach is efficacious. However, these
      doses have not been studied in a prospective, randomized, double blind trial. The
      investigators would like to evaluate the efficacy of this dose of EREM used as part of a
      multimodal regimen. The investigators will compare EREM 4 mg with lumbar plexus block versus
      lumbar plexus block alone, (providing the rest of our multimodal approach for both patients).
