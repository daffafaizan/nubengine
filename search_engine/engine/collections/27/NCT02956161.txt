      cardio-vascular, metabolic and more recently neurodegenerative diseases. The slow wave sleep,
      characterized by slow oscillations, has a major role on memory and hormones releasing. Here,
      we aim to assess a miniaturized sleep device that would automatically detect and stimulate
      sleep slow oscillations with sounds to enhance deep sleep quality.

      The subjects realize 3 conditions :

        -  Up condition : Auditory stimulations are delivered in synchrony with the up phase of
           slow oscillations during N3 sleep stage.

        -  Random condition : Auditory stimulations are randomly delivered during N3 sleep stage.

        -  Placebo condition: The device is worn without any auditory stimulations delivered.

      The subjects are equipped with a reference polysomnography and the auditory stimulation
      device during 3 nights and one habituation night prior to them. A wash out period of 6 days
      between each night will be respected.
