      mainly due to their onset early in life and their long-term disabling courses. Current
      treatments fail to improve most influential factors such as social-cognitive deficits.
      Prevention is recognized as one of the key strategies to fight these deteriorating outcomes
      and is expected to significantly reduce both, the societal costs as well as the immense
      burden for the patients and for their families. Recent meta-analyses indicate promising
      preventive effects of both pharmacological and cognitive-behavioural interventions. Yet,
      reported transition rates are still too high. Clinical evidence suggests that disturbances of
      social functioning predict conversion to psychosis. Neurobiological evidence implicates
      glutamatergic dysfunction and redox imbalance in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The
      investigators hypothesize that interventions targeting (i) social functioning and (ii)
      glutamatergic / oxidative pathways already in at-risk states would significantly reduce
      transition rates. To test these hypotheses, our study is designed as a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, 18-month trial (six months of intervention plus 12 months of follow-up),
      involving 200 subjects at-risk for psychosis. Specifically, the investigators will compare
      the preventive effects of a cognitive-behavioural and social-cognitive intervention to a
      pharmacological intervention (IPPI) with Acetylcysteine, a drug with a proglutamatergic,
      neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory profile in a 2x2 factorial design. The results of our
      planned study are expected to provide new and well tolerated interventions, thus hopefully
      helping to achieve the major goal of individualized prevention, and, consequently, lower the
      individual and societal burden of psychosis.
