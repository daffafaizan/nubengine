      Excluding third molars. This diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of at least 6 teeth with
      at least one noncontiguous interproximal site with Probing Pocket Depth (PPD) and Clinical
      Attachment Loss (CAL) ≥ 5 mm, as well as 30% of Sites with PPD and CAL ≥ 4mm and bleeding on
      Probing (BOP). Periodontal disease currently classified as Stage III Degree B. Periodontal
      healthy was defined as individuals who presented a periodontium without loss of insertion,
      with PPD ≤3 mm, BOP in less than 10% of the sites and without radiographic bone loss.

      Non-surgical periodontal treatment was performed, including oral hygiene education, scaling,
      smoothing and coronal-radicular polishing (RAR). Six sites were evaluated in each tooth
      (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, distolingual/palatal, lingual/palatal and
      mesiolingual/palatal surfaces). Scaling and root planing were performed using mechanical
      devices - ultrasound and manual instruments. The treatment was with local anesthesia, 3%
      lidocaine with vasoconstrictor, for PPD ≥ 5 mm. The objective of each session was to achieve
      a smooth surface, devoid of biofilm and calculus.

      The following parameters are evaluated during clinical examination: Probing Pocket Depth
      (PPD), distance of the enamel-cementum line at the gingival margin, clinical Attachment Loss
      (CAL), plaque index (IP) and bleeding on probing (BOP), PPD and CAL measurements are rounded
      to the nearest millimeter using a North Carolina periodontal probe (Chicago, USA).
