      Hospital October 12, Madrid. The group of patients that develops post-surgical chronic pain
      and the group that does not develop it will be observed, and risk factors will be studied.

      Before the surgical intervention, the risk factors described in the literature will be
      analyzed. Children will be followed up to 6 months after surgery.
