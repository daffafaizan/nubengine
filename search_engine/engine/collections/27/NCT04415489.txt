      cavity evaluation. SIS is often performed as a screening tool in the office for uterine
      evaluation since it is straight-forward to perform, well-tolerated has low overhead cost. If
      uterine pathology is suspected on SIS, subsequent hysteroscopy is typically performed in the
      operating room. Hysteroscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of intra-uterine
      pathology and offers the opportunity for intervention at time of diagnosis, but often is not
      used as the initial screening tool because of provider concerns about in-office tolerability,
      equipment cost and maintenance. Technology advancements, however, has introduced an
      affordable, disposable, small caliber hysteroscopes with an operative channel to make it
      possible for this type of assessment to be performed in the office setting with the addition
      of a 'see and treat' modality. If used to perform initial uterine cavity evaluation,
      hysteroscopy may offer expedited diagnosis, treatment, and avoidance of general anesthesia.
      If superior specificity is demonstrated, it may also lower the false positive rate,
      preventing unnecessary delays to a patient's projected treatment plan, and unnecessary
      exposure to anesthesia risks. To date, no randomized control trials have compared the
      satisfaction of patients and providers to saline infusion sonography versus office
      hysteroscopy without anesthesia in initial cavity evaluation with the ability to immediately
      address intra-uterine pathology.
