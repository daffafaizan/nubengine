      screening colonoscopy. Hence, inadequate bowel preparation is reported in up to 25% of all
      patients undergoing colonoscopy.

      Although the quality of bowel preparation is influenced by various factors, it largely
      depends on patientÂ´s compliance regarding instructions on purgatives and diet. Therefore
      reinforced education and guidance is a valuable tool to improve bowel preparation.

      A rapidly increasing number of individuals worldwide use smartphones in their daily life.
      Application of this new technology into patient education could facilitate and empower the
      patient guidance. In this study patients either receive regular information on colonoscopy
      preparation (paper-based) or download a SPA for reinforced reminding of the steps of
      colonoscopy preparation. Objective of this study is to measure the impact of a SPA on quality
      of bowel preparation.
