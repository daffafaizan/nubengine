      who use a wheelchair for the majority of their mobility (over 40 hours per week), and have a
      traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). This study will be accessed entirely online and
      participation is expected to last approximately one year. Subjects will select to participate
      in one of three groups; one group that will receive maintenance training immediately with no
      follow up, one group that will receive the maintenance training immediately with 1 month and
      6 month follow up, and one group that will be randomized to either receive the maintenance
      training immediately or after 6 months. The maintenance training program itself will take
      approximately 1-2 hours to complete.

      After obtaining informed consent, participants in the first two groups will complete baseline
      questionnaires. They will then receive the maintenance training program.

      Participants in the third group (a wait-list control group) will complete the baseline
      questionnaires and be contacted one month later to complete a wheelchair maintenance
      assessment questionnaire. They will then wait 5 months. After this period, participants will
      complete the baseline questionnaires a second time, and then receive the wheelchair
      maintenance training.

      After completing the maintenance training, all groups will be contacted immediately post
      training to complete additional questionnaires to assess the effectiveness of the remote
      training program. Participants in the 2nd and 3rd group will be contacted 1 month and 6
      months post-training to complete additional questionnaires. Participants may be compensated
      for their time.
