      place (around day 14-18 after the cell infusion) and will continue to receive it for one
      year.

      All >18 year old patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants performed with a reduced
      intensity conditioning regimen at our center are potential candidates for the study.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of topical cyclosporine in prevention of
      ocular versus graft disease when its use is indicated immediately after the engraftment has
      occured.
