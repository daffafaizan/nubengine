        -  Determine if a nonmyeloablative regimen comprising cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and
           radiotherapy followed by cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil provides a prompt and
           durable donor engraftment in patients with hematologic malignancies or kidney cancer who
           are undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the safety of this nonmyeloablative transplantation regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the risk of graft-versus-host-disease in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the antineoplastic potency of nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of lower doses of daily fludarabine on treatment-related mortality
           (TRM) OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to risk (standard vs high).

        -  Preparative regimen*: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours
           on day -6 and fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -2. Patients undergo total body
           irradiation on day -1. Some patients also receive anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)** IV
           every 12 hours on days -6 to -4. Patients who receive ATG* include the following:

             -  Related donor recipients who have not received combination chemotherapy within the
                past 6 months

             -  Unrelated donor recipients who have not received combination chemotherapy within
                the past 3 months

             -  Unrelated donor recipients who have received only 1 induction course for the
                treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
                myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia
                (CML) NOTE: **Patients who underwent prior autologous stem cell transplantation in
                the past year do not receive ATG.

        -  Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo
           allogeneic PBSCT on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2 hours
           beginning on day -3 and continuing until at least day 100. Patients also receive
           mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally twice daily on days -3 to 30.

        -  Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI): Patients without active GVHD but deteriorating donor
           chimerism may receive DLI IV over 2 hours.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study.
