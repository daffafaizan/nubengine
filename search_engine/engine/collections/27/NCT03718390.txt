    
      This is a multicentre, observer blind, randomised, single dose study in healthy adult
      subjects.

      The first 5 subjects enrolled into the study will be regarded as Dosing Group 1 (sentinel
      group) and assigned to each of the five available study formulations. Dosing of subjects in
      Dosing Groups 1 and 2 will be performed at the endoscopy centre. Dosing of subjects in Dosing
      Groups 3 through 5 will be performed at the clinical site.

      Subjects remain in the inpatient unit for 7 days after dosing. During this time, subjects
      undergo intermittent imaging assessments for gastric retention (MRI and abdominal U/S),
      safety assessments and faecal collections for assessments of retrieved components and bowel
      movement characteristics.

      Subjects return to the clinic on Days 10, 15, 22 and 29 (End of Study visit). Safety
      assessments will be performed at all visits. MRI, abdominal U/S and outpatient faecal
      collections may continue based on the clinical findings from subjects dosed with modified
      release capsule formulations. On Day 29, the subjects will undergo final safety assessments
      at the clinic and thereafter, will be discharged from the study.
