      I. To assess the objective response rate of RO4929097 in patients with advanced kidney cancer
      and failure of anti-VEGF directed therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of RO4929097 through secondary endpoints including:
      duration of radiologic response, rate of disease stabilizations, rate of tumor control rate
      (CR+PR+SD), and progression-free & overall survival rates.

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of single agent RO4929097 in patients with advanced
      RCC.

      III. To explore expression of Notch biomarkers in RCC patients and their potential
      interaction with RO4929097 response and toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally (PO) on
      days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 12
      months.
