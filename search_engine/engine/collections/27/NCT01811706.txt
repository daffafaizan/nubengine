      placebo over a total period of 10 weeks. After entering the study, patients will return every
      2 weeks for evaluation. After four weeks, intervention will be stopped and patient will enter
      a 2-week wash out period where they do not take any drug. Then, patients will be given the
      opposite treatment (Dalfampridine or placebo) and this "crossover" study will be performed
      for another 4 weeks. Investigators expect there will be improvement in walking speed and
      steadiness after taking Dalfampridine, thereby improving activities of daily living and
      enhancing social and occupational functions.
