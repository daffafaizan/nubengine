      education with written instruction on subjects' understanding of atopic dermatitis and their
      disease severity.

      Subjects randomized to the video-based education arm will be instructed to watch a video on
      the classifications, aggravating factors, and treatment of atopic dermatitis. Subjects
      randomized to the written education arm will receive written information on the
      classifications, aggravating factors, and treatment of atopic dermatitis. The contents of the
      video and the written educational materials will be comparable.

      At the end of the study period, 3 months later, subjects will be interviewed regarding their
      comprehension and attitude towards video-based and written education materials. Additionally,
      we will use the Patient-oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) questionnaire to assess the difference
      in subjects' disease severity between the 2 arms.
