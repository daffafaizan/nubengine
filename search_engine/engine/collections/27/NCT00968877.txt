      common practice among nephrologists to monitor and correct vitamin D deficiency of chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) patients, because it is widely believed that any vitamin D deficiency
      associated with calcium-phosphate disturbances is better treated with activated vitamin D.

      However, correction of vitamin D deficiency with native vitamin D seems to have numerous
      favorable effects not only related to the renal and intestinal handling of calcium and
      phosphate. It may have beneficial effects on bone and vascular health, the immune system and
      physical performance that are not obtained with active vitamin D treatment.

      We are therefore planning a randomized, placebo-controlled, intervention study of 8 weeks'
      duration in which vitamin D3 supplementation (40 000 IE per week in one capsule) is compared
      with placebo in a trial including 120 CKD patients with vitamin D deficiency. Multiple
      biological variables are monitored in order to assess any effect on the biological systems of
      interest.
