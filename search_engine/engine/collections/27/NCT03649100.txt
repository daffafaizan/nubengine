      restoration, consecutively enrolled. Patients randomly received Sandblasted and Acid-etched
      (SA) surface implants (SA group) or SA implants with a newly developed bio-absorbable apatite
      nano coating (NH group). Outcome measures were: implant and prosthetic survival rate,
      complications, insertion torque, and implant stability quotient (ISQ) measured at implant
      placement and every week up to 8 weeks after implant placement. Comparison between groups was
      made by unpaired t test, while comparison between each follow-up will be made by paired t
      tests to detect any change during the follow-up. Complications and failures were compared by
      using Fisher exact test.
