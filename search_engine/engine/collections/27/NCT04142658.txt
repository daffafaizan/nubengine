      anticoagulant (DOAC), as anticoagulation in participants with an aortic mechanical prosthetic
      valve. Some participants may be genetically hyper- or hypo-responsive to warfarin, which
      makes management difficult. Another small group of participants is allergic to warfarin. A
      much larger group of participants has difficulty maintaining warfarin control due to dietary
      and drug interactions. Finally, the requirement for routine blood testing makes people
      reluctant to take warfarin. All of these factors drive younger participants in need of aortic
      valve replacement (AVR) toward selection of a tissue valve instead of a mechanical valve.
      Despite multiple studies (randomized, matched and risk adjusted) that show that tissue valves
      are associated with worse outcomes, younger participants choose this type of valve to avoid
      warfarin. In addition, multiple clinical studies have shown valve reoperation rates are
      higher for tissue valves used in these younger participants. Providing an alternative to
      warfarin anticoagulation may lead younger participants to choose a mechanical valve with
      greater durability and better clinical outcomes.
