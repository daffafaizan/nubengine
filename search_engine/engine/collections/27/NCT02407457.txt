    
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, multi-center trial, intended to evaluate the
      outcomes of contemporary EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) in a real world population. The
      trial is designed to compare the anatomically stabilized AFX Endograft System to a reference
      group of proximally fixated EVAR devices. Patients will be randomized between the two groups.

      Randomization will be 1:1. Each investigator will select one comparator device of their
      choice before enrolling the first patient. The study will sequentially evaluate
      non-inferiority and superiority hypotheses.

      Up to 80 sites with experience in EVAR and up to 800 subjects will participate in this study.
