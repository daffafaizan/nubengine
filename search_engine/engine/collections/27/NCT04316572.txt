      consultations model versus treatment as usual in patients with depression or anxiety
      disorders in primary care. In total, the investigators plan to enrol 320 patients who will be
      randomly allocated to the experimental condition (mental health specialist video
      consultations) or the control condition (treatment as usual from their GP) in a 1:1 ratio.
      General practitioners will recruit patients during their regular clinic hours. If the patient
      is interested in participation, the patient will receive the informed consent form and the
      baseline questionnaire from the GP. The practice team will send the patient's contact details
      to the study team who will screen the patient with respect to the eligibility criteria.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two study conditions (video consultation
      model vs. treatment-as-usual, TAU) in a 1:1 ratio by central randomisation.

      The evaluation of the primary outcome will be performed according to the intention-to-treat
      principle.

      The health economic evaluation will be carried out from the perspective of society. A
      cost-effectiveness and a cost-utility analysis will be carried out.
