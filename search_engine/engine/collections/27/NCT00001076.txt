      T-lymphocytes. This trial will evaluate whether an accelerated vaccination schedule can
      produce immunological responses comparable to those obtained in other trials of ALVAC-HIV
      vCP205.

      Volunteers are randomized to receive immunization with either ALVAC-HIV vCP205 or ALVAC-RG
      rabies glycoprotein (vCP65) at days 0, 7, 14, and 21, followed by boost with rgp120/HIV-1 SF2
      at days 28 and 84. A third cohort receives ALVAC-HIV vCP65 on the same schedule followed by
      boost with placebo.
