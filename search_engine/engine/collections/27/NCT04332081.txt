    
      This is a single center prospective pilot cohort study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as an emergency investigational device for treating patients
      with a novel coronavirus, disease, COVID-19. Patients that meet inclusion criteria will be
      consented by the hyperbaric physician. They will then be transported from the ED or other
      unit to the hyperbaric unit maintaining airborne precautions based on the most current
      hospital protocol. All study personnel will have proper PPE at all times. The patient will
      then be placed into the monoplace chamber and when the chamber door is closed the patient
      will remove any respiratory filter/mask that was placed. The patient will receive 90 minutes
      of hyperbaric oxygen at 2.0 ATA with or without airbreaks per the hyperbaric physician. Upon
      completion of the treatment the patient will then return to the medical unit and continue all
      standard of care. Additional treatments (up to 5) can be given if warranted and agreed upon
      by the patient and all members of the team caring for the patient. After the intervention
      portion of this study, a chart review will be performed to compare the outcomes of
      intervention patients versus patients who received standard of care.
