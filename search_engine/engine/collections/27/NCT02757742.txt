      phases. In Phase I, the investigators enrolled a set of consecutive patients with
      non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who performed contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance at
      baseline and had severe cardiac dysfunction (defined as cardiac magnetic resonance LVEF equal
      or less than 35% ) in FuWai Hospital from 2010 to 2013. The investigators collect patients'
      clinical baseline data and cardiac magnetic resonance specific data(Late gadolinium
      enhancement mass). All patients were followed up every six month by phone or clinical visits.
      The primary endpoint was composite of sudden cardiac death(SCD), ventricular arrhythmias(VAs)
      and SCD/VAs related Implantable Cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization
      therapy-cardioverter defibrillator(ICD/CRTD) shock. The investigators plan to establish a
      quantitative LGE mass based model (including LGE mass on cardiac magnetic resonance, clinical
      features, specific medical histories, et al) for risk prediction of sudden cardiac death by
      analysing the phase I data(1-year model and 3-year model). In Phase II,the investigators will
      enroll another group of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy(NICM) patients from 2014 to 2015 to
      testify the risk prediction model(1-year model) the investigators have constructed in phase
      I. The investigators aim to find the real high risk NICM patients that may suffer from SCD or
      VAs in those with severe cardiac dysfunction.
