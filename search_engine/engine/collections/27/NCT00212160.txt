      sensitivity, metabolism, hormones, and body composition following bariatric surgery. Because
      preliminary data indicate differing responses to this surgery, both Caucasian and African
      American adults, scheduled for RYGB, are being recruited to participate. It is believed that
      the omentum contributes to hepatic insulin resistance, both because of the increased delivery
      of NEFAs via the portal vein, and the increased production of cytokines. Because of this, it
      is postulated that removing the omentum as part of bariatric surgery will speed up the
      reversal of insulin resistance and diminish racial differences in response to the surgery.

      Data are derived from tissue and blood samples obtained operatively (from individuals having
      bariatric surgery and other abdominal operations), as well as during
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, from indirect calorimetry, DEXA, Health-related Quality
      of Life surveys, and 24-hour urine samples. There were 66 participants randomized to
      omentectomy/no omentectomy. A post hoc data power analysis determined that this number of
      subjects is sufficient for data analysis.
