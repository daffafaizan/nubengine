      following consumption of increasing doses of epicatechin in rats . This data clearly shows
      that increasing doses of epicatechin, either 0.5 mg.kg-1 delivered once, twice, or three
      times a day, or 2 mg.kg-1 once a day, results in increasing expression of the fibrillar
      collagens (I, III, and V). This preliminary data suggests that epicatechin-rich chocolate
      supplementation can increase collagen expression in humans and that this may improve force
      transfer. From this background, the hypothesis proposed is that supplementation with
      epicatechin-rich chocolate will increase rate of force development and performance in
      athletes. Therefore, this simple nutrition intervention has the potential to simultaneously
      improve performance, decrease injuries and accelerate return to competition through improved
      collagen synthesis.
