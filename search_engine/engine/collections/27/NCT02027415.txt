      2-hour car ride along the NJ Turnpike. Samples will be collected at 3 time points for each
      exposure session: pre-exposure, immediately post-exposure, and 24 hours post-exposure. Blood
      samples will be collected immediately before and after a 5-minute occlusion at each time
      point. The subject will also be asked to provide samples of exhaled breath and complete
      symptom and stress questionnaires at each time point.

      Blood samples will be analyzed for serum nitrite. Exhaled breath samples will be analyzed for
      nitrates and nitrites.
