      reasons for attending general surgery clinics. In most of the cases no physical cause is
      demonstrated and the etiopathogenesis is still not yet determined. In 1949 Patey, for the
      first time, proposed that mastalgia might be a psychologically based problem. In the
      following years, research was focused in this issue and some articles were published
      demonstrating the relationship of anxiety, depression and high stress levels with mastalgia.
      The efforts for finding out the etiopathologic mechanism and defining the risk factors
      revealed that smoking and consumption of tea, coffee and carbonated beverages in particular
      worsen mastalgia whereas essential fatty acids (especially gamma linoleic acid) provides a
      symptomatic relief. Additionally it is known that sleep irregularities cause serious
      deterioration in daily life quality as well as can exaggerate some medical, neurologic and/or
      psychiatric conditions. More than half of the population experience sleep irregularities from
      time to time and chronic sleep disturbances effect 20% of adult population in western
      countries. Therefore sleep irregularities might have contributing effects in the
      etiopathogenesis and/or symptomatology of therapy resistant conditions like mastalgia.
