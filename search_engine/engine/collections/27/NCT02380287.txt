      several autoimmune disorders including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, possibly - SLE and
      MS. BCD-085 is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody against human IL17 developed by JCS
      BIOCAD (Russia) which is now on the first step of clinical evaluation. BCD-085-1 study is the
      first-in-human clinical trial which is intended to evaluate tolerability, safety,
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of BCD-085 when used as a single step-by-step escalating
      subcutaneous dose in healthy male volunteers. During this study it is expected to determine
      diapason of safety doses of BCD-085 (incl. MTD) which thereafter can be evaluated in phase 2
      studies.
