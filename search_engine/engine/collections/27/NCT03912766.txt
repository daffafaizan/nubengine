      of the prostate gland (TURP). Copeptin has been established as is a surrogate marker of
      vasopressin and is measured useful for thea clinical assessment of various sodium and water
      disturbances. The aim of our the study was to assess the utility of serum concentration of
      copeptin (CPP) and brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for the prediction of postoperative
      alterations of serum sodium concentration.

      Methods. Study population comprised 43 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
      undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate gland (TURP) Serum sodium and copeptin
      (CPP) were measured before the procedure and 12 hours after its completion. and sSerum
      NT-proBNP was assessment at baseline. Total amount of fluids and sodium administered
      intravenously and to flush the bladder during TURP was calculated in each patient. Receiver
      operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the value of of copeptin
      (CPP) and NT-proBNP for that could prediction of the decrease of serum sodium after TURP
