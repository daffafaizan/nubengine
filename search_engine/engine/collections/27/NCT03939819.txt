      surgery. One of those options is a procedure called a "laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy"
      (LSG). In this procedure the majority of the patient's stomach is removed leaving behind a
      stapled "sleeve" about the same size as the patient's esophagus.

      During this procedure there are three main devices that surgeon inserts through the mouth and
      in to the stomach to calibrate the size of the "sleeve". They can use a standard weighted
      bougie, an endoscope, or a suction calibration device. This study aims to compare the
      difference in staple usage and post-operative GERD (heartburn) between patients that had an
      endoscope used versus patients that had a suction calibration system used on them during LSG.
