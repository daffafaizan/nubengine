      (fixed at 1 mg/day) treatment of patients with well-preserved lung function will prevent
      disease progression to more advanced stages. Sixty patients with FEV1>70% predicted will be
      enrolled and randomized to receive 1 mg/day sirolimus or placebo, and followed for a period
      of 2 years with pulmonary function testing every 4 months. The primary endpoint will be the
      between-group (placebo vs. sirolimus) difference in the rate of change in FEV1 (in liters)
      over two years. Secondary endpoints will include severity grade adverse events, time to 200cc
      or 10% FEV1 decline, forced vital capacity, lung volumes, diffusing capacity, serum VEGF-D,
      and early airflow obstruction assessed using hyper-polarized gas MRI. The study will be
      conducted through the Rare Lung Disease Clinic Network, a confederacy of clinics organized by
      the LAM Foundation that is currently following over 1300 U.S. LAM patients and conducting the
      Department of Defense sponsored Trial of an Aromatase Inhibitor in LAM (TRAIL) trial. The LAM
      Foundation will assist with study recruitment and dissemination of results, and the
      University of South Florida will function as the Data Coordinating Center. Successful
      completion of this study will define the safety and efficacy of low dose sirolimus in
      patients with normal lung function, and determine if sirolimus can be used to prevent disease
      progression to symptomatic stages.
