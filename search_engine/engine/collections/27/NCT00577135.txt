      needs of the rest of the body. Heart failure symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling,
      and fatigue. Standard treatment for the swelling associated with heart failure includes the
      use of diuretic medications, such as furosemide, which cause urination and the removal of
      excess fluids in the body. Although furosemide has been used to treat heart failure patients
      for many years, it is still unclear how much of the drug to use, and over what time period
      the drug should be given. This study will evaluate whether furosemide treatment is safer and
      more effective when the drug is given in high doses versus low doses and in two to three
      separate doses versus one continuous infusion.

      Participants in this study will begin study procedures within the first 24 hours of their
      hospital admission for heart failure. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one
      of the following four treatments: high dose furosemide via continuous intravenous (IV)
      infusion and placebo every 12 hours via IV bolus; low dose furosemide via continuous IV
      infusion and placebo every 12 hours via IV bolus; high dose furosemide every 12 hours via IV
      bolus and placebo via continuous IV infusion; and low dose furosemide every 12 hours via IV
      bolus and placebo via continuous IV infusion. Each participant will receive treatment for the
      first 72 hours of his or her hospital stay. Participants will answer questionnaires and
      undergo physical examinations and blood tests during the first 96 hours of hospitalization
      and again before hospital discharge or on Day 7, if that occurs first. Participants will be
      asked to return to their doctors 60 days following hospital discharge to evaluate their
      responses to treatment.
