      gene mutation map and frequency, is the evaluation of therapeutic effect and the important
      monitoring indicators of clinical follow-up after treatment. The second generation of
      high-throughput gene sequencing (NGS) is an important means of detecting ctDNA, which can
      detect trace ctDNA from smaller plasma samples. The ctDNA dynamic monitoring of stage I
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was performed by the second generation gene sequencing
      (NGS) technique to verify the prognostic predictive effect of ctDNA in stage I NSCLC patients
      without radiotherapy and targeted therapy.
