      Equivalent clinical outcomes to non-weight bearing; Similar radiographic findings on CT at
      follow-up visit between the two groups; reduced morbidity and disability to subjects through
      elimination of a period of non-weight bearing; reduction of cost to patients by eliminating
      need for adjuvant walking and mobility aids (crutches, taxis) and time off work.
