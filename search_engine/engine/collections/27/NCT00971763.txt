        -  To determine whether rituximab, in combination with non-cardiotoxic chemotherapy
           comprising gemcitabine hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, and
           prednisolone, is efficacious in a group of patients who are unfit for CHOP chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8;
      cyclophosphamide IV, vincristine sulfate IV, and rituximab IV on day 1; and oral prednisolone
      once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
