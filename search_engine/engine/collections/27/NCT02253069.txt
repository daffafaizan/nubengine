      randomised into two groups: One will receive a traditional tie-over dressing saturated with
      NaCl and the other group will receive a tie-over dressing saturated with a PHMB-based
      antiseptic. A quantitative and qualitative bacterial analysis of wounds by using a modified
      Levine's swabbing technique will be carried out pre-,intra-,and postoperatively. The effect
      of nasal colonisation with S.aureus on the development of surgical site infections will be
      investigated. All wounds will be followed a week after surgery to assess development of
      infections.
