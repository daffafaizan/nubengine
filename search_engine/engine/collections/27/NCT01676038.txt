      radiographic measurements were recorded on the coronal films: 1) Hip-Knee-Ankle Angle (HKA),
      the angle formed by the mechanical axis of the femur (line between the centre of the femoral
      head and the centre of the knee) and the mechanical axis of the tibia (line between the
      centre of the talus and the centre of the knee); 2) Coronal Femoral-Component Angle (CFA),
      the angle formed by the femoral component and the mechanical axis of the femur; 3) Coronal
      Tibia-Component Angle (CTA), the angle formed by the tibia base plate and the mechanical axis
      of the tibia. The post-operative radiographic measurements were compared with the
      intra-operative readings from the pinless navigation system. The accepted values used in our
      study for normal alignment were: 1) 0° ± 3° varus/valgus for HKA; 2) perpendicular (± 3°) to
      the mechanical axis of the femur; 3) perpendicular (± 3°) to the mechanical axis of the
      tibia.
