    
      PILAR is a non-interventional, observational, international registry on the use of oral
      antipsychotics in a naturalistic setting in patients with schizophrenia. Patients initiating
      a new oral antipsychotic treatment are candidates for documentation in this registry. All
      patients should be treated according to local labeling specifications. The overall study
      objective is to document prescribing patterns in daily clinical practice and to assess
      long-term treatment outcomes related to initiation of treatment with oral antipsychotics in a
      naturalistic setting. The primary objective is to prospectively document over one year
      treatment outcomes and healthcare utilization data that will enable a cost-effectiveness
      analysis of paliperidone ER compared to other oral antipsychotic treatments. Additional
      objectives are to retrospectively collect data over one year, which will allow the evaluation
      of treatment outcomes before and after treatment initiation with paliperidone ER or other
      oral antipsychotics. Evaluation of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) and Serious Adverse Drug
      Reactions (SADR) for the retrospective period, and Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse
      Events (SAE) during the prospective period will be performed and reported. Dosing and
      administration of all treatments should be prescribed at the physician's discretion, and
      should be based on approved local labels. Dose adjustments or medication changes should be
      made by the treating physician based on clinical judgment and usual practice. Subjects should
      receive their medication according to usual care in their treatment setting, and no study
      drug will be provided. The documentation of the treatment will last one year.
