      influence on the natural history of prostate cancer. Bone-targeted therapy, when given
      sequentially with hormonal therapy (androgen suppression) and radiation therapy, prolongs the
      progression of the disease in clinically non-metastatic prostate cancer patients.

      The use of Samarium-153 EDTMP in conjunction with hormonal therapy and external beam
      radiation therapy has never been previously evaluated in high risk clinically localized
      prostate cancer. Many patients with high-risk prostate cancer develop progressive disease
      within 2 years of therapy indicating that subclinical metastatic disease may be present at
      the time of initial diagnosis. In these high-risk patients, there may be a therapeutic
      benefit of combining hormonal therapy with external beam radiation therapy and Samarium-153
      EDTMP to treat localized and subclinical bony disease, respectively.
