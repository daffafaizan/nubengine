        -  Arm A: patients will receive N2O (60% N2O/40% O2) in an open-label fashion during
           surgery and vitamin supplementation (vitamin B12, 1 mg, and folate, 5 mg) before
           surgery.

        -  Arm B: patients will receive N2O 60% N2O/40% O2) in an open-label fashion during surgery
           and placebo before and after surgery.

        -  Arm C: patients will not receive N2O, vitamin supplementation, or placebo during/before
           surgery. Patients in this arm will not be randomized.

      Patients will have blood drawn (total of 1-2 teaspoons over 3 days). We will take these
      samples before their surgery, when their surgery is completed, and in the morning of
      post-operative day 1. We will be checking their troponin I and troponin T, homocysteine,
      Vitamin B12, and folate levels. We will also perform a 12-lead EKG. Before and after surgery
      for patients in Arm A or B, will receive either vitamin B12 (1 mg) and folic acid (5 mg) (or
      placebo) added to their IV infusion. We also plan to use a non-invasive test known as a nerve
      conduction study to measure the function of their nerve system. Briefly, 2 small electrodes
      are attached to their skin over a nerve and, like an EKG, faint electrical pulses are
      generated and recorded. A typical nerve conduction measurement lasts about 10 minutes.

      After the patients surgery we will do genetic testing of MTHFR genotype.

      All study samples have been collected.

      Of note: there were no secondary outcomes.
