      cardiac surgery done through sternotomy, even though the majority of cardiac surgeries
      utilize this approach. Moderate to severe pain is common in patients undergoing these
      surgeries and is usually inadequately treated. Other various pain treatment modalities such
      as opioid and neuraxial anesthesia are avoided due to potentially dangerous side effects in
      this cohort. The efficacy of local anesthesia techniques, such as bupivacaine, are limited
      due to short duration of action and increased incidence of wound infection. On the other
      hand, slow release liposomal bupivacaine may last up to 72 hours, indicating it's potential
      for more adequate analgesia compared to bupivacaine.
