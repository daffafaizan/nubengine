    
      Objective: To determine whether high dose statin therapy in patients with aspirin mono
      antiplatelet therapy who had received drug-eluting stent (DES) previously and were free of
      the adverse cardiac events during the first 12 months could be superior over pravastatin
      therapy in the prevention of late adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events during the
      additional 12 months.

           randomization. Additional long-term follow-up (2- or 3-year) will be preceded in the
           next plan after 1-year study period.

        -  Subjects with coronary artery diseases who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria
