      routine Ultrasound scan for assessment of venous insufficiency , assessment evaluation of
      pain and participants meets our study's inclusion criteria will be provided with full
      research information, if they decide to participate. Once the routine assessment is done.
      Ultrasound will be performed to obtain the following parameters:

      the RT (second), the PRV (cm/s) and the flow at peak reflux(mL/s) . photo plethysmography
      (PPG) can be used to measure the severity of the venous reflux disease time (RT).

      Therefore, if advanced ultrasound applications can promise a precise, cost-effective,
      convenient, and repeatable results for the follow-up of CVI , it would be of an extreme
      benefit to use ultrasound scan diagnoses anatomy of lower limb for Chronic venous
      insufficiency patients rather than PPG . photoplethysmography : the non-invasive technique of
      assessing pressure without a needle .

      assessment evaluation of pain CHEPS (contact heat evoked potentials ): a beneficial objective
      tool to measure small nerve fibre function CHEPS provides a clinically practical,
      non-invasive and objective measure, .Therefore heat pulses could be annoying for the patient
      .and it is cost effectetive machine and require a special training .

      VAS visual analogue scale :

      Subjective tool to measure the intensity of chronic and acute pain.some of this tool issue is
      a sensitive tool to use by patients and there is some changes in pain intensities because it
      is little variable
