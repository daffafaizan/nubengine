    
      The study is that of a prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial of patients
      presenting for elective primary TKR to compare the outcomes of TKR using conventional soft
      tissue balancing with a tensiometer device versus augmenting the soft tissue balancing with
      the OrthoSensor VerasenseTM sensor device. The primary outcome will be rate of unbalanced
      TKRs based on the quantitative Verasense definition of a well balanced knee defined as a
      mediolateral intercompartmental loading difference of â‰¤15 pounds through ROM. Secondary
      outcomes include differences in clinical outcome scores and patient satisfaction among sensor
      guided cases and controls.

      Patients will be randomized to receive TKR with the Triathlon total knee system (Stryker) in
      the case and control group according to: (1) control group with standard balancing techniques
      used and sensor data obtained in blinded fashion and not used to balance the TKR implant, (2)
      experimental case group with sensor guided balancing where sensor data is used to balance the
      TKR within defined parameters.
