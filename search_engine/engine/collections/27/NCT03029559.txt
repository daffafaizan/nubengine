      threshold loading (ITL) will result in increased inspiratory muscle strength and ventilation.

      Investigators will use a Latin square, repeated measures design which will consist of 12
      subjects participating in four experimental conditions.There will be an interval of 1 week
      between each of the four conditions, which will serve as a washout period.

      At the end of each of the 5 sessions, the subjects will rest in a reclining chair for 15
      minutes while their heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and breathing are
      monitored. Subjects that have a blood systolic blood pressure > 140 or diastolic pressure >
      90 or SPO2 < 92% will be asked to remain in the laboratory for 15 additional minutes and the
      vital signs will be repeated. If the blood pressure and/or peripheral capillary oxygen
      saturation (SPO2) remain outside of the criteria mentioned above, the subject will be
      instructed to seek assessment by their health provider and the incident will be reported to
      the Institutional Review Board. Subjects will also be asked to report any discomfort.
