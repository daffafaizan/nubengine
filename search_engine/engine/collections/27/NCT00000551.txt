      A conference on physical activity sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
      (NHLBI) in August 1991 recommended that one priority area for research should be the
      development and evaluation of interventions for adoption and maintenance of physical activity
      including interventions that can be incorporated into primary care practice. The 1992 NHLBI
      Working Group Report on Primary Prevention of Hypertension identified physical inactivity as
      a risk factor for hypertension. Intervention research applicable to health-care settings is
      particularly important in light of national recommendations advising health-care
      professionals to intervene, including Healthy People 2000, the U.S. Preventive Services Task
      Force reports, and the American Heart Association.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, multicenter, demonstration and education study. Men and women primary care
      patients at three sites in Dallas, Palo Alto, and Memphis were randomized to two patient
      education intervention groups or to a standard care control group of physician advice.
      Intervention continued for two years for all participants. The primary outcomes were
      cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity. Other outcomes were effects on blood
      pressure, lipoproteins, and weight; the long-term maintenance of these effects; and the
      cost-effectiveness of various intervention approaches. Recruitment took 15 months and has
      been completed with the accrual of 874 subjects.

      The National Institute on Aging participated in the ACT through the addition of a measurement
      of arterial stiffness involving approximately 700 patients. The NIA tested the hypothesis
      that increases in physical activity resulting from educational interventions could reduce
      arterial stiffness.
