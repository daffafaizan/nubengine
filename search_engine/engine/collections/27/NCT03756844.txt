      Food Club for decreasing food selectivity and increasing mealtime quality for children with
      developmental disabilities. Baseline data was collected during the time that participants
      spent on the wait list for treatment. Treatment data was collected each week during treatment
      session. This protocol produced a significant change in both the number of foods the children
      in the study ate as well as the parents perception of mealtime quality.
