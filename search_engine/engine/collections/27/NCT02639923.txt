      The investigators plan to include 60 patients with minor head injury (MHI) admitted to our
      hospital within one year (1-2 each week):

      1. 30 patients in the CCT pos. group, i.e. patients with an intracranial hematoma on
      emergency CT scan. 2. 30 patients with MHI in the CCT neg. group, i.e. patients without an
      intracranial traumatic lesion on emergency CT-scan. 3. Additionally, 30 healthy volunteers
      will be included.

      Patients with multiple injuries i.e. polytraumatized patients, patients with severe traumatic
      brain injury, patients with open fractures and fractures of the long bones, as well as
      pregnant patients and patients <18 years, are excluded from the study.

      Patients with a GCS (Glascow Coma Scale) of 13-15 are usually able to consent to be enrolled
      in the clinical trial. Generally, their reasoning and judgment is not impaired.

      The objective of the study is to compare 3 groups on the microRNA serum levels.

      The investigators plan to draw blood from a peripheral catheter in the patients of groups 1
      and 2 (within 6 hours) after arrival at the hospital together with the routine laboratory
      investigations. Additionally, blood will be obtained from healthy volunteers (group 3).
