        -  Evaluate tumor response and toxicity induced by fluorouracil and doxorubicin HCl
           liposome combined with mild systemic hyperthermia in patients with metastatic breast,
           ovarian, endometrial, or cervical cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a time-escalation study of systemic hyperthermia.

      Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1-5 and doxorubicin HCl
      liposome IV over 30 minutes on day 6. Beginning on day 7, patients receive heat applied for
      6-24 hours (in 6-hour sequential treatments) using a mild hyperthermia-induction device.
      Treatment repeats every 4-5 weeks for a total of 4 courses. Patients who achieve less than a
      complete response but have no disease progression may receive additional courses of
      chemotherapy alone.

      Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating durations of hyperthermia until the recommended
      phase II duration is determined. The recommended phase II duration of hyperthermia is defined
      as the level preceding that at which 1 of 5 patients experiences measurable toxicity. (Phase
      I closed as of 9/28/01)

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 34 patients will be accrued for this study within 48 months.
