    
      This study is a multi-centered, multi-country, prospective, non-randomized, observational
      study, without concurrent or matched controls, conducted under a common protocol. Bayesian
      methods will be used for the design and analysis of this study. The Bayesian model will
      determine if the data for the valve configurations are poolable. Bayesian methods also
      provide a means of determining the appropriate stopping time for the study based on the
      amount of information generated. The objectives of this study are to confirm the clinical
      safety and efficacy of the SJM Epic Valve by establishing the following:

        -  adverse effect rates

        -  clinical status as indicated by NYHA functional classification

        -  hemodynamic performance
