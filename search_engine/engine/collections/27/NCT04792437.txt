    
      1. Through high-throughput sequencing technologies such as， genome sequencing,
           transcriptome sequencing and single-cell sequencing, Proteomics，Metabonomics and
           Metagenomics， the similarities and differences of the glioma immune microenvironment
           within and between individuals were revealed from the multi-dimensional and big data
           level, and the immune molecular typing of glioma was established.

        2. Establish and verify that the neoantigen polypeptides predicted by AI algorithm after
           analyzing multi-omics data (genome, transcriptome, etc.) have good killing effect on
           individual tumor cells.

        3. To establish an intelligent evaluation model of glioma immunotyping by integrating
           imaging, pathology, high-throughput sequencing data and other omics information, and to
           provide a visual tool for monitoring changes in the intratumoral microenvironment of
           glioma patients, with the expectation of helping timely intervention of immunotherapy in
           patients with recurrence.
