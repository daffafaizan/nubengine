      induce positive effects on bone and cardiovascular health in a healthy population. For
      example, Hagins et al. (2007) reported that the metabolic costs of Hatha Yoga, averaged
      across the entire session, represent low levels of physical activity (walking). On the other
      hand, Ashtanga Yoga, or power Yoga, is performed at a higher intensity than Hatha Yoga and
      has been shown to elicit significantly higher heart rates than either Hatha or gentle Yoga
      (Cowen and Adams, 2007). Sun Salutations (SS) are an example of an Ashtanga Yoga sequence,
      where yoga postures are performed dynamically with combinations of forward and backward
      bending poses (Omkar et al., 2011). A previous 8-month yoga intervention found that regular
      long-term Ashtanga yoga had a small positive effect on bone formation in premenopausal women.
      Although Yoga has the potential to be an alternative physical activity to improve bone health
      and arterial stiffness, there is a lack of high-quality evidence for this type of
      intervention. Thus, the purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a 12-week
      home-based dynamic yoga intervention designed to improve bone metabolism and arterial
      stiffness in healthy premenopausal women.
