    
      OBJECTIVES: Determine whether adjuvant therapy with portal hepatic perfusion of
      5-fluorouracil and sodium heparin effectively prolongs the disease-free interval and
      increases survival in patients undergoing curative resection of adenocarcinoma of the colon.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients are randomized preoperatively; those randomized to Arm 1
      begin therapy intraoperatively or within 6 hours of colonic resection. Arm 1: 5-Fluorouracil
      plus sodium heparin. Those randomized to Arm 2 receive no adjuvant therapy. Arm 2:
      observation (no further treatment).

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,334 patients will be entered over a 4-year period.
