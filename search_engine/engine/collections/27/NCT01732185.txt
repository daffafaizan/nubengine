      individual of normal lung and localized lung malformation. Among these malformations,
      congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM) represent the most important group, with
      an estimated incidence between 1/11 000 and 1/35 000 births. The precise mechanisms leading
      to these lung malformations remain poorly understood. This project aims to identify key
      genetic and/or molecular mechanisms associated with the occurrence of CCAM. CCAMs are
      collected during postnatal surgical resection. Parental agreement is required. A standardised
      histologic description of malformations is performed for each sample. Normal lung tissue at
      the periphery of the malformation is considered as control. Malformations will be analyzed in
      a systematic way by proteome and transcriptome, after laser microdissection. Somatic genetic
      abnormalities will also systematically be sought.
