      comparing 10% Terbinafine HCl Nail Lacquer vs. Placebo Nail Lacquer (i.e., vehicle control).
      For comparative purposes, the study also included a contemporaneous assessment of 1% Lamisil®
      Cream (1% terbinafine HCl) and Lamisil® Tablets (terbinafine HCl labeled as 250 mg of
      terbinafine).

      Forty (40) onychomycosis (Groups 1 and 2) and 16 tinea pedis (Group 3) patients were enrolled
      at 3 study centers. In Group 1, 10% Terbinafine HCl Nail Lacquer, and, in Group 2, its
      vehicle (0% terbinafine HCl), were applied topically by brushing on a dose volume of
      approximately 10 μL per nail twice daily for 28 days to each toenail and to 5 mm of adjacent
      skin. The patients visited the study center on Days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 for assessments of
      clinical signs and to obtain blood samples. In addition, a 24-hour urine sample was collected
      and assessed on Day 28 and Day 35. Fifty six (56) patients (20 in Group 1, 20 in Group 2, and
      16 in Group 3) received a single oral dose of a 250 mg Lamisil® Tablet after a 7-day washout
      period.

      For comparative purposes, the study also evaluated the local and systemic safety, and plasma
      levels of terbinafine, and its 3 major metabolites (i.e., desmethyl terbinafine, carboxybutyl
      terbinafine, and desmethyl carboxybutyl terbinafine) following administration of 1% Lamisil®
      Cream in comparison with 10% Terbinafine HCl Nail Lacquer. In Group 3, approximately 0.5 g of
      1% Lamisil® Cream was applied twice a day for 7 days to the area of the foot affected with
      tinea pedis. The patients visited the study center on Day 3 and on Day 7 for assessments of
      clinical signs and collection of blood samples. A 24-hour urine sample was collected and
      assessed on Day 7 and Day 14.
