    
      -  This is a 12-week, multicentre,randomized,open-label,active-controlled, paralleled-group
           study.

        -  Chinese patients aged â‰¥40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD are eligible for this
           study.

             1. If satisfying the entry criteria, patients enter an 8 to 14 day run-in period,and
                replace previous bronchodilators with inhaled or nebulized Salbutamol.

             2. Patients record daily severity ratings for daytime symptoms of shortness of breath,
                tiredness, activity limitation, frustration with symptoms, and night-time sleep
                symptoms on daily cards.

             3. Each symptom is rated using 0-100 visual analog scal (VAS). For overall assessment
                of daytime symptoms, a combined symptom score is obtained by adding VAS scores for
                shortness of breath, tiredness, activity limitation, frustration with symptoms.

             4. Patients are required to be symptomatic as demonstrated by a combined daytime
                symptom score of 120 on at least 4 of the 7 days prior to randomization.

             1. Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1) to the following 2 treatments for 12
                weeks.

                  1. Inhaled Salmeterol/Fluticasone propionate 50/500ug twice daily or inhaled
                     IB/ALB 36/206ug QID.

                  2. Salbutamol will be provided for relief of symptoms on an "as required" basis
                     during the whole 12 weeks.

             2. A Follow-up visit will be conducted 2 weeks after completion of treatment/early
                withdrawal to assess for any adverse effects after discontinuing study treatment.
