      drugs such as methotrexate to control joint pain and swelling. Often times rheumatoid
      arthritis patients experience inadequate response to methotrexate with acute or persistent
      joint pain and swelling. In these patients, alternative or additional immunosuppressive
      therapy is needed to induce disease remission. In the present clinical trial, ACTHAR is being
      studied to induce disease remission on rheumatoid arthritis patients who have inadequate
      response to methotrexate therapy.
