      cardiosurgical patients, it is necessary to know the hemostatic potential. After blood
      samples have been taken for coagulation diagnosis, they are usually sent to the central
      laboratory. After analysis and validation, the results are transmitted electronically. The
      loss of time due to sample transport, analysis and provision of the results prolongs the time
      required to derive therapeutic measures.

      In recent years, point of care testing (POCT) devices for the diagnosis of coagulopathic
      patients have become increasingly important. In our clinic, POCT devices have been routinely
      used for intra- and postoperative targeted coagulation therapy for years. These include the
      ROTEM delta and Multiplate. For analysis, a whole blood sample is pipetted together with test
      reagents. Depending on the selected reagent, different parts of the coagulation cascade can
      be evaluated and, depending on this, an appropriate therapy can be derived. A coagulation
      algorithm developed in our clinic is based on these measurement results and has been used
      successfully for years for perioperative coagulation management. This algorithm requires
      additional information on the platelet function, which is also carried out as standard on the
      bed side using multi-plate analysis as POCT.

      A new system for whole blood analysis has recently become available on the market. The
      Quantra from HemoSonics also allows the analysis of a whole blood sample on the bed side. Due
      to the cassette structure, the time-consuming and potentially error-prone pipetting of a
      whole blood sample is no longer necessary. The aim of this study is to develop a coagulation
      algorithm based on Quantra POCT for the treatment of coagulopathic cardiac surgery patients.
