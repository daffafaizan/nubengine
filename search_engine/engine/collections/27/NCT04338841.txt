      The Delphi method is used to reach a consensus of a large panel of experts and to define an
      easy-to-use clinical rule aiming to help emergency physicians in hospitalisation or
      outpatient management decision making : the HOME-CoV rule.

      The impact of the rule implementation is evaluated in a before and after study:

        -  before period: observational assessment of current practices

        -  implementation period : educational lectures, posters, and pocket cards showing and
           explaining HOME-CoV rule are communicated to participating Emergency Departments.

        -  after period : observational assessment of practices

      In each period, patients consulting Emergency Departments with suspected or probable COVID-19
      are evaluated for potential inclusion. Clinical, biological and imaging data that may be
      involved in decision-making about hospitalization are collected as well as the physician
      final decision (hospitalization or outpatient management) and its main determinants.

      A phone-call follow-up is performed and the clinical status according to the Ordinal Scale
      for Clinical Improvement of COVID-19 from the World Heath Organization is collected on day 7
      and day 28 following inclusion.
