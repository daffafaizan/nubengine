    
      Specific Aim #1: To determine the association of a mixture of paternal urinary concentrations
      of phthalate metabolites, BPA and parabens with the primary outcomes of implantation failure
      and live birth, and the secondary outcomes of chemical pregnancy (with no subsequent clinical
      pregnancy) and spontaneous abortion.

      Hypothesis 1: Higher paternal urinary concentrations of a mixture of anti-androgenic
      phthalate metabolites of DEHP, DBP, DiBP, BBzP, and DiNP is associated with increased risk of
      implantation failure and reduced live birth rate, and increased risk of chemical pregnancy
      and spontaneous abortion.

      Hypothesis 2: Higher paternal urinary concentrations of a mixture of estrogenic chemicals
      (BPA and parabens) is associated with increased risk of implantation failure and reduced live
      birth rate, and increased risk of chemical pregnancy and spontaneous abortion.

      Specific Aim #2: To determine the association of a mixture of maternal urinary concentrations
      of phthalate metabolites, BPA and parabens with implantation failure and live birth rate, and
      the secondary outcomes of chemical pregnancy and spontaneous abortion.

      Hypothesis 2: Higher maternal urinary concentrations of a mixture of anti-androgenic
      phthalate metabolites of DEHP, DBP, DiBP, BBzP, and DiNP is associated with increased risk of
      implantation failure and reduced live birth rate, and increased risk of chemical pregnancy
      and spontaneous abortion.

      Hypothesis 3: Higher maternal urinary concentrations of a mixture of estrogenic BPA and
      parabens is associated with increased risk of implantation failure and reduced live birth
      rate, and increased risk of chemical pregnancy and spontaneous abortion.

      Specific Aim #3: To determine the joint effect of maternal and paternal urinary
      concentrations of phthalate metabolites, BPA and parabens with primary outcomes of interest
      including implantation failure and live birth rate, and the secondary outcomes of chemical
      pregnancy and spontaneous abortion.
