      patients in an earlier stage of HIV-1 infection tended to tolerate SC IL-2 better than those
      with more advanced infections, and those with higher baseline CD4+ counts tended to derive
      the greatest benefit.

      Patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms; patients receive either low-dose or
      high-dose SC IL-2 for 5 days either on a monthly or bimonthly schedule for approximately 6
      months.
