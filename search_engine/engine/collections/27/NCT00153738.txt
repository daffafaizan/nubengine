      metabolism. It is expected that this dose will significantly reduce LDL cholesterol after 12
      weeks of supplementation.

      The study recruited 72 men and women 20-70 years of age with mild hypercholesteremia (>130
      mg/dl LDL-C). They were assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Participants ingested the supplement or a
      placebo for 12 weeks, with an interim assessment at 6 weeks. Participants agreed to maintain
      current diet, medication, and exercise habits and to not donate blood during the trial.
