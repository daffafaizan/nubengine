      laboratory tasks used successfully to show deficits of cognitive control over cocaine and
      nicotine cues, and to objectively measure stimulus salience and craving/arousal in response
      to alcohol cues. To achieve the study's two specific aims, participants with AUD will be
      assessed with antisaccade (to measure cognitive control) and attentional bias (to measure
      stimulus salience and pupil diameter) eye tracking tasks.

      Specific Aim 1. To isolate and preliminarily assess the impact of specific CBT
      microinterventions on potentially malleable hypothesized mechanisms of change in drinking
      using a novel laboratory paradigm and conducted by a translational science team.

      Specific Aim 2. To test specificity of CBT interventions' effect on particular Mechanisms of
      Behavioral Change, the investigators will test each microintervention's effects on all three
      purported mechanisms (as stated in "Brief Summary".)
