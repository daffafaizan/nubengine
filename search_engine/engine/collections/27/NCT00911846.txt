      much is known about patients' and their therapists' attitudes towards substitution
      medication. Our hypothesis is that the attitude towards buprenorphine is more positive than
      towards methadone even in patients taking methadone. Better knowledge about the influence of
      attitudes on treatment success could facilitate to adapt therapy to the patients' needs.
