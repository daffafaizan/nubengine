    
      This study is designed to show similar efficacy but a different adverse event profile between
      the three regimens. Its main purpose is to provide more information, if steroid free
      immunosuppressive treatment is a valuable alternative in the treatment of de novo kidney
      transplant recipients and that it is possible to withdraw calcineurin inhibitors after 3
      months in this steroid free protocol. A secondary rationale of the study is to compare
      sirolimus with everolimus directly to better differentiate these two mTOR-inhibitors in terms
      of compound-specific effects and class-effects. This should allow for early conclusions on
      the usage of these two mTOR-inhibitors in CNI-free regimens.

      Basis for this study are the following hypotheses regarding the first 6 months of treatment
      following kidney transplantation:

        -  Similar graft function in the three treatment groups after 6 months

        -  No difference in graft and patient survival in the three groups

        -  No differences in incidence of first, total number, type of acute rejections, and number
           of anti-rejection treatments in the three groups

        -  No differences in number of patients successfully withdrawn from calcineurin inhibitor
           in the sirolimus and everolimus arm, respectively

        -  A different adverse event profile with regard to the incidence of dyslipidemias,
           impaired fasting glucose, new onset diabetes mellitus, de novo post-transplant insulin
           dependency, histological signs of calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, and tubulointerstitial
           nephrotoxicity in the three groups. In addition to this the incidence of mTOR-inhibitor
           specific adverse events will be analysed.

      These hypotheses are the basis for the study objectives.
