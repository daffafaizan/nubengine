      diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. Up to a third of prostate cancer deaths
      occur when cancer spreads to other parts of the body known as metastatic prostate cancer,
      which is a major healthcare burden. Currently, physicians use a maximum of six cycles of
      Docetaxel and continue Abiraterone until disease progression with long term androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT).

      There is no early test to indicate if treatment is working for patients with metastatic
      prostate cancer. Currently Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is not sensitive enough to guide
      treatment alone. Studies in colorectal, lung and prostate cancers have started looking at
      substance called Plasma tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (ptDNA) and correlated presence of ptDNA
      will early relapse. Therefore, this study will investigate if the detection of ptDNA after
      initiating treatment is associated a worse clinical outcome. Our ultimate aim, is to identify
      which of the current treatment options will work best for patients in the future. This
      research may also identify new targets for the development of new drugs to test in clinical
      trials in the future.

      Assessments will include blood taken before and during treatment and at cancer progression.
      In selected centres, an optional Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WBMRI) will be
      performed before and during treatment for those patients who are eligible. Patients will be
      followed up for a maximum of 5 years at the time they register onto the study. We expect
      recruitment duration to be 18 months.
