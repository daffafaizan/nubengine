      perforator flap with or without split-thickness skin grafting for soft tissue reconstruction
      of the bony defect of the lateral malleolus of the ankle joints. Reconstruction using a
      peroneal artery perforator flap with or without split-thickness skin grafting was performed
      for 10 men and 5 women patients with defects in the lateral malleolus. The mean age was 53.7
      years with the age range between 22 and 89 years, and the mean size of the flaps was 40 cm^2.
      The soft tissue defects were caused by a diabetic foot (6 patients), infected bursitis (1
      patient), chronic osteomyelitis (2 patients), and trauma (6 patients). Three of six diabetes
      mellitus patients also had peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The flaps were elevated in
      the form of a perforator flap, and split-thickness skin grafting was performed over the flaps
      and adjoining raw areas. The pedicled supramalleolar perforator flap is classified into two
      categories: (A) propeller and (B) rotation flaps. The mean follow-up duration was 30 months
      postsurgical.
