      rectal distension (visceral perception) and elasticity / compliance of the anorectum and
      stool consistency is important. A disturbed anorectal function may lead to functional
      defecation disorders or incontinence.

      The currently available methods for measuring physiological assessment of anorectal function
      mostly focus on measurement of sphincter pressures, but generally provide no complete
      explanation for the underlying pathophysiology of defecation disorders. By voluntary
      contraction of the striated muscles of the external anal sphincter and puborectalis muscle
      defecation can be further delayed. In addition, however, other continence mechanisms play an
      important role.

      The Group for the Study of functional gastrointestinal disorders at the Clinic for
      Gastroenterology at the University Hospital of Zurich has a great expertise in the
      establishment of new research methods such as the already in routine clinical practice used
      high-resolution anorectal manometry and has conducted numerous studies with anorectal
      Barostat. To use the results of Barostat also in everyday clinical practice in patients with
      defecation disorders this technique means significant simplification of the instrumental
      methodology and shortening of the work described in the literature. Before the simplified
      barostat can be used with the shortened protocol in different patient groups and clinical
      practice, it generally requires the validation of the technique in healthy subjects to define
      the range of normal values.
