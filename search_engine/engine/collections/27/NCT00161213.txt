      Primary

        -  Evaluate the time to progression in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and imatinib mesylate as
           first-line therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients treated with this regimen who survive 1 year or more.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, uncontrolled study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 120 minutes on days 3 and 10 and oral
      imatinib mesylate on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
