      epidermal cysts. Surgical excision removes the entire cyst but requires a larger hole in the
      skin. A punch incision makes a smaller hole through which the cyst can be removed. The
      trial's purpose is to determine if one method is better than another in terms of recurrence,
      infection, or other side effects.

      Patients with epidermal cysts will be randomized to having the cyst removed by surgical
      excision or by a smaller punch incision followed by removal of the cyst through the smaller
      hole. The skin will be stitched shut in both cases. A short survey about how the cyst affects
      the patient will be given before the cyst is removed. When the stitches are removed 2 weeks
      later, photographs will be taken and a survey regarding satisfaction with the procedure will
      be given. Two additional phone surveys, given at 4 and 12 months after the procedure, wil be
      given to ask about recurrence, satisfaction with the procedure, side effects, and how the
      cyst affected the patient's life. The study doctor will be blinded as to which procedure each
      subject underwent. Forty subjects will be recruited at the Atlanta Veteran's Administration
      Medical Center
