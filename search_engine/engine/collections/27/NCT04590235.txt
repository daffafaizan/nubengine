    
      Paediatric and adult patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and Inoperable Plexiform
      Neurofibromas (PN) will be evaluated in the screening visit to confirm eligibility.
      Approximately 16 paediatric and 16 adult qualified patients will receive oral selumetinib 25
      mg/m^2 twice a day (approximately every 12 hours) continuously until disease progression or
      unacceptable drug-related toxicity, whichever occurs first. Once a patient has discontinued
      the study treatment then the patient will be followed for specified period for safety
      assessment.
