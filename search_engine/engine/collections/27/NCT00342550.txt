      have reported that ultrasound evaluation of the cervix can predict the risk of preterm
      delivery. Three-dimensional ultrasound may provide additional information about how to best
      counsel parents about the chances of premature birth. This technology has the capability for
      accurate volume measurements of irregular structures that is superior to conventional
      ultrasound. Therefore, it is possible that three-dimensional ultrasound methods may better
      characterize cervical changes and the risk for preterm delivery.

      Our protocol will attempt to identify prognostic indicators of adverse pregnancy outcome by
      three-dimensional ultrasound. A maximum of 680 pregnant women with the diagnosis of preterm
      labor will be prospectively studied to characterize cervical morphology and volume as
      predictors of preterm delivery risk. These results will be correlated with maternal and fetal
      biological markers, placental pathology and pregnancy outcome. We will also compare the
      performance of conventional two-dimensional endovaginal ultrasound with three-dimensional
      ultrasound findings. This information is expected to improve our understanding about the
      nature and timing of cervical volume changes in relation to pregnancy outcome.
