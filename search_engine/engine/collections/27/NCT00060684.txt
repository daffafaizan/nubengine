      and contains the chemotherapy agents mitoxantrone, fludarabine, dexamethasone (a steroid) and
      the monoclonal antibody rituximab. In this trial we are replacing mitoxantrone with
      pixantrone, an agent with a similar chemical structure (both agents are DNA intercalators).
      The trial is being run in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL and aims to
      define the appropriate dose of pixantrone to be used in this combination, as well as to
      obtain data on pixantrone's safety and activity profile in combination with these drugs.

      This trial is expected to recruit up to 30 patients in the USA. Patients will be treated with
      the drug combination for up to eight months and then followed closely in the four-week period
      after the last administration. After that, patients will receive physician check-ups every
      three months.
