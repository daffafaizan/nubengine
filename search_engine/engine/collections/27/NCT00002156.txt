      15 (Induction) then every 14 days (maintenance), with ganciclovir given daily during both
      Induction and Maintenance. Escalation to the second dose does not occur until all patients at
      the first dose level have reached their first maintenance dose (day 29). In Stage 2 of the
      study, 174 patients are randomized to receive either a) ISIS 2922 at the dose established in
      Stage 1 on days 1, 8, and 15 and then every 14 days, with ganciclovir given daily during both
      Induction and Maintenance, or b) ganciclovir daily for 14 consecutive days and then a lower
      dose as maintenance. Patients may continue to receive ISIS 2922 biweekly if the dose is safe
      and their CMV retinitis is clinically controlled. Per 2/8/96 amendment, patients are now in
      Stage 2 at 150 mcg.
