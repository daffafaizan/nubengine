      Although this approach substantially improves local control and reduces deaths from breast
      cancer, it also results in some severe late side-effects, including skin fibrosis, deaths
      from radiation-induced cardiac disease and lung cancer. We will undertake a novel approach to
      the evaluation of radiation-induced toxicity during and after whole breast irradiation (RT)
      following breast-conserving surgery, with the long-term strategic goal of minimizing RT
      toxicity in early breast cancer. Theoretically, it is possible to achieve this goal through
      very highly conformal RT delivery and avoidance of RT in toxicity-prone individuals where
      possible. We plan to evaluate the utility of genomic analysis, cellular DNA repair
      competence, and functional imaging endpoints as predictive markers of toxicity in our breast
      cancer population. This program is expected to (a) prospectively validate that HT for breast
      RT can decrease acute toxicity whilst maintaining excellent cancer control after BCS; (b)
      demonstrate that novel surrogate markers will aid in the prediction of acute and/or late
      normal tissue toxicity with a view to identify toxicity-prone (or conversely, robust)
      individuals from amongst the breast cancer population.
