    
      A multi-center, randomized, clinical trial with two arms to study the efficacy and safety of
      passive immunotherapy with CP compared to a control of standard of care (SOC).

      All trial participants will receive SOC:

        -  Treatment arm: Pathogen-reduced CP from patients recovered from COVID-19, whom, for the
           purpose of this trial, are herein designated as donors.

        -  Control arm: SOC for COVID-19.

      Randomization among the two arms will be 1:1 and will be stratified per center. Of note, in
      the current status of a worldwide pandemic for which we have no approved vaccines or drugs,
      for the purpose of this trial SOC would also accept any drugs that are being used in clinical
      practice (e.g. lopinavir/ritonavir; darunavir/cobicistat; hydroxy/chloroquine, tocilizumab,
      etc.), other than those used as part of another clinical trial.

      The study is planned with a sequential design. Interim analyses: comprehensive safety data
      monitoring analyses will be conducted when 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of patients, or at the
      discretionary DSMB criteria when needed. A DSMB charter will be set before the trial
      initiation where criteria for prematurely stopping the trial due to safety issues will be
      set. Interim analyses will be predefined upfront based on the DSMB recommendations.
