      stimulated whole salivary flow in patients with head and neck cancer. II. Determine whether
      prophylactic use of pilocarpine can moderate xerostomia in these patients. III. Determine
      whether prophylactic use of pilocarpine can reduce the grade and duration of radiation
      induced mucositis in these patients. IV. Evaluate quality of life outcomes between patients
      receiving pilocarpine versus placebo. V. Evaluate the impact of xerostomia on patients
      receiving irradiation to the head and neck.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind study. Patients receive a central axis midplane
      dose of radiotherapy five days per week over 6 to 7 weeks. Oral pilocarpine or placebo is
      administered beginning 3 days prior to radiotherapy, one tablet four times per day for three
      months. A tablet will be taken 45-60 minutes before radiotherapy. After three months, and
      after a 3-4 day rest period, all patients receive non blinded pilocarpine for an additional
      three month period. Patients are followed at weeks 4, 13, and 26 after the start of
      radiotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 244 patients will be accrued (122 per treatment arm).
