    
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders in
      children. Children with ADHD often have impaired functioning in home and school and usually
      experience difficulty relating to peers. If left untreated, the disorder can have long-term
      adverse effects into adolescence and adulthood. Atomoxetine is a selective noradrenergic
      reuptake inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD in children, adolescents,
      and adults. Unlike most other medications for ADHD, atomoxetine is not a stimulant. Studies
      have shown that atomoxetine is effective in treating ADHD, but more information is needed on
      its effectiveness in young children. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of
      atomoxetine in reducing the symptoms of ADHD in young children.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      atomoxetine or placebo for 8 weeks. In addition, all children will receive parent training
      for the duration of the study. For the first 5 weeks, participants will report to the study
      site weekly for assessments of ADHD symptoms. Study visits will occur every other week for
      the remainder of the study.
