      twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Abnormalities of the motor cortex
      have been shown in patients with focal hand dystonia. In addition it is well known that
      dystonic patients have co-contraction of their antagonist muscles, and that individualized
      finger movements are imprecise and difficult. Motor training such as "constraint-induced
      movement therapy" has been described to be successful in patients with musician's cramp. We
      therefore hypothesize that motor training with training of individualized finger movements
      could improve focal hand dystonia in patients with writer's cramp. We propose to study one
      group of twelve patients with either pure or dystonic writer's cramp. Patients will receive
      individualized finger training with immobilization of fingers that are not in training.
      Evaluation for improvement will be done with a handwriting analysis program developed by Mai
      and Marquardt, and clinical evaluation with the Fahn-Dystonia Scale.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have shown that patients with dystonia have
      less intracortical inhibition compared with normal subjects, leading to excessive cortical
      activity and possibly to co-contraction of agonist-antagonist groups of muscles of the
      forearm resulting in dystonic posturing. Furthermore, studies in other basal ganglia
      disorders as well as dystonia have suggested that the movement related cortical potentials
      might show plastic changes that reflect the degree of "successful" performance of a motor
      task. We therefore would like to evaluate the excitability of the motor cortex before and
      after the training with TMS and movement related cortical potentials.
