      intervention to improve lipid control in patients with diabetes. Our patient population is
      predominantly low-income and Latino. Using our diabetes registry, we randomly assigned 381
      patients to continue with their usual care and 381 to participate in our nurse run program.
      Three registered nurses learned algorithms for diabetes care. These algorithms address
      management of lipids, glycemic control, blood pressure, nephropathy, aspirin use, eye
      screening, pneumovax and influenza vaccines, obesity, and cigarette smoking. The nurses were
      also trained in motivational interviewing techniques and facilitation of patient
      self-management. The primary goal was to improve lipid control in our diabetic population.
      Secondary outcomes address blood pressure control, glycemic control, renal function, and
      medication adherence. In addition, a cost-effective analysis is being performed.
