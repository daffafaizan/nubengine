    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending
      dose, pilot Phase 2a study in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients requiring
      hemodialysis. Eligible patients will undergo screening assessments and PRS-080#22-DP will be
      administered by intravenous infusion. The study will consist of 2 dose cohorts of 4 mg/kg and
      8 mg/kg body weight with 6 patients in each cohort. Using a standard 4+2 design, 4 patients
      in each cohort will be randomized to PRS-080#022-DP and 2 patients in each cohort will be
      randomized to placebo. The decision to escalate the dose will be based on an interim analysis
      of clinical and laboratory safety as well on a comparison with pharmacokinetic data. Safety
      and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics as well as potential immunogenicity will
      be investigated.
