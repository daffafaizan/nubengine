      children and adolescents. The disorder is associated with high rates of suicide and high-risk
      behaviors like sexual promiscuity and drug abuse. Bipolar disorder in children is also
      associated with high rates of comorbidity, especially with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD). There is a scarcity of clinical trials assessing the effects of medications
      in children with BD. Moreover, the frequent presence of comorbid ADHD might determine lower
      response to treatment. Aripiprazole is a novel anti-psychotic drug. Its mechanism of action
      seems to be related to a stabilization of dopaminergic transmission, acting as a partial
      agonist especially in dopaminergic D2 receptors. It also has effects in 5-HT1a serotonergic
      receptors. Thus, it might have a promising effect in children and adolescents with comorbid
      BD and ADHD. A retrospective chart review, recently published, suggests the efficacy of this
      drug in children with BD. This study aims to assess the efficacy of Aripiprazole associated
      with Methylphenidate (MPH) for the treatment of 20 children and adolescents (age range: 8 to
      17 years-old) with Bipolar Disorder comorbid with ADHD who improve in maniac symptoms while
      receiving aripiprazole but did not have an adequate response in ADHD symptoms. The study
      design is a 4-week randomized, double blind, cross-over group trial. Patients were randomized
      to aripiprazole + MPH or aripiprazole + placebo. The hypotheses are: 1) Aripiprazole + MPH
      will significantly reduce ADHD scores compared to aripiprazole + placebo. 2) Patients
      receiving aripiprazole + MPH will not deteriorate in maniac symptoms.
