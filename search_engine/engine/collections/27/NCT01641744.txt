      children. Yet despite the critical importance of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
      Services, Maternal and Child Health Bureau's goal "to reduce fatal and non-fatal child
      maltreatment," non-empirically supported parenting skills classes remain child welfare
      agencies' standard approach to meeting this goal.

      The study examines the effectiveness of parent-child Group Attachment Based Intervention
      (GABI) in reducing risk of maltreatment in infants and toddlers compared with parenting
      skills classes. GABI directly addresses the needs of isolated, marginalized families, with
      the goals of of enhancing parent coping and resilience, and improving parent-child attachment
      relationships.

      Seventy families with children aged 2-36 months who are referred for parenting help will be
      randomly assigned to either GABI or "treatment as usual" that consists of parents-only
      parenting skills classes. Treatment will be offered for up to 6 months. Both groups will be
      assessed at baseline, end of treatment and at 6 months follow up.
