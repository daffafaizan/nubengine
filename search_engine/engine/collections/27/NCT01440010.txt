      breast conserving surgery with 20 Gy at the applicator surface as an advanced boost followed
      by a shortened external beam radiotherapy. This is a prospective phase IV study to evaluate
      real life data of IORT Boost. Study runs in Germany with 13 active centers recruiting. Due to
      the nature of the study (registry) there is no need for randomization. Inclusion of n = >1000
      patients is planned.
