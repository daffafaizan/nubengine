      Genetic data including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, neurotropic factors,
      glutamate-related genes will be genotyped.

      Environmental disruptors including phthalate and cotinine will be analyzed. Brain MRI data
      including T1, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) will be
      obtained.

      Neuropsychological tests including continuous performance test, Stroop test, Children's color
      trail test, Wisconsin card sorting test will be conducted.

      The investigators plan to identify biomarkers of ADHD using an integrative approach of
      genetic, environmental, neuroimaging and clinical data.
