      depressed patients. it is hypothesized that improving mood state by means of an
      antidepressant drug . namely mirtazapine. could be responsible of alleviating the number of
      appropriate shocks delivered by the cardioverter. this could be due to a direct effect of the
      drug itself or an indirect effect of improving anxious and depressive affect. the mood and
      anxiety state are measured with the HADS scale
