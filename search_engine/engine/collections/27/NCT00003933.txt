        -  Determine the incidence of p16/p15 homozygous deletions and p15 promoter
           hypermethylation in acute lymphocytic leukemia cells of children treated on protocol
           CCG-1941.

        -  Determine the prognostic importance of p16/p15 abnormalities in these children.

        -  Determine the presence or absence of p16/p15 abnormalities in the dominant clone at
           diagnosis if present at relapse in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Frozen cells are obtained from samples collected on protocol CCG-1941. DNA is
      isolated and examined using Southern blot analysis to assay for deletions and promoter
      hypermethylation of p16 and/or p15.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 samples will be obtained for this study.
