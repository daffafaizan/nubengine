      on meta-analyses showing a cholesterol-lowering effect of oat beta-glucan, if the product
      delivers at least a 3g daily dose of oat beta-glucan. However, not all studies have
      demonstrated a lowering of oat products. This may be due to variable bioactivity of the
      beta-glucan in the oat products. The bioactivity of oat beta-glucan is believed to depend
      upon its viscosity in the gut. Factors influencing viscosity include the molecular weight
      (MW) of the beta-glucan molecule and the amount of soluble beta-glucan in the product, which,
      in turn determines its concentration (C) in solution. In finished food products both MW and C
      can be modified by beta-glucanase enzymes present in other ingredients in the food (eg. wheat
      flour), processing (eg. extrusion) and storage (eg. freezing of moist products such as
      muffins). The effect of altering the MW and solubility of beta-glucan in foods on glycemic
      responses has been shown, but a role for MW and C in cholesterol lowering has not been
      established.

      To address this issue, this study was designed with 2 primary objectives:

        1. An extruded oat cereal containing 3g high-molecular weight oat β-glucan daily will
           reduce LDL cholesterol compared to a control wheat bran cereal.

        2. A significant correlation exists between LDL cholesterol and log(C×MW), where C is the
           amount of soluble β-glucan in the daily dose of cereal and MW is the molecular weight of
           the β-glucan in the cereal.
