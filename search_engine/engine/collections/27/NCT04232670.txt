    
      This is a single center, pilot, sham-controlled clinical trial of ERCP with pancreatic
      endotherapy for pain secondary to chronic calcific pancreatitis with main pancreatic duct
      obstruction. Potential subjects will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment including
      Quantitative Sensory Testing, to ensure enrollment criteria are met and baseline covariates
      are measured. Eligible subjects will complete a 14-day run-in period. If eligibility criteria
      persist, subjects will be randomized to diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) + sham
      pancreatic endotherapy or diagnostic EUS + ERCP with pancreatic endotherapy as defined in the
      study protocol. Subjects will be followed by a blinded physician for the next 90 days, at
      which time the pilot trial outcomes will be measured. Regardless of outcomes, all subjects
      will be followed longitudinally for 12 months after randomization.
