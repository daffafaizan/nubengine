    
      The purpose of this study is to assess if, compared with standard paper-based systems, an
      automated Early Warning System (EWS) resident in a spot check patient monitor, can help to
      identify patients in the acute care settings but outside of the intensive care unit, who may
      be experiencing physiological instability and who are in need of rapid clinical intervention
      by a Rapid Response Team (RRT)/ Medical Emergency Team (MET).

      The development of such an automated system by offers a unique opportunity to assess its
      user-friendliness, labour-saving effect, feasibility and clinical utility. Accordingly, we
      plan to conduct a research program aimed at assessing this new approach toward patient
      monitoring.

      This study will use the hospital's Standard of Care protocol for the monitoring of vital
      signs (including timing and vital signs collected) and a commercially available automatic
      spot check monitor to collect data. No investigational procedures or devices are associated
      with this protocol.
