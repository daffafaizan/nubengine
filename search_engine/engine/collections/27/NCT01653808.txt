      transports appears as the treatment modality of choice for hemodialysis patients. Indeed,
      this innovative technique offers an effective dialysis modality removing spectrum of uremic
      solutes with an optimized biocompatibility of the extracorporeal circuit obtained with use of
      ultrapure dialysis and sterile substitution fluids. However, such therapy can not be proposed
      in all dialysis centers due to major drawbacks of this technique over conventional
      hemodialysis, the complexity of the system and its increased costs. Alternatively,
      enhancement of convective transport may now be achieved by use of innovative dialyzers
      allowing more internal filtration. This is the case of ELISIOâ„¢-H dialyzers which possess
      fibers of a greater internal length which potentially allow more internal filtration. Aim of
      the present study was therefore to evaluate efficacy and biocompatibility of internal
      filtration-enhanced hemodialysis using this dialyzer compared to hemodiafiltration, over a
      four-month period.
