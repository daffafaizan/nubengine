      microbiological activity of a moxifloxacin-containing regimen (isoniazid, rifampin,
      pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin [HRZMoxi]) to a control regimen (isoniazid, rifampin,
      pyrazinamide, ethambutol [HRZE]) in the first two months of treatment of sputum
      smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, the study will evaluate whether
      intermittent administration (thrice-weekly after the first 2 weeks) of these regimens affects
      their tolerability and microbiological activity. The assessment of microbiological activity
      will be sputum culture-conversion. Improved sputum culture conversion after 2 months of
      treatment with a moxifloxacin-containing regimen would support phase 3 clinical trials of
      moxifloxacin in treatment regimens of less than the current 6 month standard regimens.
