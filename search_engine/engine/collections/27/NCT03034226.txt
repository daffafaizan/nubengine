      of diabetes. It causes recurrent morbidity in most people with type 1 diabetes and in many
      patients with type 2 diabetes and can be fatal. Episodes of hypoglycemia impair
      physiologically protective mechanism in subsequent episodes of hypoglycemia. This phenomenon
      is known as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), the clinical syndromes of
      defective glucose counter regulation and hypoglycemia unawareness.
