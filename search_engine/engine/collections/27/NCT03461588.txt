      prospectively enrolled. Two types of radiation treatment are delivered based on attending
      physician's preferences: radiation to whole breast +- regional nodal areas with
      free-breathing technique, or with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique. The cardiac
      dose parameters including heart dose and the dose to left anterior coronary artery are
      assessed, and the cardiac toxicities regularly assessed with cardiac
      enzymes,electrocardiogram(ECG) and normal gated single-photon emission computed
      tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging before, during and after radiation.The dose-effect
      relationship of heart injuries is analyzed.
