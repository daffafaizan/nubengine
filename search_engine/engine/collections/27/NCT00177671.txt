      (escitalopram, venlafaxine, or duloxetine) with a medication used in Alzheimer's Disease
      (donepezil), in elderly patients age 65 and older with major depression, will help to 1)
      improve and/or maintain memory, concentration, attention, and problem solving abilities such
      as ability to balance a checkbook, pay bills, use the telephone, and 2) reduce the risk of
      depressive symptoms from returning. Study participation will last up to two years.

      We aim to investigate pharmacologic strategies for improving and stabilizing cognitive
      functioning in late-life depression and minimizing progression of cognitive and associated
      functional impairment. Cognitive impairment in late-life depression has not been adequately
      addressed in previous intervention research, is a core feature of the illness, contributes
      markedly to disability and impaired quality of life, and is an overlooked but potentially
      critical target of intervention. Data from the MTLD II study suggest that treating depression
      does not normalize cognitive functions and may not prevent their progression. We will test a
      pharmacologic strategy involving the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil, in combination with
      maintenance antidepressant pharmacotherapy (escitalopram, venlafaxine, or duloxetine), to
      improve and to maintain cognitive functioning and functional competence in elderly patients
      with major depression.

      We hypothesize that maintenance antidepressant pharmacotherapy combined with donepezil will
      be superior to maintenance antidepressant pharmacotherapy combined with placebo/clinical
      management in (1) improving cognitive performance; and (2) slowing progression of cognitive
      impairment and decline in functional competence. We plan to recruit 200 patients aged 65 and
      above in current episodes of major depression. Those who respond to antidepressant
      pharmacotherapy with citalopram, venlafaxine, or duloxetine will then be randomly assigned on
      a double-blind basis to one of two 24-month treatments: 1)antidepressant pharmacotherapy plus
      donepezil/clinical management; or 2)antidepressant pharmacotherapy plus placebo/clinical
      management.
