    
      This multicenter, prospective clinical trial will examine the diagnostic yield and clinical
      utility of NewbornDx, a targeted genomic sequencing panel for use in the neonate, and rapid
      whole genomic sequencing (rWGS) testing in high-risk infants with signs/symptoms consistent
      with a possible genetic disorder. Infants will undergo NewbornDx and rWGS (proband) testing.
      The biological parent(s), when available, will undergo NewbornDx testing at the same time as
      the infant. For rWGS,the infant will undergo testing first. If a specific diagnosis that is
      consistent with the phenotype is not made with rWGS proband analysis alone, the parent(s)
      will undergo rWGS. The study will also evaluate the cost effectiveness of each test as well
      as standard of care (SOC) testing. A retrospective chart review of infants with suspected
      genetic disorders will be done to understand 1-year cost and health outcomes that would have
      been incurred in the absence of the advanced testing. The resulting data from the trial will
      be used in the economic evaluation comparing NewbornDx, rWGS, and SOC over a 1-year period
      and used as basis to simulate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of these testing strategies. A
      web-based clinical reference database to provide references, clinical management guidelines,
      opportunities for clinical trial participation, and support groups for each condition will be
      developed with separate interfaces for the parent/guardian(s) and medical provider. The
      clinical reference database will be qualitatively assessed by a survey of medical providers.
