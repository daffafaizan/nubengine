    
      An observational, retrospective-case control, multi-center study is proposed to evaluate any
      effects of Sitagliptin on clinical, laboratory and instrumental parameters in the course of
      hospitalization for COVID-19. The data will be extracted anonymously from the computerized
      medical records commonly used in clinical practice by the centers involved in the study. The
      evaluation will be performed by comparing the parameters of COVID-19 positive diabetic
      patients treated with Sitagliptin with those of a group of COVID-19 positive diabetic
      patients not treated with Sitagliptin. All diabetic subjects treated with Sitagliptin (100 mg
      / day, 50 mg / day or 25 mg / day) and all diabetic subjects not treated with Sitagliptin,
      eligible for inclusion / exclusion criteria, will be included in the analysis.

      The clinical data of patients that will be collected anonymously during hospitalization will
      include: smoking habit, remote medical history aimed at assessing the presence of
      comorbidities (atrial fibrillation, heart failure, hypertension, arterial hypertension,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other lung disease, chronic renal failure, decay
      cognitive, Parkinson's disease, autoimmune diseases), pharmacological history (treatment
      introduced during hospitalization for COVID-19, respiratory failure or other complications;
      use of ACE-inhibitors, sartans, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, antiarrhythmics, beta
      blockers, anti-aggregants, anticoagulants, neuroleptics ). Anthropometric parameters
      including blood pressure measurement and BMI will also be collected.

      For all patients, the following data will be collected at the baseline (first data available
      upon entry into the hospitalization regime) and upon discharge:

        -  Clinical picture and symptoms (presence of cough, body temperature, respiratory rate,
           need for ventilatory support, duration of ventilatory support in days, duration of
           oxygen therapy in day, duration of hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit in days, total
           length of stay in days, blood gas parameters, PaO2 / FiO2 ratio, oxygen saturation by
           pulse oximeter)

        -  Routine blood chemistry tests performed in hospitalization (e.g. glycemia, reactive
           protein C, blood count with formula, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood gas analysis,
           LDH, inflammation indices).

        -  Instrumental exams (chest x-ray)

        -  glycated hemoglobin

        -  Serum creatinine and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (estimated with CKD-EPI)

        -  Presence of specific comorbidities for diabetes

        -  Average daily blood sugar levels (from capillary blood)
