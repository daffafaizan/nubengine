      will be measured for 7 days before the study. A research diet that is designed to maintain
      weight will be provided for 3 days before the study and during the study. Multiple tests will
      be performed, including metabolic testing and muscle and fat biopsies, both when participants
      first arrive and have had normal sleep and again after 4 nights of only 5 hours time in bed.
      The visit takes place at the Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) at the University
      of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical campus. It will take approximately 2 weeks to complete
      this study.
