      tympanostomy or tube placement under general anesthesia. Middle ear effusion will be
      collected, divided in two and frozen.

      The investigator will perform ELISA tests to measure the level of MMP2 MMP9 MMP7 et TIMP2
      (inhibitor of MMPs). The investigator want to compare the level of MMPs between healthy
      eardrum and atrophic membrane.

      Clinical data will be collected such as age, gender, chronicity of the OME, quality of the
      eardrum and middle ear effusion type to see if there is any difference when MMPs level is
      higher.
