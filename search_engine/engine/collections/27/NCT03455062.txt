      published in January 2016, found lower rates of implantation, clinical pregnancy, and newborn
      babies in these patients compared to HIV-negative patients.

      Studying the fertility of transplanted immunocompromised women would provide adequate
      information on fertility and pregnancy possibilities for these patients, study their
      fertility on a larger scale and finally better understand the role of immunodepression in
      fertility.

      Pregnancy is considered an allogeneic semi-graft, one can question the fertility of these
      patients under long-term immunosuppressive treatment. In particular, is there an impact on
      embryo implantation and on the development of pregnancy? To try to answer this problematic,
      we propose a retrospective non-interventional study to evaluate the birth rate after
      spontaneous or induced pregnancy in women who have tried to procreate after
      transplantation.The data will be collected using questionnaires submitted to the women
      present in the list of patients transplanted from the Organ Transplant Unit (OTU) of Toulouse
      University Hospital who have agreed to participate. This will make it possible to
      retrospectively study fertility data in these patients and to carry out, with the necessary
      hindsight, statistics on pregnancy rates.

      The primary outcome measure: birth rate after spontaneous or induced pregnancy in liver,
      heart, lung or kidney transplant patients who have attempted to procreate post-transplant is
      a good primary endpoint because it is a unique clinical criterion. relevant to the purpose of
      the study, specific and objective.
