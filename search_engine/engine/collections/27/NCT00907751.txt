    
      Duration of the study:

      3 years and 2 months, including 1 year of inclusion and 2 years of participation for the
      patient.

      Experimental plan:

      Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the study will be treated according to the
      recommendations of the Reference Centre for the management of thrombotic microangiopathies.
      If patients present refractory TTP, infusions of rituximab (375 mg/m2) will be added to this
      treatment at day 1, 4 and 15, immediately after plasma exchange sessions.On diagnosis, during
      treatment and after remission achievement, the following values will be explored: ADAMTS13
      activity, ADAMTS13 inhibitors and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, B-cell lymphocytes quantification
      by immunophenotyping, and serum gammaglobulin level by serum protein electrophoresis.
      Rituximab will also be quantified.

      Number of patients:

      Each participating centre may recruit and include 1 patient/year.Amongst 10 participating
      centres, a total number of 10 patients should be included.

      Specific activities during the study:

      Three infusions of rituximab (375 mg/m2 /infusion), immediately after plasma exchange
      sessions on day 1, 4 and 15. Blood samplings at day 1, 4 and 15, at 1 month and then every 3
      month until month 24.

      Expected results and perspectives:

      This study should provide evidence as to whether the association of rituximab to plasma
      exchanges allo an efficient B-cell depletion. If yes, a randomized study should be performed
      to evaluate the role of rituximab at the acute phase of acquired idiopathic TTP, immediately
      after the diagnosis was established.
