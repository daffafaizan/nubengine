      too ; in the second group again entrance pressure will be 15 mmhg , intraoperative pressure
      will be 12 mmhg ; and in the thirth group both entrance and intraoperative pressures will be
      12 mmhg. During operation intraoperative mean pressures will be recorded every 15 minutes ,
      also end tidal CO2 pressures will also assesed by the anesthesiologist. Every participant
      will take , same standard analgesics ; 2 mg/kg contramal and 1 gr i.v. paracetamol at the end
