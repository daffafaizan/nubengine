      not necessary in patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes who undergo breast
      conserving surgery, whole breast irradiation, and systemic therapy. However, whether or not
      the regional lymph node should be irradiated and if radiation given, whether or not all
      levels of axillary lymph node and internal mammary and supraclavicular lymph node should be
      irradiated is unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of
      axillary level I-II areas radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer with 1-2 positive
      sentinel lymph nodes and no further axillary lymph node dissection.
