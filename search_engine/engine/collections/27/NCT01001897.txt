      require little participation from the woman after insertion. Despite these benefits, few
      women in the US use an IUD. Education is important so that both providers and women
      understand that IUD's are safe and effective in women even if they have never had a child.
      Insertion of an IUD in nulliparous patients can be more difficult and uncomfortable. The
      purpose of this study is to see if use of misoprostol prior to IUD placement in nulliparous
      women can make it easier and less painful. The goal is that more information on the
      feasibility and ease of IUD insertion will make it more accessible to more women. The
      findings from this trial will be used in a prospective meta analysis on this topic.
