    
      This single centre study will be comprised of 4 parts, Part A (SAD; up to 7 cohorts, 8
      subjects per cohort and including an assessment of food effect), a multiple-dose part (up to
      4 doses, 10 subjects per cohort); an elderly cohort (8 subjects per gender) and a proof of
      principle part.

      The single ascending dose part (Part A) comprises of increasing doses of an oral solution or
      capsule, with an investigation of the potential for food effects.

      The multiple ascending dose part (Part B, MAD; 14 days dosing) will be initiated after the PK
      and safety data are available from the single ascending dose part. Subjects in Part B will
      have ultrasound scans of the gallbladder during the study and at screening a HIDA scan will
      be performed. An evaluation of the PK in the elderly and any potential gender differences
      will also be evaluated in Part C. Subjects in Part C will have an ultrasound of the
      gallbladder at screening.

      Part D will be a proof of principle evaluation where the effects of ONO-5788 to inhibit the
      GHRH and arginine-stimulated GH release will be evaluated. Octreotide acetate is a reference
      arm in this part of the study.
