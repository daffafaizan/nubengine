    
      Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome that involves a gradual and generalized loss of the mass
      and strength of the skeletal muscles. Currently, there is an international debate about the
      criteria and reference values for the sarcopenia diagnosis, and the main scientific societies
      encourage improving research on this. The biggest problem lies in the assessment of the
      diagnostic criterion of muscle mass while the criterion of muscular strength seems safer and
      more robust. Experts point out the need to adjust the muscle mass indexes to the
      characteristics of the population studied, and the convenience of relating the three
      diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia (muscle mass and strength, and walking speed) with other
      variables that report about functionality and frailty in older adults.

      The main objective is to establish different cut-off points for the diagnostic criteria of
      sarcopenia and relate them with other instruments for assessing functionality in older
      population of Valencia Province.

      To this purpose, data will be collected through various tests and questionnaires about:
      clinical, demographic and anthropometric characteristics; muscle mass; muscle strength; walk
      speed; physical and cognitive function; nutritional status; self-perception of health;
      comorbidity and frailty. With this information it will be possible, as primary outcome, to
      determine a more sensitive, reliable and valid muscle mass index to predict sarcopenia, and,
      as a secondary outcome, to establish the relationship between the multicriteria diagnostic of
      sarcopenia with the functional and frailty variables.
