    
      This is a Phase I single center, open-label, single dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      study of an injectable formulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) jointly developed by the
      National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and CONRAD, and manufactured
      by Coldstream Laboratories, Inc. Healthy normal weight and obese women will be followed as
      outpatients for up to eight months. During this study, subjects will undergo a screening
      cycle to confirm normal ovulatory function, and then receive active treatment with a single
      injection of LB. They will undergo frequent evaluations to obtain serum samples to evaluate
      drug levels and ovulatory function, as well as transvaginal ultrasound and cervical mucus
      evaluation at selected visits. Follow up will continue until normal ovulatory cycles resume.
      Based upon detailed studies in non-human primates, it is expected that most subjects will
      resume menstrual cyclicity within 12- 26 weeks following the injection. Subjects will
      continue to be followed for one normal cycle after return of menses. This study will be
      conducted by the NICHD at one of the Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN) sites
      (Oregon Health & Science University, (OHSU)) in the USA and will enroll approximately 16
      women.

      This study will enroll approximately 16 subjects that demonstrate favorable cervical mucus
      and normal ovulatory function during a baseline cycle. Enrollment will be stratified to
      ensure that 50% of the subjects have a BMI >32 kg/m2 and <40 kg/m2 and approximately 50% of
      subjects have a BMI <32 kg/m2.
