      generation of autoantibody and immune complex due to abnormal activation of the immune cells
      on the basis of abnormal immune responses.

      Although about 50% of lupus patients have lupus nephritis, there is no therapeutic product
      targeting for the lupus nephritis so far.

      The investigator has performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using allogenic bone
      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in SLE.

      CS20AT04 has anti-inflammatory effects, controls activity of immune cells and reduces
      generation of autoantibodies. So, it is expected to have therapeutic effects on lupus
      nephritis.

      Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted as a single center, open-label.

      The main component of CS20AT04 is bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. And the risk of
      tumor formation is low. Through the repeated administration and long-term observation with
      mouse model, it was confirmed that there was no oncogenicity. In addition, it was confirmed
      through the cell residual tracking test of the animal model that the in vivo residual period
      was shorter than 14 days.

      However, since long-term safety has not been evaluated after administering CS20AT04 to
      humans, the investigator will confirm the safety of stem cells for up to 5 years according to
      the risk management plan for stem cell products of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and
      already approved phase 1 clinical trial.

      Also In the phase 1 clinical trial that only confirmed safety and tolerability for 28 days
      after administration of CS20AT04, it is difficult to confirm the continuous change of the
      indicator for evaluating efficacy.

      So, it is necessary to check the efficacy in this observation study.
