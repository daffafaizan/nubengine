      entitled "Development of Markers of Sarcopenia Using an Integrated Approach : From Cell to
      Human".

      Consistent with the above-mentioned observation, there is not only one biological marker that
      perfectly matches the sarcopenia criteria but there is a range of complementary biomarkers -
      including but not limited to inflammation markers, products of oxidative damage, serum
      creatinine and urinary creatinine excretion, endocrine function, urine proteomics panel,
      N-terminal procollagen peptides, myostatin and agrin fragment - that will together constitute
      the ideal panel of markers (Foug√®re et al, 2015). These current biomarkers and the thresholds
      for correlation with clinical outcomes have to be deeply evaluated in clinical trials before
      being considered as good biomarkers.

      In addition, one research priority is to investigate and define novel biomarkers allowing an
      improved assessment, characterization and follow-up of elderly people with sarcopenia.
      Biomarkers derived from blood can indeed easily be measured in a standardized and low-cost
      way and are therefore very attractive.

      This clinical trial aims at confirming the relevance of new soluble markers and validating
      the most relevant biological (previously and newly identified), imaging, mobility and
      clinical markers for clinical research in sarcopenia.

      Newly identified soluble markers of sarcopenia coming from DEMAIN Research program and using
      secretomic approach (to be identified in secretome of human myotubes during the program
      research) using immunoassays on biological fluids.
