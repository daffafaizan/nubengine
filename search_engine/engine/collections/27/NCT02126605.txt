      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device, as well as a BG meter. CGM, BG meter, and DAD
      alert data will be collected over a 4-wk period. CGM devices will be "blinded" so that BG
      readings will not be shown. This will allow for a direct comparison between objective glucose
      readings generated by approved BG monitoring devices and DAD alerts. This study will also
      utilize two methods for measuring DAD alerts: (1) use of the event recorder mechanism of the
      CGM device, and (2) collection of more detailed and qualitative data on DAD alerts using
      diaries (Daily DAD Diaries) to collect information concerning the occurrence, timing, and
      type of DAD alerts.
