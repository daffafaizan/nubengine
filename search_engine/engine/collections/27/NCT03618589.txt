      lesion or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system, and it can be diagnosed by
      well-established clinical criteria. Neuropathic pain is caused by lesions or dysfunction of
      the nervous system and is initiated by several cellular and molecular mechanisms. Compression
      of neural and neurovascular structures may result in neuropathic pain. Although a number of
      therapies are available for neuropathic pain, including antidepressants, tramadol, opioids,
      and different antiepileptic drugs, the results of a recent systematic review suggest that, in
      view of their balance between efficacy and tolerability, pregabalin can be regarded as first
      line treatments for peripheral pain with a neuropathic component.

      Pregabalin is one of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that have been studied in the treatment of a
      wide variety of disorders, such as neuropathic pain, epilepsy, spasticity, and anxiety. The
      use of AEDs in the treatment of neuropathic pain is based on a number of similarities in the
      pathophysiologic and biochemical mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain and epilepsy. Its use
      for the treatment of several neuropathic pain syndromes is common, and it is approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic
      neuralgia, fibromyalgia and spinal cord injury, a model of central neuropathic pain. The
      off-label use of pregabalin for the various pain syndromes in general, and for neuropathic
      pain in particular, is ubiquitous. However, minimal support for this practice exists in the
      literature and its cost is perhaps exorbitant. There is no information on the effect of
      pregabalin in patients with neuropathic pain in cervical myelopathy under routine clinical
      practice.
