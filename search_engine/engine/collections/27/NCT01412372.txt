      to improve QOL and perhaps gastrointestinal symptoms, in patients with PI-IBS. The results of
      this study, if positive, will provide preliminary data for a large scale clinical trial.

      This study will also provide information about plasma cytokines in patients with PI-IBS and
      whether improvement in symptoms correlates with improvement in plasma cytokines.
