      oxaliplatin and cetuximab work in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic
      pancreatic cancer. Irinotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving irinotecan
      hydrochloride together with oxaliplatin and cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.
