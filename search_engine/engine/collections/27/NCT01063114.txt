           prepare for the radiation treatment. Doctors will use information gathered from these
           scans to plan the best way to deliver radiation to the tumor.

        -  The following procedures will be performed either before or during the radiotherapy:
           Hearing exam; neurocognitive exam; blood tests and cerebral spinal fluid test.

        -  Not everyone who participates in this study will receive the same amount of proton
           radiation therapy. The length of time and amount of radiation received will depend upon
           the condition of the participant's disease. Radiation treatment will be given once a
           day, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday). The overall treatment course will be approximately 6
           weeks.
