    
      A phase I/II, 5 arm, single blind study, comparing five doses of Proellex to matching placebo
      in healthy adult female subjects of reproductive age. Exposure to study drug will be for up
      to 10 weeks. In-clinic pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be made on the first day of
      dosing and on the last day (week 10). Office visits will occur every week to assess liver
      function and trough blood concentrations for Proellex and primary metabolite. Daily vaginal
      bleeding diaries will be maintained during the course of the study. A single blind run-in
      period of up to 56 days will begin the study to assess baseline menstrual patterns will be
      utilized. Twelve subjects per treatment group (total 60 subjects) will be assigned to each
      dose. New groups will not begin dosing until the previous dose group has completed. Daily
      treatments will be either 1 mg, 3 mg, 6 mg, 9 mg, 12 mg Proellex. A single blind run-in
      period using placebo will be incorporated to establish baseline parameters.
