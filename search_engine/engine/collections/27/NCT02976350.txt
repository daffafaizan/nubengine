      failure and the many insights that it provided for the development of new therapies, there is
      increasing clinical evidence that suggests that our current models fail to completely explain
      the disease progression. Thus, neurohormonal models may be necessary but not sufficient to
      explain all aspects of disease progression in the failing heart. There is evidence suggesting
      that in heart failure there is a metabolic imbalance characterized by the predominance of the
      catabolic status over the anabolic drive.

      Consistent data coming from several independent groups have documented the reduced activity
      of most anabolic axes in HF with reduced ejection fraction. To date, no study has addressed
      the prevalence the presence and the prevalence of the Multiple Hormone Deficiencies in Heart
      Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction.
