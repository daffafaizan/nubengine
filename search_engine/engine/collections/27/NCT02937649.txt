      common complication is gastric leak from the staple line, observed in approximately 3% of
      cases, and can result in long and incapacitating treatment. The diameter of the bougie used
      to calibrate the remnant stomach could impact the rate of gastric leak, a higher diameter
      being correlated with a lower risk of leak, without lowering long-term weight loss.

      The aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare the outcomes of LSG according to
      the use of a standard care bougie calibre or 48-Fr on postoperative gastric leak and mid-term
      weight loss.
