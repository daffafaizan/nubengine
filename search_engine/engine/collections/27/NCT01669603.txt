      and socioeconomic consequences. Current treatments for the common cold that have proven
      efficacy are limited to pharmacologic agents that are directed at specific symptoms. These
      treatments- antihistamines, nasal decongestants and analgesics- have limited effectiveness,
      generally relieving the target symptom by 15-25% at the peak of activity, and are associated
      with bothersome side effects. There are no currently effective treatments for prevention of
      rhinovirus infections.

      Probiotics have been defined by FAO/WHO as "Live microorganisms which when administered in
      adequate amount confer a health benefit on a host." The most common probiotics belong to
      Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium genera. Bifidobacteria are natural human gut inhabitants
      that were discovered over a hundred years ago from the feces of breast-fed infants. The study
      product Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies (subsp.) lactis Bl-04 (Bl-04) has been
      genetically characterized as B. animalis subsp. lactis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and full
      genome sequence comparison. Bl-04 has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collections
      safe deposit as SD5219.

      This study will test the hypothesis that ingestion of a probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis
      subsp. lactis Bl-04 will alter the innate and adaptive host response to rhinovirus infection.
