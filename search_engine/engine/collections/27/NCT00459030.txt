        -  Compare traditional print versus simple electronic communication versus usual care, in
           terms of increasing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates, in average-risk women
           attending a routine OB/Gyn visit.

        -  Explore the moderating role of attentional style and background variables on the impact
           of the interventions in these participants.

        -  Determine the mediating effect of potential cognitive-affective factors related to CRC
           screening in these participants.

        -  Investigate the comparative cost-effectiveness of these interventions to improve CRC
           screening adherence.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 screening arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants are contacted by simple electronic communication methods by an email
           message linked to a personalized website.

        -  Arm II: Participants are contacted by traditional print communication methods.

        -  Arm III: Participants are observed (usual care). Participants in arms I and II are
           randomized a second time to receive messages about colorectal cancer screening that are
           matched or mismatched to their attentional style.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5,000 participants will be accrued for this study.
