      insure curative resection (R0 resection). The region of liver resected is based on the
      anatomy or portal vein and hepatic vein. The liver pedicle of the tumor located lobe is
      exposed and dissected, which is principle to perform anatomical liver resection.

      In the non-anatomical liver resection group, the liver parenchyma transection is around 0-2
      cm from the tumor margin, according to tumor size and location.
