      old) of Lybrel and other oral contraceptives (OC) containing 20 µg ethinyl estradiol in the
      PharMetrics/IMS and MarketScan databases. From among the base population, the databases are
      then searched for any diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or
      cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) [referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism
      or VTE] that occurred after receipt of Lybrel or other oral contraceptives containing 20 µg
      ethinyl estradiol. The intent is to include newly diagnosed cases of VTE.
