      performance of MAF-1217 when administered pre-surgery, in reducing the sign and symptoms of
      post-surgery DED in patients undergoing cataract surgery. Patients will be enrolled 2 weeks
      before Surgery (screening visit), will undergo cataract surgery (Day 0 - Baseline/Surgery),
      and then will be seen at week 1 and 2 after surgery.
