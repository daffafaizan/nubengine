      The primary objective of this pilot study is to investigate whether tart cherry juice
      consumption can reduce oxidative stress in older adults as measured by attenuation of
      F2-isoprostane responses to a forearm ischemia-reperfusion, and a decrease in urinary
      excretion products of oxidative damage. The secondary objective is to examine whether
      age-sensitive markers of inflammation are reduced in response to the cherry juice
      consumption.
