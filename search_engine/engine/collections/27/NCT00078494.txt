      carcinoma at risk for loco-regional or distant recurrence will receive immunization with
      peptides representing HLA-restricted T cell epitopes of the Epstein-Barr virus encoded latent
      membrane protein-2 (LMP-2) emulsified in Montanide ISA-51. Patients will be allocated to
      treatment according to their HLA phenotype. The immunologic potential of the vaccine will be
      followed by enumerating the frequency of vaccines-specific CD8+ T cells in the peripheral
      blood using tetrameric HLA/peptide complexes. This study is designed to evaluate the
      immunologic effectiveness of peptide immunization in adjuvant settings in the context of
      anaplastic NPC.
