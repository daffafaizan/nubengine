      I. To determine if the use of tranexamic acid results in a significant reduction in
      intraoperative and perioperative blood loss.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if use of tranexamic acid lowers the amount of blood products transfused in
      hemipelvectomy surgeries.

      II. To determine if the use of tranexamic acid has an effect on laboratory (lab) measurements
      preoperatively through postoperative day 7.

      III. To determine if use of tranexamic acid has an effect on complication, length of
      intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital stays.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (TRANEXAMIC ACID): Patients receive tranexamic acid intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes
      30 minutes prior to surgery and continuously during hemipelvectomy procedure in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (NO TRANEXAMIC ACID): Patients undergo standard of care hemipelvectomy in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days.
