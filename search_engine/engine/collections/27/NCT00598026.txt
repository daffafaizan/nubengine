      mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia. However, the expanding indications of
      this therapy will have an impact on the follow-up policy. Currently, regular follow-up visits
      are scheduled every 3 months. In this context, the recently-introduced "remote monitoring"
      devices constitute a promising new technique, allowing to transmit information about the
      status of the device and ICD therapies, without direct contact between patients and
      physicians. This monitoring by "tele-follow-up" might reduce the cost of care by avoiding
      useless visits to the implantation centre.

      The aim of our study is to assess the cost-benefit ratio of "tele-follow-up" assisted care as
      compared with the conventional ICD follow-up. Thanks to an open label, randomized, 2 arms
      study : one using a telephone follow up, the other a conventional follow-up.
