      gynaecologist in each center will be screened and women fitting the inclusion criteria will
      be proposed to participate in the study. These women will be enrolled and matched with obese
      women with planned bariatric surgery prospectively. The matching for age (± 1 year) and BMI
      category (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m², 40-49.9 kg/m² and ≥ 50 kg/m²) of each woman in the surgery group
      with a control woman will be performed globally, i.e. two matched women could belong to the
      same center or two different centers.

      This is a national prospective multicentre cohort study. Obese women with planned BS, matched
      for presurgical age and BMI with women with no planned BS.

      Subjects with planned bariatric surgery will be recruited in the nutrition departments. All
      consecutive eligible patients will be considered for inclusion.

      Obese women with no planned bariatric surgery will be recruited in the same centers than the
      corresponding women with planned bariatric surgery, but two matched women can belong to two
      different centers.

      All subjects will be followed 36-42 months according to the delay between inclusion and BS,
      and AMH levels will be measured at baseline or preoperative time, 12, 24 and 36 months after
      baseline for controls and after BS for operated women.
