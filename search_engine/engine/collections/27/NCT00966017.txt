      on 72 people with Down syndrome (DS), 36 non-demented and 36 with dementia, as well as 36
      age-matched healthy controls. Participants will receive comprehensive clinical and
      neuropsychological assessments. PET and MRI scans will be performed at baseline and after two
      years of follow up. All participants will have blood drawn for APOE genotyping during their
      baseline evaluations. The intellectual range of participants with DS will be restricted to IQ
      scores of 45 to 60 (moderate range) to reduce variability, particularly due to extreme low
      levels of intellectual ability.
