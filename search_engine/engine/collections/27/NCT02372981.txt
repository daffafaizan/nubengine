      one of the two study arms: (A) DG-HAL with mucopexy or (B) mucopexy alone. Endpoints are
      pain, faecal incontinence, bleeding, residual prolapse and vascularisation of the anorectal
      vascular plexus. Vascularisation of the anorectal vascular plexus is assessed by
      transperineal contrast enhanced ultrasound.
