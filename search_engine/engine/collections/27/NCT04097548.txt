      enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing biomedical, behavioral and psychosocial
      outcomes among pregnant women who participate in CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care, to
      women in the traditional individual prenatal care and to investigate whether improving
      women's stress, activation and engagement will explain the potential benefits of
      CenteringPregnancy on outcomes and health disparities. The study will be conducted in a large
      prenatal care center in South Carolina. Eligible White and Black women will be recruited
      before 20 weeks of gestational age with low risk pregnancy.
