      generated by the radiation of an electromagnetic spectrum, resulting in an immediate
      retraction of existing collagen and subsequent activation of fibroblasts causing a
      neocollagenesis. In studies using radiofrequency to treat SUI, a therapeutic response to 50%
      was shown. Representing a more cost-effective treatment than surgery.
