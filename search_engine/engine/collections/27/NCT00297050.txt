      year, and avian influenza presents a threat of a future pandemic. Despite this burden of
      current and potential disease, there are no parenteral treatments for influenza, and
      currently, the most common treatment (oseltamivir) is expensive and complex to manufacture.

      The primary purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      intravenous peramivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor. Beginning with a low single-dose, the
      safety and tolerability is established by evaluating symptoms, clinical laboratory tests,
      ECG, and pharmacokinetics. Utilizing a series of stopping rules and a medical monitor, the
      dose will be escalated as safety and tolerability are established. Once the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is established in the first part of this trial (either limited by adverse effects
      or up to maximum anticipated dose), the safety and tolerability of multi-dose administration
      will begin (replicating anticipated clinical use). These cohorts will be evaluated using
      similar criteria. The dose used in the multi-dose cohorts will also be escalated as safety
      and tolerability are established.
