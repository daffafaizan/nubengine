    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate pathologic complete response (pCR) at the primary site in patients with newly
      diagnosed and untreated stage III-IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) of
      the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx with nivolumab, paclitaxel and
      carboplatin in addition to standard chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety. II. Complete pathologic response at all sites of disease. III. Major pathologic
      response rate at primary site. IV. Overall clinical response rate. V. Clinical complete
      response rate. VI. 1 year progression-free survival (PFS). VII. Overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether PDL1 expression is associated with treatment response. II. To explore
      whether there is a net change in the Th1/Th2 ratio (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL10, etc.) or cell
      subset frequencies (M2 monocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, etc.) within a patient's
      peripheral blood either at baseline or in response to treatment is associated with treatment
      response.

      III. To explore whether exosomes or other immune related serum biomarkers change after
      combination therapy.

      IV. To explore the predictive value of serial cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels
      and response.
