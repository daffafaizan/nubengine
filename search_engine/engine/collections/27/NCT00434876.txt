      staying asleep which may eventually lead to relapse. Novel antipsychotic medications such as
      quetiapine have shown some efficacy in treating alcoholism and have also shown some benefit
      in improving insomnia.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the degree to which quetiapine improves sleep
      in veterans during the early phase of recovery from alcohol dependence. The sleep efficiency
      from an in-lab polysomnogram will be the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures of sleep
      will include the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, and actigraphy.
      Other additional aims will explore for alcohol use and cravings, change in psychiatric
      symptoms using the The Time Line Follow Back measure, Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), the
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item scale (PHQ-9), and the Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI)
      respectively.

      Twenty four subjects within the first year of sobriety will be enrolled. Participants will be
      undergo an extensive baseline screening procedure. After 2 consecutive in-laboratory
      polysomnograms they will be treated with either Quetiapine XR or matching placebo pills
      targetting a dose of 400 mg a night. The treatment duration will be 8 weeks and during the
      eight week of treatment they will undergo 2 more nights of in-laboratory polysomnogram. All
      subjects will also receive Medical Management therapy, a standardized psychosocial
      intervention which is medically-based and focusses on alcohol abstinence and medication
      compliance.
