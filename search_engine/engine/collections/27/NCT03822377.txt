      patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Additional
      antithrombotic therapy prior or during intervention plays an important role in the short- and
      long-term outcomes after PPCI. Oral antiplatelet therapy including a platelet P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitors is a cornerstone of antithrombotic treatment in patients with acute coronary
      syndromes. Prasugrel and Ticagrelor have been shown to be superior to Clopidogrel in patients
      with STEMI in reduction of ischemic complication without any increase in the bleeding risk
      and with a significant reduction in the stent thrombosis rate. Nevertheless, in STEMI
      patients, pharmacodynamic studies showed prasugrel and ticagrelor oral loading dose (LD)
      provided a suboptimal platelet inhibition in the first hours after LD, and at least 4 hours
      are required to achieve and effective platelet aggregation inhibition in the majority of
      patients, in part due to slowed gut motility caused by morphine use. Orodispersible tablet
      (ODT) is a different tablet formulation that disperses upon contact with the moist mucosal
      surfaces of the oral cavity and quickly release its components before swallowing; thus local
      drug dissolution and absorption as well as onset of clinical effect can be obtained
      conveniently easily and quickly by bypassing gastrointestinal tract. Recently, Ticagrelor 90
      mg ODT has become available and bioequivalence studies on healthy volunteers documented its
      effectiveness with consequent approval by European Medicine Agency of this formulation which
      is currently available on the market. Thus, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the
      superiority in platelet inhibition with 180 mg Ticagrelor loading dose (LD) administered as
      ODTs as compared with standard formulation, among patients with STEMI or very high-risk
      NSTEMI undergoing immediate PCI. Primary objective consists in evaluating platelet reactivity
      1 hour after Ticagrelor loading dose by VerifyNow test.
