      medication. NSAIDs are very effective in lowering pain in these patients. Recently there has
      aroused major concern with regard to cardiovascular side effects and safety, especially in
      selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (coxibs) but also in "regular" NSAIDs.

      At the moment, there is a big confusion, whether these drugs still should be used, especially
      in patients with known coronary artery disease. Physicians now try to switch to high dose
      paracetamol, despite the weaker efficacy in pain relieve, because this drug is considered
      generally as not harmful.

      As there is very few information on the cardiovascular effect of this drug, we plan to
      perform this study and investigate the impact of paracetamol on endothelial function, an
      important cardiovascular surrogate marker, on inflammatory markers and on oxidative stress in
      patients with coronary artery disease on top of standard medication, including aspirin
