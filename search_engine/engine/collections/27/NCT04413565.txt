      bilateral TKA and single surgeon bilateral TKA. While 2 surgeons will perform simultaneous
      total knee arthroplasty in the two surgeons' bilateral TKA group, one surgeon will perform
      sequentially in the single surgeon bilateral TKA group. The primary outcome is to compare the
      incidence of PJI between the groups. Secondary, logistic regression use to estimate the
      effect of two surgeons bilateral TKA and single surgeon bilateral TKA on the likelihood of a
      patient being infected.
