    
      This is a Phase 2, uncontrolled, 3-stage, ascending-dose-escalation study in patients with 1
      of 3 forms of TMA: atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenia
      (TTP), and hematopoietic stem cell transplant - associated TMA (HSCT-associated TMA). In
      Stage 1 of the study, OMS721 was administered to 3 cohorts, with dose escalation by cohort to
      identify the optimal dosing regimen. In Stage 2, the dose selected in the first stage was
      administered to expanded cohorts of patients with distinct etiologies (aHUS alone in 1 cohort
      and TTP or HSCT-TMA in the other cohort). Patients completing Stage 2 were eligible for
      continued treatment in Stage 3 if they tolerated OMS721 treatment and derived clinical
      benefit. Enrollment in the study has been completed.
