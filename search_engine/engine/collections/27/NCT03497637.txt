      stenosis. Therefore, clinical guidelines support the use of pressure-derived fractional flow
      reserve (FFR) to assess the hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis. Nevertheless, the
      penetration of FFR in clinical routine continues to be limited by its requirement for
      pharmacological vasodilation, prolonged procedure time and adverse systemic effects from
      adenosine.

      Vessel-FFR (vFFR) is a novel method for evaluating the functional significance of coronary
      stenosis by calculation of the pressure drop in the vessel based on computation of two
      angiographic projections. The vFFR values at each point along the vessel are color-coded and
      superimposed on the 3D epicardial model and cut-off values of â‰¤0.80 identical to standard
      invasive FFR apply.

      These developments may translate towards more physiology guided intervention bearing the
      potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients with stable CAD. The ability to derive FFR
      values from routinely performed coronary angiograms, without the practical drawbacks that
      limit invasive techniques, could have an important impact on daily clinical practice.

      To date no randomized outcome-based clinical trial has compared an image-based FFR
      methodology with standard invasive FFR in terms of subsequent clinical outcomes.
