    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES; I. Identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STAT3 inhibitor WP1066
      (WP1066) in patients with recurrent malignant glioma (glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma), and
      melanoma patients with progressive brain metastasis.

      II. Assess the safety and tolerability of WP1066 in patients with recurrent malignant glioma
      and melanoma patients with progressive brain metastasis using the National Cancer Institute
      (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) with special attention directed at determining whether
      any induced autoimmune reactions occur.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the in vivo bioavailability of WP1066. II. Assess overall
      response rate (ORR) in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas and progressive metastatic
      melanoma to the brain.

      III. Assess immunological response in patients with recurrent malignant glioma and melanoma
      patients with progressive brain metastasis treated with WP1066.

      IV. Assess time to radiographically assessed progression and/or response in patients treated
      with WP1066.

      V. Assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with
      WP1066.

      VI. Estimate the proportion of patients treated with WP1066 who develop additional melanoma
      metastatic lesions, including those in the central nervous system (CNS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on Monday, Wednesday,
      and Friday of weeks 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.
