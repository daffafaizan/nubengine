    
      The window of opportunity, Study H-200-002, will examine the effects of study agent (HB-201)
      on subjects during the "window" between diagnosis of their cancer and their definitive cancer
      surgery or chemoradiation.

      The study will be a 2-arm study design. In Arm 1, the study will enroll subjects with
      resectable stage I-III human papillomavirus 16 positive (HPV 16+) genotype squamous cell
      cancer of the oropharynx who are candidates for transoral surgery. Participants will receive
      a single dose of the study agent HB-201 prior to transoral surgery. Arm 1 will consist of 2
      Cohort groups; Cohort 1 will enroll subjects receiving HB-201 as an intratumoral injection
      and Cohort 2 will enroll patients receiving HB-201 administered intravenously.

      In Arm 2, the study will enroll cervical cancer subjects who have locally advanced squamous
      cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and/ or adenosquamous cell carcinoma with HPV 16+ genotype.
      Subjects with advanced/metastatic disease that are previously untreated who are planning to
      undergo upfront chemoradiation for local control are eligible and will receive an
      intratumoral injection of HB-201 prior to the start of chemoradiation.
