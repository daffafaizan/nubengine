      836858 in AML relapse after alloHSCT and investigating safety and tolerability of the
      combination regimen.

      Dose escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) with overdose
      control that will be fitted to binary toxicity outcomes. The estimate of parameters will be
      updated as data are accumulated using the BLRM. At the end of the dose escalation phase, the
      probability of toxicity at each dose combination level will be calculated to determine an
      estimate of the MTD. Once the MTD or a biological active dose has been defined, additional
      patients (up to 10) will be treated with F16IL2 and BI 836858 dosed at this dose combination
      in order to confirm the safety profile of the combination.
