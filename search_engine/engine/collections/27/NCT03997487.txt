      smartphones, routinely used in trachoma surveys for collecting data, for quality assurance,
      supervision and training purposes. The investigators will develop an app in the United
      Kingdom (UK) by taking photos of the conjunctivae of healthy adult volunteers to iteratively
      improve the quality of images based on the image metadata and review by trachoma experts. The
      app will then be field tested, and trachoma grading based on the app photos, DSLR photos, and
      clinical grading, compared. Any management (treatment) will be based on routine clinical
      diagnosis only - the images are for research purposes only. The investigators will also ask
      participants for their views on acceptability of having photos of conjunctivae taken with the
      phone, and conduct a cost-consequences analysis of potential implementation of the app in
      routine trachoma surveys.

      Objectives and approach:

      2.1 To develop a mobile phone application to capture images of everted eyelids (conjunctivae)
      of children being examined as part of the Tropical Data field inter-grader agreement (IGA)
      test, or sampled as part of trachoma prevalence surveys.

      2.2 To evaluate the quality of the mobile phone application images compared with field
      grading and DSLR images.

      2.3 To assess the acceptability and feasibility of a mobile phone application for
      photographing everted eyelids (conjunctivae) from children being examined as part of the
      Tropical Data IGA test, or sampled as part of trachoma prevalence surveys.

      2.4 To conduct a cost-consequences analysis of setting up an infrastructure for capturing and
      transmitting images in order to make the system economically viable.
