      a racial disparity in exercise, such that minorities are much less likely to engage in
      physical activity than are white individuals. Research suggests that a lack of motivation may
      be an important barrier to physical activity for racial minorities. Therefore, interventions
      which increase participants' motivation may be especially useful in promoting physical
      activity within these groups. A previous meta-analysis has found that physical activity
      interventions based on self-determination theory (SDT) and motivational interviewing (MI) are
      especially effective in increasing white individuals' physical activity (Miller & Gramzow,
      under review). However, it remains unclear the extent to which these results apply to
      minority populations. The current study involves conducting an intervention based on SDT and
      MI to promote physical activity in a racially-diverse sample. It is expected that this
      intervention will successfully increase physical activity in participants. Specifically, it
      is expected that there will be a greater relative increase in physical activity in minority
      individuals than white individuals within the intervention group because it is expected that
      their level of activity will be lower at baseline.
