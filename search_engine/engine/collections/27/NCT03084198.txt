      awaiting transplantation, efforts have been made to develop extracorporeal methods to support
      or replace the function of the failing organ. A bioartificial liver support system has to
      provide the main functions of the liver: detoxification, synthesis, and regulation. It may
      prolonger the expected survival time of acute liver failure patients. Direct reprogramming of
      fibroblasts to hepatic lineages could offer a new type of solution to bioartificial liver
      support system. The investigators have already generated human induced hepatocytes (hiHeps)
      from fibroblasts by lentiviral expression of FOXA3, HNF1A, and HNF4A. hiHeps express hepatic
      gene programs, can be expanded in vitro, and display functions characteristic of mature
      hepatocytes, including cytochrome P450 enzyme activity and biliary drug clearance. hiHeps can
      restore the liver function and prolong survival. This study tends to evaluate safety and
      efficacy of hiHep bioartificial liver support system in treating acute liver failure.
