    
      This is a prospective, cross-sectional study designed to provide a consistent method for
      obtaining biological samples and respiratory health-related information from participants for
      use in research that evaluates lung function (e.g., responses to environmental agents such as
      air pollution particles, engineered nanomaterials, or immune ligands; the role of genetics on
      cellular responses or functioning).

      Study participants will be adult volunteers, ages 18-65 (inclusive), who meet eligibility
      criteria to undergo bronchoscopy. Potential participants will be prescreened and scheduled
      for a final eligibility visit that will include medical history review, vital signs, physical
      examination, blood draw, and pulmonary function tests. After eligibility is confirmed, the
      participant will be scheduled for biological sample collections, which will include a blood
      draw and bronchoscopy.

      The objective of this protocol is to investigate the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP)
      epoxygenase pathway enzymes, including the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH; encoded by EPHX2)
      and CYP2J2 proteins, in macrophage function and inflammatory responses. The primary outcome
      measure will evaluate macrophage phagocytosis in an ex vivo assay, comparing groups of
      individuals with and without EPHX2 and CYP2J2 polymorphisms of interest. Secondary outcomes
      will include evaluations of ex vivo gene expression of inflammatory receptors and cytokines
      in stimulated macrophages (alveolar and peripheral blood monocyte-derived), assessment of the
      lower airway microbiome from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and measurement of
      eicosanoids and cytokines in serum and BAL fluid.
