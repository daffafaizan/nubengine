    
      Patients currently participating in the research study titled: "A Pilot Randomized Study of
      the Use of the Sentinel Device for Cerebral Protection during Atrial Fibrillation Ablation"
      will be asked to participate in this sub-study to collect additional MRI and laboratory data
      to support the main study. This study will assess the number, size and volume of new cerebral
      emboli in protected territories detected using MRI of the brain within 7 days after AF
      ablation in patients treated with the Sentinel device compared to controls not receiving the
      Sentinel device, and to assess if change in blood inflammatory markers is associated with
      silent cerebral lesions.
