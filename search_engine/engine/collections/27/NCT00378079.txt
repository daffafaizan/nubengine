      while incarcerated or upon release. Effective treatment for such prisoners is urgently needed
      because rapid relapse typically follows release. Relapse is associated with increased risk
      for HIV, overdose death, criminal activity, and reincarceration. Other than three studies of
      methadone maintenance with short-term jail inmates, the only study of longer-term inmates who
      were previously, but not currently, heroin-dependent was the investigator's pilot study with
      pre-release inmates. Based on that pilot study, which found that initiating maintenance
      treatment is feasible and facilitates post-release treatment entry, the present study
      provides a more rigorous examination of this unique treatment approach.
