      products can be used in massive bleeding. However, unwanted allergic reactions may occur in
      blood and blood product transfusions. Fibrinogen is the first coagulation factor in
      coagulopathy. Some studies have shown that when the fibrinogen level falls to <150-200 mg /
      dl, the bleeding increases dramatically.
