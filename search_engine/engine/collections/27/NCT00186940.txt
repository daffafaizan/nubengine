      and rasburicase, the safety of rasburicase in this population is not known, though
      preliminary data indicates that the drug is safe. The primary objective of this study is to
      estimate the proportion of grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions to rasburicase in patients with a
      history of asthma or severe allergy (to antigens other than rasburicase or other urate
      oxidases) treated with rasburicase for the prevention or treatment of malignancy or
      chemotherapy-induced hyperuricemia. Patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome with a history
      of asthma/atopy will be treated with rasburicase according to standard practice and observed
      for allergic reactions.
