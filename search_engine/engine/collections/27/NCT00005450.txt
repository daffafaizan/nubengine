      The investigators extended work they had done in modeling the health benefit of reducing risk
      factors for cardiovascular disease. Their new model incorporating risks of importance in the
      elderly, including cerebrovascular disease, estimated both morbidity and mortality averted by
      risk reduction, and estimated the costs and risks of the interventions used to modify risk
      factors.

      The model was designed for the counseling of elderly individuals free of cardiovascular
      disease, and evaluated strategies for remaining disease free. It was implemented as software
      running on personal computers, and marketed to physicians and other health professionals who
      advised the elderly on medical issues. Accompanying documentation was also developed to
      explain the assumptions and non-quantifiable aspects of the decision to adopt major lifestyle
      changes to reduce risk.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
