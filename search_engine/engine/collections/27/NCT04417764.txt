      chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in the Paitents
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. TACE would block the blood supply of the tumor to
      achieve ischemic, hypoxic andnecrotic effects. The PD-1 knockout engineered T cells were also
      prepared from autologous origin using CRISPR Cas9 technology. The patients performed one TACE
      treatment followed by 3 cycles of PD-1 edited T cells by percutaneous infusion in the
      peripheral of tumor under the guide of CT every four weeks. The safety and clinical efficacy
      will be evaluated. biomarkers and immunological markers will be monitored.
