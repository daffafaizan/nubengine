      undergo two separate pairs of two-consecutive-overnight sleep studies and receive anodal tDCS
      (active or sham) to M1. The first sleep study in each pair will acclimate subjects to the
      sleep laboratory and minimize "first night" effects, thus no tDCS will be applied. The second
      sleep study in each pair will include active or sham tDCS, presented in a pseudorandom order
      such that approximately half of the subjects receive active tDCS first while the other half
      receives sham first. The two pairs of sleep studies will be separated by one to three weeks.
