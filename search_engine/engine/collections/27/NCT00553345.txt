        -  To investigate whether selenium and/or vitamin E (Î±-tocopherol) supplementation reduces
           the risk of recurrence and progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by recurrence risk group (high
      vs intermediate) and treatment center and randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral selenium tablet and oral vitamin E capsule once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral selenium tablet and oral placebo capsule once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo tablet and oral vitamin E capsule once daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo tablet and oral placebo capsule once daily.

      In all arms, treatment continues for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed every 6 months for 5 years.
