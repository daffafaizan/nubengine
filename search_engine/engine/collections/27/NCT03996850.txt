      I. To determine the impact of technetium Tc-99m sestamibi (MIBI) SPECT/CT on patient
      management decisions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of MIBI SPECT/CT on patient management decisions for tumors 1.5-3.0
      cm and 3.1-5.0 cm.

      II. To assess the impact of MIBI SPECT/CT on decisional conflict score. III. To assess the
      impact of MIBI SPECT/CT on physician management recommendation.

      IV. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of MIBI SPECT/CT for the identification of an
      oncocytic renal mass (oncocytoma, chromophobe, and hybrid oncocytic tumor) with respect to
      tumor histology identified by renal mass biopsy or surgical resection.

      V. To compare the specificity of MIBI SPECT/CT with conventional cross-sectional imaging in
      predicting an oncocytic renal mass.

      VI. To assess the correlation between MIBI SPECT/CT outcomes to final treatment decisions.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the mitochondria content in tumors that had positive MIBI SPECT/CT findings.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive technetium Tc-99m sestamibi intravenously (IV) then undergo SPECT/CT.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 6 months.
