      disadvantages between Uncut Roux-en-Y and Roux-en-Y reconstructions after
      laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

      Method: It's a prospective study including all patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal
      gastrectomy (LADG) in the First Hospital of Jilin University. All surgical procedures will be
      performed by the single surgery team, which is leaded by professor Wang Quan. The
      reconstruction method will be selected randomly from Uncut Roux-en-Y and Roux-en-Y
      anastomosis preoperatively without distinct indications. All clinical data, operation data,
      perioperative complications and related physiological indexes after surgery will be compared.
