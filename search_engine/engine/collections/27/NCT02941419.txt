      recruited. This diagnosis will be based on medical history, physical examinations, laboratory
      tests, and specific diagnostic tests. Patients qualified for this study, are patients with
      distal extremity ischemia indicated by claudication and rest pain present for a minimum of 4
      weeks without evidence of improvement in response to conventional drug therapy; showed
      angiographic evidence of PAD in the affected limb; and were not candidates for surgical
      revascularization. Platelet lysate will be injected intramuscularly at different sites of the
      gastrocnemius muscle. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      platelet lysate injections into ischematic limbs of patients with PAD.
