      as stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases. Its pathophysiology is unclear and the
      variety of clinical symptoms is determined by the injury location. Several studies have
      suggested the possibility of active pain treatment effectiveness through myofascial trigger
      points management. One of these interventions is dry needling, which has been used in several
      scientific studies. However, these investigations have been based on spasm response or deep
      dry needling mechanisms always over a trigger point, but none of the participants compare the
      possible mechanical effects of the insertion of a needle into a spastic muscle without
      targeting specifically a trigger point. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the
      effects on spasticity, pain and motor function after a dry needling intervention versus the
      insertion of a needle into a non trigger point area in patients who had experienced a stroke.
