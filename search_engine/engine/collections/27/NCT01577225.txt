    
      OPSITE Post-Op Visible (OPOV) is a post-operative dressing that has been developed to protect
      the wound from bacteria in the environment and absorb blood or other fluid exuding from the
      wound. The honeycomb nature of the dressing pad allows direct visibility of the wound through
      the dressing, minimising the need to expose the wound to the environment and the patient to
      the trauma of a dressing change just for the clinician to inspect the wound. OPOV is unique
      in combining these features and offers a real benefit over other standard post-operative
      dressing regimes.
