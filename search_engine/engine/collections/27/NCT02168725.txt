      2-hour, once-a-week intravenous (IV) administration of briciclib in 3-week cycles, in up to
      54 adult patients with advanced cancer and solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2
      stages: a dose-escalation stage to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and a
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RPTD) confirmation stage. Patients with stable disease (SD) or
      response may remain treated on study until progression.
