    
      Ivacaftor is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical
      benefit in subjects with CF. Results from Phase 3 studies (VX08-770-102 [Study 102]
      [NCT00909532] and VX08-770-103 [Study 103] [NCT00909727]) showed that ivacaftor is effective
      in the treatment of subjects with CF who have the G551D-CFTR mutation, as evidenced by
      sustained improvements in CFTR channel function (measured by reduction in sweat chloride
      concentration) and corresponding substantial, durable improvements in lung function,
      pulmonary exacerbations, respiratory symptoms, and weight gain. Ivacaftor was also well
      tolerated, as evidenced by the rates and reasons for premature discontinuation and results of
      safety assessments.

      Ivacaftor (Trade Name Kalydeco; 150 mg tablets) was initially approved in the United States
      for the treatment of CF in subjects 6 years of age and older who have a G551D mutation in the
      CFTR gene.
