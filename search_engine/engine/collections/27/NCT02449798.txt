      System placed in the upper arm with ultrasound guidance, and the lower arm with and without
      ultrasound guidance based on clinical assessment. Subjects will be subjected to a maximum of
      4 attempts. If unsuccessful by the 4th attempt, alternatives will be considered as per
      current standard of care.

      Currently multiple IV attempts are made in difficult IV access patients without success.
      Patients are often escalated to more invasive lines due to the need for longer catheters
      without clinical indication. The study will evaluate the feasibility of AccuCath 2.25" BC as
      a low risk, lower cost alternative for this patient population in lieu of using a midline,
      peripherally inserted central line or central venous catheter when not clinically required
      for purposes of therapy.
