      or sham taping to the tibialis anterior muscle on walking parameters in stroke individuals.

      Methods: The study included 28 adults stroke patients . The subjects who received scores of 7
      or more in the Hodkinson Mental Test and 3 and above in the Functional Ambulation
      Classification with subjects who gastrocnemius muscle spasticity 2 and below points according
      to Modified Ashworth Scale were included in the study. The walking parameters of the
      participants were evaluated with the BTS G-Walk Spatio-Temporal Walking Analysis System. The
      walking parameters of the participants who were selected by randomization method were
      evaluated separately by applying kinesiological taping and sham taping or without any taping
      or interference on a 10 meter track.
