    
      This study is designed to examine the safety and proof of concept of therapeutic hypothermia
      prior to conventional revascularization in subjects experiencing acute ischemic stroke by
      comparing the results to subjects who remain at normal body temperature (normothermic) and
      proceed directly to reperfusion via conventional reperfusion intervention.

      The investigational plan also examines the following outcomes in 85 subjects randomized to
      either hypothermia or normothermia:

        -  Regulation of biomarkers indicative of ischemia-reperfusion injury

        -  Changes in blood brain injury using the Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker (HARM)
           protocol MRI as a surrogate imaging biomarker

        -  Incidence of hemorrhagic conversion post reperfusion

        -  Neurologic function at 90 days post acute ischemic stroke.

      The results of this study will be used to power a definitive phase III clinical trial
      evaluating the combination of hypothermia and revascularization versus reperfusion alone.
