      supplement has on prostate cancer and normal prostate tissue. Patients will be randomized to
      either receive placebo or a commercial soy supplement for 2-4 weeks prior to the planned
      surgery for treatment of their prostate cancer. The specific objectives are:

        1. To assess the effect of soy supplementation on endogenous hormone production levels and
           serum prostate specific antigens.

        2. To assess the impact of soy supplementation on estrogen receptor expression(ER).

        3. To determine the impact of soy isoflavones on cell cycle regulation and associated gene
           expression.
