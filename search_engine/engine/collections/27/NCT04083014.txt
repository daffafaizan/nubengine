      but 10% to 20% patients are refractory to GCs and more than 50% patients will relapse after
      GCs tapering or cessation.

      Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is the preferred second-line treatment for relapsed refractory
      wAIHA. Anti-CD20 antibody 375 mg/m2, once a week, four times, is the standard treatment
      regimen. Low dose anti-CD20 antibody, 100mg once a week, four times, also showed similar
      response rate. However, the use of four times of intravenous infusion is trouble. So the
      investigators intend to explore the efficiency of the singe dose of 500mg anti-CD20 antibody.

      Anti-CD20 antibody takes median 6-8 weeks to response and only about 50% patients achieving
      long-term response. Plasma cells produce antibodies and long-lived plasma cells in bone
      marrow and spleen continuously work. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor and targets plasma
      cells. Bortezomib has become a first-line treatment for clonal plasma cell diseases (such as
      multiple myeloma, systemic amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome, etc.). Bortezomib can also induce
      reactive plasma cell apoptosis and has a variety of immunomodulatory effects. The
      investigators try to combine bortezomib with anti-CD20 antibody, which may play a synergistic
      role and improve the efficacy.

      Patients of relapsed and refractory warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia or EVANS syndrome will
      receive a single dose anti-CD20 antibody (500mg) and bortezomib (1.3mg/m2 twice a week for
      two weeks) twice for three months interval.
