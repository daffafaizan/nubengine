      in China. The data from the phase I and II study suggested that the inactivated EV71 vaccine
      had a clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese infants. In
      order to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine against Hand, Foot and Mouth disease caused by
      EV71, and to further explore the safety profile of this vaccine in expending infant
      population, a phase III clinical trial is planed to conduct.
