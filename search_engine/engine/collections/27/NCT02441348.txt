      constitute over 60% of voice clinic caseloads. Over 80% of patients with lesions and nearly
      100% of those with MTD are treated exclusively with voice therapy.7,8 Traditional, bottom-up
      hierarchical, non-conversation based voice therapy is the established standard of care used
      most widely by speech-language pathologists (SLP) in clinical practice.e.g.3,9,10 However,
      the investigators group's published research indicated a clear need to target conversational
      voice use in treatment.2 Currently, no treatment program exists with a focus on voice use in
      conversation. Most voice therapy techniques are based in hierarchical, programmatic
      approaches aimed at manipulating phonatory physiology for voice improvement. These
      hierarchies necessitate that the final step in therapy is generalization of the target voice
      techniques to spontaneous, conversational speech.3 Three major problems exist with this
      approach to voice therapy, which the current proposal aims to address.

      First, A hierarchical non-conversational approach to therapy builds treatment from unvoiced
      breathing to single sounds and rote phrases to connected speech to spontaneous every day
      conversation last, if at all, and patients are often discharged from therapy unable to
      generalize therapy techniques to conversation. Second, the use of a hierarchical, bottom-up
      approach necessitates a protracted time in treatment. Third, attrition rates for behavioral
      voice therapy are estimated between 16-65%,4,17 and voice problem relapse rates are between
      51-68%.
