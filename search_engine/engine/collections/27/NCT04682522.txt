      take part in this randomized study. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either
      Metronidazole 250 mg three times a day, starting after surgery, for three months, or the
      local usual standard of care after surgery, which may be a different antibiotic prescribed by
      the physician.

      Participants will also provide a stool sample at the following time points: prior to surgery,
      the day of discharge, at their follow-up appointment (usually about two weeks after surgery),
      three months, and six months.

      Participants will also be followed to determine their clinical outcome.
