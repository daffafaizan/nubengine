      of hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that inductive
      chemotherapy plus CCRT achieved the same prognosis as total laryngectomy, and minimized the
      damage of normal tissue. TPF is the standard regime of inductive chemotherapy for squamous
      carcinoma of head and neck. If the primary tumor shrinks obviously (complete remission or
      >75% partial remission )after inductive chemotherapy, CCRT is suggested as the definitive
      therapy, for the tumor is sensitive to chemotherapy. If the primary tumor shrinks a little or
      progresses after inductive chemotherapy, operation is suggested as the definitive therapy to
      get a longer survival. This is a prospective, phase II, cohort study. We designate TPF plus
      Toripalimab as the inductive regime, expecting a higher complete remission rate and longer
      PFS and OS. And we replace the CCRT with radiation plus Toripalimab to decrease the adverse
      events of CCRT.
