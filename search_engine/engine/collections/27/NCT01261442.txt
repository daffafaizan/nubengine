      in permanent deficit. It is believed that patients with neuropathies might be at higher risk
      of injury but detailed investigation of the diabetic patient is lacking yet anesthetic
      practices may be altered nevertheless. This study intends to investigate the appearance and
      sonographic qualities, as well as electrophysiologic measures, of the posterior tibial nerve
      (PTN) in diabetic patients undergoing nerve conduction studies in order to compare PTN
      characteristics between diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy to those without.
      Ultimately, we hope that ultrasound, a commonly used non-invasive tool, will be able to
      assist in the identification of patients at higher risk of injury from regional anesthesia
