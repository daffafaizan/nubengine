      Department, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry (University of Valencia, Spain) from 1996 to
      2016, in which patients with early peri-implantitis diagnosed were included (Figure 1). All
      patients were informed about the study design and procedures. Prior to participating, they
      were requested to sign an informed consent document. The study design was approved by the
      Ethical Committee of the University of Valencia (H1478255958653).

      Two groups were established: Test group (patients diagnosed with early apical
      peri-implantitis diagnosed) and Control group (patients whose implants had not developed any
      inflammatory/infectious process and were osseointegrated).
