      The objective of this protocol is to evaluate and provide treatment for subjects who have a
      clinical indication for the routine extraction of dental third molar wisdom teeth with the
      aim to allow investigators to maintain their expertise in dental clinical care, gain
      additional knowledge about oral health and to utilize surgical waste collected from these
      patients for research studies.

      Study Population

      The protocol will enroll a convenience sample of 10000 subjects ages greater than or equal to
      16-50 in need of clinically indicated, routine extraction of third molars.

      Design

      This is an evaluation, treatment and training protocol. Subjects will receive standard
      evaluation and treatment for clinically indicated, routine extraction of third molars.
      Subjects will report to the NIDCR dental clinic for at least three visits. The first visit
      will be a screening evaluation to determine the clinical need for third molar extraction and
      protocol eligibility. Eligible subjects will return for a second visit for third molar
      extraction. Oral specimens removed during the standard procedure of third molar extraction
      will be distributed for research. A third visit will be scheduled approximately one week
      after surgery for a post-operative clinical evaluation. Data collection will include
      demographics, pain management, medication regimen and adverse events to examine its effect on
      clinical outcomes

      Outcome Measures

      There is no research planned under this protocol. However, data is collected for purposes of
      research and clinical quality assurance. If trends emerge that warrant further exploration,
      outcome measures will be described when IRB approval or determination of exemption is
      requested to carry out the project.
