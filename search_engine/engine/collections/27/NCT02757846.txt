      Tri-phasic CT images are currently the standard imaging modality for the management of HCC.
      Our goal is to improve treatment decisions of HCC patients through better understanding of
      their prognosis based on radiomics modeling of HCC. Radiomics is defined as the extraction of
      quantitative image features from medical images. We will use triphasic CT data of at least
      200 patients and develop a robust strategy to extract imaging features from CT. We will use
      deep learning in the form of a Convolutional Neural Network to segment HCC lesions and use
      image feature extraction algorithms with supervised classification to predict prognosis.
