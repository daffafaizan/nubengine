      Aim 1: Conduct formative research to develop and refine a clinical protocol for a
      multi-component smoking cessation intervention, grounded in the extended parallel process
      model, consisting of pharmacogenetic treatment (smoking cessation drug matched to each
      individual smoker's genotype) and genetic feedback (delivery of patient-centered,
      personalized genotype information and its predictive value for smoking cessation treatment
      efficacy): We will adapt, pilot-test, and refine a theoretically-grounded PGx smoking
      cessation intervention using formative interviews of 20 African-American and
      European-ancestry smokers.

      Aim 2: Conduct a mixed-methods feasibility trial randomizing treatment-seeking smokers to
      pharmacogenetic (PGx) treatment combined with genetic feedback (GF) vs. PGx treatment without
      GF for smoking cessation to examine the feasibility of the newly developed protocol in a
      primary care setting and characterize its psychological and behavioral impact: Smokers (N =
      100) will be randomized to GF vs. no GF and all will receive motivational interviewing
      (standard care/SC) and PGx treatment. We will assess the impact of GF on time to relapse,
      medication adherence, and a comprehensive assessment battery of process and cognitive,
      psychological, and behavioral outcomes. Finally, we will synthesize quantitative and
      qualitative data to revise protocols, generate hypothesizes, and estimate effect sizes for a
      follow-up R01 submission.
