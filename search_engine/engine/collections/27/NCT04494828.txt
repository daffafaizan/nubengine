      and is associated with undesirable consequences. Prevention of postoperative delirium is
      recommended in the clinical guidelines and consensus statements. Dexmedetomidine, a highly
      selective Î±2-adrenergic receptor agonist, has been investigated as a pharmacological
      intervention to prevent postoperative delirium. Several randomized controlled trials have
      shown that prophylactic use of low-dose dexmedetomidine (0.1 ug/kg/hour without loading
      infusion) may decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients after cardiac and
      non-cardiac operations. However, neurosurgical patients are often excluded from previous
      studies due to potential consciousness and cognition impairment. The investigators design
      this pilot randomized controlled trial aiming to clarify the feasibility and safety of use of
      low-dose dexmedetomidine for prevention of postoperative delirium in patients after
      intracranial operation for brain tumor.
