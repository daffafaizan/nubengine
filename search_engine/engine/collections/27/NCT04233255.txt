      diagnoses difficult. The combination of muscle imaging with clinical can limit the
      differential diagnosis and yield the most probable one and can direct genetic testing as the
      only method to arrive at a definite diagnosis.

      In recent years, the use of high-resolution ultrasound had become an important tool in
      diagnosis and in the monitoring of disease progression and treatment of both hereditary and
      acquired myopathies. Additionally, it entails a safe, accessible, low-cost, and no ionizing
      radiation tool which renders the technique extremely suitable for paediatric patients and
      patients who cannot lie still without sedation. therefore, it can be used as a complementary
      tool to electro-diagnosis.

      Ultrasound permits to evaluate echo intensity, muscle perfusion, transverse and longitudinal
      sections of the muscle and its thickness at rest and during maximal voluntary contractions,
      overlying subcutaneous fat, cross-sectional area, and angled fibers of pennate muscles.

      The use of sonographically guided biopsy is an easy, safe, and reliable method for attaining
      tissue for histologic diagnosis in neuromuscular disease.

      In most myopathies, either acute or chronic, muscle tissue undergoes morphological changes
      giving rise to replacement of muscle by connective tissue and/or fat. Pattern recognition on
      muscle imaging might be helpful in distinguishing between different disease entities.
