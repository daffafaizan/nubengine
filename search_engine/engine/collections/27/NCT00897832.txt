        -  To determine if a method of extracting and identifying biomarkers (i.e., secreted
           cytokines and growth factors) from tissues of the quantity obtained from typical biopsy
           can now be applied in the setting of pancreatic cancer

        -  To correlate pre-treatment biomarkers with recurrence, overall survival, and tumor
           response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue specimens are obtained from the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center Human
      Tissue Acquisition Core and analyzed for biomarkers (e.g., integrity of DNA repair pathways
      as analyzed by Rad51 and phosphorylated DNA-PK foci formation). The biomarkers are correlated
      with clinical outcomes (recurrence, overall survival, and tumor response to treatment).

      Patients are followed for recurrence, relapse, and death from disease.
