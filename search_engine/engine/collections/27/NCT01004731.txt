      in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with EGFr positive,
      chemotherapy-naive, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Also, the study will determine the response rate in patients with EGFr positive
      chemotherapy-naive, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with Cetuximab in
      combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin as well as determine the time to progression in
      patients with EGFr positive chemotherapy-naive, stage IV NSCLC treated with Cetuximab in
      combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin.
