    
      Patients who are scheduled for elective surgery/ general anesthesia are randomized to two
      groups.

      l : cuff pressure - 20cmH2O ll : cuff pressure - 30cmH2O

      After tracheal intubation with routine method, cuff pressure is continuously monitored with
      manometer. The anesthesia during surgery is maintained with 0.8 MAC of desflurane and
      continuous remifentanil. Clinical outcomes (sore throat, hoarseness and postoperative pain)
      are evaluated after 0 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours after surgery.
