      small cell lung cancer. How to improve the progression free survival in advance was a
      challenge. Our previous study showed that first-line EGFR-TKIs plus microwave ablation had
      PFS survival advantage versus EGFR-TKIs alone. So we conducted this prospective study to
      verify the efficacy and safety of the combination in a randomized, controlled, phase II
      clinical trial. Patients were assigned into two groups.In the experiment group, patients were
      treated with both Almonertinib and microwave ablation. In the control group, patients were
      treated with Almonertinib alone. The primary end point was progression free survival. Second
      endpoints included overall survival and safety.
