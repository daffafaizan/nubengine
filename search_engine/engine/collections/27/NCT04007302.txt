      exercise conditions (speed and slope) of walking that will generate lumbar pain. Patients who
      have not experienced lumbar pain during this phase will be excluded from the study. The
      patients included are then randomized according to the order of physical exercise situations.

      For the tests, patients will be equipped with a miniaturized wireless (Octamon, Artinis) and
      multi-channel (8 optodes) NIRS device placed on the patient's frontal lobe according to EEG
      10-20 positioning (fig. 2). They will then be placed on an inclined treadmill according to
      the angle that caused the pain during the pre-test.

      During the test, subjects will walk to the voluntary stop and the different reasons for the
      stop (feeling of fatigue, pain, etc.) will be recorded by visual analogue scales and
      questionnaires. The duration of the exercise will be measured by a digital stopwatch
      connected to the treadmill. During physical exercise, the bilateral activity of the
      prefrontal cortex will be recorded continuously at a sampling frequency of 10 Hz.

      For each test, subjects will be confronted with 2 situations, on D1 and D2. In a situation,
      walking will be done without distraction. In the other situation, the patient will be placed
      in front of a screen with virtual reality simulation while performing the walking exercise.
