      traumatic injuries, spinal injuries have one of the highest impacts on functional outcomes
      and employment status. Even more than an injury of the spinal column, traumatic spinal cord
      injury (tSCI) is a devastating disorder severely affecting patients' physical and
      psychosocial well-being. The incidence of tSCI is estimated to be 11 to 53 new cases per
      million population per year.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, observational cohort study to evaluate if early (≤ 12
      hours after the tSCI) surgical decom¬pression is superior to late (> 12 hours and < 14 days
      after the tSCI) in improving neurologic motor outcomes in patients with acute traumatic
      spinal cord injury.

      The study will enroll 300 patients with anticipated 1:2 ratio of early vs. late surgery. This
      CIP is not limited to cervical spinal cord injuries, does not consider a diagnostic MRI as
      mandatory and will be conducted in a European setting where patients are generally
      transported more swiftly to the treating institution when compared to other geographic
      regions in the world.

      Patients will be evaluated according to the schedule set forth in this CIP. The schedule
      includes evaluations at pre-surgery, post-surgery, 72 hours post injury, 12 weeks ± 2 weeks;
      6 months ± 30 days; 1 year ± 30 days. The enrollment period is expected to be approximately
      36 months and subjects will be followed-up for 12 months for the evaluation of the primary
      endpoint. The study duration is approximately 48 months.
