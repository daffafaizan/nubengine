    
      Patients are randomised to modified FOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, FA 400 mg/m², FU 400 mg/m²
      bolus then 2400 mg/m² over 46 hr) alone or combined to either panitumumab (6 mg/kg) or AMG
      102 (10 mg/kg), every two weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Judgment
      criteria include 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate (primary endpoint), OS,
      objective response rate, and safety. Ancillary studies aim to identify candidate predictive
      and prognostic biomarkers among functional of molecular alterations of the EGFR/RAS/RAF and
      HGF/c-Met pathways, and to monitor circulating tumour cells and circulating immune cells
      (myeloid derived suppressor cells, NK cells) in sequential blood samples taken at baseline
      and through the study treatment. A total of 165 pts will be enrolled (Fleming's one-step
      design)
