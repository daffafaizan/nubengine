    
      A single site, two arm, parallel-design randomized trial comparing Cytal速 Burn Matrix to
      EZ-Derm速 Porcine Xenograft, for patients with partial-thickness burns to the hand. Up to 60
      patients from a single center will be recruited and randomized (using a 1:1 randomization
      scheme) to receive either Cytal速 Burn Matrix or EZ-Derm速. Scar formation, number of wounds
      requiring autografting, wound infections, rate of healing, hand function and impact of
      treatment will be compared between study arms. Additionally, a cost analysis and review of
      individual and group changes in narcotic prescription patterns and employment status will be
      evaluated. The protocol defined patient follow-up is 6 months.

      An independent biostatistician will review all participant data for power and futility
      analysis. In addition, a clinical events committee will adjudicate adverse events (AEs) and
      serious adverse events (SAEs)
