      randomized in two groups (arm 1 and 2). All patients will be treated with a transobturator
      correction of anterior defect, in patients of arm 1 will be associated TOT, whereas in
      patients of arm 2 will be associated TVT.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      clinical, hormonal, urodynamic, and ultrasonographic evaluations. During the study, the
      surgical outcomes, the clinical subjective and objective efficacy data, and the adverse
      experiences will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
