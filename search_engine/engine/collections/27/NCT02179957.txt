      intervention or require patient involvement at any stage of this research.

      The study would utilise anonymised patient data, identified as part of the previous audit.
      FFR values are already known for each patient. The image dataset would be retrieved and
      matched to an FFR. At this stage all data, including the images, would be anonymised. The
      images would be reviewed independently by two expert readers who would record their
      impression of the likely haemodynamic significance of a particular stenosis. Two weeks later,
      to minimise bias, the readers would re-review the images to identify features of the stenoses
      known, or likely, to cause haemodynamic significance, including stenosis length, territory of
      the vessel, calcification.

      The results would be directly compared to the FFR readings and the features would be
      subjected to multivariate analysis to identify any salient anatomical feature which may
      predict haemodynamic significance.
