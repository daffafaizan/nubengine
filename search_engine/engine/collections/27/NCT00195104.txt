      arabinoside and arsenic trioxide.

      Patients will receive a fixed dose of arsenic trioxide administered 0.25mg/kg/day on days 1-5
      and 8-12 and ara-C administered at 5, 7.5, or 10 mg/m2 SC BID days 1-14 in repeated cycles of
      2 weeks on therapy and 2 weeks off therapy in a standard dose escalation design (1 cycle = 2
      weeks on therapy + 2 weeks off therapy).
