      to preserve its functioning. Even more, decision to keep the PORT-A-CATH® after completion of
      adjuvant therapy cannot be based on profound patient information as there exist hardly any
      data regarding PORT-A-CATH® related complications of non-used PORT-A-CATH®.

      The proposed prospective, two arm trial aims to investigate if no flushing of a non-used
      PORT-A-CATH® over a period of one year has equal PORT-A-CATH® related complications compared
      to flushing the PORT-A-CATH® every 4 weeks.

      The proposed trial also aims to examine the frequencies of PORT-A-CATH® related complications
      in non-used PORT-A-CATH®. The authors put up the hypothesis that there will be fewer
      port-a-cath related infections in the experimental arms compared to the infection rate
      mentioned in the literature up to 27 %, since the puncture of the PORT-A-CATH® and the
      administration of fluids are the main causes of infection.
