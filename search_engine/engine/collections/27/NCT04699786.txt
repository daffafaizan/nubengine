      of aging (Memory and Aging Project) will be offered a five-year Alzheimer dementia risk
      estimate report that incorporates genetic and neuroimaging research results as well as
      demographic information into five-year Alzheimer disease dementia risk estimate. Using a
      two-year delayed-start randomized clinical trial design, participants will be randomized to
      receive research results either two weeks (Arm A) or one year (Arm B) after informed consent.
