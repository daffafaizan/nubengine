      noting improvements in treatment refractory auditory hallucinations as well as negative
      symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. However, no previous studies have examined the effects of
      precuneus directed rTMS on SRP deficits in schizophrenia. It is also important to note that
      the vast majority of studies using rTMS in schizophrenia have examined chronic populations
      where confounds associated with prolonged duration of illness may be present. Early phase
      psychosis (EPP) is a desirable population to study because these patients tend to have fewer
      psychiatric and physical comorbidities and less antipsychotic drug exposure, all of which are
      factors that may confound investigations of new treatment interventions for this illness. In
      light of the significant unmet medical need associated with schizophrenia and the grave
      clinical effect of disrupted SRP in the illness, rTMS modulating precuneus, and potentially
      DMN circuitry, represents an unexplored and potentially novel potential treatment option.

      This study proposes to examine the application of rTMS targeting the precuneus for the
      treatment of disrupted SRP in EPP. This is an important population for study because if
      effective, rTMS may represent a preventative treatment for the development of poor outcomes
      and functioning associated with SRP deficits in in schizophrenia. This study will also seek
      to refine the understanding of the brain circuitry that mediates the potential pro-SRP
      effects of rTMS through the use of fMRI at baseline and following the course of rTMS
      administration.
