      method is not that straightforward with a lot of inter and intra observe variation. In
      attempt to overcome this problems we going the verified a new software for automated AFC.

      At the first step we will compare the human count and the software count of the AFC in 150
      exams of ovaries at 3D US.

      At the second step we will use the software to evaluate ovarian reserve at 50 women before
      fertility treatment. This woman will be questioned about epidemiologic data (age, ethnicity,
      medical history) and evaluate at the early follicular phase with blood test for follicle
      stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone , E2, anti-mullerian hormone , Prolactin,
      thyroid-stimulating hormone, Testosterone, Progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone,
      dehydroepiandrosterone-Sulphate. The evaluation of the AFC by US will be at early follicular
      phase, late follicular phase and mid luteal phase
