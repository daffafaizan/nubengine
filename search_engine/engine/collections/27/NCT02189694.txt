      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      The investigators aim to conduct a randomized three-way cross-over trial comparing single
      hormone closed-loop strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and the conventional pump
      therapy. The investigators aim to compare the three interventions for 3 consecutive nights in
      children with type 1 diabetes in a diabetes camp.
