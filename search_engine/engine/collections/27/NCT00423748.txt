      Inclusion is not based on a specified WHO functional classification. Rather, subjects with
      WHO Class I-IV symptoms are eligible if their 6-minute walk distance is 150-450 meters and
      they meet the study-specified hemodynamic criteria. Subjects with anorexigen or HIV infection
      related PAH are eligible but subjects with congenital heart disease and pediatric subjects
      are excluded. The study requires a historical cardiac catheterization and other diagnostic
      procedures.
