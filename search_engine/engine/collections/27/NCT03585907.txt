      with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) likely due to AD, 2) to examine whether changes in
      participants' cognition, mood, or other functioning are more favorable in patients using the
      MAD than in patients using the MIND diet, 3) to assess the role of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)
      epsilon 4 genotype in response to the MAD in individuals with SCD. We hypothesize that 1)
      participants will be able to adhere to and tolerate the MAD and the MIND, determined by
      review of patients' food records and urine ketone production, 2) participants who adhere to
      the MAD will demonstrate a more favorable change on neuropsychological tests than
      participants on the MIND diet, and 4) the neuropsychological effects of the MAD will be
      greatest in those participants without a Îµ4 allele of the ApoE gene.
