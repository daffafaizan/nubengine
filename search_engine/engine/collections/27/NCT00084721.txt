      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan when administered with celecoxib in
           patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects and non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this
           regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and intensity of diarrhea and myelotoxicity in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine any responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine potential mechanisms for irinotecan-induced diarrhea and protective effects of
           celecoxib on diarrhea prevention in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive a fixed dose of irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8,
           15, and 22 and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 10-42. Courses repeat every 42 days in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Group II: Patients receive irinotecan as in group I at escalating doses and oral
           celecoxib twice daily on days 0-42. Treatment continues as in group I.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients (9 for group I, 9-21 for group II) will be
      accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
