      contiguous communities in New York City. Households will be randomized, stratified by
      community 1:1 to receive surveillance-only (no text message education) vs. surveillance plus
      text message educational intervention. For symptom surveillance, households in both arms will
      receive text messages 3x/week during each influenza season and report if someone in the
      household has ILI symptoms. For those in the educational intervention arm, when an ILI/acute
      respiratory infections (ARI) is reported, a series of educational text messages will be sent
      with information to decrease household transmission.
