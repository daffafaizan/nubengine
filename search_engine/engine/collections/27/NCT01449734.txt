      They experience the process of care along with their loved ones. Increasingly, the
      satisfaction of family members with ICU care, decision-making and information, and their
      empowerment to contribute towards patient care as near relatives, is being perceived as an
      important aspect of the general quality of ICU care.

      Family satisfaction is assessed using the 34-item FS-ICU questionnaire which was recently
      validated for German-speaking participants.

      The aim of this pilot survey is to identify opportunities for improvement of family
      satisfaction.
