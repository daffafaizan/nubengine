    
      This is a multi-center, FDA clinical study designed to investigate the safety and performance
      of the MicroPhage S. aureus/MSSA/MRSA test direct from blood culture positives. Informed
      consent is not anticipated, as this is a laboratory performance study with no patient
      intervention. The MicroPhage Test will be compared to site standards of care,
      market-available rapid tests, two predicate tests, and two disk diffusion tests for
      antimicrobial susceptibility. The study will last approximately 4-6 months (Bactec),
      dependent on the accrual rate of each institution.

      This study is designed to support the following product indications for use:

      The MicroPhage S. aureus/MSSA/MRSA Blood Culture Test is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic
      test for the rapid identification of Staphylococcus aureus and determination of methicillin
      susceptibility (MSSA) or methicillin resistance (MRSA) directly from positive blood cultures.

      The test uses bacteriophage amplification to rapidly and phenotypically identify the presence
      of S. aureus and assess the response of the target organism to cefoxitin as an analog to
      methicillin.

      This test is performed on positive blood cultures.

      Subculturing of positive blood cultures is necessary for further susceptibility test
      determinations.

      Results of the study analysis will be in the form of descriptive statistics (mean, median,
      standard deviation, frequencies) for all study variables. Associations among variables will
      be presented using correlation coefficients, as well as odds ratios and parameter estimates
      from multivariable regression (linear and logistic) where applicable.
