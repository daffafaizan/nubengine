      specifically in pregnant women. Some recent research has found an association between sleep
      disorder breathing and preeclampsia. Both conditions have shown to be associated with worse
      pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, more research is needed to find the strength of these
      associations. By gathering more information, this provides investigators with an opportunity
      to see if there is a way to slow the progression of complications in preeclampsia through the
      management of sleep-disordered breathing. Preeclampsia continues to be one of the top reasons
      for maternal mortality in the U.S. and this percentage continues to grow each year. Through
      the study, investigators hope to bring awareness of the comorbidity and how its similar
      pathogenesis can potential exacerbate complications in pregnant women.
