      will be recruiting 66 patients, who will be randomized (1:1) to either the PTNS group or the
      Sham group. The patients in the PTNS group will receive one PTNS treatment per week for 12
      weeks. The patients in the Sham group will receive one sham treatment per week for 12 weeks.
      Patients in both groups will be asked to complete questionnaires before the start of the
      treatment, as well as after 12-weeks of treatment to assess the changes in the severity of
      their symptoms

      Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), compared to a
      validated sham, on sexual functioning in women with female sexual dysfunction (FSD).

      Aim 2: To compare the effect of PTNS on lower urinary tract symptoms versus sexual
      functioning in patient with FSD.
