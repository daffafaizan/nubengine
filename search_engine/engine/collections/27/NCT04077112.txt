      intensive version of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT; 5 days/week over the course of
      2 weeks) versus a more traditional weekly PCIT format (1 day/week over the course of 10
      weeks) in treating early childhood externalizing behavior problems (EBP). Using a randomized
      trial design, 60 young children (M child age = 4.33 years; range 2-6.92; 65% male; 85%
      Latinx) with elevated levels of EBP and their mothers were assigned to either I-PCIT (n = 30)
      or traditional PCIT (n = 30). Families completed pre-treatment and post-treatment assessments
      as well as a follow-up assessment 6-9 months following treatment completion. Across all
      assessments, mothers completed measures of child behavior, discipline practices, and
      parenting stress. Observational data on child behavior and parenting was also collected
      during three 5-minute standard situations that vary in the degree of parental control
      (child-led play, parent-led play, & clean-up).
