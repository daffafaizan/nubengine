      response and duration of treatment in patients with advanced ALK- and ROS1-positive non-small
      cell lung cancer who received lorlatinib (PF-06463922) as part of the French expanded access
      program. Those outcomes will be correlated to clinical, pathological, and radiological
      characteristics of patients.
