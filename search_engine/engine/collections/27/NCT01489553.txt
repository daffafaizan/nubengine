      objectives are to determine the safety of allergen-specific immunotherapy for egg allergy
      through ingestion of baked egg products and whether it will ultimately lead to a desensitized
      state for native egg. We will also examine if quality of life is improved by expansion of
      diets.

      Subjects aged six to 17 years with a history of egg protein allergy will be recruited from
      The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Allergy practice (main campus and satellite
      locations).

      Prior to and after the desensitization to baked egg, we will conduct double blind
      placebo-controlled food challenges to native egg protein. During the desensitization phase,
      we will give increasing doses of baked egg (meringue cookie or equivalent) on a weekly basis,
      as tolerated.

      The primary endpoint of the study includes the percentage of subjects who can successfully
      complete the food challenge to native egg once they have completed the desensitization
      protocol to baked egg. Secondary outcome measures include egg-specific IgE, quality of life
      before and after desensitization, and egg skin prick test size.
