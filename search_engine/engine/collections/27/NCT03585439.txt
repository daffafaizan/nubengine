      medical management, a surgical treatment can be proposed. Even though the goal is consensual,
      there are plenty of ways to reach vertebral fusion: ALIF, PLIF, TLIF, Posterior fusion only,
      etcâ€¦ This study aims to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of isthmic
      spondylolisthesis surgically treated with combined approach. The goal is to demonstrate that
      it is a safe and efficient technique to treat isthmic spondylolisthesis using standard XRays,
      CT Scan and patient reported outcome measurements. There is very little literature concerning
      this procedure.
