      symptoms of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adolescents and young adults. It will also
      assess the impact of daily topical oxybutynin 3% gel on Health Related Quality of Life
      (HRQOL); determine if daily topical oxybutynin 3% gel has a treatment effect at distant,
      untreated sites; and assess the local and systemic tolerability of daily topical oxybutynin
      3% gel. Finally, the study will determine the treatment effect size, if one exists, in order
      to power a larger, placebo-controlled study in the future.
