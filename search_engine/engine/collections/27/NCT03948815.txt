      birthing room on maternal and neonatal outcomes is insufficiently studied. This RCT project
      measures and compares effects and experiences of two types of birthing rooms at one Labour
      ward in Sweden. A qualitative ethnografic studu will assess how women interact with the
      birthing rooms and its physical objects.
