      males. The primary aim of this study is to describe the relationship between plasma
      concentrations and brain PDE4 occupancy of GSK356278 over time. Up to 24 healthy volunteers
      may be administered single doses of GSK356278 in order to obtain 12 evaluable complete data
      sets of occupancy estimates. This study will help to optimize the dose selection for future
      clinical studies with GSK356278.
