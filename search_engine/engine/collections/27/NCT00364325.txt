      attempt is made to affect the outcome), multi-center registry study of patients presenting to
      the Emergency Department (ED) for treatment of known or suspected Acute Decompensated Heart
      Failure (ADHF). Data will be collected on the medical management of patients presenting to
      the ED who are treated for ADHF in a hospital setting incorporating a disease management
      program for heart failure. The study will evaluate change in clinical management and outcomes
      of ADHF patients treated in the ED after ED implementation of three or more components of a
      disease management program for heart failure. The results are intended to assist hospitals in
      evaluating and improving quality of care for patients with ADHF by tracking quality
      indicators and providing site-specific benchmark reports and national benchmark reports. This
      registry considers patients treated with any therapy for ADHF
