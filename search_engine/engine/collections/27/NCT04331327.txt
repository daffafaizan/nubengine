      group was randomized into an intervention group and a control one. The control group patients
      were kept on their traditional medications without any intervention, while intervention group
      patients were instructed to stop using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) at least
      1 week before the assessment and throughout the study. All participants were subjected to
      baseline clinical, radiographic, and ultrasonography assessment. Follow up assessments was
      conducted after 6 months.

      Patients of the intervention group received two doses of intra-articular knee injections of
      allogenic lyophilized growth factors (L-GFs); one dose at the baseline and the other was
      after 2 months.

      Lyophilized GFs were prepared at the Cairo Medical Centre Blood Bank from allogenic platelet
      rich plasma to according a previously published patented method.

      Prior to usage, reconstitution of the product was done using 1-ml saline and 1-ml lignocaine
      followed by gentle vial rubbing for 3 minutes. Then, the mixture was kept at ambient
      temperature for 5 minutes to ensure complete protein re-hydration.

      The injection was done under complete guidance of ultrasonography through lateral
      supra-patellar short axis in-plane approach under sterile aseptic conditions. After
      injection, local ice application and oral paracetamol were allowed if the patient felt pain.
      NSAIDs were completely avoided as they may inhibit the desired post-injection inflammatory
      process. Patients were encouraged to restrict vigorous knee activities for 48 hours.
