      atelectasis and re-expansion. This inflammatory response can be attenuated with treatment,
      also decreasing postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC). Thus, avoiding complete
      atelectasis with partial insufflation of the lung during surgery could be useful to decrease
      inflammatory response and PPC.
