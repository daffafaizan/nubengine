      factors for insulin resistance. As a consequence the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      is rising fast as well.

      Interleukin 6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor alfa are well known pro-inflammatory cytokines that
      have been linked to insulin resistance. Results from our own group show that interleukin-1 is
      also involved in the process of developing insulin resistance.

      Earlier research projects studied the effect of Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra)
      on glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was shown that glycemic
      control was improved. The authors conclude that this is the result of improved function of
      pancreatic beta cells.

      These results are in contrast to our results of in vitro en in vivo research on mice, which
      show improved insulin sensitivity by Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.

      A possible explanation for not finding an effect on insulin sensitivity by earlier research
      projects may be that it is difficult to reliable quantify insulin sensitivity in this group
      of patients with concurrent changes in glycemic control, extensive co-morbidity and
      medication use, who might be at the rather extreme end of insulin resistance. Furthermore a
      relatively low dose of Anakinra was used.

      Altogether we hypothesize that the effect of Interleukin-1 is not only mediated through
      better pancreatic beta-cell function, but that Interleukin-1 blocking by recombinant
      Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist will also diminish insulin resistance.
