      prognostic and diagnostic factors. Assessments include gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic,
      dermatologic, cardiac, and serologic studies. Immunologic studies include antinuclear
      antibody, latex fixation, and serum and urine electrophoresis.

      Genetic trees are constructed using detailed family history data; blood and urine samples are
      routinely collected from relatives. Family members of patients with familial amyloidotic
      polyneuropathy type II (Indiana type) undergo a flexor retinaculum biopsy of the wrist.
