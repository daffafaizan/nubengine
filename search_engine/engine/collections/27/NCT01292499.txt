      depends on the efficacy of the psychological treatments proposed per se, or whether they just
      contribute to increase the compliance with the pharmacological treatment, maintaining the
      patients on treatment longer and allowing the drugs to reach long-lasting effects. While
      recognizing the general therapeutic efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment of depressive
      disorders, nevertheless the present study aims at verifying whether an equal therapeutic
      effect may be reached via a better compliance with the pharmacological treatment, fostered
      for example by the psychoeducational intervention. The rationale lays on the ease of
      transferability of psychoeducational interventions to the general clinical practice, that
      usually suffers from lack of resources in implementing structured psychotherapy
      interventions.
