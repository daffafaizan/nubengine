        -  Develop prognostic factors for patients with brain metastases treated by focal treatment
           without concurrent whole brain irradiation.

        -  Determine whether focal treatment without whole brain radiotherapy produces good
           long-term outcome in patients with four or less cerebral metastases.

        -  Assess survival, physical and cognitive functioning, and quality of life of patients
           treated on this protocol.

      OUTLINE: Quality of life is assessed using the FACT-BR scale, physical function is assessed
      using the FIM scale, and cognition is assessed using two brief pencil and paper tests.

      Patients receive focal therapy for cerebral metastases by any combination of (1) surgery plus
      fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to surgical bed, or (2) single fraction stereotactic
      radiotherapy by linear accelerator with or without a radiation sensitizer.

      Patients are followed at 2 and 10 weeks, then every 3 months for 18 months, then every 6
      months for 3 years, then annually. Quality of life is assessed at each followup visit.

      Patients suffering intracerebral relapse are offered further focal therapy if they have no
      more than 3 metastases, no more than 6 lesions over consecutive scans, and continue to have
      life expectancy of at least 3 months and Karnofsky performance status of 60-100%. Otherwise,
      relapsed patients are offered whole brain radiotherapy or supportive treatment with steroids,
      and may also receive stereotactic boost to the new lesions. Patients who have received prior
      whole brain irradiation will be offered entry into other protocols if eligible or supportive
      treatment with steroids. Patients are followed as above.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 60 patients will be enrolled in this study.
