    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of flotetuzumab in CD123-positive advanced acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Cohort A) and other hematological malignancies (Cohort B), as
      assessed by complete remission (complete remission [CR]/complete remission with incomplete
      count recovery [CRi]/complete remission with partial hematological recovery [CRh]) rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate toxicity profile of flotetuzumab. II. Evaluate remission duration among
      responders. III. Estimate 1-year overall survival. IV. Evaluate minimal residual disease
      (MRD) status in responders in the ALL cohort.

      V. Evaluate the percentage of patients who receive subsequent allogeneic transplantation.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine immune profile pre- and post-treatment with flotetuzumab. II. Assess the
      association between CD123 expression and tumor response. III. Assess the association between
      alterations in tumor genetic or microenvironment with response.

      IV. Assess cytokine levels during therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive flotetuzumab intravenously (IV) continuously for 28 days. Patients who
      achieve partial response or stable disease or any clinical benefit (partial remission [PR],
      stable disease [SD]) that did not meet CR, CRi, CRh or morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS)
      criteria receive a second 28-day continuous flotetuzumab IV infusion. Patients who achieve
      CR/CRi/CRh/MLFS after course 1 or course 2 receive flotetuzumab IV at a 4 days on-3 days off
      schedule. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then up to 1
      year.
