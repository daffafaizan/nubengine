      of remission, and survival in patients with refractory germ cell tumors. II. Evaluate the
      toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4 week course. Treatment is repeated for a maximum of
      six courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 44 patients will be accrued over 19 months for this study.
