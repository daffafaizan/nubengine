      enrolled to ensure at least four fully evaluable subjects. Each subject will receive a single
      10mg/ 50 ÂµCurie oral dose of [14C]SB-681323. Urine and faecal samples will be collected until
      216 h after dosing but subjects may be discharged after 168 h if 90% of the dose is recovered
      and/or <1% of the dose is excreted in a 24 h period. Blood and plasma will be collected at
      various sample times after dosing to measure parent drug and total drug-related material.
      Samples of urine, faeces and plasma will be transferred into separate study to characterise
      and quantify metabolites in these matrices. Safety will be assessed by adverse event
      monitoring, vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory tests.
