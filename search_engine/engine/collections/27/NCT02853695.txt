      abnormalities. Complication and failure rates are low because of the direct visualisation of
      the treated abnormality. Moreover, hysteroscopic procedures replaced 'blind' (curettage) and
      more invasive interventions (hysterectomy).

      The field of hysteroscopy has developed over the years. Changes occurred in hysteroscopic
      instruments and in the use of energy sources. An important development is the smaller
      diameter of the hysteroscopic system which makes it suitable for an outpatient setting. Not
      every gynaecologist, however, has the appropriate hysteroscopic skills or setting to carry
      out these procedures.

      The incorporation of hysteroscopic procedures into daily practice in Flanders is unclear. In
      the Netherlands 2 surveys were conducted in the past to question the treatment options for
      polypectomy in an outpatient setting on the one hand and the diffusion of hysteroscopy on the
      other hand.

      The investigators want to study the diffusion of hysteroscopy in Flanders and the
      Netherlands. Moreover the investigators want to provide an overview of the hysteroscopic
      procedures implemented, as well as the setting they are performed in.

      An electronic questionnaire (LimeService) will be sent to all gynaecologists in Flanders and
      the Netherlands. Participation is voluntary and anonymous. After informed consent all
      gynaecologists are asked to complete the first part of the questionnaire containing general
      information. The second part is specific for gynaecologists performing hysteroscopy
      themselves, and inquires about the procedures they carry out.
