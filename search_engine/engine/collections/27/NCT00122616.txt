      has improved in the last decades regarding to the advent of HAART, the mortality related to
      liver disease has increased in this population. Sustained virological response for HCV can be
      obtained with peg-interferon and ribavirin treatment but more or less 50% of patients
      experienced failure to this treatment and liver fibrosis due to HCV infection progress and
      may lead to cirrhosis and hepato-carcinoma. To demonstrate the efficacy of peginterferon
      therapy to reduce the liver damage causes by HCV infection, a randomised controlled study is
      needed comparing one group of patient treated by peginterferon and one group without any
      treatment against HCV infection. In order to show 30% difference between the two groups in
      reducing one point of fibrosis score (METAVIR scale), 150 patients are needed. The duration
      of the study is 96 weeks
