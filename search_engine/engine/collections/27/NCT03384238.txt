    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the optimal dose of panitumumab-IRDye800 in identifying pancreatic cancer
      compared to surrounding normal tissue in the ex vivo setting as measured by tumor to
      background ratio.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of the panitumumab-IRDye800 as an imaging agent in
      subjects undergoing resection of pancreatic cancer.

      II. Determine whether metastatic lesions, positive lymph node, or residual disease can be
      detected by near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with panitumumab-IRDye800 but not by
      white light.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes, and after
      15 minutes of observation, patients then receive panitumumab-IRDye800 IV over 60 minutes on
      day 0. Patients then undergo surgical resection 2-5 days after panitumumab-IRDye800
      administration with imaging using the Novadaq SPY/LUNA, Novadaq IR9000 fluorescence imaging
      system with open field handheld fluorescence imaging camera, and/or pinpoint endoscopic
      fluorescence imaging camera, and SurgVision Explorer Air multi spectral fluorescence
      reflectance system.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 15 and 30 days.
