      routinely at least, in the first week of life, at the end of first month and corrected age 36
      weeks and 40 weeks. We will performa all USG mesurements with measureing intracranial hegiht,
      anteroposterior diameter, biparietal diamater, ventriccular height, thalamo-occipital
      distance and ventricular index. We will calculate the brain volume as a spheric geometric
      shape than we will calculate two ventricles as conical shapes. Absolute brain volume will be
      calculating by substracting two ventricles from total brain volume. At 40 weeks of age we
      will perform a cranial MRI to show exact brain volume and we will ccompare two different
      methods.
