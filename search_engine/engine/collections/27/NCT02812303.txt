      General Hospital. They hired and allocated 4 population health coordinators (PHCs) as part of
      a pilot project to centralize population health management efforts to improve quality of care
      for chronic disease management. The network did not have sufficient resources to implement a
      PHC in all of the 18 network practices. So the program's team invited practice leaders to
      participate and the PHCs were allocated by program's leadership team based on a variety of
      factors including responses from the practice leader, baseline quality scores, size of the
      practice, nature of the practice (health center vs not), and location of the practice (on
      campus or community based). These decisions were made in a way that sought to equitably
      distribute available PHC resources within the practice network as a way to get network buy-in
      and maximize the impact of the program, both for practices with and without PHCs. In this
      study, the investigators evaluated quality of care process and outcome measures over the
      first six months of the chronic disease management program. The investigators hypothesized
      that practices assigned a central PHC would have greater performance increases in quality
      measures compared to practices that were not assigned a PHC.
