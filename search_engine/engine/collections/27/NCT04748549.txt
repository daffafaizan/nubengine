      aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Evaluate whether the use of VR during TKA can facilitate a reduction in
      intraoperative propofol dose required for patient comfort as compared to music and sham VR +
      usual care controls.

      Hypotheses: Patients in both the VR and music groups will demonstrate reductions in propofol
      dose compared to sham VR + usual care controls. A reduction in propofol dose between the VR
      and music group will be smaller in magnitude.

      Specific Aim 2: Assess the effect of VR during TKA on patient reported outcomes including
      overall satisfaction, pain, and anxiety as compared to music and sham VR + usual care
      controls.

      Hypotheses: Patients in the VR group will report significantly higher satisfaction and better
      control of pain and anxiety than those in the music group and usual care group.

      Specific Aim 3: Explore the potential effects of VR during TKA on other key secondary
      outcomes of perioperative efficiency, postoperative cognition, and functional recovery.

      Hypotheses: Patients in the VR group will have shorter post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU)
      length of stay as compared to sham VR + usual care controls. The effect of VR on
      postoperative delirium, postoperative cognitive decline, postoperative opioid use and
      functional recovery will be exploratory endpoints.
