      in the treatment of GAD.

      We first used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the gambling task to
      localize anxiety-related brain activations in each individual participant, and then used this
      information to guide treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

      TMS was delivered to the target site at a frequency of 1 Hz for 20 minutes (900 total
      pulses). The intensity of the TMS was set to 90% of the passive motor threshold for each
      participant.

      The primary efficacy measures include the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I)
      and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Response to treatment was defined as a
      reduction of 50% or more on the HARS and symptom remission was defined as a CGI-I score of 1
      or 2 ("much improved" or "very much improved" respectively) and a score â‰¤ 8 on the HARS. Data
      was entered anonymously into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed by the UCLA Semel Institute
      Statistical Core. The analysis was done on the intent to treat sample using last observation
      carried forward (LOCF). A one-sample paired t-test was used to compare endpoint to baseline
      means on the HARS, with a significance level set at p= 0.05, two-tailed.
