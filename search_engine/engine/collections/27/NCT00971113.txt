      the in vivo prebiotic effects of a functional food containing short-chain
      fructo-oligosaccharides (sc-FOS) and Sideritis euboea extract on human faecal microflora.
      Sixty-four healthy volunteers (26 men and 38 women) (age range:22-51) were assigned to
      consume daily a jelly containing 5 g sc-FOS and 0.3 g S.euboea extract or a placebo for 30 d.
      Stool samples were collected prior to the study on day 15 and 30 of intervention and 2 weeks
      after. Enumeration of faecal bacteria was performed by plate count techniques.
      Gastrointestinal side effects were recorded during the treatment period.
