      community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. The lack of accuracy in the diagnosis of acute
      appendicitis yields often to two types of outcomes: a delay in diagnosis leads to perforation
      and peritonitis in up to 15% of the cases and unnecessary appendectomy is associated with
      post-operative complications such as wound infection and adhesions. CRP is an acute phase
      protein that is often used by many surgeons as a diagnostic marker of acute appendicitis.
      During the evaluation of patients with possible appendicitis in the emergency department
      (ED), repeated physical examination of the abdomen may provide further information about the
      decision making. However, the role of repeated laboratory examinations is not proven.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether repeated serum CRP measures could be
      useful to predict acute appendicitis, after 3 hours of observation, in comparison with the
      histopathological findings.
