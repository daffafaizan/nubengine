    
      Patients with an acute optic neuritis (between 60 and 180 days before screening) or with
      residual visual deficits after a past optic neuritis are randomized in two treatment groups.
      Group A is instructed to perform software-based visual reconstitution therapy on a home PC
      daily and regularly for 30 minutes over a period of six month. Group B will perform a
      similarly, also software-based training program, developed to improve saccadic eye movements
      rather than visual fields. Patients are blinded to the respective treatment.
