      open-label (all people involved know the identity of the assigned drug), switch study
      designed to evaluate patient-assessed medication satisfaction after 12 weeks of treatment in
      patients with schizophrenia. The total duration of this study is 12 weeks. Outpatients who
      treated atypical antipsychotics and report dissatisfaction (Medication Satisfaction
      Questionnaire [MSQ] <4) with their current treatment response are eligible to participate in
      the study. Patients will be randomized into two groups, 1) Patients randomized to an
      immediate initiation of paliperidone ER for a total 12 weeks 2) Patients randomized to a
      delayed initiation will continue their previous atypical antipsychotics for 8 weeks and then
      be initiated on paliperidone ER at Day 56 for 4 weeks. During the study treatment
      optimization will be done by dose adjustment (dose increase or decrease) and by adding
      psychotropic agents except the antipsychotics.
