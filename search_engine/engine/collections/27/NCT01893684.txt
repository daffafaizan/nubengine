      ages of 65 and 80.

      This study will use a parallel-arm design. After blocking on age and BMI, 75 overweight or
      obese (BMI â‰¥ 25 kg/m2) older females (65 - 80 y old) will be randomized into three groups;
      PRO or CARB diet combined with exercise (PRO+EX;n=25, CARB+EX; n=25) or PRO (n=25) without
      exercise for 6 months. All groups will have the goal of losing ~10% of initial body weight.
      We anticipate an adherence rate of 80% (n = 20 in each group remaining). At the initiation of
      the study, all subjects will be weight stable (within 2 kg) for past 6 mos and sedentary
      (defined as < 1h/wk or less than 2 exercise sessions per week in the last 6 months). Eligible
      participants will be planning to live in the community for the duration of the study.
      Exclusion criteria will include any chronic disease/condition that would not permit exercise
      or dietary restriction or alter interpretation of data. All subjects will require personal
      physician clearance prior to enrollment. Main outcome variables of interest are whole body
      composition, regional body composition, muscle strength endurance and quality, physical
      function, fatigue and biomarkers related to fatigue.
