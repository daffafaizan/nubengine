      developed in the context of COVID for several weeks, appears necessary and will be a first
      inventory after its implementation in France. Analysis of the data collected in this study
      will allow us to propose technical, medical and organizational solutions to optimize the
      positioning and practical use of TLC for patients and care facilities. This assessment step
      seems imperative if the Covid context persists over time but could also be useful for the
      development of TLC outside the Covid context.
