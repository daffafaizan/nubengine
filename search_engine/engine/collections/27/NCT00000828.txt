      transmission of HIV-resistant strains to infants could alter the course of disease and
      response to currently recommended treatment, a study to assess the patterns of AZT
      susceptibility among mother/infant pairs with perinatal transmission is essential to
      delineate future therapeutic strategies.

      HIV-infected pregnant women are enrolled at 20-36 weeks gestation. Patients have blood drawn
      for HIV culture at study entry and at delivery. Infants have blood drawn for HIV culture at
      delivery and at 1, 3, 6, and 18 months of age.
