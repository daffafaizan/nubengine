      such as MMP's TIMP's and other diseases such as Ehlers-Danlos, Marfans syndrome, AAA
      (abdominal aortic aneurysms), diverticulosis and rectal prolapse. Furthermore has research
      raised hypothesis about inheritance of hernias. The investigators are performing genetic
      examination combined with analysis of collagen and biomarkers on patients belonging to
      families with tendency to hernias.

      Other examinations performed on the patients enrolled in this study:

        -  Ultrasound (US) examination of the abdominal aorta to discover possible abdominal aortic
           aneurysms.

        -  Beightons score to evaluate the degree of joint hypermobility.
