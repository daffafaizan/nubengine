      immunosuppressed population, especially those with HIV infection, remains at particular risk
      and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing in the US and worldwide,
      with high rates in those who are cirrhotic, and is the 10th most common cause of death in the
      US.

      HIV-hepatitis coinfection is problematic in that HIV patients are currently living longer on
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).. Those who are coinfected with HBV and/or HCV
      progress more rapidly to cirrhosis and hepatic failure. Further research on the epidemiology,
      optimal screening and new therapeutic approaches in persons with advanced liver disease, in
      the setting of effective treatment for viral hepatitis is needed.

      The primary objective of the proposed study is to characterize viral liver disease and
      factors affecting the natural history of viral liver disease in persons with and without HIV
      with an emphasis on those living in the Washington DC metropolitan area. The cohort will be
      designed to study research questions with respect to liver disease, disease pathogenesis
      using genomics, proteomics, and immunologic disease models. Secondary objectives include
      study of the immunopathogenesis of HBV and HCV disease progression in HIV infected subjects.
      In addition, this is an invaluable opportunity to determine the prevalence and risk factors
      associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, the longterm effects of HCV
      clearance with DAAs, along with biomarker profile(s) for diagnosis and outcome. Moreover,
      this will serve as a catchment protocol to select appropriate participants for novel HBV and
      HCV therapeutic trials.
