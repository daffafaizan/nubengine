      role in physiological functions. Overproduction of ROS and/or deficiency of enzymatic or
      non-enzymatic antioxidants, termed as oxidative stress, is involved in many pathological
      conditions such as Diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic periodontitis (CP).

      Several researches revealed that DM, with many determinants such as level of glycemic
      control, stands as a strong risk factor for periodontal diseases. On the other side,
      periodontal diseases induce an elevated chronic inflammatory state and exacerbated insulin
      resistance.

      In the present study, the investigators examined the effect of glycemic control level on
      clinical periodontal status, levels of MDA, GSH-Px, GSH and PON activity in gingival
      crevicular fluid and blood samples of CP patients with T2DM.
