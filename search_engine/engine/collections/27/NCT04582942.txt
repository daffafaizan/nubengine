      inadequate bowel preparation have been identified , including age >70, previous colon
      surgery, constipation, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, history of stroke or spinal cord
      injury, prior history of inadequate bowel preparation, body mass index (BMI) >25, use of
      tricyclic antidepressant or narcotics. Patients were considered as low risk if they any of
      the above factors and considered as low risk if they did not have any of these risk
      factors.This is a multicenter, endoscopist-blinded study to compare the efficacy of PEG
      combined with lactulose and PEG alone in bowel preparation. In colonoscopy procedures,
      endoscopists who were blinded to the intervention evaluated the overall quality of
      colonoscopy cleaning according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale. Patients' tolerance,
      defecation, adverse events and adenoma detection rate (ADR) were also evaluated.
