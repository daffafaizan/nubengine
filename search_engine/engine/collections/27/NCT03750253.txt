      there are still some patients with postoperative ankle pain. This study was conducted to
      investigate the clinical efficacy of shock wave therapy in the treatment of postoperative
      pain caused by cartilage injury of talus after arthroscopy.

      Patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus treated by arthroscopic microfracture
      surgery and still complained ankle pain three months after surgery were enrolled. Radial
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy was used to give energy to the injured region of the talus
      and the adjacent area.Treatment was done once a week for 5 consecutive weeks. After shock
      wave therapy,the patients were followed by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the American
      Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle-hindfoot scale(AOFAS-AHFS) , and followed finally by
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of the ankle.
