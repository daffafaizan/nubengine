      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising pemetrexed disodium and
           cisplatin followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy and high-dose postoperative
           3D-conformal radiotherapy, in terms of 90-day progression-free survival, in patients
           with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

        -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and
           cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are evaluated 3
           weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients without disease progression
           proceed to surgery.

        -  Extrapleural pneumonectomy: Within 21-56 days after completion of neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy, patients undergo extrapleural pneumonectomy. Patients are evaluated 30
           days after surgery. Patients without disease progression undergo high-dose 3D-conformal
           radiotherapy.

        -  High-dose 3D-conformal radiotherapy: Beginning 30-84 days after surgery, patients
           undergo high-dose 3D-conformal radiotherapy daily for 30 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed on days 42 and 90, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.
