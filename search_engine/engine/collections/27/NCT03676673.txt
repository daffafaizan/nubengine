    
      Primary Aim: To establish a stable and reliable neurogenesis molecular level pathways and
      potential pathogenesis mechanisms for ASD by using the machine learning approach of the
      integrated data of biological variables (NGS data and metabolomics) and the comprehensive
      clinical, environmental, neurocognitive, and MRI images data.

        1. To investigate the majority of candidate risk factors from the multiple domains
           collected in this project;

        2. To apply network-based algorithms (including deep learning) to approach the underlining
           pathogenesis mechanism of ASD;

        3. To further verify the machine learning algorithm based on the data collected in this
           project through other open access database for stability and reliability of our
           algorithm.

      Secondary Aims:

      Aim I: To identify the ASD biomarkers and disease mechanism using NGS technology.

        1. To investigate the transcriptome profiles occurring in ASD patients;

        2. To identify ASD-associated exome sequence variations from a network biology perspective;

        3. To identify ASD-associated gene-gene interaction sub-networks; and

        4. To explore how the sequencing outcomes, regulate and interact with brain structure and
           function even linking to neuropsychological functions and behavioral phenotypes.

      Aim II: To characterize ASD-affected metabolites.

        1. By using LC-MS and GC-MS, we will perform metabolomics analysis, including targeted and
           untargeted analysis;

        2. To identify the potential metabolomics profiles and pathways related to behavioral
           phenotypes, neuropsychological functions, neuroanatomy and brain functions in patients
           with ASD; and

        3. To identify how the metabolites variance distributions are manipulated through the
           genetic expressions.
