      patients in the ED with low-risk chest pain defined by a HEART score of 3 or less. Patients
      will be consented for participation and will fill out one of two surveys concerning their
      chest pain and chances of adverse cardiac events based on their HEART score. One survey will
      be printed in red text and feature red graphics; the other will be printed in black-and-white
      and feature black and-white graphics. The surveys will otherwise be identical. Enrolled
      patients will be asked to fill out survey questions related to their perception of their
      safety and their comfort with their discharge.
