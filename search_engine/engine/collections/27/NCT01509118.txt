      with oral bioavailability. Highly selective inhibition of factor Xa by rivaroxaban is
      expected to inhibit the amplified burst of thrombin generation and may result in more
      effective inhibition of thrombus formation with a favorable safety profile. In Thailand
      rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing major orthopedic
      surgery of the lower limbs including surgery for hip fractures. There are limited number of
      observational studies of rivaroxaban in thromboembolism after hip fracture surgery as the
      approved indication in most countries are for thromboprophylaxis in hip and knee
      arthroplasty. The broader indications and the high number of hip fracture surgeries in
      Thailand allow us to explore a pattern of safety profile particularly bleeding complications
      and risk factors in patients receiving rivaroxaban thromboprophylaxis after hip fracture
      surgery.
