           cycle, participants will come to the clinic on Days 1, 8, and 15. During cycles 2
           through 4, participants will come to the clinic on Days 1 and 8. The rest of the clinic
           visits will occur on Day 1 of every cycle thereafter.

        -  During each cycle, participants will take RAD001 orally, once a day in the morning. In
           addition, participants will receive CP-751,871 intravenously once every cycle on the
           first day of each cycle.

        -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered
           safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates in
           this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose will depend
           on the number of participants enrolled in the study and how well they tolerated their
           doses.

        -  Participants may remain on this research study as long as they do not have serious side
           effects or their diseae does not get worse.
