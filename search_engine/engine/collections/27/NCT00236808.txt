      urinary system in men under 50 years of age. Symptoms of chronic (long-term) prostatitis may
      include urgency to urinate, frequency or difficulty in urinating or abdominal, pelvic, or
      rectal pain. A frequent cause of prostatitis is bacterial infection, treatable with
      antibiotics. This multicenter, double-blind study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of
      levofloxacin as compared to ciprofloxacin in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis.
      Patients receive treatment with either levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for 28 days and are
      evaluated during treatment and 5-12 days after the last dose of study drug (posttherapy
      visit), and 1 month after the last dose (poststudy visit). Patients are contacted six months
      after the last dose to follow up on the potential recurrence of their prostatitis.
      Effectiveness is assessed by measuring the ability of the study drug to eliminate bacteria
      causing prostatitis and to reduce the signs and symptoms of chronic prostatitis. Laboratory
      tests for presence of bacteria are performed throughout the study and at each visit, patients
      are questioned as to the relief of their symptoms. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse
      events, physical examinations, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The
      study hypothesis is that levofloxacin is at least as effective as ciprofloxacin in treating
      chronic bacterial prostatitis without any significant safety issues being observed.
