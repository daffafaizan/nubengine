    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an over-the-counter (OTC)
      disposable stress urinary incontinence (SUI) pessary device. Specifically, this study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of the pessary device by assessing reduction in urine leakage in
      approximately 50 women with Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI). Efficacy will be assessed by
      mean pad weight gain per hour, reduction of stress urinary incontinence events per day, and a
      quality of life questionnaire. The safety of the OTC SUI pessary device will be evaluated by
      assessing all adverse events, including the results of urinalysis, vaginal swab, and vaginal
      examination.
