      which pain (through pressure pain threshold and number of active myofascial trigger points),
      quality of life, FM impact on quality of life and function, depression, anxiety and quality
      of sleep will be evaluated.

      After evaluating the volunteer, the participant will be randomly allocated to one of two
      groups: hydrotherapy treatment (HT), and hydrotherapy treatment together with pain
      therapeutic education (HT+PTE).

      All volunteers will perform 12 weeks of hydrotherapy treatment, in which the investigators
      will perform global exercises for upper and lower limbs and trunk.

      Volunteers in the HT+PTE group will receive, throughout the 12 weeks of HT, 4 sessions of
      PTE, in which the investigators will teach pain neurophysiology, pain chronification and pain
      management.

      Evaluation sessions will take place before treatment, after 6 and 12 weeks of HT and after 12
      weeks of treatment ending.

      In all evaluations sessions, the investigators will collect data on those aspects previously
      described.
