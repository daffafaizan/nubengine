    
      In this study, patients with Sjögren's Syndrome are enrolled and received Iguratimod 25 mg
      twice a day for 24 weeks. The differences of ESSPRI (EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient
      Reported Index) score, ESSPRI(EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index) score,
      unstimulated salivary flow rate, Schirmer's test SF-36 score and HAQ score between baseline
      and week 24 are evaluated to determine the efficacy of Iguratimod in patients with Sjögren's
      Syndrome.
