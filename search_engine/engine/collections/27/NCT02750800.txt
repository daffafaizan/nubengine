      prescribed in the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the local marketing
      authorization and professional and reimbursement guidelines with regards to dose, population
      and indication. AbbVie offered an array of services as part of a patient support program,
      called AbbVie Care 2.0, to study participants. The purpose of the AbbVie Care 2.0 program was
      to provide educational resources that aimed to help participants understand their health
      condition and disease management (e.g., lifestyle - exercise or diet), but also help to them
      understand how to administer the product safely and be empowered to stay on track with their
      prescribed treatment plan, all with the goal of maximizing patient outcomes. There were five
      target visits: a baseline visit at enrollment and follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
