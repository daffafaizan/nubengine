      non-malignant adrenal tumours. Thanks to the popularization of the posterior technique
      described by Walz and co-workers, the posterior retroperitoneal adrenalectomy (PRA) is being
      performed in increasing numbers worldwide. Advocates for the laparoscopic and
      retroperitoneoscopic approaches cite the advantages of each technique, but there is no
      published evidence that supports the superiority of one over the other. Most of the published
      literature is retrospective, with inadequate or no controls and with potential biases.

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that PRA is superior to the lateral
      transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LTLA) as minimally invasive approach to small and
      benign adrenal tumors.

      For a sample size calculation an assumption was made that a 20% reduction in duration of
      surgery represents clinically relevant difference. To detect this, it was calculated that 24
      patients would be required in each treatment arm to give the study a power of 90 per cent.
      Anticipating a 25% loss to follow-up, 32 patients per arm were required in the study.
