    
      Subjects will be randomized to: 1) trospium chloride or 2) placebo.

      There are three aims:

        1. To evaluate changes in cognitive function in elderly women taking trospium versus
           placebo, using validated cognitive assessment tests

        2. To develop a useful battery of cognitive screening tests for monitoring the cognitive
           safety of OAB management

        3. To understand how the timing of cognitive changes relates to the timing of improvement
           in OAB symptoms. The investigators will recruit 60 women aged â‰¥ 50 with the diagnosis of
           OAB. Cognitive assessments will be performed at baseline and Week 1 and 4 after drug
           initiation using paper-based validated questionnaires. OAB improvement will be assessed
           with validated questionnaires.
