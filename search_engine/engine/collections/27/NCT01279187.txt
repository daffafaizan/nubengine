      patients requiring dental implant therapy is planned. Subjects who qualify based on the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly placed into one of two treatment groups,
      teriparatide (20 Î¼g/day) or placebo control. Both patients and investigators will be blinded.
      Serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, radiographs, and a tetracycline-labelled
      bone core will constitute the main data gathered for analysis. After implant surgery,
      patients will return at 2 weeks for post-operative care and then at 14 weeks for an implant
      impression and again at 16 weeks to receive the final restoration. Twelve months after
      implant placement, patients will be seen for a follow-up exam and standardized radiograph to
      ensure proper healing.
