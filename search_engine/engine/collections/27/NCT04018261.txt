    
      A prospective, multicentre, open-label and uncontrolled phase Ib-II clinical trial in which a
      total of 20 patients â‰¥ 1 year of age with an allogeneic transplant of hematopoietic
      progenitors and post-transplant CMV infection will be included. The main objective is to
      evaluate the safety of the infusion of CMV activated T-lymphocytes and secondary objectives
      are to evaluate the efficacy through clinical evolution, viral load, ability to induce
      immunoreconstitution against the virus and evaluation of the persistence of specific T cells.

      The treatment will be administered intravenously (central or peripheral route) in a single
      dose at a dose of 0.01-5 E4 specific virus T lymphocytes per Kg of receptor weight. After the
      infusion, patients will follow periodic controls (+7, +14, +21, +28, +45 and +60 days) in
      which a clinical evaluation will be performed and blood samples will be obtained in order to
      evaluate the persistence of specific T cells in the recipient:
