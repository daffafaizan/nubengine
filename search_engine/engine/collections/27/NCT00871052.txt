      Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Austria. Eligible patients will be identified
      through diagnosis-related computer-assisted search in the electronic patient chart system of
      the Unit. The diagnosis of PLE will be verified by patient's history, clinical symptoms,
      histologic findings, laboratory studies and/or phototesting procedures.

      A calcipotriol-cream and a placebo cream are used in this study. Fifteen PLE patients will be
      enrolled. On day 1, the individual minimal erythema dose (MED) is assessed on patients' skin
      by exposure to a test ladder of solar-simulated UVR produced by a xenon arc source (Oriel
      Corp. Darmstadt, Germany). From day 2 to 5, 0.5 individual MED exposures (increased by 0 to
      30% per exposure, depending on the erythema response to a preceding dose) are given to a
      total of four 10-by-10 cm skin test fields on symmetrically located, individual PLE
      predilection sites on the trunk or extremities. These test fields are pretreated in a
      randomized and double-blinded fashion either with the calcipotriol cream or the placebo cream
      (twice a day) during 7 days before start of phototesting.
