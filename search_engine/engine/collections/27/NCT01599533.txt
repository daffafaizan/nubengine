    
      Through the constitution of a multicentric prospective cohort of patients with infra-renal
      AAA (n=450), the investigators aimed to determine the prevalence of a concomitant TAA, and
      the epidemiologic, clinical, biological and genetic factors related to this aortic phenotype.
      Therefore, the investigators postulate for a prevalence of the AAA-TAA association inferior
      or equal to 15%. By the use of an innovating software (AMIRA) to analyse scans, the
      investigators will perform reproductive measurements of segmental diameters from a segmental
      aortic volumetric numerized imaging, and describe the different thoracic aortic phenotypes
      associated with AAA, including the form (TAA, penetrating ulcer, dolichoaorta â€¦) and the
      location of the disease.
