      doses of STP705 and placebo via intradermal injection into the keloid excision site, to
      prevent the recurrence of keloids following their excision.

      A total of up to 50 adult subjects will be treated once weekly for 4 weeks. One eligible
      qualifying keloid will be excised. The subjects will be randomized to receive STP705 or
      placebo for treatment of the keloidectomy excision suture line.

      To be eligible, keloid scar(s) must have been present for at least one year with a target
      keloid area on the trunk or extremity (non-peri-orbital/-anogenital/-scalp), measures
      ≥0.30cm³, and be suitable for surgical excision which will result in a single wound no
      greater than 8 cm long.

      Assigned dose of STP705 or placebo will be injected along the keloid excision site, once
      weekly for 4 weeks beginning the day of keloid excision.

      The study is divided into 3 phase: screening phase (4 weeks), Treatment phase (up to 4 weeks
      +/- allowed windows), Follow up phase (up to 52 weeks +/- allowed windows).
