      traumatic rotator cuff tears. We have seen no prospective studies describing the progression
      of shoulder function improvement the first year after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

      We hypothesize that early arthroscopic repair of traumatic rotator cuff tears yields
      successful functional and structural outcomes but there will be a progression of shoulder
      function improvement during the hole first postoperative year.
