      to an increase in the use of assisted reproductive techniques. Isolation of living and
      morphologically normal live sperm is an integrated procedure in commonly used IVF /
      ICSI(intracytoplasmic sperm injection) / IUI(intrauterine insemination) procedures. Although
      current IVF / ICSI procedures result in a successful pregnancy of around 50%, the process can
      be greatly compromised if the selected sperm is abnormal. Microfluidic chips are one of the
      recommended sperm separation methods to eliminate DNA fragmentation in sperm. It is thought
      that the separation of the sperm by centrifugation in the classical gradient density
      (Percoll) method which is used in the separation of sperm in the IVF Laboratories, causes the
      increase of reactive oxygen radicals in sperm and this leads to sperm DNA fragmentation.
      Studies comparing Percoll and microfluidic chip method in terms of sperm, embryo quality and
      pregnancy rates are limited. In this context, it is aimed to investigate the effect of
      Percoll or Microfluidic Chip Technology on the quality of sperms and embryos obtained with
      these sperms and their pregnancy rates prospectively.
