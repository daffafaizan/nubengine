      enrollment. Parts 1 and 2 were the supportive/ exploratory parts (phase 2) of the study and
      part 3 and 4 were the confirmatory/ registrational parts (phase 3) of the study. In parts 1
      and 2 of the study, ABT-493 and ABT-530 were co-administered as separate tablets. However, in
      parts 3 and 4 of the study, the ABT-493/ABT-530 co-formulated tablets were administered.
