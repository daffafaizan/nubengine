      service alternative. Their use have increasingly drawn a wider range of interest as a text
      communication and video chat system between health care professionals and patients and health
      care professionals themselves. However, high-quality and adequately evaluated research,
      especially in the field of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson´s disease, is needed
      to establish whether patients with these specific neurological problems can be effectively
      managed with these technological tools. In this study, patients with Parkinson´s disease from
      high, middle, and low-income countries covering urban and rural populations, with at least
      one neurologist with Movement Disorders practice (Spain, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria,
      Tanzania, South Korea, United States, Egypt), will be included. Feasibility, clinical
      management, providers and patient´s satisfaction will be compared between in-office vs.
      telemedicine (virtual) visits. This study will show the effectiveness of telemedicine, when
      the access to specialized neurological care is limited, especially now with the Covid-19
      pandemic.
