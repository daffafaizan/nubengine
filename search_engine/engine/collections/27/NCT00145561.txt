      the transmission of HIV from mother-to-child.The (relative) contra-indications for the NNRTIs
      during pregnancy make a PI based regimen the most rational choice. Based on several
      experiences and investigations it is expected that saquinavir will play a role as a component
      of tripe drug regimens for HIV-infected pregnant women. Since the bid dose regimen of 1,000mg
      saquinavir and 100mg ritonavir is approved by the regulatory authorities and with the
      availability of a new 500mg tablet formulation of saquinavir,there is a need for a
      well-designed pharmacokinetic trial using the new 500mg saquinavir tablet formulation in the
      above mentioned dose.
