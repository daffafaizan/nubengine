      conditions seen in hospitalized patients in regards to inflammation, immobilisation and
      fasting. In this new model of disease, healthy young adults will be given lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) to induce endotoxemia and inflammation on study day 1 and then fast and bedrest for 36
      hours (Study day 2). Glucose, fat and protein metabolism will be investigated using clamp
      technique and tracer methodology together with intracellular signalling pathway activation in
      muscle and fat biopsies. This new model of disease will later be used in another study to
      investigate different protein supplementÂ´s effect on muscle waste during acute febrile
      disease.
