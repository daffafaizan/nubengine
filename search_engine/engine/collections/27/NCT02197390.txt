      qualified health center, and a county public health department. We used formative research,
      advisory committee members' recommendations, and previous research to inform the development
      of the Our Choice project. Our theory-informed multi-sector, multi-level intervention targets
      improvements in four health behaviors: fruit, vegetable, and water consumption, physical
      activity, and sleep. Intervention partners include 1200 families, a federally qualified
      health center (including three clinics), 26 early care and education centers, two elementary
      school districts (and 20 elementary schools), three community recreation centers, and three
      restaurants. Intervention components in all sectors target changes in behaviors, policies,
      systems, and the social and physical environment. Evaluation activities include assessment of
      the primary outcome, BMI z-score, at baseline, 12- and 18-months post-baseline, and sector
      evaluations at baseline, 12, and 24-months.
