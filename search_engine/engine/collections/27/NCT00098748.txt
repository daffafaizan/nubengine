    
      (i) Subjects remained on their assigned therapy for 48 weeks, unless the subject was
      discontinued early for protocol-defined treatment failure or other reasons such as adverse
      event, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or death.

      (ii) If a subject met the criteria for treatment failure or discontinued for another reason
      (eg, pregnancy, adverse event) and required an alternative regimen, the subject was followed
      until the Week 48 visit according to protocol guidelines. The new regimen, selected by the
      Investigator based on the results of resistance testing at the time of failure, had to be
      recorded in the CRF.

      (iii) Open-label maraviroc (UK-427,857) was provided by the sponsor, until it was
      commercially available, to subjects who completed 48 weeks of therapy and for whom it was
      medically appropriate to continue therapy with maraviroc (UK-427,857).
