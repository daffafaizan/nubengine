    
      Postoperative pain is a world wide problem related with surgery. Multimodal analgesia may
      include ketamine, aimed to decrease opioid adverse effects in postoperative analgesia for
      major surgery, and risk of chronic postsurgical pain. Ketamine has shown efficacy as adjuvant
      in multimodal analgesia, however, neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular effects of ketamine at
      low doses in continue postoperative infusion are less known. This type of adverse effects may
      compromise appropriated recovery.

      Objective

      to determine frequency of delirium, agitation, sedation, hallucinations, bad dreams and
      cardiovascular changes associated with ketamine analgesic infusion treatment for
      postoperative pain.
