      of the consumption of Sugar Free Gum (SFG) containing casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium
      phosphate (CPP-ACP) on tooth mineralisation and especially on the promotion of tooth
      remineralisation, over and above the well-established role of regular SFG, in humans.

      This study is a monocentric, randomised, double-blind, cross-over and controlled study. The
      research hypothesis is that chewing a SFG containing CPP-ACP from Recaldent will better
      remineralise the enamel in healthy subjects compared with regular SFG, after 2 weeks of gum
      chewing 5 times a day for 20 minutes within 5 minutes after each meal and snack occasion,
      with a CPP-ACP dose of 18.8 mg per SFG. This will be studied with an in situ model study,
      with palatal appliances bearing recessed (1,5mm) human demineralised enamel blocks with
      caries-like lesions (subsurface lesions), which should be worn 24 h a day by the subjects,
      including during eating and drinking (but the appliances should be removed for daily oral
      hygiene procedure and cleaning of the appliance itself). Each appliance will contain two
      types of the demineralised enamel blocks: half of the blocks will contain shallow subsurface
      lesions (Carbopol method) and the other half reflecting deeper subsurface lesions
      (hydroxy-ethyl cellulose method). Both types of lesions have been the subject of oral
      research interest, as both shallow and deep lesions are involved in caries genesis. Changes
      in mineralisation of the lesions will be assessed using Transverse Microradiography (TMR).
