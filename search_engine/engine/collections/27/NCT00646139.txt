      Primary

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose of KX2-391 when administered as multiple oral
           solutions in patients with refractory advanced solid tumors and lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of KX2-391 given as single and multiple oral
           solutions in these patients.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of single dosing and multiple dosing of
           KX2-391 in these patients.

        -  To determine the biological effects of KX2-391.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral KX2-391 once or twice daily for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and urine samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic studies. Biological
      effects are assessed by measuring plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor by
      ELISA. Levels of phospho-Src Tyr and transphosphorylation of selected substrates are measured
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
