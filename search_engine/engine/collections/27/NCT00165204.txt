      symptoms for up to 3 months before beginning the study. Those choosing not to take hormones
      may enroll in the study immediately.

      All women will have a baseline mammogram, breast examination, and bone study density
      performed, along with blood and urine analysis for measurement of bone markers. They will
      also be asked to take a questionnaire.

      Patients will take either tibolone or placebo once daily for 1 year. Neither the patient or
      the physician will be aware of which treatment a woman is taking during the study.

      Patients will return at 6 and 12 months to have a physical examination, blood work, urine
      collection and bone studies. At one year, a repeat mammogram will be performed. There are
      also some questionnaires asking about menopause symptoms that will be performed at intervals
      during the study.

      It is also recommended that patients take calcium and vitamin D throughout the study.
