    
      Patients will be randomized to receive 1 of 3 study regimens: Group A - Saquinavir (SQV) sgc
      plus 2 new reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs), Group B - SQV sgc plus delavirdine plus
      new RTI, and Group C - SQV sgc plus nelfinavir plus new RTI, or SQV sgc plus ritonavir plus 2
      new RTIs.

      NOTE: "New RTI" is defined for this study as any reverse transcriptase inhibitor to which the
      patient has never been exposed.

      AS PER AMENDMENT 12/12/97: In this open-label, multicenter, Phase IIIB, comparative study,
      825 patients are randomized to treatment arms. (NOTE: 50% of the patients will be treatment
      naive and 50% will be NRTI experienced.) Further, patients are randomized with stratification
      based on HIV-1 RNA level (5,000-30,000 copies/ml vs. greater than 30,000 copies/ml) and prior
      antiretroviral therapy to one of the three study arms.

      The drug regimens for the three treatment arms are as follows:

      ARM A: Fortovase (FTV), plus 2 new NRTIs*. ARM B: FTV plus 2 new NRTIs*. ARM C: FTV plus
      nelfinavir plus new NRTI**.

        -  Naive patients in Arm A and Arm B will take: d4T (or zidovudine) plus 3TC unless
           contraindicated.

           ** Naive patients in Arm C will take: d4T, unless contraindicated.

        -  NRTI experienced patients in Arms A & B should be treated with 2 NRTIs to which he/she
           has not been previously exposed. If the patient has only 1 NRTI to which he/she has
           never been exposed, then the second NRTI can be one that the patient has been previously
           exposed to from the most distant past.

      Therapy is administered for an initial 24 weeks and may be extended for an additional 24
      weeks.
