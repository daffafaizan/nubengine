      affect the taste for sweet liquids. Taste perception will be assessed before surgery
      (pre-operative, pre-op) and after bariatric surgery, at approximately 1 month. Taste studies
      will be conducted with solutions prepared freshly before each test using sucrose dissolved in
      distilled water. Six concentrations of sucrose (table sugar) will be tasted in random order,
      with the most concentrated solution being roughly the sweetness of soda. The subject is
      blinded to the concentrations. It is hypothesized that there will be no significant
      difference in taste perception when pre-op and post-op values are compared. However, the
      investigators hypothesize that taste preference will identify solutions with lower
      concentrations post-op.
