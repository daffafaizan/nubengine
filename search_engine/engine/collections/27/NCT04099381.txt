      most common disorder of the diseases characterized by dysfunctions in response to social
      interaction and communication, as well as the presence of repetitive and stereotyped
      behaviors. Recent reports of a sharp increase in the number of children with autism. The
      exact etiology of autism remains unclear. Compliance, the definition of effective treatments
      for autism is particularly difficult.

      Although it has been understood, it can be a question of immune dysregulation. Examination of
      the inflammatory cytokines, dysfunction of the immune system and the immune system. The Human
      Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cells (hUCB-MNCs) have been shown to have the ability to
      modulate the immune response and enhance angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising
      therapeutic strategy. Our study suggest that infusion of cord blood mononuclear cells will
      affect Autism.

      This protocol was developed on the basis of the results of the previously approved protocol
      of the center NCT03786744 (Transfusion of allogeneic cord blood samples in patients with
      autism spectrum disorders), which showed high efficiency in the rehabilitation of patients.
      The present protocol is intended for revealing the dependence of the clinical effect on the
      degree of tissue compatibility of umbilical cord blood samples and the recipient.
