      I. Determine the progression-free survival rate in patients with metastatic or unresectable
      carcinoid tumors treated with bevacizumab and PEG-interferon alfa-2b.

      II. Determine the tumor response rate (complete and partial) in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      III. Determine the biochemical response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are treated in 2 stages.

      Stage I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on day 1.

      Arm II: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 8, and 15.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 3 weeks. Patients with progressive disease at 9 weeks
      proceed to stage II. All other patients proceed to stage II after 18 weeks on stage I.

      Stage II: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on day 1 and PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC once weekly.
      Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) and remain in CR for 2 additional courses come
      off study. Patients are followed for survival.
