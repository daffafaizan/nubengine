      electrocardiography to construct cardiac electrical activation maps.

      All participants will attend for an UHF-ECG. This involves placing standard
      electrocardiography electrodes (up to 48) followed by electrocardiography recording using the
      UHF-ECG machine for 10-15 minutes.

      Participants undergoing a clinically indicated VT ablation procedure will their UHF-ECG done
      before the procedure at a separate time. The ablation procedure itself will proceed as
      standard with no alternation whatsoever in study participants and no invasive measurements
      will be undertaken during the procedure. After the procedure is complete the 3D electrical
      maps collected to guide VT ablation will be analyzed and used for the study. The invasive
      maps will be compared with the non-invasive maps obtained using UHF-EGC.
