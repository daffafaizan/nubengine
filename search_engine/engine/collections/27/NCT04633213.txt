      class of medications have been approved for rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and
      uveitis. HBM9036 (HL036) is a molecularly engineered TNFR1 fragment, and molecule
      fragmentation and engineering techniques are applied for enhanced tissue distribution,
      increased stability and potency. In multiple early stage studies including preclinical
      studies, HBM9036 (HL036) has demonstrated the safety and efficacy in the therapy for moderate
      and severe dry eye. As a phase 3 confirmational study, this study is to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of 0.25% HBM9036 (HL036) ophthalmic solution compared to placebo in Chinese
      subjects with moderate and severe dry eye.
