      taking frequent anti-inflammatory eye drops, they often continue their glaucoma medications.
      This can cause patient confusion and nonadherence, potentially leading to poor healing,
      slower recovery period, and/or cystoid macular edema. DEXTENZA®, as a sustained release
      anti-inflammatory insert, could help preclude adherence difficulties and increase comfort by
      reducing eye drop load. However, glaucoma surgeons may hesitate to adopt DEXTENZA® due to
      concerns regarding safety with respect to elevated intraocular pressure. This prospective
      study will address those concerns directly, providing timely and high-quality clinical
      evidence comparing DEXTENZA® to standard-of-care steroid eye drops. For physicians and
      patients, the results of this study will prove immediately useful for therapeutic
      decision-making.
