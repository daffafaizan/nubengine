      some chronic painful conditions, in spite of methodological weaknesses. The
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the endogenous opioid (EO) system are the
      mechanisms appear to explain how acupuncture works in part. These systems have been shown to
      be important mediators of stress, pain and other stimuli. The Osteoarthritis Research
      International suggest that osteoarthritis (OA) treatment should be multidisciplinary and
      recommended acupuncture as one of 12 possible non-pharmacological modalities for treating OA.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, parallel design. 128
      out-patients over 50 years with OA of the knee will be recruited from Mallorca, Spain.
      Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: placebo/sham acupuncture, non
      insertion technique, and EA. Acupuncture treatments will be used the Traditional Chinese
      Medicine (TCM) style. The patients will be evaluated after a period of one month (2 sessions
      weekly), three months (1session monthly), six months (1 session every 45 days) and again one
      year later (1 session every 2 months), at the end of the study.
