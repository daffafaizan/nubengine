      formation. It is expected that endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is a trauma causing
      adhesions around the hepatobiliary area. Such adhesions may cause some difficulty for
      consequent gallbladder surgery. For that reason, tissue measurements of factors indicating
      degree of peritoneal healing and adhesion is helpful for timing of such surgical
      interventions.

      Patients are going to be randomized to early and delayed surgery groups. Sampling of
      peritoneum around the gallbladder during laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients after
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is performed. Tissue concentrations of tissue-type
      plasminogen activator and its specific activity, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and
      plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 are going to be studied by using commercial assays.

      Peritoneal fibrinolytic activity and surgical outcomes are going to be compared.
