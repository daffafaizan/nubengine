      Following initial 2-day training, participant therapists will be randomized to either
      individual supervision, group supervision, an internet-based training program, or
      autodidactic training. Participants will be followed for a year to determine their use of
      IPT, outcomes with patients, and adherence and quality of IPT in 4 case portfolios. The
      adherence measure for IPT developed in Phase I of the project is being used as the gold
      standard measure of IPT fidelity.
