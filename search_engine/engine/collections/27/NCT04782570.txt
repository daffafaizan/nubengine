    
      The following hypotheses are derived:

        1. Patients with acrophobia, who receive an active rTMS of the left FC before VRET, show a
           significantly stronger reduction of phobic symptoms immediately after exposure therapy,
           compared to the sham stimulation group.

        2. Patients with acrophobia, who receive an active rTMS of the left FC before VRET, show a
           significantly greater increase in approach behavior and significantly less distress
           during the BAT immediately after exposure therapy, compared to the sham stimulation
           group.

        3. The postulated differences in hypotheses 1 and 2 are still detectable at follow-up after
           6 months.
