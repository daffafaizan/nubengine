    
      This is a prospective, two-arm, single-center randomized controlled pilot trial of a cancer
      rehabilitation program for older adults, titled the 'CARE program,' which is designed to
      maintain and/or improve functional status and quality of life in older adults diagnosed with
      cancer. Adults aged 65 years and older with cancer will be screened with a Geriatric
      Assessment (GA) for eligibility. Although breast cancer patients will be eligible, this study
      will focus primarily on other types of cancers. Adults with at least one functional deficit
      --defined as impairment in ability to perform activities of daily living or instrumental
      activities of daily living, cognitive decline or balance -- will be randomized to either the
      intervention (CARE program) or to the control arm (Supportive care services information
      only). Both arms will receive a brochure about the supportive care program to provide
      patients who we've identified as having deficits with information about auxiliary services
      available and because the intent is to limit the difference between the groups. We
      hypothesize that patients who participate in the CARE program will maintain or improve
      functional status and quality of life when compared to supportive care services information
      only.
