      characterized by the expression of CD19 CD24hiCD38hi . Breg cells can inhibit inflammatory
      responses in autoimmune disease, like Systemic lupus erythematosus, via the production of
      IL-10 (an antiatherogenic cytokine) which will suppress TNF- Î± production by monocytes
      leading to inhibition of T cell-mediated inflammation. Regulatory B have a vital role in
      immune tolerance and their deficiency resulted in exacerbation of autoimmunity . Evidence
      suggests Breg in autoimmune disease may be dysfunctional .

      In this proposal, We suggest IL-10 production by Breg confers an atheroprotective role. In
      Systemic lupus erythematosus, Regulatory B ability to control atherosclerosis is reduced
      therefore, we will test the hypothesis that Regulatory B play an important role in both
      autoimmunity and accelerated atherosclerosis and dysfunction in Regulatory B from autoimmune
      disease may or may not result in a reduced ability to control atherosclerosis .
