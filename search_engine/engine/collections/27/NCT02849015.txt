      study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of the
      combined therapy using cryosurgery and NK cells.

      The safety will be evaluated by statistics of adverse reactions. The efficacy will be
      evaluated according to local relief degree, progress free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS).
