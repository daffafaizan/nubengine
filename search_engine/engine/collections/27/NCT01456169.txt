    
      Eligible participants completed a 2-week single-blind run-in period (Days -42 to -29) prior
      to a Single-Blind Monotherapy Treatment Period (Day -28 to Day -1) where they received
      azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg. After the Single-Blind Monotherapy Treatment Period, those
      participants who achieved target blood pressure discontinued treatment and resumed standard
      of care management at the discretion of their treating physician, while those participants
      who did not achieve target blood pressure (defined as clinic systolic blood pressure â‰¥140
      mmHg) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 active treatment arms: azilsartan medoxomil 40 mg plus
      placebo, azilsartan medoxomil plus chlorthalidone 40/12.5 mg, or azilsartan medoxomil plus
      chlorthalidone 40/25 mg.
