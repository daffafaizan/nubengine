    
      The study is a 2-parallel groups' randomized controlled trial. Participants with elevated
      fasting plasma glucose concentrations (FPG 100-125 mg/dl) or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C
      5.7-6.3%) are enrolled. All study subjects are randomized to receive a lifestyle intervention
      (intervention group) or regular prevention education (control group). The parameters are
      obtained from physical examination and biochemical assessments by well-trained case manager
      at baseline and each follow visit (3th months, 6th months and 12th months). All participants
      complete a structured questionnaire, including basic information, disease history, physical
      activity, food-frequency, stage of change, and social support situation.
