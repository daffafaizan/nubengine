      with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma when liver transplantation or surgical resection
      are not suitable options, it is still performed only in a few hospitals and experience is so
      far limited (Goldberg & Ahmed, 2002; Shiina et al., 2005). In addition, RF ablation is
      emerging as a viable alternative to surgery for inoperable patients with limited hepatic
      metastatic disease, especially from colorectal cancer. Although radiofrequency ablation has
      been accepted as a safe and effective treatment for liver and kidney tumours, there are few
      studies addressing periprocedural pain.

      Thus, the optimal anaesthetic procedure is still to be determined. Currently at our
      institution RF is performed as monitored sedation procedure using remifentanil infusion
      supplemented with midazolam boluses, when considered necessary. However, when using
      remifentanil and midazolam combination it is quite difficult to avoid too deep respiratory
      depression.

      Dexmedetomidine is an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic
      effects, and it has more selective α2-adrenergic effect than clonidine. Dexmedetomidine has a
      great deal of potential in this arena given its analgesic and anxiolytic properties while
      preserving respiratory drive (Bergese SD et al., 2010).

      All patients will receive dexmedetomidine 0.4 µg/kg/hr infusion from the start of procedure.
      The infusion will be continued during the whole RF procedure.

      At the same time all patients will receive remifentanil infusion according to TCI (target
      controlled infusion) protocol. Plasma concentration target will be set from 0.5 ng/ml and, if
      necessary, will be increased to achieve a comfortable state of patient (Ramsey Sedation
      Scale: 2-3).
