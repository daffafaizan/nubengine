      more than 50% of patients who need ART are not receiving it and signiﬁcant mortality from
      AIDS persists. One major challenge in this region is high rates of late ART initiation (i.e.,
      in the advanced stages of HIV disease) which results in high rates of mortality soon after
      ART initiation. The clinic-level factors that contribute to late ART initiation are unclear.

      Objective: As the second of a 3-phase NIH-sponsored project, this study aims to identify
      clinic-level enablers and barriers to timely ART initiation.

      Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study will be conducted at 4 purposively selected HIV
      care and treatment clinics in Ethiopia. Data will be collected using 4 methods:

        1. Data abstraction

        2. Key informant interviews with clinic personnel

        3. Observation of post-test counseling sessions at the voluntary counseling and testing
           (VCT) clinic

        4. Observation of provider-patient interactions in the care and treatment clinic
           Descriptive statistics will be produced from the data abstraction. Content analysis of
           key informant interviews will be conducted. Descriptive summaries will be produced from
           observations. All analyses will focus on identifying within- and across-clinic themes,
           and include triangulation across data collection methods to identify clinic-level
           enablers and barriers to timely ART initiation.

      Expected use of results: Identifying modiﬁable clinic-level enablers and barriers to timely
      ART initiation will facilitate implementation of interventions, programs and policies to
      reduce late ART initiation. Additionally, results will inform the third phase of the
      NIH-project referenced above.
