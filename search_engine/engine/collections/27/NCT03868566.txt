      study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of SNP-612 for the treatment of NAFLD.

      Subjects who fulfill all the entry criteria and have written informed consent will be
      enrolled to the study. Considering a 10% drop-out rate, approximately 72 subjects will be
      enrolled in order to recruit 64 evaluable subject subjects to complete the enrollment.

      Subjects will be administered the study agents oral daily for 3 months or until treatment
      terminates prematurely. Subjects will return to the study center for clinical evaluation once
      every 4 weeks throughout the treatment period. Clinical assessment procedures and laboratory
      tests including ultrasound imaging, hematology with differential, biochemistry, liver
      function panel, and urinalysis, will be performed at each study visit. The primary endpoint
      assessment will be the reduction of ALT, at completion of Week 12 compared to baseline. With
      64 evaluable patients, there will be an 80% chance of detecting a significant difference at a
      two sided 0.05 significance level.

      Subjects who finish treatment or discontinue prematurely from the study for any reason after
      receiving one or more doses of study agent will be assessed for safety for 2 (Â±1) weeks after
      the last study agent dose or longer in the case of any significant AE or abnormal biochemical
      or clinical finding.

      Each subject will participate in the study for approximately 14 weeks (including the
      enrollment/baseline visit, 3 routine monthly visits during treatment period, and 1 follow-up
      visit after 2 weeks of the end of treatment).

      It is assumed the study will include a 6 months enrollment period and a further 4 months to
      complete the follow-up for all enrolled patients.
