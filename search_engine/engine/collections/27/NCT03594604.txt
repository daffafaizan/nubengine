      in events that menstruation would normally interfere with. While most OBGYNs prescribe
      combined oral contraceptives for this purpose, this method often results in unpredictable
      spotting, especially at the beginning of therapy. Norethindrone, a progesterone agonist,
      inhibits ovulation through its antagonistic effect at the anterior pituitary, preventing the
      release of LH. Additionally, it thickens cervical mucus to inhibit sperm migration into the
      uterine cavity . Norethindrone downregulates estrogen receptors on the endometrium lining
      preventing endometrial proliferation, enhancing glandular secretion, and maintaining
      endometrium integrity. Therefore, norethindrone is well suited in preventing the endometrium
      from breakdown and preventing menstrual bleeding. Indeed, many OBGYNs have consistently used
      it for this purpose in women who desire to remain fertile. The intention of our study was to
      compare norethindrone to birth control pills in order to determine the effectiveness at
      suppressing bleeding and spotting, compare side effect profiles and to find a method allowing
      women to freely and comfortably participate in their life events.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. Determine if norethindrone can delay menstruation without breakthrough bleeding

        2. Compare norethindrone with oral contraceptive pills for delaying menstruation

        3. Compare patient satisfaction of each method

        4. Compare side effect profiles of each method
