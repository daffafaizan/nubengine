      devices that deliver vaporized nicotine when inhaled. Corresponding with the growth in media
      attention, marketing and promotion, awareness and use of e-cigarettes has increased
      dramatically. A large proportion of those using e-cigarettes use them to reduce the number of
      cigarettes they are smoking or to help them quit. Use of an e-cigarette by smokers unwilling
      or unable to stop smoking completely might be a good approach to reducing cigarette
      consumption as the e-cigarette imitates some behavioral aspects of cigarette smoking and
      contains nicotine. Moreover, the few existing studies on the effect of e-cigarettes on
      tobacco withdrawal and craving suggest promising potential to assist smokers in coping with
      smoking urges and decreasing cigarette use.
