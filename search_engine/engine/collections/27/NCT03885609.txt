    
      The study includes 84 treatment sessions, twice a day, and 4 clinic visits over a period of 6
      weeks.

      One treatment group (Silk'n power toothbrush - ToothWave) and 1 control group (an ADA
      approved power toothbrush (PTB)) will participate in the study.

      For each patient, efficacy assessment data will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and at 6
      weeks. The average stain data will be calculated for each group.

      Treatment is defined as a timed, 2 minute brushing of the teeth according to the
      manufactur-er's instructions, twice daily (morning and evening). Brushing will be undertaken
      using the Silk'n toothbrush and standard fluoride toothpaste. The control group will use an
      ADA ac-cepted PTB and the same standard fluoride toothpaste.
