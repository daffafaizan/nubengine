      improve the outcomes of both adults with heart failure and their partners. The proposed study
      will evaluate a novel, dyadic program, Taking Care of Us, versus an educational counseling
      condition using a randomized controlled trial on 72 couples living with heart failure. Both
      programs are offered via Zoom by trained interventionists and last approximately three
      months.

      Specifically, we will 1) determine the efficacy of the Taking Care of Us intervention on
      dyadic health; 2) determine the efficacy of the Taking Care of Us intervention on dyadic
      appraisal and dyadic management; and 3) determine the feasibility and acceptability of the
      Taking Care of Us intervention.
