      studies have shown that isoflurane reduces myocardial contractility in a dose-dependent
      manner, and compromises left ventricular (LV) function.

      Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of mitral annular velocity during the cardiac cycle has been
      introduced as a reliable method for analysis of systolic and diastolic LV long-axis function.
      Efficacy of systolic and diastolic TDI profiles, including systole (S'), early early
      relaxation (E')and atrial contraction (A') have been suggested to be useful in predicting the
      impact of isoflurane on LV systolic and diastolic function.

      The investigators hypothesized that isoflurane, even at a clinical dosage, would affects
      intraoperative LV systolic function in a dose-dependent manner and thus produce significant
      changes int the TDI profiles of systolic mitral annular velocity (S').

      So the investigators planned to study the changes in S' of lateral mitral annulus at the
      clinical isoflurane dosage during remifentanil based anesthesia for cardiac surgery.
