    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational agent, P10s-PADRE, a peptide
      mimotope-based vaccine, in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients
      with clinical stage I, II or III estrogen-receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PR)
      negative and HER2-negative (= triple negative - TN) breast cancer. P10s-PADRE will be
      administered with MONTANIDEâ„¢ ISA 51 VG as adjuvant. Human breast cancers that express Tumor
      Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs) can be immunogenic, and enhancing the anti-TACA
      antibodies and immune effector function already present may augment the cytotoxic effects of
      standard therapies.

      A randomized two-arm, open-label, multi-center phase II trial is designed with the goal being
      to evaluate the efficacy of combining vaccination of the P10s-PADRE formulation with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to standard
      chemotherapy plus P10s-PADRE or to standard chemotherapy alone. Efficacy will be based on the
      rate of pathologic Complete Response (pCR) observed among TN breast-cancer patients treated
      with the combination as compared with the group of patients who receive standard chemotherapy
      alone.
