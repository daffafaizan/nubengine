      Together (HT), by supporting the integration of the HT program into core services of
      organizations serving children (up to 18 years) and families, particularly those from
      under-served populations across diverse communities and settings in Canada. The HT program
      offers a flexible, effective, integrated approach, relevant to multiple contexts, creating
      potential to become a sustainable approach to promoting healthier weights in Canadian
      children. The objectives of the evaluation for Phase 3 are to:

        1. Describe the effectiveness of the HT program in relation to knowledge, attitude and
           behavior change at the individual, family, and community level.

        2. Monitor quality and sustainability of HT, when offered as part of core service by
           organizations to meet diverse community needs and cultural contexts.

        3. Create an effective knowledge mobilization framework to increase practice and policy
           influence of HT, in collaboration with regional, provincial and national networks.
