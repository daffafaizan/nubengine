      cause of disability in Gulf War Veterans. Cognitive complaints are a common symptom of GWI,
      which suggests the brain is involved in the development of this condition. As Veterans age,
      these cognitive complaints may worsen and be compounded by the aging process. GWI may be a
      condition of "accelerated" brain aging. Therefore, there may be long-term consequences of
      GWI, and the presence of GWI may increase a person's risk for developing Alzheimer's Disease
      (AD) or other dementias. In comparison to other brain-related diseases such as stroke,
      relatively little is known about GWI and how this condition impacts the normal age-related
      changes in the brain.

      The research aims are:

        1. To determine if Veterans with Gulf War Illness demonstrate abnormal brain blood flow
           regulation and autonomic dysfunction when compared with Veterans without Gulf War
           Illness.

        2. To determine if brain blood flow and autonomic nervous system variables in Veterans are
           associated with other markers of brain aging that are relevant to cognitive decline.
