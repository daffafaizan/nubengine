      is part of a large comprehensive investigation initiated and funded by the National Institute
      of Child Health and Human Development to aid in the understanding of a reported association
      of methylphenidate treatment and elevated frequencies of some types of chromosome damage.

      Population: 60 diagnosed ADHD children, age range 6-12 years inclusive, for whom
      pharmacological treatment with stimulant medication is indicated. 30 children will initiate
      treatment with a methylphenidate-based product and 30 will initiate treatment with Adderall
      or Adderall-XR. Study group assignment will be randomized, as these two drugs are considered
      by the clinical community to be fully interchangeable.

      Primary Objective: To determine the frequency of micronuclei (markers of numerical or
      structural chromosomal damage), sister chromatid exchanges (indicators of DNA damage), and
      chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes of pediatric ADHD patients prior to and after 3 months
      of uninterrupted drug therapy. These endpoints, and the time frame, are compatible with
      investigating effects during the initiation phase of treatment; additional studies by other
      NIH institutes (NIMH, CDC) will investigate effects after chronic treatment with stimulant
      medications so that a comprehensive picture of the potential for treatment-induced
      chromosomal damage in ADHD subjects is obtained.

      Secondary Objective: In pediatric ADHD patients treated with a methylphenidate-based product
      or Adderall, to determine if flow cytometric measurement of the frequency of micronucleated
      erythrocytes can serve as a biomarker of cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes evaluated by
      standard light microscope techniques.
