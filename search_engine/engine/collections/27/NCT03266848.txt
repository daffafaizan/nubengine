      as a contrast agent, and validate the method with first-in-human studies. Subjects who are
      already scheduled to receive ferumoxytol infusion will undergo MRI scans after the infusion.
      The ferumoxytol infusion itself is not a part of the study. The project will provide brain
      angiograms and establish a human cerebrovascular atlas that will enable future quantitative
      diagnosis of cerebrovascular abnormalities by revealing abnormal regions of the brain that
      characterize disease, a tool which doesn't currently exist, and which could lead to many
      exciting discoveries and clinical applications in neurology.
