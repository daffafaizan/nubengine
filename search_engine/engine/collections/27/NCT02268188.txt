      I. Measure survivor participation in regards to each aspect of the Harvesting Health Program
      (personalized and group education, gardening and harvesting, and utilization of novel
      web-based technologies).

      II. Assess survivor preferences regarding key Harvesting Health Program components impacting
      participation (physical facilities, schedule and timing, education topics and sessions,
      garden access, web portal usability, etc.).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. A customized "Nutrition & Physical Activity Scorecard" has been developed and will be
      implemented to evaluate pre/post measures of diet and physical activity at baseline (month 0)
      and at months 6, 9 and 12.

      II. Participants are evaluated at baseline and at completion of the intervention for: (a)
      serum and body composition biomarkers of exposure and efficacy, and (b) health indices
      related to cancer survivorship and overall health.

      III. To assess Program sustainability, follow-up questionnaires will be completed at 9 and 12
      months using the Nutrition & Physical Activity Scorecard and questionnaires regarding quality
      of life outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo a series of 10 education and training sessions over 1 hour every 2
      weeks, comprising education on current research, evidence-based health guidelines,
      application techniques, reference materials specific to extended-stage cancer survivors, and
      recommendations and personal health goals for survivorship.
