    
      Primary endpoint:

      In a population based study to evaluate 30-day mortality (perioperative death) in younger
      versus elderly (≥70 years) patients with ASDH.

      Secondary endpoint(s):

        1. Describe pattern of care in younger versus the elderly

        2. Clinical outcome (Glasgow outcome scale at 6-months (range, 3-12) follow-up in younger
           versus elderly (≥70 years) patients with ASDH:

             -  Good outcome predefined as GOS 4-5

             -  Unfavourable outcome predefined as GOS 1-3

        3. 30-day morbidity (according to the Ibanez classification) in younger versus elderly (≥70
           years) patients with ASDH.

        4. To assess the effect of age as an independent prognostic factor in traumatic ASDH for
           outcome (GOS) in the elderly (≥70 years) using a three-step approach

             1. Match elderly (cases) with younger (controls) patients with respect to

                  1. GCS at admission to treating hospital according to severity - mild (GCS
                     14-15), moderate (GCS 9-13), severe (GCS 3-8)

                  2. Midline-shift (with a cut off of > 10 mm)

                  3. Dilated pupil(s) (yes/no)

             2. Using a multivariable approach with all patients including age (continuous model)
                to identify independent predictors of an unfavourable outcome (GOS 1-3)

             3. Using a multivariable approach including age as a continuous variable within the
                elderly population (≥70 years) to identify independent predictors of an
                unfavourable outcome among the oldest (GOS 1-3)
