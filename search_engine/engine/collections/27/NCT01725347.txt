      use with preschoolers. Primary caregivers (the majority will be mothers) and HS assistants
      will use a Smartphone to capture 24-hour images of HS children's food selection and plate
      waste. The RFPM, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). and the Food Photography ApplicationÂ©
      will be used to estimate the energy and nutrient intake of preschoolers. The accuracy of the
      RFPM will be examined by determining the energy and nutrient intake (collectively referred to
      as food intake [FI]) to established methods: 1) actual gram (g) weights of laboratory-based
      test meals and 2) doubly labeled water (DLW) in a natural environment.
