      Primary

        -  Measure changes in metabolic activity at visceral sites during the acute treatment phase
           of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) using positron emission tomography (PET)/CT fusion
           imaging in patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer.

        -  Measure changes in metabolic activity at metastatic sites during the acute treatment
           phase of ACT using PET/CT fusion imaging.

        -  Compare the changes in metabolic activity at visceral and metastatic sites in patients
           treated with intravenous vs intra-arterial tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte infusions.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate response of individual metastases with these metabolic alterations.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to treatment (intravenous
      [IV] tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TIL] after a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen vs
      intra-arterial [IA] TIL after a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen vs IV TIL after a
      myeloablative preparative regimen with chemotherapy and total-body irradiation).

      Patients undergo positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG-PET)/CT fusion
      imaging at baseline (before starting TIL infusion), once between days 1-4 after TIL infusion,
      and once between days 5-8 after TIL infusion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
