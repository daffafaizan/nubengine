      I. To obtain a preliminary estimate the incidence of early adverse skin reaction (EASR)
      during radiation therapy (RT) and up to two months post RT after the application of the
      cosmetic cream KeraStat Skin Therapy during RT in breast cancer patients in a pilot study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To associate personal characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, hormone therapy, smoking
      status, comorbidities, breast size) and treatment characteristics (e.g., RT dose) to
      incidence of EASR at any time point.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply KeraStat Skin Therapy topically twice daily (BID) during radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months.
