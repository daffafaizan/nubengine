      candidates for participation in Early-Synergy have had CT-CAC scanning as part of
      participation in two ongoing population-based studies (ROBINSCA and ImaLife) and had CAC
      â‰¥300.

      Participants are randomized in a 1:1 fashion to (1.) CMR stress perfusion imaging with
      feedback of clinically actionable findings or (2.) control group.

      In the CMR group, feedback on CMR stress perfusion imaging is provided to the participant and
      general practitioner only in case of CMR findings that require further management based on
      current clinical guidelines. Participants in the control group will not receive stress CMR
      perfusion imaging but will be followed in time to evaluate the clinical presentation of the
      natural course of coronary atherosclerosis.

      Follow-up will be performed up to 5 years in both groups by sending questionnaires and
      collecting medical information from health care providers and registries. Additionally, blood
      is drawn from participants in the CMR group during the hospital visit for CMR scanning and is
      stored to allow evaluation of cardiac blood markers as predictors of CMR findings.
