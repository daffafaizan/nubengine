    
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate if a hemodiafiltration with concentrated
      citrate (Cit-HDF) in 3 months can reduce the inflammation markers, evaluated by a Predialytic
      value of Beta2-microglobulin (B2m), CRP and IL6 compared to traditional concentrated acetic
      acid (Ac-HDF).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate if Cit-HDF, compared to Ac-HDF, can
      have an effect in a period of 3 months on the following aspects:

        -  the change weekly pre-dialysis values of other markers of oxidative stress (TAC, NF-kB);

        -  the technical parameters of HDF treatment, such as convective volumes, and blood
           pressure in the circuit in the filter (TMP, pressure pre-filter);

        -  the cardiovascular stability through blood pressure and heart rate before and after
           dialysis (SBP, DBP, HR) and number of intradialytic hypotension;

        -  the parameters of safety as the variation of the values of the mobility Predialytic bone
           (PTH, alkaline phosphatase, fetuin-A), the variation of the values intradialytic
           biochemical impacted by citrate (total and ionized calcium, bicarbonate) and clotting
           time (aPTT);

        -  the variation of calcifications observed by:

             -  the expression of molecules that express the ability of calcification of muscle
                cells and endothelial cells in culture with plasma taken at the beginning of
                treatment

             -  a measure of carotid intimal thickness and pulse vawe velocity by Eco Color Doppler
                (optional);

        -  dialysis efficiency by varying pre-and post-dialysis (RR%) and Clearance average
           molecular weight solutes with small and medium (Phosphorus, Beta2 Micro, Myoglobin) and
           indices of dialysis adequacy of small molecules such as EKT / V based on the dialysance
           ion formula Watson (calculated automatically by the monitor to dialysis);
