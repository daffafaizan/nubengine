      HTLV-I-associated myelopathy in patients with less than 2 years disease or new evidence of
      progression. After two baseline assessments patients will be commenced on ciclosporin in a
      weight dependent dose (2.5 - 5mg/kg/day) and the dose adjusted according to plasma drug
      concentrations. Participants will be monitored on a further 11 occasion as per the schedule
      every 2 - 8 weeks (less frequent with time) by self-administered questionnaires relating to
      quality of life and spasticity, by regular assessment of pain, timed walk, spasticity,
      bladder and bowel function and by blood tests to ensure the safety of the therapy. Blood
      samples will also be collected, at the same time points, for investigation of the immune
      response to HTLV-I and the quantity and activity of the virus. At 5 key time points the
      participants will undergo a more detailed neurological examination, the spinal cord will be
      imaged by MRI before, once during (12 weeks) and at the completion of the study and the fluid
      that bathes the brain (CSF) will be examined before and after 12 weeks of therapy. Therapy is
      planned for 12 months with 6 months further follow-up but therapy will be continued or
      discontinued according to clinical response.
