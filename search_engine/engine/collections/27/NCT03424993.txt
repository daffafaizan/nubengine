      death in the US. Dietary sodium restriction is considered an important lifestyle modification
      for individuals with hypertension; however, there is controversy about the effects of dietary
      salt given that many individuals do not have "salt sensitive" blood pressure. Deleterious
      effects of salt on the vasculature may explain the finding that chronic DSR reduces the
      cardiovascular event rate by 25%despite only minor reductions in BP. It is not known whether
      dietary sodium restriction improves central pulsatile hemodynamics, known to be related to
      the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure risk, and whether the
      hypothesized improvements in central hemodynamics are similar in men & women. The purpose of
      this study is to determine the effects of dietary sodium restriction through dietary
      counseling on central hemodynamics and vascular function in men and women with salt resistant
      blood pressure.
