    
      Background:

        -  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately 25% of childhood cancer.
           Survival rates have improved, but outcomes for some subgroups, including infants and
           young adults remain poor, and survival for patients who relapse is < 50%, despite
           allogeneic stem cell transplant following second remission.

        -  CD19 immune escape has been observed by several groups following CD19-CAR therapy for
           B-ALL. Investigation of this phenomenon reveals a complex biology responsible for loss
           or downregulation of CD19 expression observed in these cases.

        -  Sequential therapy using CD22-CARs to treat CD19 dim/lo escape is associated with rapid
           development of resistance due to CD22 downregulation. This trial will test whether
           simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22 using a novel bivalent CD19/22-CAR is safe and
           feasible.

      Objectives:

      -Assess the safety of administering escalating doses of autologous CD19/CD22-CAR engineered T
      cells that meet established release specifications in children and young adults with
      CD19+CD22+ B cell ALL or lymphoma following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine conditioning
      regimen.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients between greater than or equal to 3 years and less than or equal to 35 years of age,
      with CD19+/CD22+ B cell ALL or lymphoma who have relapsed or have refractory disease after at
      least one standard chemotherapy regimen and one salvage regimen, with no alternative curative
      options who meet standard Phase I eligibility criteria.

      Design:

        -  Phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation design using the following dose levels: -1: 1 x 10^5
           transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 1: 3 x 10^5 transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 2: 1 x
           10^6 transduced T cells/kg; and 3: 3 x 10^6 transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%); 4: 1 x 10^7
           transduced T cells/kg (+/- 20%).

        -  Patients will receive a lymphodepleting preparative regimen of fludarabine (25 mg/m^2/d
           x 3 on Days -4, -3, -2) and cyclophosphamide (900 mg/m^2/d x 1 on Day -2) followed by
           infusion of CD19/CD22-CAR T-cells on D0. Patients who are CAR pre-treated (with
           exception for those with an interval HSCT) will receive increased lymphodepleting
           preparative regimen of fludarabine (30 mg/m^2/d x 4 on Days -5, -4, -3, -2) and
           cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m^2/d x 2 on Days -3, -2) followed by infusion of CD19/CD22-CAR
           T-cells on D0.

        -  Patients will be evaluated sequentially for toxicity, antitumor effects, CAR expansion
           and persistence, as well as research correlatives.
