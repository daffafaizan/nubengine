      clinical study seeks to investigate the incidence of PME in diabetic patients with any level
      of background diabetic retinopathy undergoing cataract surgery treated with a 0.4mg
      dexamethasone intracanalicular insert when compared to standard of care prednisolone acetate
      1% QID/1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/ 1 week, QD/1 week. Topical NSAIDs will not be used in this
      study and all patients will receive an intracameral injection of moxifloxacin at the end of
      the surgical procedure. After screening a patient for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
      gaining informed consent, each eye will undergo cataract surgery on separate days. The second
      eye will be operated on within 60 days of the first eye's surgery. One eye will be randomized
      to receive the dexamethasone insert using a coin flip. The other eye will be prescribed a
      prednisolone acetate 0.1% eye drop QID/ 1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/1 week, QD/ 1 week regimen.
      The dexamethasone insert will be placed 2-4 days before surgery (Day -4 to Day-2) and those
      randomized to receive prednisolone acetate will start 2-4 days before surgery. After surgery,
      each eye will be followed for a period of approximately 60 days, consisting of four post-op
      follow-up visits (eight total post-op visits per patient). Primary and secondary endpoints
      will be assessed alongside standard-of-care procedures at all study visits . Adjusting for
      the enrollment period, the study will last a total of approximately 12 months.
