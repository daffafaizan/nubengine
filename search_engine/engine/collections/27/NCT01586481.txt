      Objective:

      The gold standard to heal diabetic foot ulcers is complete off-loading. To wear continuously
      off loading shoe is very difficult The bad compliance of the patients can lead to infection
      of the ulcer and amputation of the foot.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of a new concept of off-loading shoe (a
      pair of SANIDIAB shoes) with a single BAROUK shoe to treat chronic plantar diabetic foot
      ulcer of the fore foot. The hypothesis is that the new concept is more efficient because of a
      good off-loading associated with a best compliance to wear the new concept of shoes.

      The study will last 18 months with a duration of study of 6 months per patient It's a pilot
      prospective multicenter randomised study of 64 diabetic patients with a plantar neuropathic
      ulcer of the fore foot, treated after randomisation by an off loading shoe BAROUK or a pair
      of off loading shoes SANIDIAB.

      Patients will be followed in a diabetic foot department every 14 days until healing and after
      healing until 6 months after inclusion in the study.

      The main outcome measure is the healing duration of the diabetic foot ulcers in both group of
      treatment.

      The secondary outcome measure is the rate of reulceration after healing , the rate of
      amputation and compliance of patients 64 patients will be included in 2 groups: 32 will wear
      SANIDIAB shoes and 32 BAROUK shoe.
