    
      In this study, patients with low-risk, organ-confined prostate cancer identified in clinic or
      prior to their already scheduled standard of care MRI in the Department of Radiology will be
      approached for the study. Eligible patients will undergo a baseline eMRI/MRSI exam between 6
      and 24 weeks following biopsy. Patients will undergo definitive treatment (radical
      prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT)) or will be placed on deferred therapy.
      Predictor variables will be recorded for each patient after enrollment, before treatment and
      during treatment follow-up. Patient outcome-disease progression will be determined by long
      term clinical follow-up
