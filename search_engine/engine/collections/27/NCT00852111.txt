      the data are not conclusive, and this symptom remains poorly managed at present. Longitudinal
      studies related to treatment-related fatigue in prostate cancer patients have been conducted,
      but there are limited studies exploring the changes in physiologic mechanisms before and
      after radiotherapy which can identify individuals who are at risk for enduring fatigue during
      and after therapy. Fatigue is conceptualized as a multidimensional symptom which incorporates
      temporal, sensory, cognitive/mental, affective/emotional, behavioral, and physiological
      dimensions. This prospective, observational study is the first study to explore the
      molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying fatigue and the cluster of symptoms (urinary, sexual,
      gastrointestinal, psychiatric) experienced by prostate cancer patients undergoing External
      Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT).

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the changes in the self-reported fatigue;
      urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal symptoms; depression; fatigue catastrophizing; and
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) experienced by patients with and without prostate
      surgery before, during, and after EBRT completion. The secondary objectives of this study are
      to investigate the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile of EBRT-related fatigue (TNF alpha,
      IGF-I, IL-6, IL-8, TGF alpha and beta), determine changes in white blood cell gene
      expression, determine levels of oxidative stress and changes in potential biomarkers
      influencing oxidative stress from blood and buccal samples before and after EBRT completion
      and to relate these changes in the levels of these biological markers to self-reported
      fatigue; urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal symptoms; depression; fatigue catastrophizing;
      and HRQOL scores. This study also aims to measure the skeletal muscle strength,
      activity/fitness levels, cognitive function and energy expenditure of patients before, at
      completion of EBRT, and at least 6 months post EBRT and relate these findings with
      self-reported fatigue, physical symptoms (e.g. urinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual
      functioning), depression, and HRQOL scores before and after an exercise training program. The
      study also aims to describe changes in chemical profile in the brain that are associated with
      changes in fatigue symptoms using magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after EBRT.
