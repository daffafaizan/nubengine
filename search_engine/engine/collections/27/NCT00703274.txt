      the last few decades, stroke remains the third leading cause of death and the leading cause
      of adult disability in the United States. For the population that has experienced a
      cerebrovascular event, the risk of future stroke is greatly increased. The initiation of
      effective secondary prevention strategies is most effective when implemented early (before
      disabling stroke occurs), monitored frequently, and maintained long-term after a
      cerebrovascular event.

      The Preventing Recurrence of Thromboembolic Events through Coordinated Treatment in the
      District of Columbia (PROTECT DC) intervention uses stroke navigators to help people who have
      suffered a stroke implement secondary prevention strategies. Stroke navigators are lay
      persons trained to provide education on secondary prevention behavior, and trained to
      navigate the health and human service system. The goals are to help individuals who have had
      a stroke obtain the necessary services and programs to engage in secondary prevention
      behaviors and, ultimately, to prevent the recurrence of stroke.
