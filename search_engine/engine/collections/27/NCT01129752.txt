      such factors might be transmitted cross-generationally. We are conducting an integrative
      assessment of emotion regulation and stress reactivity in a group of mothers with and without
      a history of depression and their daughters. We use a range of methodologies to evaluate
      these processes, including self-report measures, information-processing performance, HPA-axis
      functioning and reactivity, and neural responses to emotional stimuli following exposure to
      stressful experiences.
