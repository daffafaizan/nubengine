      cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas which will compare specific outcomes between two treatment
      arms. Subjects are eligible patients who are sent to Zitelli & Brodland PC for Mohs
      micrographic surgery of tumors that meet our high risk criteria. These patients with
      clinically-negative lymph node exams will either enter into the arm of nodal observation or
      the arm of elective management of the neck, which is currently the standard protocol per the
      UPMC ENT department. The patients in the observation arm will have evaluation and treatment
      of their lymph nodes if an abnormality is detected clinically. The primary endpoint is
      disease-specific survival. Secondary endpoints will include overall and disease-free
      survival, complications, and quality of life measures for each arm.
