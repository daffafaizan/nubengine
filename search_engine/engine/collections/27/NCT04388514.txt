      The investigator enrolled, in the study, subjects with COVID-19 modest to moderate
      respiratory insufficiency (SIMEU clinical phenotypes 2-4) thus cared in an infectious disease
      ward.

      To note that The Italian Society of Emergency and Urgency Medicine (SIMEU - SocietÃ  Italiana
      di Medicina di Emergenza-Urgenza) suggest to classified the COVID-19 patients in 5 clinical
      phenotypes:

        -  Phenotype 1: subjects with fever and without respiratory failure (normal Arterial Blood
           Gas analysis - ABG -, six-minute walking test - 6mWT - and Chest XR). These patients
           usually can manage at home maintaining quarantine period.

        -  Phenotype 2: subjects with fever but with ABG and/or Chest XR indicative of modest
           respiratory insufficiency (PO2> 60 mmHg in ambient air) and / or pulmonary consolidation
           area. These patients need to be hospitalized because they can get quickly worse.

        -  Phenotype 3: subjects with fever associate to moderate-severe respiratory insufficiency
           (at triage PO2< 60 mmHg in ambient air) and /or bilateral pulmonary consolidation area
           at Chest XR. These patients need to be treated with high flow oxygen therapy.

        -  Phenotype 4: subjects with respiratory failure with suspected ARDS (Adult Respiratory
           Distress Syndrome) or complicated pneumonia. These patients require hospitalization in
           sub-intensive care unit.

        -  Phenotype 5: subject with ARDS at the beginning. These patients will require Intensive
           Care Unit (ICU) admission and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or
           mechanical ventilation.
