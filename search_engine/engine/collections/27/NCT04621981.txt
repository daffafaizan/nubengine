      resuscitation. Early effective fluid resuscitation can improve the prognosis of patients. So
      far, there is no perfect crystalloid solution. Normal saline is the most readily available
      and economical crystalline fluid for clinical resuscitation. It is isoosmotic and can meet
      the basic needs of patients in the early rehydration. But it lacks acid-base buffer system
      and potassium, calcium and magnesium ions, and the level of chloride ions is also
      significantly higher than that of plasma.

      Sodium Bicarbonate Ringer's solution contains physiological levels of Na+(130mmol/L),
      K+(4mmol/L), Ca2+(1.5mmol/L), Mg2+(1mmol/L), HCO3-(28mmol/L) and Cl-(109mmol/L). It also has
      citric acid/ sodium citrate buffer system (Citrate3-1.3mmol/L), pH7.3, and osmotic pressure
      276mOsm/L. It is the most similar solution to extracellular fluid.

      Theoreticallyï¼ŒCompared with normal saline, Sodium Bicarbonate Ringer's solution can maintain
      acid-base balance faster and better when restoring the microcirculation without affecting the
      level of chloride ion. Therefore we hypothesize that Sodium Bicarbonate Ringer's solution can
      promote the body to restore to acid-base balance more quickly, and improve organ function
      more significantly than normal saline.
