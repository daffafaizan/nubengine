      One mechanism for this is thought to be due to dynamic hyperinflation during exercise (an
      increase in the end-expiratory lung volume) that contributes to the sensation of
      breathlessness. Whether this also contributes to inhibiting motor recruitment, and reduces
      the available power output (termed performance fatigue; PF), is not well understood.
      Preliminary data suggests that many COPD patients, unlike healthy subjects, stop exercise
      with a 'skeletal muscle power reserve' i.e. the ability to acutely increase muscle power
      output. This suggests that they are limited in the exercise task by mechanisms other than
      acute intramuscular limitations to power production (termed muscle fatigue; MF). Exercise
      tolerance is increased by treatment with the fixed-dose combination bronchodilator, STIOLTO™
      RESPIMAT®. We hypothesize that increased exercise tolerance with STIOLTO™ RESPIMAT® (reduced
      performance fatigue; PF) will be mediated by a combination of: 1) reduced inhibition of
      muscle activation (termed activation fatigue; AF) allowing patients to drive their leg
      muscles harder, and thus; 2) increased muscle fatigue (MF).
