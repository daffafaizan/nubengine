      of therapy. Up to 50% of patients with congestive heart failure in industrialized nations
      will undergo long-term diuretic treatment. Diuretic therapy is associated with a loss of
      water soluble vitamins, including vitamin B1 (thiamine). Electrolyte dysbalance, a major side
      effect of diuretic therapy, has been extensively studied. In sharp contrast, only few data
      are available about the effects of vitamin loss and in particular of thiamine in this
      setting. Available data suggest that a diuretic treatment is associated with an increased
      risk for thiamine deficiency. Thiamine plays a crucial role for normal cardiac function,
      since severe thiamine deficiency leads to congestive heart failure (wet beriberi).
      Consequently, patients undergoing diuretic treatment might have compromised heart function.
      Supplementation of thiamine has been reported to improve cardiac function in patients with
      congestive heart failure on long-term treatment with diuretic drugs. However, no efforts have
      been made to confirm those preliminary observations by a placebo-controlled, double-blind
      study.
