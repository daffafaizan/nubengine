      trial with two arms: onsite HCV management through telemedicine versus HCV management through
      usual care, which in most cases will be referral to an offsite liver specialist (Referral).
      The arm assignment will be at the cluster (clinic) level. After an initial period (6 months)
      in which all clinics implement the control intervention (usual care), at regular intervals
      (i.e., the "steps") of 6 months duration each, one group of clinics will be randomized to
      cross over from the Usual Care arm to the Telemedicine arm. In this way, there will be enough
      time for implementation and assessment of the intervention within each time period. The
      process continues until all clinics have crossed over to implement telemedicine, and thus all
      clinics contribute data to both interventions. In addition, patients will be followed for two
      years post-treatment cessation to assess for reinfection or relapse of HCV RNA.
