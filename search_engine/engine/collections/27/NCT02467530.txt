      composition of gut microbial flora (gut microbiota) have been linked to different diseases
      such as obesity, diabetes and inflammation. Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) are formed
      via the Maillard reaction, which consists of a complex network of non-enzymatic reactions
      involving the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars which react with the amino groups of
      proteins. AGEs are produced in vivo and being consumed. They have been implicated in
      increased risk of different diseases including atherosclerosis, CAD and kidney diseases. In
      this study, the investigators are evaluating the effects of consuming a low AGE diet in
      participants on peritoneal dialysis on the gut bacteria and inflammation.
