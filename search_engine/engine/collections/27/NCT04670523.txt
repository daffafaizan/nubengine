      different indications. During the last decade, minimally invasive surgery and enhanced
      recovery after surgery (ERAS) programmes have radically changed the equation of recovery,
      contributing to reduce postoperative morbidity and enhance quality of life, but the chest
      tube remains its Achilles heel, still providing postoperative pain and impairing pulmonary
      function. In this view, early chest tube removal has been widely promoted not only for its
      economic benefits on length of stay but also for improving quality of life and potentially
      reducing postoperative complications. In parallel, the change from traditional chest drainage
      devices to electronic devices has also enabled a more accurate air leak measurement with
      reduction of interobserver variability, decreased chest drainage duration and shortened LOS.
      The safe conditions for early chest tube removal have been progressively questioned and
      redefined around reliable digital air flow criteria and extension of liquid threshold
      accepted. Nevertheless, in current practice, the chest tube remains in restricting early
      mobilization and optimal compliance with ERAS programme, during the first crucial 24 h after
      surgery. Thus, to go further, the investigators decide to assess in this study the safety of
      POD 0 chest tube removal after minor thoracic operations in patients in health condition
      tolerating operation and anesthesia.
