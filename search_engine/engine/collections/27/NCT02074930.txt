      birch pollen allergen extract after skin preparation (microporation by P.L.E.A.S.E.
      Professional) and standard skin prick test. By using the standard prick test the stratum
      corneum is overcome by a single puncture (1 mm).

      Micropores induced by P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional penetrate the stratum corneum less deep but
      with a higher density (five pores). It is therefore suggested that a skin preparation with
      micropores by P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional previously to the allergen contact may lead to a
      higher sensitivity. Less allergen might still elicit a skin reaction which won?t be seen by a
      conventional prick skin test. Whereas skin prick test may lead to true-negative (patient
      shows no allergic reaction on prick skin test but is an allergy sufferer in clinic),
      IgE-determination may lead to false-positives (patient is determined as allergy sufferer but
      has no clinical symptoms). So the sensitivity with micropores skin preparation by
      P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional could be a good compromise. The preparation of the skin with
      P.L.E.A.S.E. Professional leads to a better understanding of the influence of different types
      of skin injury patterns on the allergic skin reactivity. Namely, how important is the role of
      the exposed area, the depth of injury and the keratinocyte activation.

      This will be checked in a late phase reaction evaluation.
