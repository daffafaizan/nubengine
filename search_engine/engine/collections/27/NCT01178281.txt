      Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain,
      Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The global study enrolled participants
      with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis and
      RBC-transfusion-dependence. Participants were randomly assigned to receive pomalidomide or
      placebo in a blinded fashion.

      In most countries participating in the global study, RBC-transfusions are typically given for
      a hemoglobin level <80-90 g/L. In China, RBC-transfusions are rarely given unless the
      hemoglobin level is <60 g/L. Consequently, few Chinese with MPN-associated myelofibrosis meet
      RBC-transfusion-dependence criteria of the global study. A China-specific extension was
      developed to test the ability of pomalidomide to improve severe anemia (defined as a
      hemoglobin < 80 g/L for â‰¥ 84 days in persons not receiving RBC-transfusions).

      The China-specific extension study consisted of a single-arm, open-label study in adults with
      MPN-associated myelofibrosis and severe anemia not receiving RBC transfusions with the
      objective of describing the frequency of anemia response.

      The Global (intent-to-treat [ITT] and safety) population in the main study and the China
      extension (ITT and safety) population are mutually exclusive.
