    
      Two cohorts of 250 patients each will be recruited by six clinical centres endowed with a
      SCU-B (one cohort) and six centres lacking this structure. The follow-up will last 3 years,
      during which patients will be visited every 6 months and submitted to a battery exploring the
      severity of the BPSD and the quality of life. All adverse events will be registered, as well
      as some anticipated occurrences (admissions to the general hospital for intercurrent
      diseases, admissions to a SCU-B pertaining to the clinical participating centre and, if any,
      admissions to a SCU-B not pertaining to the Consortium member, nursing home placement).

      At the same time the quality of life of the primary caregivers will be measured, as well as
      their attitude toward dementia.

      A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed comparing the cohorts. Finally the time to
      the nursing home placement will be recorded and compared between the two cohorts
