           temperate climate and most homes are heated to less than the WHO recommended minimum
           winter temperature of 18Â°C. Excess winter mortality is comparable to the levels in
           Portugal and Scotland. The Group's previous Housing, Insulation and Health Study has
           shown that insulating existing homes leads to a small but significant improvement in
           health and energy consumption, but raised the question as to whether installing more
           sustainable heating could increase these gains.

        2. Study design

      We have enrolled 409 households, who use either plug-in electric heaters or unflued gas
      heating, and where there is a child with asthma, aged between 6 and 12 years. In the winter
      of 2005, uninsulated houses were insulated and baseline measures taken of indoor temperatures
      in the living room and the child's bedroom, and levels of nitrogen dioxide. Intensive
      monitoring of indoor air quality is being carried out in a sub-sample of 33 homes. All
      members of the child's family have filled out detailed questionnaires of their health and the
      heads-of -household have completed a questionnaire on the characteristics of the household's
      energy usage. Objective measures are also being collected of the household's fuel bills, the
      child's attendance at school and the family's health care utilisation.

      Households are randomised so that the intervention group will have their choice of new, more
      efficient and sustainable heaters (heat pumps, wood pellet burners, or flued gas heaters)
      that heat more of the house and which emit no internal emissions installed over the summer.
      In the winter of 2006, follow-up measures will be taken and then the control households will
      receive their choice of new heaters.
