      factor. Guidelines and systematic reviews suggest, that multimodal interventions are most
      likely to control this risk. This study evaluates, if patients at high risk for falls will
      benefit from a multimodal intervention simple and feasible enough to be transferred into
      general practice. Participants will be randomized either into an intervention group or a
      control group receiving usual care.

      The multimodal intervention consists of:

        -  medication: Participants receive 1Âµg Alfacalcidol and 500mg Calcium daily

        -  mobility program: strength, balance and gait training twice a week for one hour

        -  patient education: a single meeting with teaching lessons on risk factors for falling
           and modes of fall prevention followed by an evaluation of the individual fall risk and
           corresponding recommendations to reduce it
