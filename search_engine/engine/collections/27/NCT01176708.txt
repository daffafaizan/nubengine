      peptidase IV so only 10-15% enters the systemic circulation. This has led to the hypothesis
      that GLP-1 interact locally with afferent sensory nerve fibers.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the significance of intact liver innervation for the
      GLP-1 induced insulin secretion in liver transplanted patients; kidney transplanted control
      patients matched for immunosuppressive treatment, age, gender and body weight; and ten
      control persons matched for age, gender and body weight.

      The insulin secretion will be evaluated from blood samples that will be analyzed for insulin
      and c-peptide.
