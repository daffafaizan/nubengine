      blockages in the arteries of the transplanted heart (coronary arteries) called Coronary
      Allograft Vasculopathy (CAV). Because CAV often progresses without symptoms, transplant
      recipients undergo regular surveillance testing so that CAV can be detected and treatment can
      be offered before significant damage to the transplanted heart occurs. Current tests used to
      detect CAV are either invasive (with risk of complications) or may not be able to detect CAV
      in its early stages. Myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography is a safe non-invasive
      diagnostic test that may be well suited for detecting CAV, however has not been well studied
      in heart transplant recipients. This study examines the ability of myocardial contrast
      perfusion echocardiography to detect CAV in adult and pediatric heart transplant recipients,
      and compare those results to current standard testing strategies such as Invasive Coronary
      Angiography (ICA) and standard stress echocardiography. This will help determine whether
      myocardial contrast perfusion echocardiography is a better test for regular surveillance of
      CAV in adult and pediatric transplant recipients.
