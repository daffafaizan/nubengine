      I. Delineate the benefits of and limitations to having Take the Fight strategists, performing
      as lay-navigators, as perceived by both the patients and the students.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Investigate changes in self-reported outcomes for patients and the Take the Fight
      strategists.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive patient navigation via strategists from the Take the Fight for 8 weeks.
      Patients also complete interviews regarding perceived physical, logistical, psychosocial, and
      informational challenges experienced prior to meeting with strategists/navigators and how
      challenges were addressed by navigator or others, perceived benefits or limitations of
      navigator assistance. Strategists also complete interviews regarding their perceptions on how
      patients benefited from participation, challenges patients experienced that were directly or
      indirectly related to their cancer diagnosis and treatment, how these concerns were
      addressed, barriers to addressing these concerns, and patient health literacy.

      After completion of study, patients and strategists are followed up for 8-10 weeks.
