    
      50 adult heart transplant recipients (18-75 years of age) entered the maintenance phase (>6
      months after heart transplantation), remaining clinically quiescent (See Inclusion criteria)
      and undergoing regularly scheduled myocardial biopsies (as part of standard clinical care)
      for allograft rejection will be recruited.

      Half of the subject will be receive DHA and half DHA+EPA administered orally which will be
      administered in two capsules in the morning and two in the evening. Each patient will serve
      as their own control, and comparisons will be made between pre and post treatments within
      each patient.

      Prior to assignment to treatment, a septal biopsy (10 to 20 mg) will be obtained during a
      routine biopsy procedure and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 until
      analysis. Therapy will continue for at least 6 months and until completion of the primary end
      point of paired cardiac biopsy acquisition. Cardiac biopsies obtained during regularly
      scheduled myocardial biopsies for clinical evaluation for allograft rejection will also be
      analyzed for phospholipid fatty acid composition.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "Completed Date"
      entered in the Query View Report System (QVR).
