      for the head and neck region. CT images were transferred to the planning system.
      Three-dimensional conformal RT, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or Volumetric
      modulated arc therapy (VMAT) was created. All patients were irradiated with once-daily
      fractionation at 1.8-2.0 Gy/d with 6-MV photon beams for five days a week. The gross target
      volume (GTV) was treated with a dose of 70Gy and the lymphatic site (CTV) and areas of high
      risk microscopic disease (CTV) including lymph nose levels received a radiation dose ranging
      from 54-66 Gy according to its risk. PTV is a circumferential margin of 5mm around CTV.

      Thyroid function parameters:

      The patient's serum T4, T3 and TSH levels, were measured during follow up. Clinical
      hypothyroidism is defined as the increase in TSH above 5.0mIu/ml with a decrease in free
      thyroxine levels (free T4) in the serum while elevated TSH with normal free T4 levels was
      labeled as subclinical hypothyroidism .As per institutional values, the normal values
      intervals of T4 level (7- 25 PMOL/L), T3( 1.5-7 PMOL/L),TSH (0.2-5 mIu/L).

      The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was defined as the time interval between
      completion of radiotherapy and first abnormal recorded T3/T4/TSH value.

      For all treated patients, thyroid gland was delineated and by reviewing the DVH, the V45,
      V50, V55, V60, V65 and V70 which means the volume of the thyroid gland receiving 45 Gy, 50
      Gy, 55Gy, 60 Gy and 70 Gy respectively.
