      lithium will be crossed over to valproate (VPA). Those that also fail VPA will be again
      crossed-over to a standardized treatment as usual (TAU) arm. Subjects who are eligible for
      the study must be at least 18 years of age and have been diagnosed or are thought to have
      bipolar I disorder with at least one episode of mood instability in the last 12 months. They
      must also be eligible to take lithium and, if female and of child bearing age, agree to use
      adequate birth control methods and to inform their doctor of their plans to become pregnant.
