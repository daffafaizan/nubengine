      the study with an allocation ratio of 2:1. Using a hydraulic dynamometer grip strength will
      be evaluated three times, one minute between each measurement. Then palmar pinch, key pinch
      and tip pinch measurements will be evaluated for three times each. For each measurement, the
      participants will rest one minute between repetitive measurements, and five minutes between
      each parameters. The order of measurements will be randomized for each participants to avoid
      bias. Then the participants will be evaluated using different scales for pain, disability and
      quality of life.
