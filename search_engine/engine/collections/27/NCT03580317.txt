      study. The subjects will be randomly divided into EA+ Carbamazepine group, EA+placebo group,
      sham EA+Carbamazepine group and sham EA+placebo group. The indexes of main outcome evaluation
      are 1)Intensity of pain (Evaluation of the pain by VAS with 0-10 points) and 2)Brief
      introduction of 2-week pain. The indexes of secondary outcome evaluation are 1) Brief Pain
      Inventory-Facial scale(BPI-Facial); 2) Patient Global Impression of Change(PGIC); 3)
      Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire; 4) Short- Form 36 Questionnaire. This study will
      evaluate whether EA has the advantage over carbamazepine in the immediate effect, long-term
      effect and post effect of the analgesia in CTN. At the same time, the study also will
      demonstrate whether EA has a synergistic effect with carbamazepine on the treatment of CTN,
      or even whether EA has an alternative effect on carbamazepine. Furthermore, we will establish
      a standardized, effective and convenient therapy program of EA to promote according to the
      results.
