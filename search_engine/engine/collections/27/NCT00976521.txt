      PCI for anterior STEMI treated with a bivalirudin monotherapy anticoagulation strategy, the
      intracoronary infusion of an abciximab bolus with or without thrombus aspiration prior to
      stent implantation, compared to no infusion with or without thrombus aspiration (standard of
      care), results in 1) reduced infarct size measured by cardiac MRI at 30 days (range -7
      days/+14 days; i.e., between 23 and 44 days), 2) reduce microvascular obstruction (MVO) by
      cardiac MRI at 5 + 2 days (i.e., between 3 and 7 days), 3) enhanced ST-segment resolution, 4)
      improved myocardial perfusion, 5) reduced thrombus burden and angiographic complications, and
      6) no increase in major and minor bleeding.
