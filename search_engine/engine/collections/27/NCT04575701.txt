      stop TNF Alpha antibody therapy in IBD. Reasons are mostly loss of effectiveness or
      intolerance or side effects. Reasons for the termination are usually poorly characterized
      with regard to the exact reason and time. As a consequence, the aim of this retrospective
      study is to assess the outcome of patients with inflammatory bowel disease under TNF-alpha
      antibody therapy over a period of 20 years
