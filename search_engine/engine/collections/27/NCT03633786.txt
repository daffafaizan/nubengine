    
      Patients with clinical and trans-vaginal / abdominal ultrasound diagnosis of deep
      endometriosis, undergoing surgery for the removal of endometriotic lesions are included in
      the study.

      Patients are divided into 2 groups:

      Group A: standard laparoscopic approach

      Group B: robot-assisted approach

      After surgery, patients will be included in the post-operative follow-up, as usual in our
      clinical practice.
