    
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive autosomal disease caused by mutations in the cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes for an epithelial
      chloride channel involved in ion and fluid transport. CF is the most common inherited disease
      in Caucasians and disease severity mainly depends on the degree of lung involvement, which
      can lead to terminal respiratory failure Disease monitoring of CF-related lung disease rely
      on functional assessment and complimentary morphological assessment. Conventional low-dose
      chest computed tomography (CT) is currently the gold standard for the morphological
      assessment of CF-related lung disease but ultra-low dose chest CT and high-resolution
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lung using UTE sequences have been recently developed
      and allow important radiation reduction of radiation dose exposure. However the performances
      of these 2 competing imaging methods remains to be compared.
