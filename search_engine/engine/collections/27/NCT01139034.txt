      clinical treatments of shoulder subluxation. By applying low-frequency electrical stimulation
      to the target muscle groups, improvements may be observed in terms of muscle strength,
      subluxation, and passive humeral lateral rotation of the shoulder joint. In order to overcome
      issues regarding the integration of an FES and a rehabilitation robot, group members have
      designed a customized FES system approved by medical safety regulations. Despite sharing
      identical specifications with commercial models, the approved 2-channel FES system provides
      better integrity and control when working with the upper extremity rehabilitation robot. In
      this study, three patients with unilateral shoulder subluxation will be recruited. Limited
      shoulder x-ray photos shall be taken before, during, and after the FES shoulder subluxation
      treatment for studying the effects.
