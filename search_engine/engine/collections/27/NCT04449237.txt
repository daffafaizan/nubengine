      is always not effective, and the standardized treatment of tinnitus has been lacking. With
      the development of neuroimaging, neuroelectrophysiology and animal models of tinnitus, the
      central mechanism of tinnitus has been gradually revealed. The possible mechanisms of
      tinnitus are the increase of spontaneous discharge rate and synchronization of auditory
      central neurons caused by hearing deprivation, the change of brain topological structure, the
      reorganization of auditory cortex, and the disorder of limbic system and auditory central
      regulation of tinnitus patients. EEG, as an important means to study the cerebral cortex, has
      become an important technical support for the research on the central mechanism of tinnitus.
      Changes in activity in auditory brain areas associated with tinnitus have been observed using
      EEG/ERPs, and non-auditory brain areas such as the limbic system and frontal cortices have
      also been associated with tinnitus mechanisms. This project aims to systematically and deeply
      study the central mechanism of tinnitus using electroencephalogram, and further study the
      treatment mechanism of tinnitus in combination with sound treatment strategies, so as to
      provide a research basis for clinical treatment of tinnitus.
