      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of doxorubicin HCl liposome, melphalan, and
           bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory stage I-III multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate, including complete, near-complete, partial, and
           minimal response rate, in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen at the MTD in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 30-60 minutes and melphalan
           IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl liposome, melphalan, and
      bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 4 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity
      after 2 courses of therapy.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome, melphalan, and bortezomib at the
           MTD as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
