      in Tanzania (Shinyanga and Dar es Salaam respectively). It is expected that PPT will reduce
      laboratory diagnosed STIs by 50% in the population after a roll out of 6 months.

      This evaluation uses a cross-sectional venue-based sampling design. Three rounds of cross
      sectional data collection will be undertaken for MSM in Dar es Salaam and FSW in Shinyanga at
      three months intervals (baseline, 3 months and 6 months). The change in prevalence will be
      measured between baseline and 6 months assessments. The interim assessment will be used to
      refine the sample size. Study participants will be recruited in venues frequented by FSW
      (Shinyanga) and MSM (Dar es Salaam) in wards where Sauti operates. Respondents will be
      continuously sampled from all venues until sample size is reached. In each round of data
      collection, study participants will undergo physical examination, biological specimen
      collection, laboratory and HIV tests and a questionnaire.

      STI prevalence in MSM and FSWs will be measured during each survey and laboratory-confirmed
      STI prevalence (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis) will be assessed.

      Additionally, effect on STI prevalence in the bridge population will be measured by
      retrospective analysis of routine data for the prevalence of syndromic STIs among the mining
      population in Shinyanga, as collected in the context of the Sauti program mobile biomedical
      services (CBHTC+), which will visit the major mines in Shinyanga prior PPT implementation and
      after each survey. By the term major mines, we mean mines with large population of male mine
      workers (between 1000-2000 male mine workers) at higher risk of HIV rather than mines with
      modern mining infrastructure.
