      self-monitoring for anticoagulation therapy has been limited primarily to non-minority and
      higher socioeconomic status individuals. While effectiveness has been studied, the factors
      influencing the adoption of self-monitoring of anticoagulation in minorities with the most
      barriers to accessing quality care in specialized clinics, are not known.

      Hypothesis: Patient centered education and training intervention for minority patients will
      result in effective adoption of self-monitoring of anticoagulation therapy, resulting in
      anticoagulation control of comparable quality to that seen in specialized anticoagulation
      clinic-based monitoring.

      The research objective of this proposal will be accomplished through 3 specific aims:

        1. Identify patient and provider factors that influence adoption of anticoagulation
           self-monitoring in a minority population.

        2. Adapt and refine an education intervention that both addresses identified barriers and
           emphasizes identified positive influences to anticoagulation self-monitoring.

        3. Demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of anticoagulation self-monitoring coupled
           with an educational intervention in a minority population.
