      carcinoma(HCC) patients will be involved in the study. They will be treated with
      percutaneously microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation(RFA). The indications of
      patients enrolled in the study were as follows: tumor size ≤5cm in diameter, tumor number ≤3,
      Child-Pugh class A or B classification, no evidence of extrahepatic metastasis, vein or bile
      duct tumor embolus, and no any other anti-cancer treatment was accepted. MWA or RFA is
      selected for the patient according to the sequence of their visit to the hospital based on
      randomization number arrangement produced by SPSS 16.0 statistical software. The therapeutic
      effectiveness will be compared between two modalities.
