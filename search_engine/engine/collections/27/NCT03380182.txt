      vomiting (PONV) in the pediatric population undergoing outpatient middle ear surgery
      receiving our institution's standard dual prophylactic antiemetic therapy in combination with
      intraoperative acupuncture and postoperative acupressure compared to those receiving only the
      standard dual prophylactic antiemetic therapy.
