    
      Laboratory testing will take place on 28 separate occasions, 2 familiarisation, 8 testing and
      18 intervention sessions. The first session (FAM 1) will serve as a familiarisation trial to
      the NMES protocol, BFR stimulus and strength testing. It will be conducted 10-14 days prior
      to the intervention period. The second session (FAM 2) will serve as a second familiarisation
      trial to the NMES protocol, BFR stimulus and strength testing. This session will take place 7
      days prior to the beginning of the intervention period and will serve as a standardised
      control period prior to the main testing. The third session (PRE) will take place 1 day prior
      the start of the intervention period and all future sessions will consist of strength, muscle
      and cardiovascular function outcome measures. The fourth session (MID) will take place the
      morning following 3 weeks of training. The fifth session (POST1) will take place 48 hours
      following 6 weeks of training. There will also be post testing sessions after three days
      (POST2), one week (POST3) and two weeks post intervention (POST4) to assess detraining.
      Participants will be provided with protein supplementation after every training session. All
      strength, muscle and hemodynamic measurements will be conducted at St Marys University by
      Paul Head. Supplements should be avoided for 72 hours prior to experimental measures and
      throughout the intervention period. All repeated measures will be performed at a similar time
      of day (Â± 1 h).
