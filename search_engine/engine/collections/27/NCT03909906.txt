      with EuphytoseÂ® on psychological state with regards perceived stress and overall mood as well
      as psychological and physiological stress responses during a laboratory stressor. The trial
      will employ the Observed Multitasking Stressor (OMS), with psychological state and
      physiological responses assessed before and after its completion. The main mood/psychological
      stressor assessment will take place pre-treatment and following 14 days of treatment. Stool
      samples will also be collected from participants in order to assess changes in gut microflora
      communities at visits 1 and 2.
