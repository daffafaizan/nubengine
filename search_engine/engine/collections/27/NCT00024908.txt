      representations stored in the human prefrontal cortex developed by the principal
      investigator. Utilizing a variety of standardized and experimental neuropsychological tasks
      and techniques, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex in planning, problem-solving, and reasoning and the ventromedial prefrontal
      cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will ascertain the relationship
      between so-called "cold" cognitive processes such as planning and "hot" social processes such
      as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the prefrontal cortex. Besides
      cognitive paradigms, we will use skin conductance and event-related EEG recording techniques
      when subjects are performing selected cognitive tasks in order to determine the relationship
      between autonomic and central nervous system markers of emotional modulation and
      speed/duration of processing and task performance. The data we collect in this protocol will
      be of value in 1) Developing a model of the forms of knowledge representation stored in the
      human prefrontal cortex; 2) Developing outcome measures for drug and behavioral treatments
      for disorders of prefrontal cortex functions; and, 3) Developing biologically plausible
      computer models of the cognitive sub-components stored in the human prefrontal cortex that
      compose the complex skills referred to above.
