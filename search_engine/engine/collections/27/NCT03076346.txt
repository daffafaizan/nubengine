      following unsuccessful trials with first-line antipsychotic drugs. For these patients with
      refractory psychosis, clozapine has consistently demonstrated superior efficacy. Clozapine is
      often underutilized and administered late in a patient's course of treatment, which leads to
      increased morbidity, unnecessary medication trials, and increased health care expenditure.
      Meanwhile, the mechanism of action underlying clozapine's novel effects remains unknown and
      has not been studied with modern neuroimaging methods. Identifying the neural mechanisms by
      which clozapine exerts its effects may lead to biomarkers that will facilitate efficient
      utilization of the drug, and introduce novel treatment targets. In patients with refractory
      psychotic symptoms, the proposed study will use resting-state and task-based functional MRI
      (fMRI) to examine the neural circuitry of efficacious treatment with a trial of clozapine.
      Patients will undergo fMRI scanning both before and after 12 weeks of treatment, with the
      aims of determining: baseline patterns of resting-state functional connectivity and
      task-based activation that predict response to treatment; and changes in resting-state and
      task-based functional circuitry associated with efficacious treatment. Results of this
      proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for psychotic
      disorders and facilitate drug development for refractory psychosis.
