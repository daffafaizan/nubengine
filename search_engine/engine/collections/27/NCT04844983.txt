    
      This is a two-part, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate
      safety and efficacy of various doses of STP705 administered as an intralesional injection in
      subjects with isSCC.

      A total of up to 100 eligible subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will be randomly
      allocated to receive STP705 or placebo injection once weekly for 6 weeks.

      After 6 weeks, the lesion will be excised.

      In part 1 (dose ranging study): 40 subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of the 3 STP705
      doses or placebo.

      An interim analysis will be done after all subjects have completed end of treatment (EOT)
      visits to determine 2 selected dose levels of STP705 to be used in part of the study.

      In part 2: 60 additional subjects will be randomized to receive 1 of the 2 selected doses
      (from part 1) or placebo.

      In both parts at the End of Treatment (EOT), the lesion will be excised.
