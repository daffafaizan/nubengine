      rate remain low nevertheless the improvement in the last years. In particular there are a
      group of patients, in young reproductive age, experiencing recurrent implantation failure,
      nevertheless the good embryos produced and transferred. Recently, it has been showed that
      culture medium supplemented with GM-CSF, may improve the embryo outcomes in IVF. In this
      trial the investigators will test the potential benefits of this culture medium on embryos of
      patients experiencing recurrent implantation failure. 100 women with recurrent implantation
      failure, at least three failed previous IVF attempts with at least 8 good embryos transferred
      no more than 40 years old will be selected. These patients will be assigned to two arms, one
      experimental and one other of control by a computer generated sequence. After the oocyte
      retrieval and fertilization by ICSI procedure, the fertilised oocyte (2PN)will cultured with
      the GM-CSF supplemented culture medium (EmbryoGen, Origio, Denmark), or in normal culture in
      micro drop of 30microliters under oil until the day of transfer (day three or 8 cells sage
      embryos). A maximum of three embryos will be transferred. The pregnancy rate the implantation
      rate will be the outcomes considered
