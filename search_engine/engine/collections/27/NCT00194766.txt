      due to progressive depletion of the enzyme AT, our hope is that a daily oral schedule will be
      the most active schedule of this agent. In phase I studies doses below 85 mg/m2/day
      continuously have been well-tolerated. We plan to begin dosing at 75 mg/m2/day for 6 weeks
      out of an 8 week cycle and to escalate to 85 and 100 mg/m2/day in patients who have no grade
      3/4 toxicity.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with temozolomide can effect the
      survival of patients with advanced breast cancer or soft tissue sarcoma. To do this we will
      assess the response rate, time to progression, and survival in patients with advanced breast
      cancer or soft tissue sarcoma who are treated with temozolomide.
