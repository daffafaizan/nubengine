      I. To evaluate the detection of prostate cancer with elastography using the Aixplorer
      scanner.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain quantitative data on the elastic properties of normal and malignant tissue in
      the prostate of patients referred for ultrasound guided biopsy.

      II. To compare the Gleason grade of prostate cancers detected with elastography to the
      Gleason grade of tumors detected by conventional systematic biopsy.
