      administered alone or in combination with zidovudine to HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts
      <= 400 cells/mm3. In persons with less advanced HIV disease and less viral burden, the
      emergence of resistance may be delayed, thus permitting evaluation for beneficial effect in a
      population where there is currently no established therapy.

      Ten patients receive nevirapine daily for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of therapy, patients in
      whom resistance was not evident at week 4 and who have an adequate safety profile continue
      receiving nevirapine for an additional 12 weeks. Clinical and immunological assessments are
      performed at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. Virological assessments are performed at week 24
      only. If 50 percent of patients develop resistance at any time, the study is discontinued.
