    
      Part A investigates the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of escalating weekly dosing of
      Sym004 in patients with recurrent advanced solid tumors.

      Part B and C validates the safety, PK and efficacy of weekly dosing of Sym004 at the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) in a homogenous patient population with advanced metastatic colorectal
      cancer (mCRC) and wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS). Part B will be initiated when a safe
      dose has been established in Part A.

      If MTD equals 12 mg/kg, then part C will explore the 9 mg/kg level.

      Part D and E is to validate the safety, PK and efficacy when administered every 2 weeks at
      doses of 12 mg/kg and 18 mg/kg, respectively.

      Part F is to validate safety, PK and efficacy when administered with a single loading dose of
      9 mg/kg followed by weekly doses of 6 mg/kg.
