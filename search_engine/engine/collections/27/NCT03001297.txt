      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single ascending subcutaneous
      doses of MEDI5884 in healthy volunteers (age 18-55). The study consists of 4 cohorts of
      increasing doses (8 subjects each) and an optional Japanese American cohort (24 subjects) for
      a total of 56 healthy subjects. The decision whether or not to dose escalate will be based
      upon data review by the Dose Escalation Committee. Subjects will be randomized 3:1 to
      MEDI5884 or placebo. Following screening, the study consists of a 3 day inpatient stay and
      follow up visits. The number of follow up visits depend on the cohort assigned.
