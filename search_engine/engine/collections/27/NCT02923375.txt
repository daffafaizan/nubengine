    
      This is a multi-centre, open label, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of two infusions of CYP-001, in adults who have steroid-resistant GvHD.

      Participants will receive standard of care treatment throughout the study, according to local
      procedures. The first eight participants will be enrolled in Cohort A and receive a CYP-001
      dose of 1 million cells per kg, up to a maximum dose of 100 million cells, on Day 0 and Day
      7. Subject to a safety review of data from Cohort A, an additional eight participants will be
      enrolled into Cohort B and receive a CYP-001 dose of 2 million cells/kg, up to a maximum dose
      of 200 million cells, on Day 0 and Day 7. The primary evaluation period concludes for each
      participant 100 days after the first dose of CYP-001. Participants will have study visits on
      Days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60 and 100. Subsequently, participants will enter a long term
      follow-up period, which concludes 2 years after the first dose of CYP-001.
