        -  To test the correlation of a previously published microarray gene expression signature
           with the gene expression obtained with the nCounter™ Analysis System using RNA isolated
           from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE), high-risk neuroblastoma samples.

        -  To construct, test, and validate a novel robust classifier that can be readily
           integrated into the clinic.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      RNA samples extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue are analyzed for gene signature
      expression levels by nCounter™ Analysis System and correlated with published microarray
      expression data. Results are then used to develop a refined gene-expression-profile
      classifier of ultra high-risk neuroblastoma.
