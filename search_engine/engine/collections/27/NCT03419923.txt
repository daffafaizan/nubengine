      two-stage RCA with one stage RCA during IHD, and the second part is to compare two-stage RCA
      with regular saline flushes, with estimated total procedures, 78 and 48, respectively. The
      primary outcome was measured as therapy interruption based on visible serious circuit
      clotting or persistent alarms such as venous pressure (> 200 mmHg) or TMP(transmembrane
      pressures) (> 300 mmHg). The secondary outcomes included circuit survival time, the total
      clotting score of ECC(extracorporeal circuit ) and urea clearance (Kt/V and URR). The total
      clotting score was the sum of the clotting scores for the venous expansion chamber, arterial
      expansion chamber, and dialyzer.
