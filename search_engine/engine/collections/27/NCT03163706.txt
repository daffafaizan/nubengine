      incongruous stimulus classical (BLUE written in green for example); (2) associated
      incongruous stimuli (SKY written in green for example); (3) conventional congruent stimuli
      (BLUE written in blue for example); (4) associated congruent stimuli (SKY written in blue for
      example); (5) neutral words (BRIDGE written in green for example); And (6) neutral stimulus
      (XXXX written in green for example).

      In a second step (after a 5 minute break), they will receive these six categories of stimuli,
      but only half will be presented in a classic way and the other half will be presented in
      order to attract attention as in Augustinova and Ferrand 2007). To do this, in (1)
      incongruous stimuli classical like BLUE, a single letter (like B for example) will be colored
      in green for example and the rest of the word (LUE) will appear in gray); In (2) incongruous
      stimuli associated as SKY, only K for example will be green and the rest of the word will
      appear in gray); In (3) conventional congruent stimuli such as BLUE, only B for example will
      be written in blue and the rest of the word will appear in gray); In (4) associated congruent
      stimuli such as SKY only K for example will be written in blue and the rest of the word will
      appear in gray); In (5) neutral words like BRIDGE, only D will be colored in green for
      example and the rest of the word will appear in gray; And finally, in (6) neutral stimuli
      like XXXX, only one X will be colored in green for example and the rest of the X will appear
      in gray.

      The task will be to name the color of each word (by stating the color verbally) as quickly
      and correctly as possible, while ignoring the written word. In this experiment, we will
      measure the time taken to denominate the color (in milliseconds) as well as the percentages
      of incorrect answers.

      The first step allows to determine the stroop effect and the second the semantic conflict.
