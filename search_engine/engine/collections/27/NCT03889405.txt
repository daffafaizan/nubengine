    
      This multi-center, prospective, comparative, open-label study will be performed in two steps:
      A training step where up to 40 subjects will be enrolled to confirm uterine contraction
      performance level.

      In the second, validation step, the performance of the uterine contraction detection
      algorithm will be validated. The validation phase will involve up to 80 subjects.

      Sub-study will be implemented in the sites that will monitor the uterine activity of the
      subjects with TOCO, in addition to INVU™ and IUPC.

      Following the screening process, participants subject will undergo continuous recording of
      the uterine contraction and the fetal heart rate (FHR) for 30 to 60 min using INVU™,
      Cardiotocograph ((TOCO / CTG), and Intrauterine Pressure Catheters (IUPC). The collected data
      will be downloaded and comprehensive analysis of the values will be performed offline. Each
      participant will undergo continuous monitoring by the medical team to identify any safety
      issue, including but not limited to irritation, sensitization, and potential harmful misuse.
