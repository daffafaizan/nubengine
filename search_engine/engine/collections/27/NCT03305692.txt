    
      This is a prospective randomized study designed to determine whether cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) device programming guided by the ECG Belt (Medtronic, PLC)
      improves echocardiographic and functional outcomes in heart failure (HF) patients. The
      population will include patients treated with CRT for standard indications (not implanted for
      the sole purposes of this study). The study will focus enrollment on patients who do not have
      baseline characteristics predicting the best CRT response. Therefore the study will not
      enroll patients having non-ischemic HF etiology, left bundle branch (LBBB) morphology, and
      QRSd > 150 ms or those previously RV paced.
