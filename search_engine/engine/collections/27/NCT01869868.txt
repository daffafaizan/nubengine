      depression who receive electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)at a psychiatric clinic. We will use a
      consecutive sampling method and patient referred for ECT by their psychiatrist will be
      screened for inclusion and asked for participation. Both in - and outpatients can be
      included. At three occasions (before treatment, after four week and after three months)
      patients will be assessed with clinical ratings, cognitive tests, functional and structural
      magnetic resonance imaging and biomarkers for cell proliferation.
