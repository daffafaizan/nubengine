      was utilized to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of Risperidone ODT (orally
      dissolving tablet) formulations. The test product was a 1 mg ODT tablet formulation of
      Risperidone manufactured by Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. The reference product was commercially
      available Risperidone 1 mg ODT tablets (RisperdalÂ®), Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, LP. Each
      single oral dose (1 mg) will be administered orally as a 1 mg tablet. Blood samples were
      collected at intervals over a 72-hour period after medication administration. There was a
      washout period of 14 days between the two periods of the study.
