      oximeter, ECG and NIBP).

      We will insert a 25G needle inferior to the lower lid punctum and inject 3 ml of our local
      anesthetic mixture (xylocaine 2% +Bupivacaine 0.5%+45IU hyaluronidase enzyme)

      During surgery, we will assess the pain degree during probing using Verbal Rating Scale (0 to
      10 scale where 0 is no pain an 10 is unbearable pain), to assess the efficiency of this
      single low volume injection.
