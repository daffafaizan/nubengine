    
      To satisfy the requirements set forth in post-market surveillance orders issued by the US FDA
      to Cardica, Inc., the following outcomes will be evaluated:

        1. Acute, midterm, and one-year graft failure rates for coronary revascularization using
           the C-Port® xA™ Distal Anastomosis System, C-Port® FlexA™ Distal Anastomosis System, and
           C-Port® XCHANGE™ Distal Anastomosis System when in general use in the United States
           compared to hand-sewn anastomoses.

        2. Technical failure rates when attempting to complete an anastomosis using the C-Port xA,
           FlexA, and XCHANGE Distal Anastomosis Systems.

        3. The technical success rate of hand-sewn anastomoses following technical failures of the
           C-Port devices and the hand-sewn graft patency rates and clinical sequelae at one year.
