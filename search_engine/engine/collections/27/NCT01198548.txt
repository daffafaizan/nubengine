      I. To determine the relative rate of metastatic colorectal cancer patients who achieve 25-D3
      levels >= 40 ng/ml at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks, and 32 weeks from starting FOLFOX
      (leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3
      supplementation (cholecalciferol).

      II. To estimate the median progression-free survival (PFS) of metastatic colorectal cancer
      patients receiving first-line FOLFOX + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3 supplementation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate (RR) and the median overall survival (OS) of metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients receiving first-line FOLFOX + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3
      supplementation.

      II. To describe the safety of this combination by capturing all treatment-related toxicity as
      per National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4 guidelines.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive high-dose cholecalciferol orally (PO) once daily. Patients also receive
      bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours,
      oxaliplatin* IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours once a week.
      Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Treatment with oxaliplatin is discontinued after course 8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30 and then 3 months
      thereafter.
