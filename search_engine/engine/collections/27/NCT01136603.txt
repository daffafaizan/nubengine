      preferred reconstruction mesh for the repair of the abdominal wall post lipectomy, TRAM /
      DIEP flap.

      Aims -

        1. Investigating the efficacy of TIGR as a preferred reconstruction mesh for the repair of
           the abdominal wall post lipectomy, TRAM / DIEP flap. Efficacy of TIGR will allow us to
           determine the stability of the material in the abdominal wall reconstruction.

        2. Study the absorption characteristics of TIGR implant as compared with a non absorbable
           polypropylene mesh. Absorption characteristics can be determined by the amount of tissue
           ingrowth, adhesion formation and shrinkage profiles of the implant and it can be detect
           using ultrasound.

        3. To determine whether any reactions to the implant will occur. These reaction if any will
           manifest as inflammation reactions which may be evident on clinical followup and can be
           detect by ultrasound.

      Patients to be recruited :

      80 randomized equally into the 2 groups Age range: 21 - 80 All patients undergoing lipectomy,
      TRAM / DIEP flap reconstruction will be recruited into the study.

      Trial Duration: July 2010 - July 2015

      Follow up:

      Postoperative 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months Ultrasound will be done to
      determine the amount of tissue ingrowth, adhesion formation and shrinkage profiles of the
      implant in all these follow up appointments. Complications if any can also be detected by the
      Ultrasound.
