      micronutrient levels. Vitamin B12 and folate levels in pregnancy have been linked to birth
      defects including neural tube defects, orofacial clefts, and congenital heart disease.
      Additionally, related analytes, such as homocysteine, may be related to birth defects and
      pregnancy complications. The behavior of maternal serum micronutrients and related analytes
      throughout human pregnancy is not well described. In this study, we aim to characterize the
      patterns of micronutrient status during pregnancy. We plan to perform biochemical analyses on
      serial blood samples collected from 500 pregnant women at five intervals spanning early
      pregnancy and the post partum period. We will also characterize neonatal micronutrient status
      using a specimen of umbilical cord blood. These blood specimens, as well as buccal swab
      specimens collected from the fathers, will also be evaluated to measure the influence of
      genetic variants on metabolite levels. The major outcomes measured will be longitudinal
      maternal micronutrient levels and aggregate alleel frequencies among family triads.
      Comparisons will be made between the presence of genetic variants, biochemical parameters,
      and clinical phenotype. At a later date we also plan to study the same metabolic and genetic
      parameters in a large cohort of healthy individuals. Characterizing these biochemical and
      genetic variants should provide insight into the metabolic processes of normal and
      complicated pregnancies.
