    
      Torsemide is a loop diuretic from the group of pyridine-sulfonylureas, which acts on the
      ascending large portion of the Henle loop where it inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- transport!system
      and blocks Cl- channels.Therefore, sodium and chlorine ions and water can not be reabsorbed
      in the tubule and the urine volume increases significantly. Torsemide is used for the
      treatment of oedema associated with congestive heart failure, kidney or liver disease and,
      either alone or combined with other anti-hypertensive drugs, for the treatment of arterial
      hypertension.

      This trial compares the effect of a new formulation of Torasemide (Torasemide prolonged
      release)to the already available immediate release formulation of the same drug on the
      treatment of mild to moderate hypertensive patients.

      Eligible patients will be randomised to either treatment with Torasemide prolonged release or
      with Torasemide immediate release and will be followed-up until completing 3 months of
      treatment.Blood pressure will be measured by an OMRON pressure gauge. Additionally, ABPM will
      be performed on a sub-group of the patients taking part in this trial.
