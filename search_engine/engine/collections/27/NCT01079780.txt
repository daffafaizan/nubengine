        -  To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients with advanced K-ras wild-type
           colorectal cancer, following progression on bevacizumab-contained chemotherapy, treated
           with irinotecan hydrochloride and cetuximab with versus without ramucirumab as
           second-line therapy.

        -  To evaluate the response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To evaluate the grade 3-4 toxicity rates of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the overall suvival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 vs 1), discontinuation of oxaliplatin before disease progression (yes
      vs no), and time to disease progression since last treatment (â‰¤ 6 months vs > 6 months).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride
           over 60-90 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive ramucirumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and cetuximab and
           irinotecan hydrochloride as in arm I.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.
