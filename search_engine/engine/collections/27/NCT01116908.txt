      settings. Safe drinking water is of particular concern for HIV-positive mothers since many
      HIV-infected Zambian women choose replacement feeding and early cessation of breastfeeding of
      infants to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus. This study builds upon preliminary
      baseline research which determined that HIV-positive mothers would potentially benefit from
      an intervention that encourages HIV-positive mothers to treat their water at the household
      level.
