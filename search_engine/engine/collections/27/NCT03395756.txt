      women with regular ovulatory cycles. Potential participants will undergo screening, which
      will include a history, physical exam, assessment of vital signs, and blood draw for
      assessment of ovulation via mid-luteal progesterone levels. If her progesterone level
      confirms ovulatory status (> 3 ng/ml), she will be offered enrollment and assigned to one of
      three follicular phase groups based on her leading follicle size in the next cycle: 12-14 mm,
      15-17 mm, and â‰¥18 mm. To determine follicle size, participants will receive serial
      transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) scans of their ovarian follicles starting on cycle day 8 of
      the next menstrual cycle. The scans will be performed three times weekly to identify her
      leading follicle. Once the leading follicle has reached its assigned size, DMPA will be
      administered. Blood samples will be obtained prior to administration for baseline hormonal
      assays. One hour after administration, blood will be drawn for MPA levels. For the following
      five consecutive days, the participant will undergo daily TVUS to detect signs of follicular
      rupture and blood draws to assess serum markers of ovulation (estradiol, progesterone, and
      luteinizing hormone). On the first day, 24 hours after DMPA administration, blood will be
      drawn for MPA levels as well. After five days, the participant will return twice weekly for
      two weeks to provide serum progesterone levels to detect any delayed ovulation or ovulatory
      dysfunction. At the final visit, she will fill out a simple survey to assess her satisfaction
      with DMPA as an EC method, and whether she would recommend this method to others.
