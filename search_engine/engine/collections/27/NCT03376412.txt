      ametropes (requiring concurrent LASIK) are included in the investigation. Suitable patients
      will undergo implantation of the Raindrop inlay in the non-dominant eye to improve near
      vision. If necessary, a LASIK excimer ablation will first be performed to optimize
      postoperative vision at near and distance. Patients will follow a one-month regimen of strong
      steroid, at a minimum, after corneal inlay implantation to facilitate healing and visual
      recovery.
