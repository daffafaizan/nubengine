      researchers with Canadian northern community leaders and health officials in a collaborative
      effort to investigate H. pylori infection with the goal of finding solutions to community
      concerns about health risks. The research program uses a community-driven research approach
      in northern communities to characterize the burden of disease from H. pylori infection and
      exchange knowledge with community members and decision makers to identify ways to reduce
      health risks from this infection.

      For the participating communities, the treatment trials aim to:

        1. Estimate the effectiveness of alternate H. pylori treatment regimens to identify optimal
           regimens for the local setting

        2. Identify factors external to the treatment regimen that influence short- and long-term
           treatment success
