    
      This randomized controlled trial will prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      Nexxt MatrixxTM System titanium implant supplemented with a pedicle screw system as compared
      to a representative PEEK cage currently used in routine fashion for lumbar interbody fusion
      procedures. This study will capture clinical and radiographic outcomes on patients up to 2
      years post operatively. Both cages will be used in conjunction with milled local autograft
      bone generated as part of the spinal fusion procedure (no iliac crest autograft will be
      utilized).

      This single centered study will enroll up to 70 subjects (n = 35 per group), with subjects
      followed for 24 months post-surgery. All subjects enrolled in the study will be recruited
      from a pool of subjects eligible for combined interbody/posterolateral lumbar fusion surgery.

      Subjects will be randomized in the trial to receive either the Nexxt Spine Nexxt MatrixxTM
      3D-printed titanium cage or the HonourTM PEEK cage supplemented with a pedicle screw system
      and milled local autograft bone. Subject randomization will be stratified according to
      smoking status. Subjects will be blinded to their group status for the duration of the study
      assessments and procedures (24 months post-operatively). Subject study data will be collected
      preoperatively, intra-operatively and postoperatively at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.
