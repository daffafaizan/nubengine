      CLL, and NHL. However, there remains a lack of real-world evidence for making therapeutic
      decisions based upon MRD status. This study is designed to understand when in a patient's
      treatment continuum the assay is used and how clonoSEQ MRD data impact the treatment
      decisions made by investigators.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be followed for at least 2 yrs. Demographic data and
      disease status will be captured at study enrollment. Patients must be >/= 18 yrs of age and
      able to sign informed consent. A given patient is eligible to enroll in the study if the
      treating physician has made the decision to use the clonoSEQ assay as part of that patient's
      routine cancer care. Reasons for placing a clonoSEQ order and subsequent decisions made as a
      result of MRD data will be tracked. Patient treatment will also be tracked over the course of
      the study in order to understand how clonoSEQ use is incorporated into current treatment
      regimens.

      Participating centers will include sites that actively use clonoSEQ to manage their patients
      with lymphoid malignancies.
