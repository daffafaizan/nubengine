      give informed consent. Also at the first visit, medical reports will be confirmed by each
      participant, anthropometric measures will be recorded and blood samples will be collected.
      After first blood analysis results, participants with stable parameters will be called for a
      second visit when they will be enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial,
      with 4 treatment periods of 6 weeks each, corresponding to a total of 7 visits. At each
      visit, blood samples and anthropometric measures will be collected. At the first intervention
      period, study participants will receive a packaged for the functional or control treatment.
      Functional treatment packaged will be composed by omega 3 softgels (fish oil), chocolate
      containing plant sterols and green tea. Control treatment will be composed by soy oil
      softgels, regular chocolate, and anise tea. Subjects will be advised to consume 3 softgels
      and 1 chocolate twice a day, after main meals, and to drink two cups of tea per day. After a
      6-weeks washout period (third visit), the groups will be switched (crossover) and
      participants will receive the functional or control treatment for more 6 weeks (fourth
      visit). After biomarkers evaluation, the subjects with the greatest response to the
      functional treatment will be selected for additional 6 weeks of functional intervention
      associated to a reduction of the hypolipidaemic drugs (statin) dosage, which will be
      prescribed individually and by the evaluation of the responsible physician.
