        -  Detect changes in serum and urine proteomic profiles that predict outcome in patients
           with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer treated with hormonal therapy and
           radiotherapy.

        -  Identify prognostic and biochemical markers of early disease progression in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Identify unique protein expression and temporal alterations, in these profiles, that
           facilitate understanding of the factors predicting relapse or toxicity.

        -  Identify molecular signatures that allow identification of targets for therapeutic
           intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction hormones* (bicalutimide and releasing-hormone agonist) for
      approximately 4 months prior to starting radiotherapy (per standard treatment). Patients then
      receive radiotherapy consisting of 74 Gy up to a maximum of 81 Gy to the prostate gland per
      standard treatment.NOTE: * Patients receiving short-term hormonal treatment for 4-8 months
      are eligible to participate in the trial.

      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline, and periodically during and after
      induction therapy for proteomic analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years and
      yearly thereafter for the duration of the trial.
