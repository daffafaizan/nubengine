      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, even
      after controlling for other risk factors. 500 patients with symptoms of anxiety and/or
      depression after MI will be randomized either to a 14 week Internet-based CBT-program or to
      treatment as usual (TAU) which is the control condition. A reference group of 250
      participants without depressive or anxiety symptoms will also be studied during TAU. Data
      will be collected before, after and 7 months after treatment. Anxiety and depression
      according to ratings on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) are the primary
      outcome measures.
