      (ASD) share common features was Christopher Gilberg in 1980. Currently it is known that
      patients with ED have social impairment, which is also a risk marker to develop ED, eating
      disturbances are overrepresented in ASD, ED and ASD have common behavioural features such as
      rigidity, perfectionism, and harm avoidance; and common cognitive profiles such as
      inflexibility, high attention to detail, high scores in systemizing profiles and poor results
      in advanced theory of mind tests. This relationship is also supported by similar neural
      phenotypes such as atypical structure and function in social brain regions found in both
      disorders.

      The aim of the present study is to explore the relationship between ED and ASD traits in a
      sample of Spanish participants diagnosed with AN, bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder
      (BED) and other eating disorders (OED). Specifically, the investigators aim to explore
      possible differences within the different ED and its particular transdiagnostic features in
      association with autistic traits.

      The sample will consist of 90 patients with ED and 45 healthy controls (HC) without any
      current or lifetime history of mental disorder, both groups will be compared regarding ED and
      ASD features. Also patients will be reassessed in a 5 year follow up.
