      arms:

        -  Liposomal Doxorubicin

        -  Docetaxel

      For ever 2 patients treated, 1 will receive treatment A (Liposomal Doxorubicin) and 1 will
      receive treatment B (Docetaxel). Patients demonstrating progression on either ARM will be
      eligible for cross over to treatment in the other ARM, provided patient still meets the
      eligibility laboratory and performance status criteria. The study is not blinded so both the
      patient and the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
