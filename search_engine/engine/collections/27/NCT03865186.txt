      identifying emotions are closely associated with the adverse symptoms of the illness. Those
      diagnosed with schizophrenia need to be helped in forming interpersonal relations so that
      they can gain the skills needed to live in society.

      Ä±n this study the investigators prepared a psychoeducation program for individuals diagnosed
      with schizophrenia. The program titled, "Psychoeducation Program for Emotion Identification
      and Expression in Those Diagnosed with Schizophrenia" was conducted with the patients in the
      intervention groups once a week for ten weeks. On the other hand there were a control group
      which weren't be applied any intervention. The investigators applied some tests to
      intervention and control group three times ( before intervention, after intervention and
      three months after intervention). This study was conducted at three Community Mental Health
      Centers (CMHC's). The patients who met the study inclusion criterias were determined in these
      centers. Randomized psychoeducation and control groups were formed from these patients.
