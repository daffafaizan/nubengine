      by means of a computer-generated randomization order into two groups; general anesthesia
      group (Group 1) and spinal anesthesia group (Group 2). Before and after induction of the
      general or spinal anesthesia, patients were monitorized with near infrared spectroscopy for
      regional cerebral oxygen saturation. Findings were compared statistically.
