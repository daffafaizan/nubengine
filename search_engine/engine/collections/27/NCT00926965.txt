      than one year, and met Schooler and Kane's criteria for persistent TD were enrolled in the
      study. The subjects were randomized to three groups: the olanzapine, amisulpride and FGA
      (first generation antipsychotic) controlled groups. Neurocognitive function were assessed
      using Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WSCT) and Continuous Performance test (CPT) at baseline,
      12th week and 24th week. Clinical successive ratings were performed with Brief psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS), AIMS (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Rating Scale), Simpson-Angus Rating
      Scale (SAS), Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser side effect ratings (UKU) and Barnes akathesia
      scale (BAS).To evaluate the influences of prognostic factors on tardive dyskinesia and
      neurocognitive function and to control for all potential confounding variables, longitudinal
      analyses on the repeated measures data were conducted using generalized estimating equation
      models (GEE).
