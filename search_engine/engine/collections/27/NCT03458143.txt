      (Brussels) consists of Remifentanil in TCI-mode, with premedication by Midazolam. However,
      episodes of bradypnaea with or without desaturation are still common.

      The primary objective is to observe if with the addition of ketamine, it is possible to
      significantly reduce the dose of Remifentanil, in order to avoid episodes of respiratory
      depression caused by the opioid.

      The secondary outcomes measured, will be the pain levels experienced by the patient, the
      sedation level, and the satisfaction of the patients after the procedure.
