      new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, notably for associated chronic
      morbidity.Measurement of chronic inflammation, with modification of the balance between
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, could lead to detect patients
      with high risk to diabetes chronic morbidity.

      After parental consent, blood sampling will be carried out by micromethod for cytokine (500
      µl) and CRPhs dosages and glycemia (100 µl) and glycated hemoglobin (1 µl). Urine will be
      collected (50 ml) in the morning for further researches.
