      patidegib gel 2%, patidegib gel 4%, vehicle gel. One or two tubes of the assigned study drug
      will be dispensed to the participant at the Baseline visit. Additional tubes will be
      dispensed at subsequent visits through Week 22. The study drug will be applied topically to
      the entire face as well as to treatment-targeted surgically eligible basal cell carcinomas
      (SEBs) at other anatomical sites twice daily for 26 weeks of treatment.

      Information on reported and observed adverse events will be obtained at each visit. An
      abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Baseline, Week 14, and Week 26.

      At Baseline and Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26, all visible basal cell carcinomas (BCCs)
      (excluding areas below the knees) will be identified by the Investigator, circled in ink,
      photographed, measured, and recorded on a body diagram. Treatment-targeted SEBs (defined as
      the 5 SEBs on the face and/or other anatomical areas identified at Baseline as SEBs) will be
      treated during the 26-week treatment phase. If a participant has 5 eligible previously
      untreated facial SEBs (excluding tumors on nose and eyelids) these tumors will be the
      participant's 5 baseline treatment-targeted SEBs and non-facial baseline SEBs will not be
      treated with study drug. Tumors to be measured and mapped include the 5 baseline
      treatment-targeted tumors as well as all other facial tumors including those on the eyelids
      and the nose. In addition, up to 10 non-treatment-targeted non-facial tumors will also be
      measured and mapped.
