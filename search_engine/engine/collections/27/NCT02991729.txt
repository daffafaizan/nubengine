      decision aid in addition to routine counseling or routine counseling only during a single
      study visit. This decision aid was developed at a 10th grade literacy level using input from
      Maternal Fetal Medicine physicians and certified genetic counselors, and piloted by 20
      English and Spanish speaking women of varying education levels. Following completion of
      genetic counseling, participants will complete several surveys assessing knowledge and
      decision conflict. Data will be abstracted regarding demographics, screening and diagnostic
      testing uptake, and testing results.
