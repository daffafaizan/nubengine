      I. To determine the feasibility of purifying allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells suitable for
      clinical application and to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of these
      cells in patients with recurrent or refractory hematolymphoid malignancies following
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine disease response, time to disease progression, event-free survival, and
      overall survival following treatment with allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells.

      II. To assess donor specific chimerism before and at designated time points after treatment
      with allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo CD8+ memory T-cell infusion over 10-20 minutes.
