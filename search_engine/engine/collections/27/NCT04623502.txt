      carcinomas and urothelial cell carcinomas involving the kidney) in patients. Metabolism is
      the term used to describe how cells take up different nutrients and convert them to energy
      and materials needed for cell growth. In cancer, metabolism is hijacked to support the needs
      of cancer cells. Cancer cells can use multiple nutrients in the blood to fuel their growth,
      but it is not known what materials cancer cells make with those nutrients in patients.

      Many participants in this study will be infused with a 13C-labeled nutrient during their
      surgery or biopsy. 13C means that the carbon in the nutrient is heavier than 12C carbons that
      are the most abundant carbon atoms in nature. 13C carbons account for about 1% of natural
      carbon atoms are not radioactive or harmful in any way. Using the tissue collected during or
      after surgery and/or biopsy, the researchers can track how the heavier 13C carbons from the
      infused nutrient are being used to make different materials that cancer cells need to grow.

      The researchers hope to understand how kidney cancers change their metabolism to adapt, grow,
      and survive in patients. The knowledge learned from this study will be used to support the
      development of therapies that target metabolic adaptations, and the development of new
      non-invasive imaging techniques that will improve the care and survival of future kidney
      cancer patients.
