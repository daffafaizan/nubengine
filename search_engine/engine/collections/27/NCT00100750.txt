    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate of the combination of gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride) and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib (R115777) in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To evaluate the duration of response, time to disease progression in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer treated with the combination of gemcitabine and tipifarnib
      (R115777).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
