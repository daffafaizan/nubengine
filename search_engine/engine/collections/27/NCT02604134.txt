      at least one primary tooth where caries extends into dentine. Children will be randomized and
      treated according to one of two treatment approaches;(1) conventional caries management with
      best practice prevention, or (2) medical management of caries using silver nitrate with best
      practice prevention.

      Baseline measures and outcome data (at treatment/review during two year follow-up) are
      assessed through direct reporting, clinical examination including blinded radiographic
      assessment, and child/parent questionnaires.
