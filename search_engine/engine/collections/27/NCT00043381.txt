    
      This experimental (investigational) study is intended to answer the question of whether
      decitabine is any better than supportive care alone in delaying progression (worsening) of
      the disease, prolonging survival or improving the overall quality of life for MDS patients
      who are not candidates for bone marrow transplant (BMT).
