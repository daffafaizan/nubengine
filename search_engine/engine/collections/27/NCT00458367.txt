      descriptive survey to confirm safety of risperidone in daily practice. This is a single-arm,
      prospective, observational survey to compare the safety profile between groups defined by
      existing risk or disease factors or patient characteristics. The study duration is 6 months
      with 4 patient visits. The primary objective of this PASS is to confirm safety, as identified
      in phase III clinical trials of risperidone, by collecting data when the drug is used under
      marketed conditions in routine clinical practice. A secondary objective is to evaluate
      effectiveness and reasons for initiating risperidone. Each investigator is to document data
      for 4-10 treated patients for whom risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) treatment is
      determined to be clinically indicated. Risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) is given as
      intramuscular injections every 2 weeks. The starting dose of RLAI will be in accordance with
      the product label (usually 25 mg). If necessary, the dosage of the injection may be increased
      gradually. Treatment duration is 26 weeks. To ensure continued antipsychotic coverage until
      the main release of risperidone from the microspheres, previous antipsychotic therapy will be
      continued concomitantly during the first three weeks of the study.
