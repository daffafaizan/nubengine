      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine in children and adolescents with
      refractory solid tumors.

      II. Assess the toxicity of gemcitabine in this patient population. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetic profile of gemcitabine in male and female children and adolescents.

      IV. Assess the antitumor activity of gemcitabine within a phase I study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly for 2 weeks. Patients achieving
      objective response or stable disease after 3 weeks may receive additional courses of therapy
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at week 4 and then every 6 months
      until death.
