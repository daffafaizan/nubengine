      These paraneoplastic cases progress more quickly than primary autoimmune LEMS. An overlap
      syndrome with other autoimmune diseases is often detected in LEMS patients.

      3,4 DAP is effective in LEMS because it increases calcium influx into the nerve terminal by
      blocking potassium efflux and thereby prolonging the presynaptic action potential. 3,4 DAP is
      less likely to provoke epileptic seizures than its precursor, 4-aminopyridine, because it is
      less able to cross the blood-brain barrier. 3,4 DAP is effective in increasing strength and
      improving autonomic symptoms in LEMS patients of both the primary autoimmune and
      paraneoplastic etiologies.
