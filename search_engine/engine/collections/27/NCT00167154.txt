    
      Using a double blind, placebo-controlled design, subjects diagnosed with a current episode of
      major depressive disorder (defined by DSM-IV criteria and supported by the Mini International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview), severe with suicidality despite currently taking an
      antidepressant, will be enrolled in the eight-week study. The treatment will be initiated by
      randomizing patients to receive risperidone or placebo in addition to the antidepressant that
      the patient is already taking. The clinical efficacy will be evaluated after 4 days, weekly
      for 4 weeks, then every other week for 4 weeks with the efficacy measures. During the
      eight-week study, treatment with risperidone or placebo will continue at the highest
      effective dosage (up to 2 mg per day). The dose of the antidepressant will not be changed
      during the study.
