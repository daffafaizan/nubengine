    
      Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare cancer affecting primarily the digestive
      tract and sometimes abdominal cavity in adults. The most common site is the stomach followed
      by the duodenum and small intestine.

      Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for GIST patients whose primary tumor is felt to be
      resectable. Prior to the introduction of Gleevec, patients with inoperable GIST had
      essentially no therapeutic options. However, sunitinib trials offer options to patients who
      are Gleevec resistant or have intolerant GIST. Clinical benefit has been demonstrated with
      positive results in several sunitinib studies of varying phases.
