      investigator-blinded, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LOU064 in
      patients with inadequately controlled asthma who were on a standardized background therapy of
      inhaled corticosteroid plus long acting beta-2 agonist (ICS/LABA).

      The study included:

        -  a Screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility.

        -  a Run-in period of minimum 3 weeks and maximum 5 weeks where patients discontinued their
           current asthma therapy and were placed on budesonide 80 μg/formoterol 4.5 μg delivered
           by dry powder inhaler, two inhalations twice a day (b.i.d).

        -  a Treatment period of 12 weeks. All subjects were randomized 3:2 to receive LOU064 100
           mg once daily or placebo for 12 weeks with standard background therapy of budesonide 80
           μg/formoterol 4.5 μg, two inhalations b.i.d.

        -  a Follow-up period of 3 weeks following the last dose of study drug. Results from the
           interim analysis did not provide sufficient evidence of efficacy of LOU064 in
           inadequately controlled asthma and the sponsor decided to terminate early the study in
           April 2020. The median duration of exposure (12.0 weeks for LOU064 and 11.7 weeks for
           placebo) was close to the treatment target, as most of the subjects had completed
           treatment when the study was terminated.
