      of a subgroup with binge-eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder.
      Improved treatments for patients with obesity and BED are needed that can produce sustained
      clinical outcomes and promote weight loss. This study RCT will provide new and novel findings
      from a controlled test, amongst non-responders to acute treatments, whether
      Naltrexone/Bupropion medication results in superior and longer-term outcomes than placebo.
