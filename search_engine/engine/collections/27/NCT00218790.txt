      warm dialysate markedly normalized the rhythm of body temperature and improved indices on
      nocturnal sleep quantity and quality. Therefore, a major component of this study is to test a
      novel application for a safe, non-pharmacologic, cost-effective intervention that is alreay
      in use in clinical practice - using cool dialysate during hemodialysis to help stabilize the
      sleep/wake cycle of chronic hemodialysis patients. We will also evaluate its effects on
      selected sleep-related physiologic, psychological, behavioral, and general health outcomes.

      To test the efficacy of this intervention, a randomized, single-blinded, pretest-posttest,
      control group design is being used. The major independent variable is dialysate temperature.
      The major dependent variables are measures of sleep, body temperature, rest/activity
      patterns, and general health outcomes.
