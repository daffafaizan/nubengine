      whether hypoglycaemia awareness in Type 1 diabetes can be restored by rigorous avoidance of
      hypoglycaemia addressed by one of the following interventions:

        1. A non-targeted approach whereby pre-prandial glycaemic targets are raised from
           4.5-7mmol/L to 7.2-8.3mmol/L and hypoglycaemia is rigorously avoided without specific
           alterations in subcutaneous insulin regime5

        2. Optimisation of subcutaneous insulin regime employing pre-prandial short-acting insulin
           analogue in combination with once daily insulin Glargine targeted to prevent periods of
           hypoglycaemia identified by 24 hour glucose profiles

        3. Insulin delivery by external pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) targeted to
           prevent periods of hypoglycaemia identified by 24 hour glucose profiles
