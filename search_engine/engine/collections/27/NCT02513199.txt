      an increasing incidence of HCC in the United States over the last twenty years, largely due
      to the Hepatitis C epidemic but increasingly related as well to nonalcoholic fatty liver
      disease.

      This is a non-randomized pilot study to assess the objective response rate and durability of
      response of combination Trans-Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE) with immediate stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC). Eligible patients will be selected based on having a lesion greater than 3 cm which
      would make them ineligible for other local therapies such as TACE and thermal ablation (TA).
      Eligible, consented, and registered patients will be treated with two sessions of standard
      TACE with ethiodol separated by a 4-week interval. After ensuring adequate return to baseline
      liver function, the patients will then be treated with SBRT to the targeted lesion to 30-45
      Gy in 5 fractions. Tumor response will be assessed using mRECIST criteria as well diffusion
      weight imaging (DWI) via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) surveillance. In addition,
      tolerability and toxicity will be recorded via CTCAE v. 4.0. The essential hypothesis of this
      study is that combination TACE and SBRT for > 3 cm HCC will produce higher response rates and
      durable control compared to TACE alone.
