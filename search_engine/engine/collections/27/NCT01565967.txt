      performing in lipid removal in-vitro, the Registry AutoLog Lipid Removal and Blood Component
      Characterization is initiated to determine if the AutoLog system is successful in removing
      lipids in vivo as it is in-vitro. Therefore, it is expected that the lipid amounts after
      washing will be less than 10 mg/dl.

      The study is designed as a multi-center, non-randomized, non-interventional, post market
      release study (a registry). The study has a single arm, without controls, as it is
      descriptive in nature.
