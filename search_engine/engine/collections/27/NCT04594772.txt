      modifications are based on established standards of care. The research components of this
      study will be the use of the two evaluation timepoints for assessment of efficacy of
      pre-resection chemotherapy (including the evaluation criteria defined within this protocol),
      and the collection of correlative blood and tissue samples.

      Chemotherapy will begin with FOLFIRINOX - a standard regimen used in pancreatic cancer
      treatment, consisting of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. At the first planned
      analysis, if a switch is indicated based on prespecified criteria (see Section 8.2 for the
      specific adaptive decision criteria), gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel - another standard
      regimen in this setting - will be used. Radiation therapy may be used prior to surgery, based
      on findings on the final pre-operative scan per standard of care.
