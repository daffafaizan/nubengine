      adults have shown that vitamin D deficiency is associated with cardiovascular events such as
      stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral arterial disease. However, the impact of this
      deficiency on vascular health in adolescents with diabetes has not been examined. Furthermore
      given that endothelial dysfunction is reversible, early detection of this process may have
      therapeutic and prognostic implications in this population.
