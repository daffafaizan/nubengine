    
      The drug being tested in this study is called pioglitazone. This study is designed to further
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pioglitazone on cognitive function in participants
      who have completed the AD-4833/TOMM40_301. This study will look at the effectiveness of
      pioglitazone on cognitive decline in high-risk participants who have completed the
      AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

      The study enrolled 40 participants, but is dependent on how many decide to continue treatment
      in an extension phase after completing the main (301) study. Participants will continue to
      receive the same study medication they received during the pivotal AD-4833/TOMM40_301 study,
      either:

        -  Pioglitazone 0.8 mg tablets or

        -  Placebo (this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient).

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-centre trial, like its precedent pivotal trial, will be conducted worldwide. The
      overall time to participate in this study is minimum 2 years and a maximum of 7 years
      depending on when participants roll over from the 301 study. Participants will make
      approximately 2 visits per year to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 3 months
      after each treatment visit for a follow-up assessment, and 2 weeks after the final visit.
