      patients were randomized into 2 groups (Group A and Group B). Subjects in group A would be
      treated by using continuous subcutaneous insulin injection with insulin lispro, while
      subjects in group B would be treated by using glargine with oral drugs (metformin and
      gliclazide modified release tablets). After achieving the target glucose levels by two
      different approaches in 3-5 days, maintain the target glucose level for 3-5 days. Then a
      Medtronic dynamic blood glucose meter would be applied to the subjects for 72 hours. The
      clinical data, such as demographic information, present history, past history, personal
      history and so on were collected in the 1st day. In the 2nd day and the last day of the
      trial, the blood samples of the patient were collected for the Laboratory Measurements: Cr,
      uric acid, aminotransferase, lipid profiles, white blood cell count, N%, fasting plasma
      glucose, fasting C-peptide, insulin, HbA1c and standard meal test (0.5h-postprandial and
      2h-postprandial blood glucose levels, C peptide and insulin, et al. The parameters of b-cell
      function and glycemia fluctuation were calculated and then analyzed by spss 13.0.
