    
      The study will be a randomised controlled trial, which means that each participant will have
      equal chances to be assigned to one of 2 groups.

      The first group will start the rehabilitation after 3 weeks post-surgery and the second group
      will start after 6 weeks.

      The rehabilitation stages will start with passive movements, progressing to more active
      stages phases until full recovery. The whole program will last about 3 months, which is in
      accordance to what is normally used at the Wrightington Hospital.

      Each participant will have 4 assessment sessions: 1 pre-surgery, after 3 months post-surgery,
      after 6 months and the last after 12 months post-surgery.

      The assessment sessions will consist on answering questionnaires and a clinical assessment
      with equipment, which measures muscle activity and joint angles during clinical tasks.

      An ultrasound scan of the shoulder to assess the integrity of the rotator cuff would be
      carried out one year after surgery by a consultant radiologist.

      These assessments are timed with the routine orthopaedic clinic assessments so that patients
      do not have to make extra trips to take part in the research.
