    
      The study will be a randomized, parallel group, controlled trial of two videogame-like
      (iPad-based) digital therapies. The study will consist of 3 primary phases: Pre-screening,
      Baseline, and Treatment. During the Pre-screening Phase (Day -28 to Day 0), participants will
      undergo pre-screening to evaluate eligibility for the study. Pre-screening may take place up
      to 28 days before the Baseline Visit (Day 0). Pre-screening may take place either over the
      phone, or in the clinic. On Day 0, the Baseline visit will occur wherein additional
      eligibility criteria will be established. The Treatment Phase (Day 1 to Day 42) will involve
      using the digital therapy at home for each participant followed by an In-Clinic assessment on
      Day 42 to assess key outcomes. During the Treatment Phase participants will be instructed to
      play their videogame-like intervention for approximately 25 minutes per day for 5 days per
      week. Compliance with treatment/use requirements will be monitored remotely during this
      phase.
