    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if, and through which mechanisms,
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid improves insulin sensitivity in subjects with protease-inhibitor
      associated insulin resistance.

      The investigators will perform body composition analysis by using a DEXA machine, liver fat
      measurement by using an MRI, and hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedures in 48 HIV
      infected, insulin-resistant/prediabetic subjects before and after 30 days of treatment with
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid or matching placebo. Biopsies of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle
      will be taken during fasting conditions and during insulin infusion, before and after
      treatment to measure markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and thyroid hormone deiodinase.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measures will be change in glucose clearance during insulin infusion,
      change in markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and change in content of D2 in muscle.
