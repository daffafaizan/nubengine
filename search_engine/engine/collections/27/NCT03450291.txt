      Michael Browning) to examine differences in adaptive learning in terms of sensitivity to
      environmental change in those who are in eating disorder 'risk' groups (defined as those with
      a previous diagnosis of AN, and those who score highly in the EAT-26 for eating disorder
      symptoms. This study allows us to investigate whether or not these individuals are able to
      pick up key environmental statistics and adapt their behaviour accordingly. We hypothesise
      that those in eating disorder risk groups will show a deficit in this area, which might begin
      to explain why the cognitive phenotype of 'cognitive inflexibility' is found so commonly in
      these patients. Using pupillometry measures will also allow us to putatively form links
      between this behaviour and the norepinephrine system in these participants, as pupil dilation
      measures are thought to track environmental statistics of this kind. Additionally, this task
      allows us to identify whether there is a particular deficit in tracking and learning about
      positive or negative environmental information. We will be using standard clinical interviews
      and questionnaires to define the groups and to record key variables (e.g. mood information)
      within groups. This study will consist of a single visit, including these interviews and
      questionnaires, the volatility task with pupillometry measures, and the Wisconsin Card Sort
      Task, which we hope to use to demonstrate a baseline difference between groups on cognitive
      flexibility.
