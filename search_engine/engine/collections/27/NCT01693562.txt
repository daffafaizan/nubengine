    
      A dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of MEDI4736 (a monoclonal antibody that targets
      programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)) will evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, IM, and
      antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in adult patients with solid tumors. A dose exploration cohort
      will look at the safety profile of Q4W dosing of MEDI4736.
