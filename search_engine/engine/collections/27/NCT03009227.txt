      group in 1:1 ratio. The extent of colonic resection itself is not influenced by the
      randomization and is predefined by the investigator prior to randomization.

      Requirements applied to centers participating in the trial and surgeons performing procedures
      are described in the protocol and refer to center volume and surgeon's experience with
      evaluation of non-edited video-recordings of procedures.

      Routine quality control includes requirement to photograph vessels with the clip to determine
      the extent of lymph node dissection performed and a thorough morphological assessment of the
      specimen.

      After surgery patients are treated according to local standards with no difference wether D2
      or D3 lymph node dissection was performed. Short-term and long-term outcomes are registered
      as per protocol.

      This is a superiority trial evaluating statistical superiority. With the 50% five year
      survival according to national registry for colon cancer, expecting 10% improvement in
      survival with D3 lymph node dissection, enrollment of 768 patients during 3 year accrual
      period followed by 5 year follow up is required for a power of 80%.

      The intent-to-treat principle is used for the data analysis.
