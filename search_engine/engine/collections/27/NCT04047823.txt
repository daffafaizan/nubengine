      undergoing radiotherapy, occurring in about 87%-95% of irradiated patients and is
      characterized by swelling, redness, pigmentation, ulceration, fibrosis, pain, warmth, burning
      and itching of the skin. RSI has an effect on the level of discomfort experienced and the
      quality of life of patients, and may require interfering with radiation schedule and complex
      surgical reconstruction especially when combined with molecular targeted therapy. However,
      evaluation of RSI is not straightforward. There is no standard instrument for objective
      clinical evaluation of the severity of radiation skin injury.

      Previous studies have shown that radiation leads to the development of cutaneous vasculature
      and generation of an inflammatory response, which will increased skin temperature. The skin
      temperature change due to laser or thermal injury has been measured in many studies with
      temperature and time as predictors of skin damage.

      The most frequent method of skin temperature measurement has been the Infrared thermography.
      Consequently, the changes in the difference of skin temperature (DST) may be used as an
      objective, quantitative, and functional surrogate measure to determine and predict RSI.
