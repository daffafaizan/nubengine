      Despite that coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of myocardial ischemia, the
      symptoms may occur even in the absence of significant CAD. One of the mechanisms suggested
      for myocardial ischemia in these patients is microvascular ischemia (i.e. mismatch in
      microscopic vessels), affecting the myocardium (i.e. heart muscle) at the cellular level.

      A novel electrocardiographic recording method, the iECG is capable of capturing and
      amplifying signals from the cellular level that are much lower biologic signals than those
      processed by a traditional electrocardiogram (ECG). These recordings focus on early detection
      of myocardial abnormalities by non-linear analysis of electrical activity and physiological
      phenomenon. This novel assessment might be capable of detecting subclinical myocardial
      dysfunction in a variety of heart diseases.

      Specific Aims

      Aim#1: Study the feasibility of detection of CAD using iECG compared to computed tomographic
      coronary angiography (CTA).

      Aim#2: Study the association between patterns of iECG and myocardial dysfunction in patients
      without CAD compared to echocardiography.

      Aim#3: Study the effect of changes in iECG output on future outcomes of CAD and need for
      revascularization.
