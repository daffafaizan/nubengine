      important for strengthening the bones. However, too much phosphorus in the blood may be bad
      for the health of your heart and blood vessels. The kidneys keep the blood levels of
      phosphorus normal by getting rid of extra phosphorus in the urine. New research has found
      that common forms of food additives that are high in phosphorus may increase blood phosphorus
      levels in individuals with kidney disease. In addition, these food additives may increase
      blood levels of hormones that control phosphorus such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Like high blood phosphorus levels, high levels of PTH
      and FGF23 in the blood may also be bad for the health of your heart and blood vessels. In
      this study, the investigators would like to examine the effects of food additives on blood
      levels of phosphorus, PTH and FGF23 in individuals with normal kidney function.
