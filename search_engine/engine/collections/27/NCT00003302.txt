      conjunction with mammography for the detection and characterization of lesions in women with
      suspicious mammographic or clinical examinations. II. Assess the incremental value of breast
      MRI to determine the local extent of cancer in these patients. III. Assess the value of
      breast MRI to determine the prevalence and characteristics of incidental enhancing lesions in
      the remainder of the breast.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo a high resolution 3D post contrast
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Patients with enhancing abnormalities undergo a
      dynamic scan no less than 18 hours later. Some patients may require a third scan if a core
      biopsy is to be performed. Patients who are ultimately found to have cancer are assessed for
      extent of cancer including measurement of the index lesion and identification of other
      present foci of cancer in relation to the index lesion. Further histological diagnosis of
      index lesions is determined by MRI-guided needle localization excisional biopsy. Patients
      with benign needle biopsy are followed for 2 years. Patients with benign primary lesions
      receive a follow up MRI scan 1 year after the initial scan. Patients with benign primary
      lesions and incidental enhancing lesions (IEL) are followed at 2 years. Patients with
      negative needle biopsies not yielding a specific diagnosis and who do not undergo subsequent
      excisional biopsy are followed yearly for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1500 patients will be accrued for this study over 4.25 years.
