      growing evidence that non-opiate analgesics may provide equivalent pain relief with fewer
      adverse effects and greater overall satisfaction. The purpose of this randomized trial is to
      compare the efficacy, side effect profiles and satisfaction associated with Ibuprofen plus
      Acetaminophen versus Oxycodone alone following outpatient hand surgery. No previous studies
      have compared the use of opiate analgesics with acetaminophen/ibuprofen following outpatient
      hand surgery. Patients will be randomized to receive either oxycodone alone or acetaminophen
      and ibuprofen following outpatient soft tissue hand surgery. Patients will be randomized to
      receive one of the two aforementioned pain regimens. Patients will be given a booklet in
      which to record pain level by visual analog scale (VAS), satisfaction with pain control,
      brief pain inventory and any side effects. Patients will be seen in clinic 1 week after
      surgery to review symptoms. Patients may also be contacted by phone to review daily log of
      symptoms. Patients will be seen in clinic 1 week after surgery per standard of care.
