      baseline mFARS score (<40 versus ≥40), age of disease onset (<14 versus ≥14), and age at
      screening (≤21 years or >21 years) and randomized to receive either vatiquinone or placebo
      using interactive web response system (IWRS). Following completion of the randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled phase (72 weeks), participants will enter into an open-label
      extension phase (24 weeks) during which they will receive open-label treatment with
      vatiquinone at the dose they received in the randomized phase of the study (for participants
      entering the extension phase who initially received placebo, the dose of vatiquinone will be
      determined based on age and weight) and then a safety follow-up (10-30 days after last dose).
