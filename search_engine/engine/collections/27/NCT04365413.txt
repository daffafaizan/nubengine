    
      This study will involve patients that are scheduled for routine standard of care surgery. It
      is a single-arm study designed to provide safety information regarding the use of the Acuity
      MSOT device in the clinical setting, and the ability of MSOT imaging data to correlate with
      clinical findings identified via pathology.

      The device will be used to obtain images of the tumor or lymph node margins for
      investigational use only to compare to clinical pathology and patient's medical record. All
      images will be obtained pre- and post-surgery in a closed surgical patient. The temperature
      of the patient's skin will also be measured prior to and after MSOT imaging. MSOT imaging
      will be for research only and no treatment decisions will be based on the MSOT images
      obtained.
