      used treatments include topical agents, systemic medications and biologic agents, but all of
      them have some drawbacks or limitations. Besides, non-standardized treatment or the disease
      itself may lead transformation to other diseases, which add more importance to finding
      improved management strategies.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that can differentiate
      into bone, cartilage and fat cells. They have several functions, such as migration to skin
      lesions, immunomodulation, limitation of autoimmunity and local paracrine effects. It
      reported MSCs have already been used in some kinds of autoimmune disease, such as systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis et al.

      In this study, consenting umbilical cords are donated by healthy donors. After several
      processing steps, UC-MSCs are separated and froze for future infusions. When volunteers are
      recruited, their condition will be assessed by Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI)
      and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Then MSCs will be infused according to a standard
      scheme. After all 6 infusions, the patient will be re-assessed by the PASI and DLQI and will
      be followed up for one year.
