      will incorporate the foods containing soy into their usual diet for one week. The
      tolerability to each dose will be evaluated and fecal short chain fatty acids will be
      measured as a biomarker of compliance. Subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria and
      express willingness to consume the study foods will be enrolled.
