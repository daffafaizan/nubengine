      single-arm study. It will consist of 2 Phases: a Screening Phase (up to 21 days before the
      first dose administration), and Treatment Phase (for patients meeting the continuation
      criteria). During the Treatment Phase, patients will receive a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 trabectedin
      intravenous formulation administered as a 24-hour infusion on Day 1 of each suggested 21-day
      treatment cycle. All patients will receive 20 mg dexamethasone (or corticosteroid equivalent
      to dexamethasone). Number of cycles is not specified for this study. Patients may continue to
      receive treatment as long as they obtain an overall clinical benefit, ie, until there is
      clear evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, as judged by the
      investigator. Trabectedin is the first of a new class of antitumor agents. Previous studies
      with trabectedin in patients who had been previously treated for soft tissue sarcoma have
      suggested that treatment with trabectedin resulted in tumor shrinkage, disease stabilization,
      and improved survival rates. However, hematologic toxicity, hepatic toxicity, and renal
      impairment were also observed in these patients. The safety profile of trabectedin will be
      evaluated to further assess the potential risks of trabectedin treatment in patients
      previously treated for soft tissue sarcoma who are not expected to benefit from currently
      available therapeutic options for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
