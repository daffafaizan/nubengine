      embolization with liquid embolic agents (onyx/squid/Phil) as the main treatment of CSDH.

      The subjects are enrolled in the study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Imaging
      and clinical presentations of patients are recorded. Within 48 hours of embolization,
      patients are assessed with clinical examination and with a brain CT scan to evaluate in any
      change in their symptoms and CSDH volume. 2-4 weeks after embolization, patients are
      evaluated in clinic for any change in their symptoms and signs. 60 days after embolization
      patients are examined clinically and are assessed for SDH volume change in CT scan and MRI.

      If there is any significant increase in CSDH volume or any deterioration of patient,
      evacuation of hematoma is considered.

      MMA embolization is performed under general anesthesia using biplane or monoplane
      angiography. Femoral or radial accesses are used. Guiding catheter is advanced into external
      carotid artery in corresponding side. The corresponding MMA is catheterized distally by
      micro-catheter and is embolized by liquid embolic agents. Patients are discharge next day if
      they are stable.
