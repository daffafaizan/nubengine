      sources of metastatic cancer cells, which upon isolation, permit comparative studies between
      the biology nature of primary tumor and metastatic ones. In this study, we will try to
      isolate cancer cells from human malignant effusions, said to be pleural effusions and/or
      ascites. We will establish phenotypic alterations along the progression of malignant tumors
      with serosal metastasis, with special emphasis on expression of some proteases, laminin
      receptors and transcription factors involved in the process of invasion and metastasis. We
      would also perform clinical correlations, including tumor type, staging, status of lymph node
      metastasis and histopathological differentiation and grading, etc.
