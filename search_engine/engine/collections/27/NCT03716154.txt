      periodontitis, from subjects attending Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST)
      Postgraduate Dental Clinic (PDC), the age range were (28-55) year, between Apr 2017 and Oct
      2017. Those patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled single-blinded study. For each
      patient, full medical and dental history and periodontal examination were recorded. Clinical
      parameters such as pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), gingival index (GI) and
      plaque index (PI) were evaluated at the baseline. All Patients underwent initial periodontal
      therapy; SRP which was performed using a sonic device and hand instruments and the sites were
      divided randomly into two groups SRP alone and SRP with adjunctive diode 810 nm laser in the
      contralateral sites in the same jaw. The Clinical parameters have been re-evaluated at 1, 3
      and 6 months to test the effectiveness of (810 nm, 2 W, pulsed mode, for 20 sec) in treatment
      of CP. Diode laser therapy was applied to periodontal pockets in the same day of treatment.
