      celecoxib (CelebrexÂ®) and irinotecan (CPT-11), with standard radiation therapy on people
      before they undergo surgery; to determine what effects this combination has on pancreatic
      cancer; and to determine the highest dose of celecoxib and irinotecan that can be given
      safely without causing severe side effects. While not an endpoint, it is hoped that this
      combination will also shrink tumors enough for excision.
