      secretion. In addition, there is a report that oral intake of glutamate evokes the activation
      of vagal afferent nerves in the rat. Thus, such amino acids are thought to be influential in
      the process of digestion and absorption.

      . To investigate the effect of monosodium glutamate on gastrointestinal motility, we planned
      a single-blind randomized study. The participants will take either monosodium glutamate or
      sodium chloride before the first examination of upper GI motility and the other agent before
      the second examination. The order of intake will be randomized by the envelope method.
