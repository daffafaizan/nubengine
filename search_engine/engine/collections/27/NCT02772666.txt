      patient with visual loss. Asymmetric response may indicate a relative afferent pupillary
      defect (RAPD). The rapid detection device for relative afferent pupillary defect (present
      device) is a newly designed portable facility with computerized software on a mobile device.
      This allows for field ophthalmic examination and identification of RAPDs quickly and
      accurately and also record pupillary movements for further processing and analysis or send
      the information and images via Wi-Fi. We aimed at comparing and evaluating this device with
      available methods to develop a test which is practically easy and quick with objective
      results and no need for specialist interpretation, so that any technician can perform the
      test automatically. Distinctive software allows simple use of the device by field personnel
      with minimal training. Each patient was investigated by swinging flashlight method and the
      newly constructed automated O-glass. The swinging flashlight test procedure, also called as
      Marcus Gunn Test, is well known in ophthalmology science.The hardware for this device
      includes 4 different parts: Camera and optics, light control system, power control system,
      and the microcontroller.The two main components of the software are the ability to
      communicate with the hardware wirelessly, and the pattern recognition system.
