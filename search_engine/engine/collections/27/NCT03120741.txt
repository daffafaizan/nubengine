      bring information about the behavior of the patients to the caregivers and their relatives.
      In this study, non-invasive wireless sensors such as infrared motion sensor the switch sensor
      will be built in the home of the subjects. The wireless sensor data collected by the input to
      the team's "activity identification system" in order to assess the mathematical model of the
      subjects "capacity" and immediate judgment of their activities. In the identification of
      activities can be divided into two categories of behavior, risk behavior (harmful to the
      subjects) and protective behavior (beneficial to the subjects), real-time activity detection,
      can avoid dangerous behavior, such as water and gas off, roaming , Repetitive behavior
      (over-eating), forgetting to eat and day-night reversal (sleep disturbance), etc., the
      protection of behavior can be observed through a long time to help patients conduct
      beneficial behavior, such as regular quantitative diet.
