      (IPI)-score â‰¥ 3 21% of patients will relapse within 2-years after completion of R-CHOP
      induction treatment despite achieving a complete remission. Patient relapsing within a year
      after R-CHOP treatment have a very poor prognosis, even after second line chemotherapy, with
      only 15% of patients achieving a long remission. Therefore, additional therapy in first line
      treatment is required for these patients. The immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab is a
      monoclonal antibody directed against the program death ligand 1 (PDL1). The PD1 and PDL1
      inhibitors have shown excellent results in relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and promising results in
      relapsed B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma. Given the acceptable toxicity profile of atezolizumab,
      this study examines the efficacy and toxicity of atezolizumab as consolidation treatment
      after R-CHOP induction in DLBCL patients at high risk of relapse.
