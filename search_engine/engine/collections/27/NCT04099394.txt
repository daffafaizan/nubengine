      functioning in older adults. Although clinical practice guidelines recommend physical
      exercise for managing symptoms of knee OA, several systematic reviews indicate that exercise
      intervention studies provide only short-term benefits (lasting 6 months) for knee OA. Many
      older adults with painful knee OA return to sedentary lifestyles when structured exercise
      programs end6. Efforts to increase and sustain physical activity in this population will
      require promoting self-regulatory skills to develop confidence to maintain an active
      lifestyle and manage symptoms that often limit activity. Therefore, we developed a
      group-based behavioral health (BH) program for older adults with painful knee OA that
      complements Enhance Fitness (EF) - a multicomponent, community-based exercise program for
      older adults, involving balance, strength, and endurance training. The Behavioral Health (BH)
      program will have 10, 1-hour weekly classes spread over 4 months, while the Health Education
      (HE) program will be equally matched for attention with classes on aging and health. In
      parallel with BH/HE programs, all study subjects will participate in Enhance Fitness (EF)
      exercise classes that will be held for 1-hour, 3 times a week for 4 months. EF+BH
      intervention (versus EF+HE) improves physical activity, pain, physical function, and other
      outcomes in older adults with knee OA.
