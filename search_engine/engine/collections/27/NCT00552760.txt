      have continued sleep disturbances. Improving patients' sleep by also normalizing the
      circadian rhythm will lead to fewer mood exacerbations. Ramelteon offers a new and more
      pharmacologically exact mechanism to re-synchronize the SCN. The administration of ramelteon
      for bipolar patients will improve sleep and will cause fewer mood exacerbations.

      Patients with bipolar disorder often experience frequent mood alterations that are attempted
      to be controlled by mood stabilizing agents and anti-psychotic agents. Both classes of
      medications have numerous significant side effects. Establishing that ramelteon is helpful in
      the sleep of patients with bipolar disorder and helpful in mood stability will increase the
      number of treatment options for bipolar patients.
