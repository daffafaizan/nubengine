      program, including home monitoring and medication adjustments, is practical to use in recent
      stroke survivors and whether or not it is associated with lowering blood pressure after 3
      months. Data from this trial may be used to do more research and may be used by doctors when
      seeing patients.This research is being done because high blood pressure, also called
      hypertension, is the leading risk factor for stroke. Lowering blood pressure (BP) has been
      shown to lower the risk of future strokes. The majority of stroke survivors continue to have
      uncontrolled BP. Currently, blood pressure (BP) is most often measured in the doctor's
      office. However, those single BP measurements are not the best picture of blood pressure over
      time and can be influenced by the stress of being in a doctor's office, known as the "white
      coat effect". This is why measuring BP at home may paint a more accurate picture of a
      patient's true long-term BP. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is recommended in the
      recently updated national hypertension guidelines. Home BP monitoring plus guided BP
      medication self-adjustments is associated with lower BP in patients with high blood pressure.
      The investigators believe that a HBPS program, including medication self-adjustment and home
      monitoring, may help to reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension within 3 months.
