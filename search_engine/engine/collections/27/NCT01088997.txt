      vasculature fails to relax after birth resulting in severe hypoxemia. This condition has a
      high rate of mortality and morbidity. The current standard of care is treatment with inhaled
      nitric oxide (iNO). However, for many babies this treatment does not provide sufficient
      improvement in oxygenation.

      In this study, subjects already receiving nitric oxide will be randomized to one of two
      dosing regimens of milrinone. They will receive milrinone IV for 24 hours and will be
      monitored for 24 hours afterwards. During this time, milrinone assays will be performed by
      blood sampling. Echocardiograms will also be performed to explore the pharmacodynamics of
      milrinone. Safety monitoring will be performed.
