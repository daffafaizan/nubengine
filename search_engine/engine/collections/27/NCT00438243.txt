      advances in cataract surgery, cystoid macular edema (CME) is the most common cause of loss of
      vision after cataract surgery, occurring in approximately 0.3% to 3% of all uncomplicated
      surgeries. If the surgery is complicated, CME can occur in up to 20% of these patients. In
      CME, fluid accumulates in cystic spaces within the outer plexiform layer of the retina,
      resulting in decreased vision.

      Ocular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used in the treatment
      of CME. NSAIDs decrease inflammation and are hypothesized to decrease the production of
      prostaglandins via selective inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway, which can result in
      CME. The standard of care for management of postoperative pseudophakic macular edema to some
      extent remains unclear. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy for the prophylaxis or
      treatment of postoperative cystoid macular edema.

      Bromfenac (Xibrom)an NSAID and is FDA-approved for ocular use to treat pain and inflammation
      after ocular surgery. Therefore, these medications might decrease inflammation and be
      effective in treating CME. The investigators plan to conduct a controlled study to
      investigate the effect of Bromfenac (Xibrom)in patients who develop CME after cataract
      surgery. The results of this study may be important in better understanding the pathogenesis
      and treatment of acute postoperative cystoid macular edema to prevent chronic vision loss.
