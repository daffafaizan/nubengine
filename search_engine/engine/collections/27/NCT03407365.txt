      number to patients in physician's offices and has a high recurrence rate. Physical therapy
      and exercise therapy to strengthen the quadriceps is often prescribed, however recurrence is
      common. It is hypothesized that PFPS patients have core weakness, hip strength abnormalities
      and neuromuscular control deficits.
