      stimulating (anodal) or inhibiting (cathodal) neural circuits in the brain. In the treatment
      of severe lower limb paresis after stroke, the GangTrainer GT1 (GT) proved to be effective.
      Therefore the present study intends to combine both approaches, tDCS + GT, apply at the same
      time every day for two weeks in order to improve the effectiveness of GangTrainer therapy in
      the gait rehabilitation. The rehabilitation programme are compose 3 kinds of locomotor
      training interventions (experimental group, control group 1 and control group 2).

      During intervention experimental group, patients receive a total of 10 treatments of
      repetitive locomotor training with electromechanical gait device (duration 30 min) + tDCS
      (duration first 7 min) with the anodal electrode is place over the presumed lower limb area
      of the lesioned hemisphere, and the cathodal electrode is place above the controlateral
      orbital. The anodal stimulation is expected to facilitate the activity of the lower limb
      motor area side directly, while the cathodal stimulation of the non-lesioned hemisphere is
      expected to facilitate the lesioned side indirectly by decreasing inhibitory inputs. The
      control group 1 receive a total of 10 treatments with only GT (duration 30 min) with
      sham-stimulation, and the control group 2 receive a total of 10 treatments with convectional
      physiotherapy
