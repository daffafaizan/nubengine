      by radiotherapy (RT). On the other hand, all adjuvant treatments involve a risk of side
      effects; some are acute and transient while others are long-term. Considering the well-known
      side effects of irradiation, it seems appropriate to involve patients in the decision on
      whether to receive irradiation.

      In the shared decision making (SDM) process clinicians and patients work together to make
      appropriate health decisions based on clinical evidence and the patient's informed
      preferences. A patient decision aid (PtDA) is instrumental in the SDM process.

      This study is a multicenter, national trial randomizing doctors to either use or not use SDM
      and a PtDA when informing the patients about benefits and risks of receiving adjuvant
      radiotherapy.

      It is not expected that significantly less patients will receive radiotherapy as a
      consequence of SDM. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether patient engagement in
      decision making is affected by SDM and the use of an in-consultation PtDA.
