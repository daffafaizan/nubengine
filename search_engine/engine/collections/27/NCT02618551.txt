      severe asthma that treats smooth muscle by radiofrequency to reduce its thickness. This
      procedure leads to improved asthma control and quality of life, but also to decreased
      exacerbations frequency and number of emergencies hospitalizations. This treatment requires 3
      procedures every 3 to 4 weeks.

      The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying its effectiveness need to be better understood
      for an improved selection of best candidates. In particular, there is a discrepancy between
      the improvement observed in symptoms (ACQ), quality of life (AQLQ) and the lack of
      improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Investigator assume that this
      paradox is due to an efficiency appearing at effort, targeting dynamic hyperinflation
      phenomenon.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of bronchial thermoplasty on dynamic
      hyperinflation in severe asthma. The secondary objectives are to assess the effectiveness of
      bronchial thermoplasty (ACQ, AQLQ) in a selected population of patients with dynamic
      hyperinflation and to describe bronchial wall structural changes by probe-based confocal
      LASER endomicroscopy (pCLE).
