      material and undergoes rapid and complete resorption. Studies have shown that CS creates an
      osteoconductive lattice that stimulates bone ingrowth into a defect. PRF poses multiple
      growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. It is biologically active
      up to one week. The combination of these 2 materials will serve as good grafting material for
      tooth socket, in order to preserve vertical and horizontal dimensions.
