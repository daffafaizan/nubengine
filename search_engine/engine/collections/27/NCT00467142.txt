    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of bevacizumab, irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and
           fluorouracil, in terms of partial or complete response, in patients with unresectable
           metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the pharmacogenetics and change in genetic polymorphisms susceptible to
           modification by this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours, and bevacizumab IV on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV over 46 hours
      beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected periodically for pharmacogenetic and genetic
      polymorphism analysis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 61 patients will be accrued for this study.
