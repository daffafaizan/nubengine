    
      The drug being tested in this study is called vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested for
      the prevention of relapse in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who respond to daily
      treatment with vortioxetine. This study will look at relapse rates of MDD in people who take
      vortioxetine.

      The study will enroll approximately 1100 participants. All participants will receive
      vortioxetine 10 mg open-label for the first 16 weeks of the study. Participants who meet the
      appropriate MDD response criteria from the Week 8 Visit through Week 16 Visit will be
      eligible for randomization into the double-blind treatment period. Participants will be
      randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups-which
      will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 5 mg

        -  Vortioxetine 10 mg

        -  Vortioxetine 20 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 55 weeks. Participants will make 19 visits to the clinic,
      and will be contacted by telephone 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
