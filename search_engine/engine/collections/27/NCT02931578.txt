      assessments of the glycemic index commonly consumed food items. This will be used in the
      scientific literature to assess the glycemic index of foods containing various sweeteners.
      Participants will be monitored for a total of 10 weeks.

      The glycemic index is defined as the "incremental area under the glucose response curve after
      standard amount of carbohydrate relative to that of a control food (white bread or glucose)
      is consumed." In general, the glycemic index quantifies the relative effect of the
      carbohydrate content of the food on resultant blood glucose.
