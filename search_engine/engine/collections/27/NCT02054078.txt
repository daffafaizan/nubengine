      Currently recognized as the most reliable method to control malignant pleural effusion is
      pleural fixed or thoracic catheter drainage. The most effective pleural fixed agent is pulvis
      talci, but there are about 30% relapse rate. Thoracic drainage can lead to some
      complications, such as chest infections, catheter migration and blockage etc. The
      investigators need a reliable methods to solve dyspnea and other symptoms caused by malignant
      pleural effusion, and improve quality of life. The purpose of this study was to determine the
      efficacy and Safety of intrapleural Bevacizumab versus pulvis talci as treatment for
      malignant pleural effusions (MPE) in patients.

      Methods:

      A unblended, randomized study to compare the inhibition of two treatment methods in malignant
      pleural effusion. Consecutive 183 patients were randomly assigned to two groups, A group is
      Bevacizumab200mg by intrapleural administration; B group is injected pulvis talci with closed
      thoracic drainage.
