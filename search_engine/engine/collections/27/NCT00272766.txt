    
      Ocular histoplasmosis is a leading cause of severe and irreversible central vision loss in
      middle-aged adults living in the central and eastern US. OHS has been associated with the
      fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic soil mold found in 18 to 20 states in the central
      and eastern US. Annually, approximately 100,000 people are thought to be at risk of vision
      loss caused by OHS.

      This study will include OHS patients with CNV lesions no larger than 5400 microns in greatest
      linear diameter with classic or occult CNV extending under the geometric center of the FAZ
      and best-corrected visual acuity letter score between 20/40-20/200. Twenty four patients will
      be enrolled and the study will have 2 treatment arms with 12 patients each. The first arm
      will consist of 12 patients who will receive 0.3 mg of Macugen intravitreally every 6 weeks
      for one year. The second arm will consist of 12 patients who will receive Photodynamic
      Therapy (PDT) with Visudyne every 3 months for one year.
