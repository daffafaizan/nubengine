    
      Patients with esophageal (EC) and gastroesophageal junction (GEJC) cancers who are seen in
      the Esophageal and Gastric Multidisciplinary Clinic (EGMDC) for treatment planning and are
      recommended to receive neoadjuvant therapy and plan to receive treatment at UCCC Metro will
      be offered enrollment into the study. Patients will complete the patient reported assessments
      focused on QOL and physical activity on provided tablet computers during UCCC visits at
      specified time points. If unable to complete assessments in person they will be e-mailed to
      the patient via REDCap to complete. Additional data regarding dosing of chemotherapy,
      radiation, nutrition and surgical outcomes will be collected.
