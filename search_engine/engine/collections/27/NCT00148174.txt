      transplantation outcomes including acute graft rejection and graft loss. In this study, we
      are randomly assigning a telephone intervention in a prospective cohort of medically
      noncompliant patients. Standard therapy includes specifically warning patients about the
      risks of noncompliant behavior, and the formal intervention is randomized so half of these
      patients will also receive intensive telephone followup, intended to improve medication
      compliance and reduce adverse events.
