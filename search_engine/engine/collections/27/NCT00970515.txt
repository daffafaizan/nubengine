    
      The aim of this study is to compare immediate and long-term (24 months) results of
      laparoscopic and open mesh repair of incisional and umbilical hernia.

      Five hundred patients will be included in this randomized, multicentric trial.

      Hypotheses are that laparoscopic approach: 1- reduces immediate parietal complications
      without increasing intra abdominal septic complications 2- is less invasive and also reduces
      patients' hospital stay and recovery time; 3- has the same efficacy, than open approach.
