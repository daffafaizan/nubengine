      Partners in Care study has shown that evidence-based service delivery programs for depression
      can improve health outcomes in depressed patients, and especially in minorities, largely
      overcoming disparities in outcomes from care between whites and minorities. Effective
      treatments exist, but they do not reach many depressed individuals, especially in
      resource-poor communities--ethnic minorities, rural residents in the United States, and
      individuals in most of the developing world.

      Women, in particular, are at risk for depression and poverty. Integrating programs that treat
      depression and address livelihood concerns may improve engagement in depression treatment and
      improve mental health and functioning for patients in low-resource settings. The proposed
      study would integrate depression care with existing "microfinance" programs, which provide
      poverty-alleviation services including small loans, savings programs, and vocational training
      to women.

      This project will (1) conduct qualitative studies of barriers and facilitators of women's
      successful use of existing depression care and microfinance programs; (2) adapt and integrate
      the depression care and microfinance services; (3) train Women's Union facilitators to
      deliver the integrated depression care and microfinance program; and conduct evaluation of
      LIFE-DM program to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness. The
      non-randomized control trial compares the integrated microfinance and collaborative care
      intervention with enhanced treatment as usual (national guideline antidepressant care and
      referral to microfinance resources) at the Women's Union in Danang city in Vietnam.
