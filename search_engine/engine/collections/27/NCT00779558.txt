      apply:

      Inclusion criteria:

      All infants < 1 year of age undergoing cardiac surgery at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital

      Exclusion Criteria:

      Known coagulopathy History of clinically significant bleeding (GI, cranial, pulmonary) Need
      for therapeutic heparinization ECMO

      Randomization and blinding are performed in the Pharmacy. The intervention is initiated at
      the intensive care unit physician's discretion, generally within the 1st 24 hours
      post-operatively. The study is terminated when all catheters have been discontinued or at POD
      #14, whichever occurs first.

      Thrombosis is demonstrated by echocardiogram or ultrasound performed at

      1 - 3 days, 5 - 7 days, and 10 - 14 days after initiation of the study drug.

      The following are calculations for statistical analysis:

      Sample size determination - Using 2 - sided alpha = 0.05 and Beta = 0.2, and assuming a
      baseline thrombosis incidence of 20%, 160 patients are required to detect an effect size of
      15%.
