      mononuclear cells of 50 to 90 ml of the patient's peripheral blood (PB). During the term of
      cell preparation of CART30, patients will receive a conditioning regimen including
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. One day after completing conditioning regimen, the patient
      will be given infusions of CART30 cells into the vein in escalating doses over a period of 3
      to 5 consecutive days.

      Extra blood will be drawn to measure the persistence of CART30 in vivo.
