      developed countries. Survivors may suffer several neurological deficits or deficiencies, such
      as hemiparesis, communication disorders, cognitive deficits and visuospatial perception
      disorders. Hemiplegia is a par loss of hemi-body voluntary motricity following a brain
      injury, usually resulting in alterations of the locomotor system with persistent disorders of
      movement and posture. Hemiplegia significantly affects gait performance. Gait recovery is an
      important objective in the rehabilitation program for stroke patients.The currently available
      treatment techniques include classical techniques of gait rehabilitation, functional
      electrical stimulation, electromechanic devices, robotic devices and brain-computer
      interfaces, among others.The evidence suggest that the combination of different
      rehabilitation strategies is more effective than conventional rehabilitation techniques
      alone. Technology-based rehabilitation methods such as robotic devices need more research to
      demonstrate their effects on gait recovery.

      The present study aimed to identify the changes in the gait characteristics of subjects with
      stroke after a treatment program with FES for the lower extremities through instrumental gait
      analysis.
