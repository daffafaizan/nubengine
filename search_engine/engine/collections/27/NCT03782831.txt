      unrestable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at intermediate-stage. Programmed cell death
      protein-1 (PD-1) antibody is effective and safe for advanced HCC. No study has compared the
      efficacy and safety of TACE plus PD-1 antibody and TACE alone. Thus, the investigators
      carried out this prospective randomized control study to find out it.
