      overnight fast, iron supplement will be provided to participant before breakfast. Blood
      samples will be collected right before and 2 h after iron supplement consumption for NTBI
      analysis.

      NTBI concentration before and after iron supplement consumption will be compared. Dependence
      of NTBI formation on markers of iron status (serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation,
      serum ferritin and hemoglobin) will be evaluated.
