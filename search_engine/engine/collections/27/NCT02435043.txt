      patients in an especially designed garden at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,
      Alnarp. The intervention is grounded in environmental psychology and occupational therapy,
      supported by a multimodal rehabilitation team that utilizes the garden/nature for sensory
      stimulation, body awareness, meaningful occupations and nature experiences.

      The enrollment of 101 patients (51 intervention; 50 control) was completed on August 2014.
      Follow-up is on-going, with assessments by examiner blinded to treatment group, at end of
      intervention period, 8 months, and 14 months after randomization. A parallel study with
      qualitative in-depth interviews in a subset of patients, who were randomized to the
      intervention group, as well as the staff, is also ongoing.
