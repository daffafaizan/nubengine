      experimental or control groups. Following a baseline psychiatric assessment session, subjects
      will return to the study center for two to three additional follow-up visits.

      During the second visit, all subjects will undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) scanning session, during which they will perform a series of functional neuroimaging
      tasks designed to examine the neural substrates involved in visceral interoception and eating
      behavior. Prior to the start of the scan session, blood samples will be collected from each
      subject, for the measurement of bio-markers related to nicotine use and peripheral
      inflammation. After the end of the second visit, subjects within the experimental group will
      be asked to switch from combustible to electronic cigarettes. Subjects within the control
      group will continue to smoke combustible cigarettes as previously.

      During the third visit, which will follow two to eight weeks after the second visit, all
      subjects will provide a second blood sample and complete a second fMRI scan session. Both
      groups of participants will complete the same fMRI tasks as they did during the second visit.
