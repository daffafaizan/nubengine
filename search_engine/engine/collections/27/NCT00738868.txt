      Primary

        -  Evaluate local control at 12 months in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma
           of the head and neck treated with cetuximab and stereotactic radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of cutaneous toxicity.

        -  Assess the care and development of skin reactions.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine tumor response at 2 months.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV once weekly for 5 weeks. Patients undergo stereotactic
      radiotherapy 3 times weekly during weeks 2 and 3.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2 months and then every 3 months
      for 2 years.
