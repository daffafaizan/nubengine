    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study assessing the effects
      of an 8-week intervention of wild blueberry powder in young adults with mild to moderate
      depressive symptoms. A total of 66 participants will be randomly assigned to either 22 g
      blueberry powder or a matched placebo powder consumed daily with water. The severity of
      depression, anxiety, and anhedonia will be measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks. In
      addition, we will assess changes in cognitive-emotional function, transient mood, and
      biomarkers of inflammation and neurotransmitter metabolism after 8 weeks as well as acutely
      (2 hours after consuming a single dose).
