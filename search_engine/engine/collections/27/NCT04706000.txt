      practice and have malignant potential. It may be asymptomatic in the clinic or may present
      with abnormal uterine bleeding. Although its pathophysiology has not been clearly revealed,
      there are many studies in the literature about it. However, the autophagy pathway emerges as
      a subject that has never been evaluated. In this study, the investigators would like to
      prospectively evaluate Beclin 1, LC3A / B and p62 markers in the autophagy pathway in
      endometrial polyp tissue samples by immunohistochemistry and reveal their importance.
