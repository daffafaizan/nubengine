      antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies have failed to show any mortality benefit for
      patients with COVID-19. Dexamethasone was shown in prior studies to improve mortality and
      ventilator free days. However, it is unclear what dose of dexamethasone is most beneficial in
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This randomized single center open label clinical trial
      is to evaluate two different doses of dexamethasone (20mg vs. 6mg) on the health outcome for
      hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The intervention arm is dexamethasone 20mg daily for 5
      days, followed by dexamethasone 10mg daily for 5 days. The comparator is dexamethasone 6mg
      daily for 10 days. Three hundred participants will be enrolled. The primary outcome is
      clinical improvement using World Health Organization ordinal scale at day 28.
