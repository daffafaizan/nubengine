      world-wide. The treatment of this disorder is based upon the concept of aneurysm repair prior
      to the presentation of symptoms or rupture. Thus aneurysm repair can be viewed as a
      prophylactic procedure embarked upon to prevent the disastrous complications of a ruptured
      aneurysm. The decision to treat an aneurysm electively is based upon a risk to benefit ratio.
      Treatment options include medical management of co-morbidities (hypertension, pulmonary
      disease, etc.) with observation of the aneurysm, open surgical aneurysm repair through a
      transabdominal or retroperitoneal approach, and endovascular aneurysm repair. The decision to
      intervene is based upon physician judgment. Once the decision to intervene is made, the mode
      of the intervention must be chosen. Although open surgical repair is more invasive and has
      been noted to have a higher morbidity and mortality(1;2) than most endovascular reports, few
      argue with the effectiveness of the procedure. To date, open surgical repair remains the gold
      standard of care for the aneurysm patient. Endovascular repair has several beneficial
      characteristics in comparison to an open surgical approach. They include the potential for
      decreased need for blood transfusions, shorter intensive care unit and total hospital stays,
      the lack of endotracheal intubation, to name a few. However, the procedure requires adequate
      imaging prior to graft placement and during the follow-up period, in addition to the
      availability of a trained team to ensure proper device placement.
