      previously shown to be associated with poor intakes of nutrients in older adults, including
      but not limited to vitamin C, calcium, fibre, protein, zinc and folate. Similar findings have
      been found when poor dentition is defined by the presence of a prosthesis. Reasons for this
      inverse relationship include poor denture quality, reduced chewing capacity, or the
      inadequacy of prosthesis to replace natural teeth.

      However limited studies have looked at how the composition (natural verses prosthetic) of
      functional tooth units is associated with nutrient intake. A cross sectional analysis of a
      cohort of male older adults, participating in an ongoing longitudinal study, was conducted to
      investigate nutrition and oral health associations, including the relationship between the
      composition of functional tooth units and nutrient intake.
