      self-selected loading on ulcer occurrence and to establish natural loading behavior following
      diabetic foot ulcer closure.

      Eligible participants will be randomized into a group given specific directions from a
      Therapist to return to walking (i.e. reloading skin following plantar ulceration closure) or
      a group encouraged to slowly return to walking (self-directed re-loading of the skin
      following plantar ulceration closure). Following randomization and instruction for re-loading
      according to group assignment, participants will be assessed every 6 months for walking
      behavior. Participants will be monitored for ulcer recurrence throughout. Participants will
      be followed for up to 18 months.
