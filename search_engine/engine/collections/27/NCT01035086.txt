      binding the bile acids and by increasing the faecal mass. Bile acids, especially the
      secondary bile acids, are potential risk factors for colorectal cancer. A high bile
      acid-binding ability of fibre could lead to lower blood cholesterol concentrations by
      interrupting the enterohepatic circulation. There is evidence that the consumption of lupin
      kernel fibre, containing both soluble and insoluble fibre fractions, may beneficially modify
      bowel health.

      A total of 133 subjects were recruited for this study. Sixty moderate hypercholesterolemic
      volunteers (total cholesterol > 5.2 mmol/L) fulfilled the selection criteria and were
      randomly assigned three groups. Forty-five subjects (mean age of 47 years, 34 women and 20
      men) completed the double-blind, randomized crossover trial.

      The subjects consumed a high-fibre diet containing 25 g fibre (citrus- or lupin fibre) per
      day and a low-fibre diet (placebo) for four weeks each. After baseline, each volunteer had to
      pass all three periods in different order with a two-week wash-out period between each.

      At the end of each intervention period, subjects consumed a standardized diet for three days.
      Furthermore, a quantitative stool collection took place and fasting blood samples were drawn.
