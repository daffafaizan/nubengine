      widespread in various pathological conditions and implantation rates are increasing each year
      worldwide. Previous to implantation it is mandatory to realize a screening in order to assess
      specific electrocardiographic vectors used to analyze cardiac rhythm. In routine practice,
      approximatively 10% of patients are recused for S-ICD device implantation due to failed
      screening 1-3. Causes are mainly abnormalities of R wave (low or high amplitude) and low R/T
      wave ratio. Determinants for screening failure have not yet been clearly studied. Moreover,
      it is a common finding in S-ICD implantation to find variations between pre-implant
      electrograms and electrograms recorded by the device. Variations of R wave amplitude and R/T
      ration are also observed with small variations of electrode positioning prior to
      implantation. It has been also shown that despite initial screening failure, S-ICD could be
      securely performed in some cases 4,5. Patients included in the study will undergo usual
      screening protocol. In case of failure a 2nd screening will be realize with slight electrode
      positioning variations compatible with S-ICD and lead placement. In case of success modality
      of implantation will be decided by physician.

      In case of S-ICD implantation screening data will be compared to post implantation device
      electrograms. A 2 month follow-up will be performed with comparison of a new screening
      procedure with electrodes at the level of sub-cutaneous electrodes.
