    
      Methods: prospective, single arm multicenter clinical trial without entry restrictions on
      plasma HIV-RNA (VL) or CD4 with a planned duration of 52 weeks.

      The primary clinical endpoint is the percentage of subjects with therapeutic success on
      etravirine 400 mg/day (200 mg bid or 400 mg qd) plus 2 active NRTIs after 12 months. Efficacy
      data will be analyzed by on-treatment and by intention-to-treat analyses (noncomplete/missing
      equals failure), considering treatment failure as either treatment interruption whatever the
      reason (adverse events, death, or loss to follow-up) or virological failure, defined as
      inability to suppress the VL to less than 50 copies/ml after 24 weeks on treatment or a
      confirmed VL of more than 200 copies/ml in patients who had previously achieved a viral
      suppression or had an undetectable viral load at inclusion.

      Patients missing two consecutive scheduled visits were considered lost to follow-up. The
      safety and tolerability of the studied medications will be evaluated by means of clinical
      adverse events, physical examination and laboratory results.

      NRTIs prescribed as part of HAART were selected by the responsible physicians on the basis of
      previous antiretroviral treatments and/or genotypic resistance testing.
