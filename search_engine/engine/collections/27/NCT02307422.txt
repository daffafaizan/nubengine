      on angiographically documented CAD and CAD events is conditional on proinflammatory IL-1
      genotypes. This novel paradigm links the etiology of atherogenesis attributed to OxPL and
      Lp(a) from genetics to clinical expression of CAD. ILI has also identified the functional
      IL-1 gene variations that regulate the IL1B gene in a haplotype context and appear to explain
      over-expression of IL-1β, as well as the expression of other inflammatory biomolecules that
      are downstream of IL-1β. The functional IL-1 variants have been combined into patterns that
      have been associated with risk for more severe periodontal disease across multiple
      ethnic/racial populations. It is also important to test this functional genetic pattern for
      similar interactions with OxPL and Lp(a) biomarker levels in association with
      angiographically documented CAD and CAD events. DNA has been extracted from previously
      obtained subject blood samples (1173 subjects; 18 years to 90 years at entry (coronary
      angiography)) at the University General Hospital of Ioannina, Greece study site. DNAs will be
      labeled by anonymized subject ID # (de-identified), and shipped to ILI for genotyping and
      genetic analysis. Phase II will determine whether other gene variations (SNPs) previously
      shown in the literature to be associated with CAD and/or CAD-related secondary events can be
      validated in this study population.
