    
      The purpose of this protocol is to carry out laboratory studies concerning the
      immunopathogenesis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVI) and related primary humoral
      immunodeficiency diseases. Additionally, we aim to document and track the progression of
      known complications of this primary immunodeficiency. Complications associated with CVID
      include recurrent respiratory, and gastrointestinal bacterial infections, pulmonary
      insufficiency, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, lymphoid malignancy, and various autoimmune
      manifestations.

      Patients with CVI and related B Cell immunodeficiencies will be enrolled into this natural
      history study. Protocol procedures will include baseline measurements of and changes in lab
      and radiographic studies. First or second degree genetically related family members (limited
      to mother, father, siblings, grandparents, children, aunts, uncles and first cousins of an
      affected patient) may also be screened for clinical, in vitro and genetic correlates of
      immune

      abnormalities. Changes in the patients clinical state will be measured to determine the

      precursors of disease complications. This may lead to developments in improving preventive

      measures and novel treatment options for this population.
