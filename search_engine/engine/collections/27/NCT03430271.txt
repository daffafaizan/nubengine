      remain independent in the community and have higher rates of chronic disease, falls and
      mortality. Recent results from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE)
      study demonstrated that a structured program of physical activity (PA) reduced the onset of
      major mobility disability in at-risk older adults by up to 28% over a 2.6 year period.
      Despite the public health significance of this study, to-date no study has attempted to
      translate LIFE PA to broader populations of at-risk older adults in community-based settings.
      To address this knowledge gap, and to aid the design of a larger pragmatic trial of LIFE PA
      in community-based settings, the investigators conducted the ENhancing independence using
      Group-based community interventions for healthy AGing in Elders (ENGAGE) pilot study. The
      investigators examined the safety and feasibility of translating LIFE PA into the existing
      infrastructure of a community-based senior center. The investigators also explored the
      preliminary real-world effectiveness of PA on physical performance and several other
      important health related outcomes for older persons, including cognitive function, quality of
      life, depressive symptoms and frequency of falling.
