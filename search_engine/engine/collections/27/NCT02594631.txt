      bladder will be randomly assigned to receive treatment either by extracorporeal shock wave
      lithotripsy or by endoscopic visual cystolitholapaxy where patients and stone characteristics
      will be recorded and the outcome including the intraoperative and postoperative complications
      and the stone free rate will be also evaluated
