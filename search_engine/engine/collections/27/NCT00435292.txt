      study in subjects with moderate-severe OA. Subjects will be randomized to receive flavocoxid
      250 mg bid, flavocoxid 500 mg bid, naproxen 500 mg bid or placebo in a 2:2:2:1 ratio.
      Subjects will take study materials twice daily for twelve (12) weeks. After the 12 week visit
      subjects in the placebo arm will be re-randomized to the two flavocoxid arms. All subjects
      will then continue on the study for an additional 12 weeks.

      Subjects will keep a diary noting date of onset of symptom change (better or worse), adverse
      events and cost of all aspects of medical care related directly or indirectly to
      osteoarthritis.

      Laboratory studies for inflammatory markers will be drawn and archived at baseline and at the
      12 week visit. In addition, a subgroup of subjects will have arthrocenteses performed at
      baseline and the 12 week visit and the synovial fluid archived for study of intra-articular
      inflammatory markers.
