      consent form, this placebo-controlled, crossover study involved patients with Sj√∂gren's
      syndrome to use oral pilocarpine or placebo for ten weeks and after two weeks of medication
      withdrawal, to invert the treatment for the same period of time. The assessments applied were
      the Ocular Surface Disease Index, NEI-VFQ-25 questionnaire, non-invasive break-up time,
      traditional break-up time, evaluation of the cornea and ocular surface with fluorescein and
      rose bengal dyes, Schirmer test, and tear ferning test. Side effects observed during the
      treatment period were also assessed.
