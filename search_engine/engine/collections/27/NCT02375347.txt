    
      Short-term active feeding study:

      The investigators will provide various chickpea products to participants for a 14 day
      chickpea enhanced diet. Subjects will receive specific meal plan instructions for the
      consumption of 5 servings/week of chickpeas. Chickpea products will be sourced from
      commercial providers. While participants will be told to substitute chickpea products for
      other diet ingredients, the subjects will be free to choose what to substitute according to
      their preferences. Subjects will keep daily food records and will be told that chickpea
      consumption will be monitored in their fecal samples (qPCR). Fecal samples will be collected
      before the start (Day 1), during (Day 7-9) and at the end (Day 14) of the intervention using
      a stool collection kit (Sigma). Participants will complete our GI health questionnaire on a
      weekly basis to determine tolerance to increased chickpea intake. An open ended questionnaire
      will be administered after participants have completed the short-term study protocol to
      assess any issues with compliance to chickpea intake. All individuals that increased their
      chickpea intake from their usual diet by at least 3 servings/week will be included in the
      analysis.
