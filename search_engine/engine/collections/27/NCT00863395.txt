      malignant CD4+ T-cells of CTCL accumulate in the epidermis and are in close proximity to the
      neural, immune and vascular systems that influence and regulate the biology of the skin. The
      close proximity of malignant CD4+ T-cells with the key mediators in the itch process could
      result in the pruritus experienced by patients with CTCL. To accomplish this we are
      collecting and examining skin biopsies for CTCL patients and healthy controls to identify
      itch-associated local biomarkers of the disease. In addition to these skin biopsies, we are
      retrospectively examining existing paraffin-embedded skin biopsy tissue blocks from CTCL
      patients. We are performing comparative and quantitative immunohistochemical analyses on the
      samples. This study will help to determine which components in the skin are potential key
      players in the manifestation and maintenance of recalcitrant pruritus in patients with CTCL.
