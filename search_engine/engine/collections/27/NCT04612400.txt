      a continuous oral sip-feeding of stable isotope tracer method for the evaluation of
      whole-body protein metabolism. This method will be evaluated using two different amounts of
      an essential amino acid (EAA) + whey protein supplement on up to six younger, healthy
      subjects. Stable isotope preparations will be continuously consumed by subjects throughout
      visits 2 and 3 to enable whole body protein metabolism to be measured.
