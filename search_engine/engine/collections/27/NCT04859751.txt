      women. The usual first treatment for NMIBC (Ta, T1,and CIS) is transurethral resection of the
      bladder tumors followed by intravesical immunotherapy, most commonly with bacillus
      Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG).

      Because of the high risk for development of muscle invasive disease, cystectomy is
      recommended for CIS and high-grade Ta and T1 patients who experience disease recurrence
      following intravesical therapy. For patients unable or unwilling to undergo cystectomy,
      treatment options are limited.

      VB4-845 injection is a recombinant fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) that
      expresses a humanized single-chain antibody fragment specific for the epithelial cell
      adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antigen linked to exotoxin A (ETA[252-608]). Once bound to the
      EpCAM antigen on the surface of carcinoma cells, Vicinium is internalized through an
      endocytic pathway. The ETA(252-608) is cleaved off and induces cell death by irreversibly
      blocking protein synthesis.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter bridging study in Chinese patients with
      NMIBC, specifically CIS (with or without papillary disease), high-grade Ta or any grade T1
      papillary disease, who have previously failed BCG treatment (i.e., not those who are
      intolerant) with or without interferon. The study consists of a Screening period, a 12-week
      Induction Phase, and a Maintenance Phase of up to 21 monthly cycles for a total treatment
      period of up to104 weeks.
