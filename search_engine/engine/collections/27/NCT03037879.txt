    
      104 individuals with SCI will be recruited for eligibility to participate in the study.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=26 per group) story memory technique
      (mSMT), mSMT control, speed of processing training (SPT) and SPT control.

      The study involves 14 visits spread over 8 months. A screening visit, lasting approximately 1
      hour. 3 testing sessions lasting 3-4 hours each (Baseline, Immediate and Long-term
      follow-ups), and 10 intervention sessions that will last approximately 45 minutes each.

      Screening: Prior to enrollment in the study protocol, all potential subjects will undergo
      cognitive screening to determine eligibility for participation.

      Baseline: After passing screening, subjects will be scheduled for the baseline evaluation
      comprised of a cardiovascular/cerebrovascular assessment and cognitive evaluation.

      Intervention: Subjects will undergo 10 sessions of training in one of the 4 randomized
      groups.

      Immediate Follow-up Assessment: Subjects will undergo a repeat of the baseline assessments
      upon completion of the intervention protocol to document changes in PS, LM, BP and CBF
      following treatment.

      Long-Term Follow-up: Subjects will be asked to return to the laboratory 6 months following
      the intervention for evaluation of the maintenance of the treatment effect over time.
      Baseline and Immediate follow-up measures of PS, LM, BP and CBF will be documented.
