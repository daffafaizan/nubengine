      address footwear use among women lower limb prosthesis users. Responses from sixty women with
      a lower extremity amputation will be targeted. VA participants will be identified by the
      MVAHCS. These potential participants will receive the IRB-approved survey via mail. Eligible
      participants include women with unilateral or bilateral lower extremity amputations.

      The questionnaire will target the types of footwear worn by prosthesis users and the types of
      footwear desired to be worn. It will also capture the various types of prosthetic feet worn
      in each footwear category, amputation type, time spent walking in a prosthetic device, and
      general satisfaction with the prosthesis function during daily living when worn with shoes.
