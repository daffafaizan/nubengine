      efficacy of infrared laser moxibustion (ILM) and sham ILM (SILM) compared to waitlist control
      (WLC) for moderately to severely fatigued BCS. The two intervention groups will receive
      real/sham infrared laser moxibustion on four acupoints (e.g. ST36 (bilateral), CV4, and CV6)
      for 20 minutes each session for six weeks (two times per week). The primary endpoint is the
      change in fatigue scores from Baseline to Week 6 as measured by the Chinese version of the
      Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI-C). Our secondary aims are to compare the severity of
      comorbidities (e.g. depression, insomnia, and pain) and biological outcomes (e.g. telomere
      length) among the three groups.
