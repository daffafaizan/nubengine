    
      Nephrolithiasis, also called kidney stone disease, occurs in patients with genetic
      susceptibility and who may have a broad spectrum of metabolic disorders and other comorbid
      conditions (for example obesity or diabetes). These renal stones develop as a result of
      supersaturation. Calcium oxalate (CaOx) is the most common type of stone. Reducing the
      urinary excretion of uric acid is an established approach for the treatment of CaOx kidney
      stones.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate treatment with febuxostat compared to allopurinol
      or placebo in the reduction of 24-hour urine uric acid (uUA) excretion levels in
      hyperuricosuric patients with a recent history of renal stones and the presence of at least
      one CaOx stone larger than or equal to 3 mm as seen on Multidetector Computed Tomographic
      Angiography (MDCT).

      Participants in this study will be required to make 4 office visits provide 3 urine samples
      and undergo 2 MDCT scans (a type of x-ray) of their kidneys.
