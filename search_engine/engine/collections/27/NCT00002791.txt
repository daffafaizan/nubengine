      neoadjuvant mesna/doxorubicin/ifosfamide/dacarbazine (MAID) plus radiotherapy in a
      cooperative group setting exhibit a response rate, toxicity, and complication rate comparable
      to those seen in pilot data collected by the Massachusetts General Hospital. II. Assess local
      control and local complications related to surgery and neoadjuvant MAID plus radiotherapy in
      these patients. III. Develop a tissue repository of frozen STS for ancillary genetic and flow
      cytometric analysis of these tumors. IV. Form an Intergroup Working Sarcoma Group that will
      develop a patient base, relationships, and support for the future development and completion
      of a phase III study of adjuvant therapy for STS.

      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 DTIC Dacarbazine,
      NSC-45388 EBRT External-Beam Radiotherapy (equipment unspecified) G-CSF Filgrastim;
      Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 IFF Ifosfamide, NSC-109724 MAID
      Mesna/DOX/IFF/DTIC Mesna Mercaptoethane sulfonate, NSC-113891 3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy
      plus Radiotherapy followed by Surgery followed, if indicated, by Radiotherapy followed by
      3-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. MAID; plus EBRT to the primary tumor and suspected
      microscopic disease; followed by minimal wide surgical excision; followed, if positive
      margins, by postoperative EBRT; followed by MAID.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 60 patients accrued into this study within 15 months.
