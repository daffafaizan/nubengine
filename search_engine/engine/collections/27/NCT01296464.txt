    
      This is a randomised, double-blind, 3-period crossover study comparing the effects of a
      single dose of two L/C/E treatment regimens (A and B) and standard L/C/E treatment regimen
      (Stalevo) on the duration of motor response in PD patients with wearing-off symptoms after
      the first morning dose of levodopa.

      The study consists of a screening visit, 3 treatment visits and an end-of-study visit. Within
      14 days of the screening visit, the patients will receive a single morning dose of study drug
      (either of the two L/C/E treatment regimens) or Stalevo. The order of the 3 treatment periods
      will be randomised according to a crossover design and the duration of each period is 2 days,
      followed by a wash-out period (1-9 days) during which the patients will be on their
      individual standard PD treatment.

      Before each study day, patients will arrive at the study centre in the previous evening. The
      patients' own standard PD treatments will be discontinued at the latest by 22:00 to be
      continued after completion of the motor part (part III) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale (UPDRS III) next day. After completion of the UPDRS III, patients will return to
      their own standard PD treatments. Duration of the study will be 2 to 7 weeks per patient,
      depending on the length of the screening and wash-out periods.
