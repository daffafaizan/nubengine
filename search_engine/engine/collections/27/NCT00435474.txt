    
      Objective: To investigate whether treatment for cancer patients with malignant wounds can
      improve (wound healing/wound size, odor, infection, seepage, pain) through comparing the
      effects of two multidimensional interventions:

        1. wound treatment (silver product, alginate and foam dressing >< honey product, alginate
           and foam dressing) in combination with,

        2. psycho-social support (based on the structure in cognitive therapy) and

        3. relaxation therapy.

      Furthermore to investigate coping strategies, body image, stigma and quality of life in
      cancer patients with malignant wounds.

      Design: A hypothesis testing prospective randomized clinical intervention study (n=70) and an
      explorative qualitative interview study

      Method: Digital photographing, measurement of wound size with Quantify-Image-One, wound
      morphology registration (the extent of malodour, infection, seepage, bleeding, pain, the
      healing process), grafting, VAS-score, quality of life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30, DLQI),
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC), interview.

      Patients will fill out a diary focusing on wound related problems.

      Perspectives: The results will determine whether the honey treatment is an improvement, and
      whether the silver treatment has statistical and clinical significance.

      The qualitative study will contribute new knowledge about conditions of life for cancer
      patients with cancer wounds, their feelings and impositions.

      In spite of proving positive effect, the project will contribute with new required knowledge
      on treatment and support for cancer patients suffering from malignant wounds.
