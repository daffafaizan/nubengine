      health intervention for traumatized asylum seekers. Aim I: The investigators predicted that,
      relative to a waitlist control condition, MBTR-R will lead to improved stress-and
      trauma-related mental health outcomes, including lower levels and rates of posttraumatic
      stress, depression, anxiety, and improved subjective well-being at post-intervention and
      5-week follow-up. Aim II: The investigators aimed to test, whether relative to the
      waitlist-control condition, MBTR-R was safe and thus not associated with participant-level
      clinically significant deterioration in any of the monitored primary mental health outcomes
      at post-intervention or at follow-up. In the event of adverse responding, the investigators
      planned to test whether key demographic factors or pre-existing vulnerability factors at
      pre-intervention that may predict participant-level deterioration or adverse responding to
      the intervention - so as to identify candidate contraindications for MBTR-R. Aim III: The
      investigators predicted that, relative to a waitlist control condition, MBTR-R will lead to
      changes in psycho-behavioral processes targeted by the intervention and implicated in
      vulnerability at pre-intervention, from pre-to-post intervention, measured in controlled
      behavioral and cognitive-experimental lab tasks or experience sampling measures, including
      measures of (a) self-compassion and self-criticism, (b) self-referential processing of fear,
      (c) avoidance, (d) emotional reactivity to trauma-related information and autobiographical
      memory, (e) impaired executive functions of trauma-related information processing in working
      memory. Aim IV: The investigators aimed to test whether, among the MBTR-R group,
      pre-to-post-intervention change and pre-intervention to follow-up change in mental health
      outcomes (Aim I) will be predicted or mediated by pre-to-post intervention change in the
      targeted psycho-behavioral processes.
