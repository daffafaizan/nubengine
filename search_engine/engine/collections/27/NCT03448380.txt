      daily blood glucose monitoring to manage their diabetes, will be enrolled to obtain at least
      736 subjects who complete the final visit. Subjects will utilize capillary SMBG for managing
      diabetes for 6 months (control phase) followed by diabetes management using FreeStyle Libre
      for 6 months (intervention phase). Subjects will maintain a diary/log book of Adverse Events
      during each phase. Assessment of Adverse Events will occur via self reporting at each monthly
      visit and/or phone call.
