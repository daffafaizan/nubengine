    
      Qualitative pilot study of patient' views of their experiences with antiviral treatment for
      hepatitis C. Two groups of patients will be sampled: nine who completed a 24 or 48 week
      course of treatment and nine who withdrew from treatment prior to planned end. Interview data
      will be analyzed using narrative and grounded theory methods to identify attributes of
      treatment experience that may discriminate between completion and withdrawal.
