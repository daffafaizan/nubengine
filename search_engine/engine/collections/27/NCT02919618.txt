      invasive catheter ablation) have limited options, with one-year survival below 20%.
      Preclinical data demonstrate that single fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to
      discrete portions of the heart is feasible and may result in a reduction or elimination of
      VT. The efficacy may be further improved when guided by cardiac electrophysiologic (EP)
      testing. In total, the mapping and ablation proposed for this EP-guided Noninvasive Cardiac
      Radioablation (ENCORE) is a rapid and totally non-invasive method. Overall safety and early
      efficacy of ENCORE have not been rigorously studied in a prospective trial to-date. The
      purpose of this phase I/II study is to demonstrate the short-term safety and preliminary
      efficacy of ENCORE for patients with life-threatening, treatment-refractory VT.
