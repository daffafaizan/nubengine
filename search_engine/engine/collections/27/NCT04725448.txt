      category of non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), accounting for about 0.3%-1.3% of lung cancers
      .Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the standard adjuvant chemotherapy and palliative
      chemotherapy for NSCLC, and it is also commonly used for PSC. Advanced PSC has a low response
      rate to systemic chemotherapy and a short duration of curative effect. The primary
      progression rate of aggressive platinum-based chemotherapy is 60%-70%, showing that PSC is
      highly resistant to multiple chemotherapeutics. In recent years, the progress of targeting
      MET tyrosine kinase mutations has been relatively rapid, but most of the mutant PSCs
      targeting EGFR, KRAS, ALK, and BRAF V600E are case reports and there is no effective
      treatments. Immunotherapy has rewritten the treatment pattern of NSCLC. However, the current
      application of immunotherapy in PSC are mostly case reports. In immunotherapy, IMpower150
      research data suggests that the combination of immunity and anti-angiogenesis +
      platinum-containing dual-agent chemotherapy can bring sustained OS benefits in NSCLC patients
      , and safety tolerated. However, PSC has moderate to high tumor mutation burden (TMB >10
      mutations/Mb). This high mutation rate may increase tumor immunogenicity, making
      immunotherapy a better treatment option. At the same time, VEGF, as a cytokine that promotes
      the growth and differentiation of vascular endothelial cells, plays a decisive role in
      promoting tumor neovascularization. In this regard, immunotherapy combined with
      anti-angiogenesis and chemotherapy is worth exploring in the treatment of PSC.
