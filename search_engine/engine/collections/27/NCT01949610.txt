    
      This is a single-dose, 1-arm (group), open-label study (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) in healthy adult male participants. On Day 1, after completing a 10-hour
      overnight fast, participants will receive a single oral dose of 14C-JNJ-26489112 1,000 mg as
      a 10-mL suspension. Participants will be recruited in 2 cohorts. The 6 participants in the
      first cohort were dosed in error with doses less than 1000 mg. So, an additional cohort of 4
      participants will be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of 1000 mg 14C-JNJ 26489112.
      Total 10 participants will receive the study medication. Safety will be assessed by
      monitoring vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory
      tests throughout the study. The total duration of the study for each participant will be
      approximately 5 weeks (including up to 3 weeks for screening and 11 to 15 days of study) or
      up to 1 additional week for participants who excrete 14C-JNJ26489112 more slowly.
