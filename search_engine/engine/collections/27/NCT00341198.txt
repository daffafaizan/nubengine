      autoimmune diseases. However, associations between autoimmune diseases and farming have not
      been extensively investigated, and exposure data in the currently available studies is
      extremely limited. One of the major challenges in conducting population-based research on
      autoimmune diseases is case ascertainment. Self-report of previous diagnosis has been shown
      to be very unreliable. This protocol outlines a strategy to confirm self-reported diagnoses
      of systemic autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
      scleroderma, and Sjogren syndrome) within the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort. The
      confirmed cases will constitute a refined case group to allow etiologic analyses of
      pesticides and other farming-related exposures as possible risk factors for these diseases
      using data that have already been collected. The codes can also be used in a nested
      case-control study that could be designed to collect additional exposure data (for example,
      on silica-related exposures).
