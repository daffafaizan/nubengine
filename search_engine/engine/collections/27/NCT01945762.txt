    
      This is a multinational, multicenter, non-interventional (observational) and prospective
      study. European countries where vandetanib is on the market will participate in the study.

      This study is being conducted to fulfil the specific obligation post-authorisation measure
      for the conditional marketing authorisation. It is carried on to confirm in real life
      conditions the benefit/risk of vandetanib (CAPRELSA™) 300 mg, both in RET negative and RET
      positive patients with symptomatic, aggressive, sporadic, unresectable, locally
      advanced/metastatic MTC. The clinical benefit of vandetanib (CAPRELSA™) 300 mg has previously
      been established in a clinical trial (Study 58) on the basis of a clinically and
      statistically significant advantage in progression free survival (PFS) which was supported by
      a high response rate and substantial duration of response.
