      ß-carotene in a gram of dry rice (12). Since the vitamin A equivalency varies from 2 ug (oil
      dose) to 27 ug (vegetable) carotene to 1 retinol equivalent and the equivalency is matrix
      dependent, it is necessary to know what the vitamin A equivalency of golden rice
      beta-carotene is. The determination of the absorption and conversion of golden rice
      beta-carotene is of importance for designing food programs in many rice-eating regions of the
      world, where vitamin A deficiency is common.

      To evaluate the absorption and intestinal conversion of rice beta-carotene after an acute
      dose of golden rice, an intrinsically labeled Golden Rice with a labeled reference dose of
      vitamin A are used. We propose to conduct a pilot study on the US adults with normal vitamin
      A status (n = 15).

      The specific aims of this pilot study are:

        1. To determine ß-carotene response kinetics following a meal of golden rice with 0, 5, or
           10 g fat (butter);

        2. To determine retinol kinetics from the golden rice and from the labeled vitamin A dose;

        3. To determine vitamin A value of golden rice ß-carotene in adults with normal vitamin A
           status. The determination of the absorption and conversion of golden rice ß-carotene is
           of importance for designing food programs in many rice-eating regions of the world,
           where vitamin A deficiency is common.
