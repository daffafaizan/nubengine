      Surgical treatment reliefs pain and improves fertility by radically removing endometriotic
      lesions. However, peritoneal endometriotic lesions may vary significantly in their appearance
      in standard white light laparoscopy and therefore may be difficult to be identified. Because
      endometriosis is associated with hypervascularisation the visualization of tissue perfusion
      by additional use of near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG)
      may improve the detection of peritoneal endometriotic lesions.
