    
      The study is designed as a longitudinal observational study addressed to identify the effects
      of Tat protein and humoral/cellular anti-Tat immune responses (induced in the natural
      infection or by Tat vaccination) in HIV-1 reservoir dynamics in blood of HIV infected
      patients receiving cART. HIV DNA data will be used for analyzing the decay dynamics.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the rate of decay of total HIV DNA in
      blood of anti-Tat antibody (Ab) positive versus anti-Tat Ab negative HIV patients receiving
      cART.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to relate the HIV DNA decay data to:

        1. the persistence of anti-Tat humoral responses;

        2. biomarkers of HIV reservoir stability potentially affected by the Tat protein or
           anti-Tat immune responses, including: i) apoptotic/survival index of CD4+ T cells; ii)
           reactivation dynamics of latent HIV in resting CD4+ T cells upon exposure to Tat protein
           and/or activation stimuli; iii) cellular and humoral biomarkers relevant to inflammation
           and immune dysregulation.
