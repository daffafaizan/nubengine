      combination of counseling by peer weight coaches and portion-controlled foods. Second, the
      study will test the effect of varying the "dose" of portion-controlled foods provided to
      patients by randomly assigning individuals to receive half or all of the food required to
      follow a meal replacement regimen. The primary endpoint of the study will be weight change.
      Secondary endpoints will include adherence to the recommended eating plan, health-related
      quality of life, as well as changes in waist circumference and blood pressure. The provision
      of "half-dose" portion-controlled foods (1 meal per day) is hypothesized to be non-inferior
      to provision of "full-dose" (2 meals per day). The goal of non-inferiority is important
      because it can demonstrate that health care payers wishing to support weight loss programs
      can achieve equivalent results at a lower cost. All patients have the choice regarding their
      use of portion-controlled foods in the study, and no patients will be asked to leave the
      study because of non-adherence.
