      Fentanyl 0.05mg, the vital signs will be closely monitored by physiological monitor (PHILIPS
      SureSigns VM6). The treatment will be terminated immediately if unstable vital sign detected
      or if patient asks for termination. The pH value of gastric juice will be measured with the
      pH test strips. and the he gastric mucus is irrigated with acetylcysteine solution. The
      investigators randomly assigned medicaments containing different antibiotic powders either
      Tetracycline 2g, Metronidazole 2g, and Bismuth 480mg (Group A) or Amoxicillin 3g,
      Metronidazole 2g, and Clarithromycin 1g (Group B) to dispense on the surface of gastric
      mucosa and duodenal mucosa of duodenal bulb. After the intraluminal therapy, patients will
      rest for 30 to 60 minutes and go home if the effect of sedation subsided. Patients can take
      meal if no abdominal discomfort. C13-Urea breath test (UBT) will be used to assess the
      existence of H. pylori 2 weeks after the intraluminal therapy. Patients failed to achieve
      intraluminal eradication of H. pylori will be assigned to 7-day concomitant therapy (Group A)
      or 7-day bismuth quadruple therapy (Group B). The C13-UBT will be used to assess the
      existence of H. pylori 4 weeks after the oral antibiotic therapy. The overall eradication
      rates of the intraluminal therapy plus the oral antibiotics therapies will be evaluated.
