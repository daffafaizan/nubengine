      receive general anesthesia and brachial plexus block. Patients will be randomly allocated
      into two groups. Study and control group received propofol target-controlled infusion (TCI)
      and inhaled anesthetics as anesthesia maintenance, respectively. Main outcomes will be
      assessed by perioperative blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2,
      analgesics dosage, pain intensity and perioperative adverse events.
