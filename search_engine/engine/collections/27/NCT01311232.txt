        -  Laboratory parameters defining HBV status/activity at time of treatment initiation

        -  Lymphoma stage at rituximab treatment initiation (Ann Arbor, B-symptoms, bone marrow
           involvement, IPI, ECOG-score, LDH)

        -  Immunochemotherapy regimen (treatment line, rituximab dose and cycle)

        -  Disease status at time of HBV reactivation

        -  Antiviral prophylaxis (medication, dose, duration at time at time of reactivation)

        -  Patient demographics (age, gender, residence, ethnic origin, smoking status, alcohol
           consumption and occupation)

      Time to Hepatitis B virus reactivation

        -  The time from start of rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy until first evidence of
           HBV reactivation meeting the criteria

        -  Description of prophylaxis and treatment with antiviral medication HBV vaccination Time
           of initiation of antiviral therapy of prophylaxis relating to clinical or laboratory
           signs of possible HBV reactivation Anti-viral medication used in prophylaxis or therapy

        -  Description of outcomes Outcomes of the HBV reactivation Outcomes of the
           rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy Demographics and previous infection history:
           Age, gender, nationality, race, social history, past medical history

        -  Parameters associated with lymphomas: Ann Arbor stage, number of extranodal involvement,
           serum LDH, serum Î²2-microglobulin, ECOG performance status, presence of B symptoms,
           International Prognostic Index, bone marrow invasion

      antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe),
      serum HBV DNA

        -  Lymphoma treatment history:

      Line of treatment (first line, second line), rituximab and chemotherapy administration (dose,
      schedule), start date, last treatment date

        -  Prophylaxis or treatment against HBV reactivation:

      antiviral drug (dose, schedule, duration)

        -  Hepatitis B virus reactivation:
