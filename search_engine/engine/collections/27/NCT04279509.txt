      can be used as an adjunct tool to aid treatment selection in patients with cancer. Using the
      IRS, drugs with high IRS (defined as a score of 70% and above) will have a high probability
      of inducing objective response (either a complete or partial response by RECIST criteria) in
      patients with refractory cancers. Conversely, IRS of drugs for which the patients have been
      treated and experienced clinical progression on will be low (defined as a score of 50% or
      below).

      Primary Objectives

      -To prospectively determine if a high-throughput drug screen assay using patient
      tumour-derived organoids can accurately select a chemotherapeutic agent that results in
      objective response in patients with refractory solid tumours

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the IRS measured on tumour-derived organoid drug screen assay of
           chemotherapeutic agents to which patients had previously progressed on clinically

        -  To assess changes in IRS pre and post-chemotherapy treatment
