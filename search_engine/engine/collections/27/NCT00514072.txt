      Primary

        -  To determine whether ONY-P1 vaccine can increase the time to PSA-defined progression in
           patients with androgen-dependent stage D0 prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate all toxicities related to ONY-P1 vaccine.

        -  To compare the immunologic response in patients treated with ONY-P1 vaccine vs placebo.

        -  To evaluate PSA kinetics (doubling time/velocity) of treatment.

        -  To evaluate time to testosterone recovery following limited androgen ablation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to estimated PSA doubling time (< 12 months vs â‰¥
      12 months).

      Patients receive goserelin subcutaneously once. Approximately 3 months later, patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive ONY-P1 vaccine with BCG intradermally on days 1 and 15. Patients
           then receive ONY-P1 vaccine alone on day 29 and then every 4 weeks for up to 12 months
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo vaccine intradermally on days 1, 15, and 29 and then
           every 4 weeks for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 15 years.
