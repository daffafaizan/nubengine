      Compared to patients with early-stage disease, those with advanced cancer report higher
      levels of pain and greater functional impairment related to pain. There is a critical need
      for psychosocial pain management interventions that are specifically designed to address the
      suffering of patients with advanced cancer. The proposed study seeks to develop and assess
      the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a novel integration of pain
      coping skills training and meaning-centered psychotherapy for patients with advanced cancer
      and moderate-to-severe pain.
