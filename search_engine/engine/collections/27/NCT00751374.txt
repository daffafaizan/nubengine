      exit site infection in peritoneal dialysis patient. Previous data has shown the superiority
      of gentamicin cream over the mupirocin cream in this aspect. However, the efficacy of the
      combination therapy using gentamicin cream alternating with mupirocin cream has not been
      tested. There is a potention benefit of reducing drug resistant strain in the combination
      group theoretically.
