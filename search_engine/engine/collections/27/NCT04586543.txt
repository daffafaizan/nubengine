      objective of this phase II, randomized, controlled, open label study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of MAO-B (Monoamine oxidases-B) inhibitor selegiline plus docetaxel
      therapy. Patients diagnosed with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate adenocarcinoma are
      randomly divided into two groups. One group (control arm) receives docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV
      every 3 weeks for maximum of 12 cycles). Another group (experimental arm) receives docetaxel
      (75 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks for maximum of 12 cycles) plus selegiline (daily 10 mg tablet).
      Patients are followed up for 36 months or until the end of the trial, death or withdraw from
      this study due to other reasons. The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of
      patients without progression at month 9. The secondary endpoint is proportion of patients
      without progression at month 12/18, progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of
      PSA response, radiological response rate, PSA response rate, health-related quality of life
      and safety.
