      Fistula (DAVF): (1) the surgical approach consisting of craniotomy and ligation of the vein
      and (2) the endovascular approach with embolization of shunting zone. Onyx™ (EVOH (Ethylene
      Vinyl Alcohol) in solution in an organic solvent, DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide), is the main
      embolic agent used for the endovascular treatment of DAVF. During the occlusion procedure
      with Onyx™, residual malformed compartments become gradually less visible on x-ray to the
      operator, due to the high radiopacity of Onyx™, resulting in a potential risk during
      treatment. Moreover, viscosity is frequently not as low as required to penetrate the
      shunt.Thus, development a new embolization system with lower radiopacity and lower viscosity
      to achieve improved occlusion is needed. SQUID™ is a new liquid embolic agent, with variable
      radiopacity and viscosity. The purpose of this study is assessment of safety, efficacy, and
      short-term outcome of SQUID™ in the embolization of DAVFs .
