    
      Definitions:

      Heart failure can be defined as an abnormality of cardiac structure or function leading to
      failure of the heart to deliver oxygen at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the
      metabolizing tissues, despite normal filling pressures (or only at the expense of increased
      filling pressures).

      Acute decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF), is defined according to Framingham criteria as a
      change in symptoms and signs in the context of heart failure. For this study we define this
      as an acute change in symptoms and signs within the previous 24 hours.

      In the New York Heart Association classification (NYHA), Class I: no limitation is
      experienced in any activities; there are no symptoms from ordinary activities.; Class II:
      slight, mild limitation of activity; the patient is comfortable at rest or with mild
      exertion.; Class III: marked limitation of any activity; the patient is comfortable only at
      rest.; Class IV: any physical activity brings on discomfort and symptoms occur at rest.
