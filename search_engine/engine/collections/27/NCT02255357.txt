      dependence, increases the sensitivity of the Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis and CNS
      stress pathways to vasopressin. For their part, oxytocin systems, in chronic stress, acquire
      an increasing moderating effect on CNS stress system and the HPA axis. Cocaine dependence
      generates increased responsivity of stress system to oxytocin in the face of depleted
      oxytocin stores; thus creating an environment where exogenous oxytocin could exert a strong
      regulatory effect. Intranasal administration provides a convenient method to deliver these
      small peptides to the brain. Studying the feasibility of this approach, and its applicability
      to the treatment of cocaine-dependent patients, will be a goal of the study. The main outcome
      of this study will be the number of consecutive days of abstinence from cocaine after
      abstinence induction. A secondary outcome will be: Is the acute effect of intranasal oxytocin
      on desmopressin-induced ACTH secretion associated with the number of days of continued
      abstinence.
