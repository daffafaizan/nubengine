      Asian population. First-time insertion success rate was lower and more time was required to
      achieve an effective airway even in well-trained physician. A number of techniques have been
      described to improve the insertion success rate. However, these techniques are only
      recommended to be used as backup when the digital or introducer tool techniques fail. We
      hypothesized that insertion of ProSeal laryngeal mask airway with 90-degree rotation would
      reduce the contact surface between the device and pharyngeal wall and make it easy to advance
      the device over the smooth angle against the posterior pharyngeal wall.We compared the
      success rate and incidence of complication of the standard technique with the rotational
      technique.
