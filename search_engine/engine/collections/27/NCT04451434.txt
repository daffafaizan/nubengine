      participants of Japanese descent.

      On Day 1 of each period, participants will receive a single oral dose of 200 milligrams (mg)
      danicopan under fasting conditions, 200 mg danicopan under fed conditions, or 400 mg
      danicopan under fed conditions. Participants will receive each treatment once, according to
      the randomization schedule. There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between each
      dose of study intervention.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
