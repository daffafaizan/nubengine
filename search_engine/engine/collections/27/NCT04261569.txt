      preclinical studies, and justify the transfer into a clinical trial. The investigators
      currently have developed and produced implantable devices, to be implanted into the brain
      through a minimally invasive endoventricular route. The electrical energy required is
      supplied by the batteries adapted from those used for deep brain stimulation.

      The feasibility of trans ventricular implantation is ensured by the experience gained by our
      team in the endoventricular stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus in the cluster
      headache.

      In this clinical study, the investigators will evaluate the tolerance and safety of
      intraventricular surgical technic and illumination by the Ev-NIRT medical device implanted
      into the brain of 7 patients with Parkinson's disease. idiopathic, aged 25-65 years, at a
      very early stage (less than 2 years of evolution). The NIR illumination will begin
      immediately after surgery.

      The investigators will also evaluate secondarily, the neuroprotective effect of this new
      treatment modality, by comparing the decrease of dopaminergic neurons by Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET)-scan using [11C]PE2I) tracer of implanted patients to that of a control
      group of 7 patients whose characteristics in terms of duration of evolution and clinical
      severity are identical, but who are not implanted, and therefore not exposed to NIR
      illumination.

      The PET-scan-PE2I exam is conducted in both groups annually for 4 years (a total of 5
      measurements) and compared to the PE2I PET obtained at the beginning of participation in the
      study. A group-wide comparison will be made between the NIR group and the control group.
