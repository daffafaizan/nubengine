      I. Test the feasibility of Witness CARES (WC) Services to achieve colorectal carcinoma (CRC)
      screening for non-adherent Medicaid clients.

      II. Develop an algorithm for predicting CRC screening outcomes following intervention
      services.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients who are not prepared for a colonoscopy or stool test receive educational materials,
      messages, and videos electronically or by mail with information about colorectal screening
      and are followed up by phone within 2 weeks. Patients desiring colonoscopy receive navigator
      assistance with obtaining the screening (e.g.,determining gastrointestinal doctor, scheduling
      appointment, prep materials and process, transportation, escort). Patients desiring a stool
      test receive navigator assistance by facilitating fecal tests.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.
