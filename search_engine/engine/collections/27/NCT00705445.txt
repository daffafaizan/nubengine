      up-scaling of zinc supplementation programs to prevent childhood illnesses, such as diarrhea
      and respiratory infections, and its subsequent co-morbid conditions. As the potential
      mechanisms of action of zinc still remains to be established, this trial is proposed to
      evaluate the relationship of intestinal microbial flora, intestinal permeability, morbidity
      patterns and response to various enteric pathogens in a representative birth cohort randomly
      allocated to receive daily zinc and micronutrients from 6-18 months of age, and a control
      population.
