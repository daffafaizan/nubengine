      mortality independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors due to increased vascular
      calcification. Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that hypermagnesemia and
      magnesium supplementation reduce vascular calcification in CKD by increasing
      calcium/phosphate solubility in serum, by inhibiting calcium influx into vascular smooth
      muscle cells (VSMC), by inhibiting intracellular pro-calcification enzymes in VSMC and by
      increasing activity of intracellular anti-calcification enzymes in VSMC. However, there have
      been concerns that any anti-calcification effect of magnesium might also reduce bone mineral
      density, in which case there might be an increased risk of bone fractures associated with
      magnesium supplementation in CKD. We wish to conduct a randomized placebo-controlled
      double-blinded interventional trial to examine whether oral magnesium supplementation will
      reduce vascular calcification in subjects with CKD while not decreasing bone mineral density.
