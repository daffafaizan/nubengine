      Time (KTBUT) and Fluorescein Tear Break Up Time (FTBUT). All qualified study participants had
      their eyes measured for tear break up time measured with a keratometer and with fluorescein
      dye. In this study, we compare the use of the most common method, fluorescein dye, to measure
      tear break up time to a novel method, a keratometer, to measure tear break up time. Using the
      keratometer avoids instilling fluorescein dye into the tear film and not altering the tear
      film's physiologic environment.
