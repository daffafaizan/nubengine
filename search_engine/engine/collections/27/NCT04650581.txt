      (a substance that looks like the study drug but does not have any active or medicinal
      ingredient) plus Fulvestant. The study will provide information about the ability of
      Ipatasertib plus Fulvestrant to control the cancer, the side effects and safety of the
      treatment, how patients feel while taking the treatment and associated costs.
