      effect of 10% strontium chloride associated with photobiomodulation (FBM) on teeth exposed to
      35% hydrogen peroxide during 3 weeks of whitening treatment. Methods: 50 volunteers were
      evaluated by the split mouth model, where the hemiarchy patients were randomized and
      subsequently allocated to one of the experimental groups: PLACEBO (negative control) - group
      with no desensitizing treatment, only bleached; FBM (positive control) - group treated with
      placebo gel and application of the LLLT (Low Level Laser Therapy); ESTRÔNCIO (positive
      control) - group treated with 10% strontium chloride and simulation of LLLT application
      (without light emission); and FBM + ESTRÔNCIO - group treated with LLLT + 10% strontium
      chloride.
