      solution during silicone hydrogel (SiH) contact lens 30-day continuous wear (CW) can mitigate
      increases in corneal epithelial permeability (Pdc) and reduce the risk of mechanical, contact
      lens-induced, inflammatory, and overall adverse events. 161 non-contact lens wearers were fit
      with SiH contact lenses and randomized to either a treatment (n = 81) or control (n = 80)
      group for 30-day CW. Subjects in the treatment group irrigated every morning and whenever
      dryness symptoms occurred; subjects in the control group did not.
