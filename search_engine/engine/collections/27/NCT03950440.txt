      (POD) causing increased morbidity and mortality. This is especially true for the older
      cardiac surgical patient, in whom the incidence of POD is up to 70%. Surgical invasiveness
      and herewith related inflammation, a cholinergic load of medications, postoperative pain or
      use of opioids are examples of precipitating factors that can be altered to reduce the
      incidence of POD. Transaortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a revolutionary technique that has
      led to a dramatic decrease in surgical invasiveness and improved outcomes in high-risk
      surgical patients. However, only a few studies evaluated neurocognitive outcome after
      surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) compared to TAVR, suggesting a reduced incidence of
      POD with TAVR compared to SAVR. In contrast, other studies found almost no difference in POD
      in the aforementioned patient groups. Hence, it remains still unclear which technique best to
      use in patients at high risk for POD.
