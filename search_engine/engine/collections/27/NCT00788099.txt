    
      Phase I Multicenter, Open-label, Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Study of Plitidepsin in
      Combination with Sorafenib or Gemcitabine in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD), the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of these combinations, drug-drug PK interactions, preliminary
      information on the clinical antitumor activity of these combinations in solid tumors,perform
      a preliminary pharmacogenomic (PGx) study of potential biomarkers of sensitivity/resistance
      to these drugs combinations and of prognostic markers of the treatment outcome in tumor
      tissue sample.
