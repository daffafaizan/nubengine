      2. Aerobic exercise (walking on a treadmill), 3. Seated rest (watching educational videos).
      Each activity will be 30 minutes in duration. Immediately before and after the 30 minute
      intervention, participants will undergo psychosocial and cognitive assessments. Prior to the
      intervention, participant's physical activity will be tracked for one week, via a consumer
      grade accelerometer.

      Baseline and post-intervention testing will include a cognitive battery, psychosocial
      questionnaires, flexibility testing and physiological measures.
