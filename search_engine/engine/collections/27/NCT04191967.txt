      Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) or Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women by the 2018
      Kenya national cancer guidelines.32 Data primary from Western countries demonstrate similar
      efficacy for the treatment of precancerous lesions between Cryotherapy and Thermocoagulation.
      Data on safety, acceptability, and efficacy, particularly linked to gold-standard pathology,
      among HIV-positive women in low-resource settings are scare. Given the demonstrated benefits
      over cryotherapy including increased portability and availability hence easier
      implementation, use of thermal coagulation for the treatment of precancerous lesions in low
      resource settings could significantly improve access to treatment compared with cryotherapy.

      This study seeks to fill a critical data gap by evaluating the efficacy of thermocoagulation
      among HIV-positive positive women using gold-standard biopsy for disease verification at
      baseline and follow-up, as indicated. We will also assess the safety and acceptability of
      this treatment modality among patients and providers

      Aim 1: To evaluate the efficacy of thermal coagulation for the treatment of HIV-positive,
      HPV-positive women by assessing rates of HPV persistence and CIN2/3 rate at 12 months after
      treatment

      Aim 2: To evaluate the safety and acceptability of thermal coagulation for treatment of
      abnormal cervical lesions within a screen-and-treat program among HIV-positive women in
      Western Kenya.

      Aim 3: Evaluate provider acceptability of thermal coagulation for the treatment of
      precancerous cervical lesion within a screen-and-treat program in Western Kenya.
