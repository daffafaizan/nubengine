    
      Men who participate in this study will take both metformin and simvastatin every day. Both
      drugs are pills and can be taken at home.

      Subjects will be asked to take metformin and simvastatin until metastasis from their prostate
      cancer appears or until their PSA has doubled from what it was before they started the study.

      Primary Objective:

      To define the efficacy, as measured by an improvement in PSA doubling time (PSADT) at 6
      months, of the combination of metformin plus simvastatin in patients with recurrent prostate
      cancer following definitive treatment.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To define the time to protocol-specified event for men treated with the combination of
           metformin plus simvastatin.

        2. To describe the pattern of change in log PSA levels and PSA velocity over time during
           treatment with metformin plus simvastatin.

        3. To describe the associations between changes in metabolic parameters (fasting
           glucose/insulin/lipid panel/leptin/adiponectin and others) with the pattern of change in
           log PSA levels.
