      in 16,000 deaths because of liver metastasis.

      In case of bilobar metastasis, classic two-stage hepatectomy with portal embolization could
      be performed.

      An alternative to the classic surgery, early two stage hepatectomy, could be proposed to
      simplify the patient's management and to improve the resectability.
