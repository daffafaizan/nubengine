    
      Purposes: 1. Searching for a standard task to measure CT function by Q-LEMG. 2. Correlate the
      data among Q-LEMG activity of CT muscle, lexical tone in Mandarin and vocal cord position and
      its impaction on vocal functions. 3. Detect the influence of lexical tone from conventional
      laryngoplasty for peripheral UVFP with eSLN injury.

      Study designs: The current research is a two-year study. In the first year, the investigators
      will develop a standardized task for quantified LEMG analysis for CT muscles which were
      controlled by eSLN. In the second year, patients with acute UVFP will be enrolled into the
      study. By comprehensive evaluation including Q-LEMG analysis, the impact of injection
      laryngoplasty on tone adjustment can be identified. The results between UVFP with or without
      CT muscle damage will also be compared.

      Predictive outcomes: 1. Developing a standard tool, Q-LEMG, to measure the function CT
      muscles. 2. Achieve the correlation of the neuromuscular control of lexical tone and CT
      muscle. 3. Analyze the impaction of early temporary injection on speech modal tone in
      Mandarin speakers and neuromuscular control in CT muscles. 4. Applying the data of tone and
      CT signals to future pitch controlled artificial electrolarynx animal models.
