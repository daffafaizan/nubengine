      for the treatment of myelopathy and radiculopathy in the cervical spine. A tricortical iliac
      crest bone graft is the traditional inter-body fusion material that can show perfect bony
      fusion and maintain the patency of the neuroforamen. However, donor site complications were
      reported in fusion with an iliac bone graft, such as subcutaneous hematomas, infections, and
      chronic wound pain.

      Currently, the titanium cage and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage are the two most common
      cages in clinical practice. The ideal cage should lead to a high fusion rate and prevent
      complications, such as subsidence and loss of correction.

      Even though a titanium cage can provide long-term stabilization, increase lordosis, and
      increase foramina height compared with the iliac bone graft, some inferior clinical outcomes
      appeared in clinical practice. Loss of correction is a major complication of subsidence that
      may eventually affect cervical spinal function after the operation.

      A modulus of elasticity close to cortical bone might contribute to advantages in stress
      distribution and load sharing, which can contribute to a lower subsidence rate and, thus,
      better clinical results, making PEEK cages more welcomed by surgeons.

      It is supposed, that in the cervical fusion procedure, a porous coating of a PEEK cage will
      lead to favourable results. Therefore, the present study intends to show these results, in a
      larger patient cohort who received such a coated cervical cage.
