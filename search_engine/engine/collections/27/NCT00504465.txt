      weeks' singleton, cephalic gestation with intact membranes and an unripe cervix (Bishop's
      score <6). Study arms were: 1) dinoprostone vaginal insert (Cervidil) for 12 hours followed
      by oxytocin, 2) dinoprostone vaginal insert (Cervidil) for 12 hours with simultaneous
      oxytocin, and 3) intracervical dinoprostone gel (Prepidil)(one dose) followed by immediate
      oxytocin. Primary outcome measure was the rate of vaginal delivery <24 hours. Secondary
      outcomes were randomization to delivery interval, rate of cesarean delivery (CD) for non
      reassuring fetal status (NRFS) and rate of uterine hyperstimulation.
