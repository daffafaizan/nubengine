      mg/dl were enrolled in a randomized double blind cross over trial comparing 4 g fish oil
      daily with placebo. Treatment interval was 8 weeks with a 4 week wash out, between the two
      treatment intervals. Lipid profile, lipoprotein particle distribution and size, glucose,
      insulin, high sensitivity C reactive protien (CRP), interleukin-6, fibrinogen, plasminogen
      activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and thrombin generation were measured.

      Patients were evaluated at 6 time points: Visit 1/baseline (week 0), Visit 2/randomization
      (week 4), Visit 3/after treatment 1 (week 12) , Visit 4/after wash out (week 16), Visit
      5/after treatment 2 (week 24) and Visit 6/close out (week 28) . Patients were advised to
      maintain a stable diet and not alter baseline fish consumption . One participant took an oral
      contraceptive throughout the trial. Any fish oil supplements were discontinued. Advice on a
      heart healthy diet was provided. Blood pressure (right arm sitting with appropriate sized
      cuff, taken 3 times, last measurement used), height, and weight were measured at the
      beginning of the study, after the first wash out period, and close out. Participant phone
      contact was made during each treatment arm to assess diet stability. Fasting lipid profile
      was performed at every visit. Red blood cell fatty acid profile and secondary endpoints were
      performed at all visits except baseline.
