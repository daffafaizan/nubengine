      sufficient hospital space, and the appropriate equipment, for treating the most serious cases
      of COVID-19. Equally, enormous resource is being dedicated to developing technologies that
      determine who has the disease, and who has developed antibodies to it.

      However, patients recovering from serious disease will also pose a huge, ongoing challenge.
      Not only are people with co-morbidities including underlying fatty liver disease, metabolic
      syndrome and diabetes at higher risk for complications with COVID-19Í¾ but patients discharged
      from hospital after severe COVID-19 are reported to have liver and kidney injuries, and
      impacts on pancreas and spleen. However, the extent of organ health/damage has not been
      mapped.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study looking at patients
      recovering from COVID-19 disease using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
      assess the degree and prevalence of organ injury. This proposed study aims to measure the
      prevalence of organ volume changes and damage in lungs, heart, kidney, liver, pancreas,
      spleen as assessed by MRI among those having recovered, or recovering, from the SARS-CoV-2
      infection - participants will have a final MRI scan at 12 months. Assessing the severity and
      sequelae of COVID-19 in patients is crucial to enable global planning for health-care needs.
      The study includes up to 3 visits for MRI scans and blood tests over a 12 month period. All
      participants will receive standard-of-care by their healthcare provider/s.
