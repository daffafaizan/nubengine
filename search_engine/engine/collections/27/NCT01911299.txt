      warning labels on alcoholic beverages, many pregnant women continue to drink alcohol. The
      consequences include a range of physical, neurological, and behavioral effects referred to as
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Unfortunately, there are currently no comprehensive
      treatments for individuals with FASD. This pilot study will examine whether a nutritional
      intervention could reduce the severity of cognitive deficits associated with prenatal alcohol
      exposure. Choline is an essential nutrient, necessary for brain and behavioral development.
      Animal studies have shown that prenatal or early postnatal choline supplementation can lead
      to long-lasting cognitive enhancement. Similarly, choline supplementation improves cognitive
      outcomes among rats exposed to alcohol during development, even when administered postnatally
      and after alcohol exposure has occurred. The present experiment translates these findings to
      a clinical population of individuals exposed to heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to receive daily choline supplementation or placebo control for a
      period of 6 weeks (approximately 20 subjects per group). Performance on neuropsychological
      tasks that measure cognitive functioning will be measured prior to treatment and at 6 weeks.
      These data will provide important information regarding a potential nutritional intervention
      for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.
