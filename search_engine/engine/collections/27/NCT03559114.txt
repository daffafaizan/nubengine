      can travel to the lungs. This potentially serious complication is known as venous
      thromboembolism (VTE). Anticoagulants are commonly used to prevent VTE in hospital patients.
      However, in patients with major head injury, anticoagulant prevention is commonly delayed for
      the fear that it can potentially lead to further bleeding in the brain. Another method that
      aims to prevent blood clots involves the use of sequential compression device (SCD) that
      compress the legs and increase the flow of blood in the leg veins.

      This study will compare results from patients who receive the SCDs only to those who receive
      both SCD and anticoagulants. The outcome of this study will provide information about how
      best to prevent blood clots while not increase brain bleeding after head injury.
