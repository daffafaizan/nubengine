    
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, blinded trial. The study will consist
      of approximately 265 patients who require treatment of persistent or permanent, symptomatic
      atrial fibrillation by atrioventricular (AV) node ablation and permanent pacing therapy i.e.
      "Ablate and Pace" therapy. All patients enrolled into the clinical study will be randomly
      assigned to one of three groups using a randomization ratio of 2:2:1. Patients will be
      assigned to receive either biventricular (biV) pacing with CLS-based rate adaptive pacing
      using the legally marketed Protos DR/CLS (Group 1), or biventricular pacing with
      accelerometer-based rate adaptive pacing using the Stratos LV (Group 2), or right ventricular
      (RV) pacing with accelerometer-based rate adaptive pacing using the Stratos LV (Group 3).
      Patients in all three groups will be implanted with legally marketed right and left
      ventricular pacing leads. The patients, the core lab used to interpret the echocardiographic
      data and the Clinical Events Committee adjudicating crossover, patient death and congestive
      heart failure (CHF) hospitalizations will be blinded to the randomization assignment.
