      immunosuppression to conventional management in patients with active Crohn's disease who have
      not previously received glucocorticoids, antimetabolites, or infliximab. Patients assigned to
      combined immunosuppression receive azathioprine and 3 infusions of 5 milligrams per kilogram
      of body weight of infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. Retreatment with infliximab and, if
      ultimately necessary, corticosteroids are used to control disease activity. Patients assigned
      to conventional management receive corticosteroids followed, in sequence, by azathioprine and
      infliximab. The primary outcome measure is remission without corticosteroids and without
      bowel resection at weeks 26 and 52.
