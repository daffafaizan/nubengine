    
      After 20 min installation and temperature equilibration (T0), the subject skin temperature
      was recorded in 5 regions of both hands (1 = distal hand, 2 = proximal hand, 3 = wrist, 4 =
      distal forearm, 5 = proximal forearm) using infrared thermography.

      After 10 min of latency, skin temperature was recorded again in both hands (T1).

      A first noxious stimulus (NOX1) is then applied by the hypnotherapist by pinching the webbing
      between the thumb and index fingers of the dominant hand between the thumb and the index.
      Pain intensity is assessed on a 0-10 (0 = no pain, 10 = maximal pain imaginable) numerical
      rating scale (NRS1).

      The hypnotic glove is then mentally created by the subject on his dominant hand following the
      suggestions of the hypnotherapist (T2). To assess the efficacy of the hypnotic glove, a
      second noxious stimulus (NOX2) is applied similarly to NOX1 and the NRS was recorded (NRS2).

      The subject is then invited to mentally wear off the glove (T3). Skin temperature is then
      recorded in both hands, and a third noxious stimulus (NOX3) is applied similarly to NOX1 and
      NOX2 to verify the disappearance of hypnotic anesthesia.

      A last record of skin temperature in both hands is performed 5 min after the glove is
      withdrawn (T4).
