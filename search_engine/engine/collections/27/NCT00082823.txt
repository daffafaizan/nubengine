      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of intravenous VEGF Trap in patients with relapsed
           or refractory advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the steady-state pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the ability of this drug to bind circulating vascular endothelial growth
           factor in these patients.

        -  Determine whether antibodies to this drug develop in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the ability of repeated doses of this drug to alter tumor
           growth and vascular permeability in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, extension study.

      Patients receive VEGF Trap* IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients receive the same drug dose that they received in MSKCC-03137 (VGFT-ST-0202)

      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-6 months.
