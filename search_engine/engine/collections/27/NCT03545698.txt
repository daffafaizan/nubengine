    
      Primary Endpoint: Northwell's House Calls program will be effectively scaled to maintain a
      patient census of 2000 without compromising patient and caregiver satisfaction.

      Secondary Endpoint: The telehealth platform, Avizia, effectively improves communication of
      patient and caregiver needs to House Calls staff, and overall program satisfaction.

      In order to achieve the secondary endpoint, a telehealth platform will be implemented that
      will allow patients and their caregivers to teleconference with their care manager, who is
      either a nurse or a social worker, replacing a typical visit which is completed
      telephonically.

      Hypotheses to be tested through a home based telehealth intervention :

        -  Maintain longitudinal non-inferiority of: in-person acute care home visits from a
           provider, in-person acute care home visits from a care manager, hospitalizations, ED
           visits, Community Paramedicine deployments, Community Paramedicine transports to
           hospital, the patient's acuity level, LACE Score, Charelson Co-Morbidity score and the
           total number of ADLs group compared to usual care group.

        -  Telehealth acceptability

        -  decrease caregiver stress

        -  Improve program satisfaction

        -  Improve staff satisfaction and engagement
