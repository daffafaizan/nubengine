    
      This is a multi-center, open phase II clinical study, in patients with unresectable stage III
      non-small cell lung cancer,to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Almonertinib induction
      therapy, and ,to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different treatment decisions
      guided by ctDNA dynamic monitoring after local treatments (surgical or radical radiotherapy)
      evaluated by MDT.

      The study includes a screening period (not more than 28 days after the subject signs informed
      consent to before the first medication), treatment period (including induction\MDT+topical
      therapy\adjuvant or consolidation therapy) and follow-up period (including safety and
      survival) .

      Eligible subjects received 110 mg of Almonertinib once a day for 8 consecutive weeks of
      induction therapy; local treatment (surgical or radical radiotherapy) was selected after MDT
      assessment. In patients with no disease progression after Almonertinib treatment for 2 years,
      it is up to the investigator to decide whether to continue taking the drug.

      Operable subjects were randomly assigned to groups A and B after surgery: Group A received
      110 mg of Almonertinib once a day for 2 years, and Group B received Almonertinib ctDNA
      dynamic monitoring guided treatment (every 3 months test ctDNA once, if it is positive,
      continue to receive Almonertinib 110 mg once a day, if it is negative, stop Almonertinib
      until ctDNA turns positive and receive Almonertinib treatment again).

      Inoperable subjects were randomly assigned to groups C and D after radical radiotherapy.
      Group C continued to receive Almonertinib 110 mg once a day for 2 years, and group D received
      Almonertinib ctDNA dynamic monitoring guided treatment (every 3 months test ctDNA once, if it
      is positive, continue to receive Almonertinib 110 mg once a day, if it is negative, stop
      Almonertinib, if ctDNA turns positive, you can receive Almonertinib again).
