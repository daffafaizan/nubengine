      of perianal fistulas. An alternative to this treatment could be injection with freshly
      collected autologous adipose tissue. In this study 27 patients with cryptoglandular anal
      fistulas were treated with freshly collected autologous adipose tissue.A clinical assessment
      of the patient prior to inclusion was undertaken and a loose seton placed for at least 6
      weeks prior to fat injection. An MRI of the pelvis was performed before inclusion. Fistulas
      with secondary tracts and/or cavities were excluded. The operation was performed in one
      procedure including liposuction and injection of adipose tissue. A sample of adipose tissue
      from all 27 patients was analyzed. AT-MSCs were isolated and characterized using cellular and
      molecular analyses. Clinical and MRI-scanning evaluation of fistula healing and evaluation of
      ano-rectal function was performed after 6 months. AT-MSCs phenotype was compared between
      responders and non-responders with respect to fistula healing. The evaluation of the AT-MSCs
      was performed in a blinded manner.
