        -  To evaluate the feasibility of adding non-invasive sample collections in the
           pre-surgical setting and at the post-surgery follow-up visit.

        -  To identify and assess metabolic and microbial signatures collected at pre- and
           post-surgery and determine which are indicative of lung cancer.

      Secondary Objective

        -  To identify signatures which are associated with lung cancer stage.

        -  To identify signatures which are impacted by patient's pulmonary function status.
