      vision. The technology of Liberty 677MY is based on the elevated phase shift technology
      (patent pending). Previous evaluations showed the strength of studied IOL both in laboratory
      and clinical conditions.

      Patients will be examined 5 years after implantation. The examination will include the
      measurement of the best corrected distance, intermediate and near visual acuity (assessed
      with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts), intraocular pressure
      (contact Goldman tonometry), biomicroscopic and fundocsopic examination, contrast sensitivity
      (CSV-1000), defocus curve, reading capability, pupilometry in different light conditions and
      PCO evaluation, Nd:YAG capsulotomy rate, photo-documentation of anterior segment. YAG
      capsulotomy will be indicated in case of posterior capsule opacification (PCO). The criteria
      for YAG capsulotomy will be visual acuity decreased 2 or more lines when using (ETDRS)
      charts. Details of all related and unrelated complications will be documented, including
      severity, time of onset, specific treatment and clinical outcome. The investigators will also
      record whether the capsulorhexis is on or partially off the optic.
