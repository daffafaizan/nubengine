      follow approximately 4500 persons with hemophilia who were exposed to hepatitis C virus
      (HCV). The vast majority will have been infected with HCV, and approximately 1/3 will have
      been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Primary objectives are to quantify the
      rates of liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and to
      evaluate candidate clinical, genetic, virologic, serologic and immunologic markers that are
      likely to be on the causal pathway for these conditions. Candidate clinical and laboratory
      markers will be examined longitudinally to define changes over time and their relationships
      to one another. Collaborative studies will focus on genome scanning and evaluation of
      candidate genetic loci for susceptibility or resistance to HCV and HIV infections or to the
      diseases that result from these infections. Additional studies will identify response and
      complication rates of various anti-HCV and anti-HIV regimens in the setting of comprehensive
      clinical care of persons with hemophilia.
