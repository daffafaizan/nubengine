    
      Background:

        -  The availability of high quality, clinically annotated patient samples is crucial for
           the study of biologic factors that influence the natural history of viral related
           malignancies, malignancies occurring in the setting of HIV, and Castleman disease

        -  Comprehensive genomic sequence of viral-associated malignancies, malignancies occurring
           in the setting of HIV, tumors hypothesized to be caused by endogenous retroviruses, and
           Castleman disease may identify diagnostic or prognostic disease signatures, and
           recurrent driver alterations that interact with viral factors, and may identify targets
           for new therapies

        -  Comparison of transcriptomes and genomes between cancers or Castleman disease from HIV+
           and HIV- individuals might identify novel non-human sequences that could potentially
           suggest the presence of transcripts from hitherto undiscovered oncogenic viral agents

      Objective:

      -The primary objective of this protocol is to support molecular investigation of viral
      associated malignancies, malignancies occurring in the setting of HIV or other
      immunodeficiencies, and Castleman disease, by accrual of high quality, clinically annotated
      tissue from such patients as well as patients with tumors that may serve as appropriate
      controls.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age >18 years

        -  HIV or other acquired immunodeficiency and cancer or

        -  Viral-associated cancer or

        -  HIV-negative with cancer that commonly occurs in people with HIV or

        -  Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV)-associated malignancy or related diseases, such as
           Multicentric Castleman Disease or

        -  Idiopathic Castleman disease or

        -  Tumors that are hypothesized to be caused by endogenous retroviruses

      Design:

        -  Samples will be processed using project specific collection and processing protocols.

        -  Collection of non-tumor specimens will generally be performed to obtain germ-line
           genetic material. The results between tumor and normal DNA will be analyzed to identify
           the somatic changes present in the cancer tissues.

        -  Alterations to be evaluated may include: detection of chromosomal changes, such as, but
           not limited to, amplification, deletions, loss of heterozygosity, translocations, etc.;
           as well as expression profiling and detection of transcripts resulting from
           translocations and mutations, including single nucleotide variants, insertions,
           deletions, etc.

        -  Multiple forms of project specific analyses may be performed, including evaluation of
           polymorphisms, mutations, gene expression and clinical pathologic correlation based on
           project specific statistical and bioinformatics plans.

        -  Alterations may also be analyzed within the context of biological pathways and systems
           biology being evaluated in a given project.
