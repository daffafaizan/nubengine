      that centre on the detection and treatment of bowel disorders. It is time-consuming and an
      expensive process to develop a skilled workforce that has both the skills and the resources
      to provide a satisfactory colonoscopy service to the general population. Colonoscopy is also
      an invasive procedure associated with some serious complications like bleeding and
      perforation. Endoscopy resources are limited by theater space, number of endoscopes and
      skilled workforce. With the introduction of bowel cancer screening programmes, colonoscopy
      capacity has been stretched to the limit, such that extremely long waiting lists are an
      increasingly growing problem.

      The rationale for having the database in Portsmouth is because it is a large referral centre
      and already has an electronic hospital endoscopy reporting system. All useful information is
      already stored on this platform, but the relevant clinical information is not easy to analyse
      in the current format. Therefore, we plan to export relevant clinical information to a
      database to permit retrospective data analysis. There is no need to collect any prospective
      data as we can achieve the desired outcomes with the current information.The research
      database will facilitate definitions of clinical pathways to reduce the present burden of
      colonoscopy on the health care system.
