    
      This is a randomized, parallel study that includes 1 initial visit and 1 final visit,
      separated by 8 weeks of diet. The investigators enrolled 73 women in the study, who met the
      criteria for inclusion in the study, to determine whether changes in the diet of patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome will affect their nutritional status. At the initial and final
      visit (after 8 weeks) in all patients, anthropometric measurements, body composition, an
      interview questionnaire concerning the symptoms of the disease was performed, the intensity
      of abdominal pain was assessed, the life quality of patients on the IBS-QOL scale was
      assessed, the calprotectin concentration in the stool was determined and the questionnaire
      regarding the quantitative assessment of diet was performed. The study population was divided
      using simple lottery into 3 groups with different dietary treatment for 8 weeks: group 1 - 26
      patients - diet with low content of easily fermenting carbohydrates (FODMAP), group 2 - 21
      patients - an elimination-rotation diet, and group 3 - (control) - 26 patients - classic diet
      treatment (recommended by the leading gastroenterologist).
