    
      This is a multi-center, open label, dose finding Phase 1/2 study of single agent IMCnyeso
      administered in patients with NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-A1 positive tumors. The primary objective
      of the dose escalation phase (Arm 1) is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of IMCnyeso in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Preliminary efficacy will be evaluated in Arm 2.
