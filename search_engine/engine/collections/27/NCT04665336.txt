      behaviors, for obesity is mostly unknown. Morning types are more successful in long-term
      weight control than evening type chronotypes. Those with a sleep preference in the evening
      and a long sleep time have a higher rate of being overweight / obese than those with a
      morning preference and sufficient sleep time. Evening-type circadian preferences are
      indirectly related to food addiction. Individuals with the evening chronotype tend to have
      higher BMI and unhealthy eating habits.

      Although a direct link between chronotype and obesity has not yet been demonstrated, based on
      the negative health consequences in evening chronotypes; In this study, it is assumed that
      success in obesity management will increase with well-timed circadian / sleep cycles,
      adequate sleep time and quality sleep in obese individuals with evening chronotype.

      Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to examine the effect of circadian timing program
      created for obese individuals with evening chronotype on obesity management and sleep
      quality.

      This study will be conducted in an experimental design, in a randomized controlled manner, in
      accordance with its purpose. The universe of the study will be obese individuals followed in
      Kocaeli University Hospital Obesity Outpatient Clinic. As a result of the power analysis
      performed to determine the sample size, the number of individuals in each group was
      determined as n = 18. The sample of the study will be 36 individuals in total. Participants
      will be selected to the intervention and control groups by simple randomization method.
