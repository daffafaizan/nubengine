      with a significant difference in post-PCI myonecrosis (measured as an elevation of CK-MB
      ratio ≥ 2 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) within 24 hours of low-medium risk PCI in
      patients who are aspirin or clopidogrel non-responsive as determined by VerifyNow Aspirin and
      P2Y12 testing.

      Secondary study objectives will include an assessment of safety. These safety determinations
      will be determined by monitoring the rates of MACE (defined as death, MI, ischemic
      [non-hemorrhagic] stroke and urgent revascularization by repeat PCI or CABG), bleeding
      events, rate of bailout procedures performed, elevations of CK-MB ratio (in the range of 3 to
      5 times ULN and greater than 5 times ULN) and elevations of troponin I.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center study designed to compare differences
      in rates of myonecrosis (measured as an elevation of CK-MB ratio ≥ 2 times ULN) within 24
      hours following low-medium risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in aspirin or
      clopidogrel non-responsive patients who are randomized to heparin with or without
      eptifibatide therapy during PCI. All subjects must also be pretreated with clopidogrel
      (300-600 mg) at least 2 hours before PCI. Study subjects will be randomized to either
      eptifibatide and unfractionated heparin or unfractionated heparin and placebo. Study subject
      randomization in aspirin non-responsive patients will be stratified based upon clopidogrel
      responsiveness.
