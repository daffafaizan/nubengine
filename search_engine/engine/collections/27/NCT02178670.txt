      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with ovarian
      Cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the PBMCs of the
      ovarian cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate ALDHhigh and ALDHlow
      tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the ovarian cancer patient using a similar protocol as
      investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-ovarian cancer CSC immunity
      induced by ovarian cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of ovarian cancer CSCs by
      antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with ovarian cancer CSC-DC.
