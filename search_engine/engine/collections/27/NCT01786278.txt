      adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophago-gastric junction. More than half of these
      patients already have inoperable disease at presentation. Most of them need palliative
      treatment to relieve progressive dysphagia. Presently, endoscopic placement of a covered
      selfexpanding metal stent is the most commonly used method for treatment of malignant
      dysphagia. Cancer overgrowth and stent migration are the most common complications of
      endoscopic stenting and they occur more frequently with longer time from stenting. Specific
      location at esophago-gastric junction at the end point of the propulsive force after swallow
      may predispose stents for easier migration to the stomach. Additionally, the advances in
      chemotherapy have resulted in improved median survival of advanced adenocarcinoma ot the
      stomach and esophago-gastric junction even up to 10-12 months increasing a potential for
      higher chance for occurrence of stent complications. Brachytherapy has been proved to be a
      valuable and durable method to treat malignant dysphagia resulting from esophageal and mainly
      squamous cell cancer. For many years irradiation was not recommended for adenocarcinoma of
      the esophagus and esophago-gastric junction due to their putative low sensitivity to
      radiotherapy. Recently external beam radiation has been incorporated to a combined modality
      therapy regimens also for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Thus, brachytherapy could be an
      attractive and durable method for improving swallowing in adenocarcinoma of the
      esophago-gastric junction, as well. Single-dose brachytherapy and endoscopic stenting with
      SEMS in relieving dysphagia resulting from clearly defined adenocarcinoma of the
      esophago-gastric junction have not been compared yet.
