      properties with a cancer therapeutic beta-emitting radioisotope. Cellectar believes that this
      compound will benefit individuals with cancer due to its selective retention and accumulation
      in malignant cells versus nonmalignant cells. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated that
      I-131-CLR1404 significantly slows malignant tumor growth in several mouse tumor models.
