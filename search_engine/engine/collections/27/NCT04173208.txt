      microbiome could be successfully and safely normalised by postnatal oral transfer of maternal
      fecal microbiome. After faecal microbiota transfer, the children are followed for 24 months
      for the evaluation of markers of, for example, atopy-related diseases, and changes in
      immunomarkers associated with the transfer.
