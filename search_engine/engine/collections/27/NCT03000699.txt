      the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) will be randomized to receive CBM-I daily
      for one week, adjunct to the residential psychosocial treatment or to an assessment-only
      control condition. Participants will complete clinical measures consisting of interviews and
      questionnaires measuring suicidal ideation, hopelessness, depression, negative affect, and
      interpretation biases before, during and after treatment.
