      cancer (PCa) and a life expectancy of > 10 years. RP is a treatment option for localized PCa
      that shows benefit in prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) and overall survival compared
      to conservative management. According to the guideline recommendations of the European
      Association of Urology (EAU), RP should be accompanied by extended pelvic lymph node
      dissection (ePLND) in patients with intermediate-risk PCa (D'Amico classification) and > 5%
      nomogram (Briganti) predicted risk of positive lymph nodes and in all high-risk PCa cases.

      Besides an improved accuracy in staging, the therapeutic role of ePLND remains controversial.
      The primary goal of this trial is to provide high-level evidence regarding the therapeutic
      benefit of ePLND in intermediate- and high-risk PCa patients without clinical evidence of
      nodal involvement. It is hypothesized that ePLND prolongs time to biochemical recurrence
      (BCR) and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) in intermediate- and high-risk PCa
      patients.
