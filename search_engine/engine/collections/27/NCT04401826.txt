    
      The conventional approach: Anesthesia will be given followed by bone sounding using William
      graduated periodontal probe and measuring the pocket depth (using magnification loupes and
      microsurgical blades)

        -  Marking the bleeding points

        -  An internal bevel incision is made followed afterwards by a sulcular incision.

        -  The gingival collar is eliminated.

        -  Elevation of the flap is proceeded to allow access for osteoplasty using piezo surgery
           and an apical position of the bone 2-3mm beyond CEJ.

        -  Mattress suture (6.0) is made

      The intervention approach:

      Surgery is done the same as in the conventional approach but without opening a flap, gaining
      access via a tunneling instrument and piezo tips for osteoplasty
