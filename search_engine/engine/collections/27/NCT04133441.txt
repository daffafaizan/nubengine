      renal and liver failure, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, congenital
      heart diseases, minor and major stroke, and inherited thrombocytopenias and other major
      malignancies. subjects were examined by means of the medical history, hormonal, metabolic and
      routine hematochemical parameters. We provided for a clinical baseline evaluation that
      included extemporaneous ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and a physical assessment of body
      weight, Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference (WC) as anthropometric parameters. To
      lead the statistical analysis, all sample was clusterized into three different groups
      according to the diagnostic condition of deficiency (<10 ng/mL), insufficiency (<20 ng/mL)
      and sufficiency (â‰¥20 ng/mL) of vitamin D. We labelled each cluster as group 1, group 2 and
      group 3.
