      choice on possible complications in patients undergoing MRI under sedation retrospectively.

      After one of the routine sedation protocol used in our department was chosen and applied
      according to the physical status of the patient and the physicians decision, the datas of the
      patients will be recruited to the study from the medical records . Patient characteristics
      (age, gender, weight, height), ASA (American Society of Anethesiology) classification,
      associated diseases will be recorded . After the procedure was completed all the
      complications during the 2 hours waiting period in the recovery room will be recorded from
      the medical records. All the compl≈ücation and recovery times will be recorded from the
      medical records. Whether the patient received radiocontrast material or not will also be
      recorded. The patients will be called by phone, and will be questioned for the complications,
      any epileptic seizure attack, or increase in the number of seizures, any admission to
      emergency room or any in patient admission to the hospital will be recorded which developed
      in the first week after the procedure.
