      with bilaterally missing single bicuspid or molar had one of the sites to be restored
      randomly assigned to be treated according to the platform-switching concept with (PS group),
      or with matching implant-abutment diameters, (RP group). A total of 36 implants, (18 Nobel
      Replace Tapered Groovy PS, 18 Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy), were bilaterally installed. All
      the implants were inserted with an insertion torque between 35 and 45 Ncm, in healed healthy
      bone and the healing abutment was connected at the same time. Both implants were delayed
      loaded with screw retained temporary crowns 3 months after implant insertion and with screw
      retained definitive crowns 2 months later. Outcome measures were implant survival, biological
      and prosthetic complications, radiographic marginal bone-level changes, soft tissue
      parameters (PPD and BOP). Clinical data were collected at baseline 6 and 12 months.
      Statistical analyses were conducted using computational program SAS (version 9.2), with
      1-away ANOVA and F-test. Statistical significance was tested at the 0.05 probability level,
      and all values were presented as mean and standard deviation with 95% confidence intervals.
