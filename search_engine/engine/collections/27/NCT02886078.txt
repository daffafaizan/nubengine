      prosthesis. For implantation, there are two approaches available: The dorsal central split
      approach according to Swanson and the volar approach described by Simmen.

      Our experiences and data from our prospective registry indicate, that the active extension of
      the PIP joint is better after the dorsal approach, but sometimes related with hyperextension
      of the PIP joint and secondary swan-neck deformity. Extension is supposed to be better after
      the volar approach, but associated with active and passive extension lag. Evidence of theses
      experiences will assist the surgeon in the preoperative planning to select the appropriate
      approach according to the patient's needs.

      The primary objective is to investigate the active extension six months after implantation of
      the CapFlex-PIP© arthroplasty, comparing the dorsal with the volar approach.

      This is a randomized controlled trial.
