      assessed clinically and radiographically. Full-mouth clinical periodontal examinations were
      performed by the measurements of probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL),
      gingival index (GI), plaque index (PI) and bleeding on probing (BOP). All these measurements
      were recorded at six sites around each tooth with a manual periodontal probe. The
      participants were categorized into three groups: healthy controls (n=25), patients with
      gingivitis (n=25) and patients with periodontitis (n=50). Gingival crevicular fluid, saliva
      and serum samples were collected from each participant one day after the clinical periodontal
      measurements. TFF-1, TFF-3 and IL-1Î² levels of these biofluids were determined using the
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
