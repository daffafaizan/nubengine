      with measurement of macrophage markers and no other intervention than the NAC treatment
      administered in the setting of management of the participants PCM overdose according to best
      clinical practice.

      The interventional part of the study which is submitted for registration here concerns only
      healthy controls who were exposed to NAC treatment in order to assess the direct effects of
      NAC on macrophages. The participants received NAC treatment according to the same protocol as
      the PCM overdosed patients, and macrophage activation markers were measured prior to and
      after 16 hours of NAC treatment. Thus, the involvement of the participants in the study was
      limited to the 16 hours of NAC treatment.
