      receive one of two possible medications during surgery to help with pain after surgery. After
      they go to sleep for surgery the anesthesiologist will give them either (1) a single
      injection of morphine into the spinal fluid in the lower back, or (2) a single injection of
      extended-release morphine into the epidural space (just outside the spinal fluid) in the
      lower back.

      The usual care for patients having this surgery is a single injection of morphine into the
      spinal fluid in the lower back. If randomized to group (1), subjects will receive the usual
      care for pain control. If subjects are randomized to group (2), they will receive a single
      injection of extended-release morphine into the epidural space.

      During surgery, a small blood sample (1 teaspoon or less) will be collected to analyze
      specific DNA sequences that are involved in individual responses to morphine for pain
      control. The blood sample will be destroyed after 24 months.

      After surgery, subjects will have IV pain medication through a patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA) machine. Subjects will be shown how to work the PCA so they can get the pain medicine
      when they need it. A research nurse will check in frequently to ask how much pain is
      occurring following the surgery and any side effects that may arise from the study medicine.

      Subjects will be in this study up to 60 hours after surgery.
