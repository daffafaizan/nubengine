    
      Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and their healthy family members (living
      together in the same house) are recruited in the study. CFS has been diagnosed in Tampere
      University Hospital and the diagnosis is based on thorough clinical assessment fulfilling the
      Institute of Medicine 2015 criteria. Patients microbiota is analyzed (microbiological
      analysis, mediators of inflammation) and results are compared with their family members.

      Via colonoscopy, up to 40 patients with CFS are randomized to receive either a faecal
      transplant from a healthy donor (treatment group) or his/her own feces (placebo group).
      Products are blinded, investigators and patients are blinded. Patients' health related
      quality of life and ability to work or study are assessed (baseline, 1 and 6 months after the
      procedure).
