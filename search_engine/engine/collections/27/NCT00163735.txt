      allergenic food proteins "casein", egg white, isinglass ( fish derived), milk or evaporated
      milk where "there is detectable residual processing aid". However it is not clear whether the
      final wine contains concentrations of residual added food proteins that can provoke allergic
      reactions.

      Comparison:This study is a double blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether adults
      known to be allergic to eggs, fish, milk and/or nuts exhibit allergic reactions following
      consumption of Australian commercial wines fined with food allergens.
