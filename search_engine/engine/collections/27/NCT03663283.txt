    
      This is a prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial comparing outcomes in
      patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty (anatomic and reverse) who receive a
      peripheral nerve block with liposomal bupivacaine in combination with standard bupivacaine
      versus standard bupivacaine alone. Once consent is obtained, baseline characteristics will be
      recorded and patients will be randomized to intervention or control. Following surgery,
      patients will be followed until their 3-week post-operative visit. The primary outcome
      measure will be the mean difference in patient pain scores over the first 72 hours
      post-operatively between two groups. Secondary outcomes will include: (1) Total opioid
      consumption (as measured utilizing morphine intravenous equivalents) in first 72 hours and at
      3 weeks (2) Patient perceived duration of block determined as the time patient perceives
      complete resolution of block (3) Patient satisfaction with pain control at 72 hours, 3 weeks
      post-operatively and patient reported outcome measures (SANE, SST, ASES, VR-12) at 3 weeks
      post-operatively.
