      clinically separate components: incisional pain (somatic pain), visceral pain (deep intra
      abdominal pain), and shoulder pain due to peritoneal stretching and diaphragmatic irritation
      associated with carbon dioxide insufflation. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that intense
      acute pain after laparoscopic prostatectomy may predict development of chronic pain. Without
      effective treatment, this ongoing pain may delay recovery, mandate inpatient admission, and
      thereby increase the cost of such care.
