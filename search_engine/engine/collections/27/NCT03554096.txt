      females who are not pregnant will be recruited for the study. Three volunteers will be
      enrolled with a reasonable sampling of ethnicities from the Nashville area, and an effort
      will be made to recruit males and females. The study will be conducted by the Vanderbilt
      Clinical Research Center (CRC).

      Briefly, the three volunteers will be studied at a single dose level. Baseline assessments
      will be performed, and then each volunteer will be given a single oral dose (550 mg) of
      2-HOBA. Ninety minutes after the dose, a lumbar puncture will be performed to obtain
      cerebrospinal fluid and a blood sample will be collected. 2-HOBA levels will be measured in
      cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples from this timepoint to assess the ability or orally
      ingested 2-HOBA to cross the blood brain barrier.
