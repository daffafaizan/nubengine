        -  Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of calcitriol when combined with
           paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the effect of administration of calcitriol on the pharmacokinetics of
           paclitaxel in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of administration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of
           calcitriol in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of calcitriol.

      During course 1, patients receive oral calcitriol daily on days 1-3 of weeks 1-6 and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 of week 1 and day 3 of weeks 2-6. During course 2 and
      subsequent courses, patients receive oral calcitriol daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV over
      1 hour on day 3 of weeks 1-6. Treatment continues every 8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose giving an estimated
      probability of dose-limiting toxicity of no more than 0.30.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
