      section, can produce significant post-operative analgesia for several hours. The Tranversus
      Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block can also provide prolonged post-operative pain control. A small
      number of published studies comparing analgesic outcomes after cesarian section with ITM or
      TAP block have reported variable results.Moreover, these studies have been conducted in
      countries with extensive post-operative nursing care.

      Many counties in sub-Saharan Africa have very limited post-operative nursing capacity, and
      relatively little data have been published about post-operative maternal pain control in
      these settings. Cesarean section is the most common type of major operation at our
      institution, Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH), in south-western Uganda.Nursing ward
      staffing capacity is low, with much basic nursing care provided by families and friends of
      patients. The investigators conducted a study to examine the impact of ITM versus TAP block
      in a setting of limited formal nursing oversight.
