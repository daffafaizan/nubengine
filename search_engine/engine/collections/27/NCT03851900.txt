    
      The aim of this randomized, controlled, clinical trial is to compare the clinical efficacy of
      a desensitizer that contains calcium phosphate with a two-step self-etch adhesive and placebo
      through a long-term period (6 months). At least fifty patients with a sensitivity score of 6
      or higher, according to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with at least three teeth will
      participate in this study. Teethmate Desensitizer (TM), Clearfil SE Bond 2 (SE) and placebo
      (distilled water) will be applied randomly to three teeth of each patient. Recalls will be
      done at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment by applying
      air-blast and the sensitivity scores will be determined according to VAS. The efficiency of
      the materials will be determined according to the VAS scores. Data will be analyzed using
      Paired t test and repeated measures of ANOVA.
