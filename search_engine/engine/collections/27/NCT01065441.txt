      creating a personalized anti-tumor vaccine within the body of patients with cancer. The aim
      of the study is to evaluate the safety of administration and anti-tumor effect of a vaccine
      protocol that has three separate steps. Cancer patients generally present with an immune
      response to cancer biased to a Th2 response, while a Th1 response is considered necessary for
      mediating anti-tumor immunity. The first step of the study consists of multiple intradermal
      priming doses of AlloStimTM. The aim of this step is to create Th1 immunity to the
      alloantigens in AlloStimTM, thus increasing the number of Th1 cells in circulation. The
      second step of the protocol involves the cryoablation of a selected tumor lesion followed by
      an intratumoral AlloStimTM injection. The aim of this step is to generate tumor-specific CTL
      killer cells in the circulation. The final step is an intravenous infusion of AlloStimTM. The
      aim of this step is to activate circulating Th1 cells, killer cells, and natural killer
      cells. The further aim of this step is to create an inflammatory environment that can
      break-down the ability of the tumor to avoid an anti-tumor immune response. In patients with
      partial responses and recurrence of disease, additional intravenous "booster" infusions are
      utilized to reactivate the circulating immune cells.
