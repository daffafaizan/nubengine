    
      The objective of the study is to identify socio-demographic factors, behaviors and practices
      associated with infection with SARS-CoV-2 to help determine where and how patients mostly get
      infected with SARS-CoV-2.

      The study will focus on sociodemographic data (age, gender, location of residence,
      socio-economic level, etc.), behaviors and practices (adherence to hand-washing,
      mask-wearing, work habits, meetings, etc.), the places they visit (public transportation,
      bars, restaurants, sport facilities, etc.).

      It is a case-control study including :

        -  cases identified by the nationwide system of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests (SIDEP)
           (currently limited to RT-PCR) and invited to participate by CNAM, which hosts the data
           from the nationwide test system, through a nationwide email campaign sent once a week;
           cases will be asked if they can tell where they most probably were infected, leading to
           a detailed description of the circumstances of the contamination, including whether the
           suspected contamination took place within the household or not.

        -  controls included via Ipsos, a polling institute with access to personal data from a
           panel from which they will include controls matched on age (divided into 10-year
           categories up to 68 years old included as expected adherence to an online questionnaire
           quickly drops beyond that age), gender and geographic area (departement); invitations
           will be sent every week via email to adapt the profile of recruited controls to the age,
           gender and geographic profiles of the cases that participated in the previous week;

        -  cases will be offered to invite a person they live with to participate in the study
           offering another case-control analysis inside a household. Cases will be recommended not
           to invite the person that they suspect was responsible for their contamination, if a
           intra-household contamination is suspected. They will indicate the email address of that
           person to allow sending of an invitation via email. These participants will be required
           to report the result of the test as recommended by contact tracing guidelines to
           determine whether they are cases or controls.

      Analysis will also include descriptive analysis:

        -  Estimation of the proportion of cases infected within the household or outside

        -  Among the cases with a extra-household contamination suspicion, proportion of cases for
           whom infection circumstances are known and description of these circumstances

        -  Proportion of cases for whom no specific circumstance of contamination could be
           evidenced.

      Questionnaires will focus on the 10 days preceding :

        -  symptom onset (symptomatic cases)

        -  day of testing (asymptomatic cases)

        -  day of symptom onset of the first case within a household (people from the same
           household as cases) or testing of the first case if they are asymptomatic

        -  questionnaire completion (Ipsos-recruited controls)

      Participants will be offered at the end of the online self-administered questionnaire to
      indicate a phone number. Among those agreeing to do so, a random sample of case-control pairs
      and cases of particular interest (eg with specific contamination circumstances) will be
      called within two weeks following the online questionnaire for a more detailed telephone
      questionnaire to measure reliability of online retrieved data and explore more specific
      aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
