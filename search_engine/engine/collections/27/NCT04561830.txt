      either laparoscopic (30 cases) or open total mesorectal excision (30 cases) in addition to
      lateral pelvic dissection. The duration of operation in the laparoscopically assisted
      procedure was longer than the open procedure (p=0.003). The postoperative hospital stay time
      was longer in the open group than in the laparoscopic group (P=0.043). No significant
      differences between both groups regarding the number of excised lymph nodes, disease
      recurrence, RFS, or OS rate.
