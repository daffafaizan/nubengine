      learned and acquired. Service learning advocates learning by doing. Through experience
      learning, students are guided to learn caring attitude or caring behaviour. Thus, teachers
      should construct appropriate assessments to understand caring traits as a transformative
      process from students' learning. Teachers should also adjust the pace of teaching
      continuously and design appropriate courses to facilitate students' achievement of their
      learning goals.
