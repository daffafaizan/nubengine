    
      The study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled
      study.

      Eligible patients with head and neck cancer undergoing chemoradiation will be randomized
      assigned at one-to-one ratio to receive

        -  Group A: melatonin oral gel 3%

        -  Group B: placebo

      All patients will receive standard symptomatic treatment for oral mucositis along the study
      according to routine clinical practice of the hospital.

      A full PK and safety assessment will be carried out in the first 24 patients included in the
      study (PK subgroup).

      All patients will take melatonin oral gel 3% or placebo oral gel from two to three days
      before start of systemic treatment until one to four weeks after completion of radiotherapy.
      In the case of concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin, patients will remain on study from the
      first day of chemoradiotherapy during 19 weeks (seven on chemoradiotherapy treatment, a
      maximum of four weeks after completion of radiotherapy and eight more weeks on observation).
      In the case of patients receiving cetuximab, since the first infusion of cetuximab will be
      administered one week before the first day of radiation, the patients will remain on study
      during 20 weeks (eight weeks on chemoradiotherapy, a maximum of four weeks after completion
      of radiotherapy and eight more weeks on observation). Investigators should take into account
      that the minimum duration of the melatonin oral gel 3% treatment would be 8 weeks for
      patients treated with cisplatin and 9 weeks for patients treated with cetuximab.

      Patients with oral mucositis improved to grade 1 (based on RTOG) until one to four weeks
      after the end of chemoradiation may stop melatonin oral gel 3% or placebo treatments.
      Patients with grade â‰¥ 2 oral mucositis at this time-point (four weeks after the end of
      chemoradiation) will stop treatment per protocol (melatonin or placebo) and will continue
      with standard treatments and under observation until the last safety visit.
