      this time. Unipolar Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia are
      associated with major disruptions in functioning and quality of life. Understanding the
      causal physiological and genetic factors involved in each of these disorders would allow us
      to make great strides in tailoring treatment to the individual's needs. Because the etiology
      of these disorders are likely multifactorial in nature, a study examining a wide range of
      variables might best allow us to examine the interactions between different factors and to
      get a better sense of how genes and the brain interact to produce psychiatric disorder.
