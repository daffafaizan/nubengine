    
      In the initial phase of this study, HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts between 200 and 500
      were randomized to receive either IL-2 alone by continuous IV infusion for 5 days every 8
      weeks, IL-2 plus anti-TNF antibody, or IL-2 plus thalidomide. The primary endpoints of this
      study are safety and tolerability of the IL-2/TNF inhibitor combination. Secondary endpoints
      will include changes in CD4 counts, frequency and severity of IL-2 related side effects,
      changes in serum TNF levels, and plasma viral load changes. The study period is one year,
      with an optional extension period to follow. Enrollment was for up to forty-five IL-2-naive
      patients.

      In the amended phase of this study, up to 60 patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts equal
      to or greater than 350 will be studied to determine the ability of prednisone to ameliorate
      IL-2 related toxicity. Patients will be randomized to one of four groups: IL-2 alone; IL-2
      plus prednisone; prednisone alone; no treatment. All four groups will be treated with a
      combination regimen of antiretrovirals to include at least one protease inhibitor. IL-2 will
      be dosed SQ at a starting dosage of 7.5 mlU bid x 5 days every 8 weeks, and prednisone (or
      placebo) will be dosed at 0.5 mg/kg/day during IL-2 cycles. Primary endpoints are frequency
      of IL-2 associated fatigue and fever, CD4 count changes, and viral load changes. Secondary
      endpoints include frequency of other IL-2 side effects, concomitant medication use, steroid
      associated side effects, cytokine changes during IL-2, and IL-2 total exposure in the IL-2
      plus steroid vs. IL-2 plus placebo arms. The study period is one year with an optional
      extension period to follow.
