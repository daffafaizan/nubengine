      as a potential mean to improve endurance performance in elite cyclists, facilitated by
      muscular or systemic physiological adaptations. So far, the effects of such training has been
      studied exclusively in context of short-lasting low-intensity sessions, representing a
      scenario with suboptimal ecological validity for such highly trained athetes.

      This study will investigate the effects of including sprints during prolonged LIT-sessions
      sessions during a 14-day training camp focusing on LIT, followed by 10 days recovery (REC),
      on performance and performance-related measures in elite cyclists. During the training camp,
      a sprint training group will conduct 12x30-s maximal sprints during five LIT sessions,
      whereas a control group will perform distance-matched LIT-only. Overall, the training camp
      will lead to substantial increases in training load compared to habitual training in both
      intervention groups, followed by subsequent reductions during REC. Performance tests will be
      conducted before the training camp (T0) and after REC (T2). Muscle biopsies, hematological
      measures and stress/recovery questionnaires will be collected Pre (T0) and after the camp
      (T1).
