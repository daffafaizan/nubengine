      mortality rates remain high. Adjunctive therapies that target the underlying immunopathology
      may further reduce morbidity and mortality in severe and cerebral malaria beyond that
      possible with anti-malarials alone. Pre-clinical data have established a beneficial role for
      PPARγ agonists in experimental cerebral malaria. A proof-of-concept randomized clinical trial
      of uncomplicated malaria in Thailand has extended these findings to an informative patient
      population, showing that adjunctive treatment with the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone improves
      parasite clearance, and reduces biomarkers of inflammation (IL-6 and MCP-1) and endothelial
      activation (Ang-2 to Ang-1 ratio), and increases neuro-protective pathways (BDNF). The
      previous clinical trial also established the safety and tolerability of short course
      rosiglitazone in adults with malaria infection. Importantly, rosiglitazone does not induce
      insulin release or hypoglycemia in malaria-infected patients. Based on these data, and on
      studies demonstrating neuro-protective effects on PPARγ agonists in CNS disease and injury,
      the investigators believe that PPARγ agonists are promising candidates for adjunctive therapy
      for severe and cerebral malaria.

      In this study the efficacy of rosiglitazone vs. placebo control as adjunct to standard of
      care anti-malarial therapy in children with severe (including cerebral) malaria will be
      tested.

      The underlying hypothesis is that the addition of rosiglitazone to standard antimalarial
      therapy in severe P. falciparum infection is safe and will result in improved clinical
      outcomes and lower rates of long-term neurocognitive impairment.
