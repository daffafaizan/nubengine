      identified radiation dosimetry and optimal uptake time.

      We believe that a fluorine-18 analogue of NP-59, [18F]FNP-59, would greatly improve the
      imaging characteristics, by providing a PET imaging cholesterol analogue with significantly
      improved radiation dosimetry, and improved localization / sensitivity / specificity without
      concern of thyroid exposure.
