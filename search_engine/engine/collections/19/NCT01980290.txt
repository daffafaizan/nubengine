    
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, observational, prospective study to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and adherence to telaprevir in ex-People Who Inject Drugs (ex-PWIDs)
      infected with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C and any fibrosis stage including compensated
      cirrhosis, who are receiving substitution therapy (eg, methadone, buprenorphine) and/or are
      being followed in an addiction center. Patients may be treatment na√Øve or relapsers.
      Participating physicians are to offer enrollment in this study to all eligible patients at
      their site in who they plan to initiate triple therapy with telaprevir, pegylated interferon
      alfa (PegIFN alfa), and ribavirin (RBV). A target of 115 patients will participate in this
      study. The duration of each patient's participation in this study will be up to approximately
      60 weeks. After obtaining the signed participation agreement or ICF, selection criteria will
      be reviewed to verify the patient's eligibility. Data will be recorded in the electronic case
      report form (CRF) at 6 time points for each patient which correspond to routine care visits:
      inclusion, and at the patient's routine care visit closest to Week 4, 12, and 24, end of
      treatment, and end-of-follow-up (e.g., approximately 12 weeks after end-of-treatment). No
      additional blood, urine, or other biological samples will be required, and no additional
      investigations, beyond the routine clinical management of the patient, will be performed.
