    
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, PK, safety and tolerability study of oritavancin
      in pediatric patients (<18 years of age) with suspected or diagnosed Gram-positive bacterial
      infections or pediatric patients requiring peri-operative prophylactic antibiotics.
      Approximately 52 patients will be enrolled at 5-10 US centers. This study will include 5 age
      cohorts and patients will be entered in a stepwise approach starting with the older age
      cohort (12-<18 years). The starting dose will be IV oritavancin 15 mg/kg. The safety,
      tolerability and PK data will be reviewed at the completion of each cohort to ensure safety
      and determine the appropriate dose for the next age cohort. At least 8 patients will be
      enrolled in each cohort except for the birth to <3 month age cohort which will have at least
      16 patients enrolled. Three PK samples will be collected over 14 days. The safety follow-up
      will complete with a 60-day phone call to the caregiver.
