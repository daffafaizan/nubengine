      traditional methods such as suture, clips or energy-based coagulation are ineffective or
      impractical.

      Many products are not as effective in the presence of active and/or brisk bleeding since the
      lack of sufficient adhesion strength allows forceful bleeding to simply "float" the products
      away from the bleeding tissue, prior to the achievement of full hemostasis.

      The Study investigates a new product, sFilm-FS, aimed to help the control of body fluid
      leakage in general surgery procedures, proposing its use as an adjunct to hemostasis and/or
      sealing.
