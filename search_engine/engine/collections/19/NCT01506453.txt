    
      Patients with ALL on Total XVI ((or for those being treated "as per TOTXVI protocol") who
      experience NP/PN after specific doses of vincristine are eligible to enroll in the study as
      soon as the diagnosis of NP/PN related to VCR is established. The qualifying doses of
      vincristine have been selected because they fall in the schedule of weekly vincristine doses
      as per Total XVI, and 2 additional weekly vincristine doses are anticipated according to the
      protocol. Participants will be randomized to receive gabapentin or placebo upon enrollment.
      Morphine will be available to both groups as needed for pain at any time on the study. At the
      time of enrollment, and daily thereafter until completion of the study drug, data will be
      collected for pain assessment, and the daily dose of oral morphine used will be collected.
      Data regarding the pain type, quality, and location, as well as treatments used to manage
      pain will be assessed on a daily basis for the diagnostic event and for the period following
      the next two administrations of VCR treated with the study drug.

      Primary Objective: To assess the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin in controlling VCR-related
      NP/PN in participants with ALL, by comparing the morphine daily dose (mg/kg/day) used to
      control NP/PN as a primary or a rescue regimen in the gabapentin vs. placebo groups.

      Secondary Objective: To compare the pain scores in the gabapentin and placebo groups as
      recorded by pain score right now and pain score average for previous 24 hours.
