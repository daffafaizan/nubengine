      The first phase will test the feasibility of the intervention (UltraPro) along a pilot study.
      Following the setup of a lung ultrasound training curriculum for general practitioners, the
      practicality of the whole UltraPro algorithm will be evaluated at primary care level.

      The second phase will be a pragmatic randomized three-arm intervention study using an
      algorithm based on the results of procalcitonin and lung ultrasound to manage patients with
      lower respiratory tract infections at primary care level. The procalcitonin-ultrasound
      algorithm will be compared to procalcitonin-guided management alone and usual care.
