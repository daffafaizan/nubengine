      couple can benefit for the selection of single embryo transfer (SET)/double embryo transfer
      (DET), or donor selection by HLA-C in ART, in order to increase the live birth rate
      (LBR)/cycle since HLA-C1/C1 donors are predicted to be safer and C2/C2 males or oocyte donors
      may be mor "dangerous" as identified by epidemiological studies
