    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single arm efficacy and safety study in patients with
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, who have failed at least one prior
      systemic therapy.

      Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with 1000 mg/mÂ²
      belinostat administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on days 1-5 of every 3-week cycle until
      there is disease progression or unmanageable treatment-related toxicities.

      The primary study endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) based on the IHP revision IWG
      criteria. Safety will be evaluated during the study and for 30 days after the last
      administration of study drug. Adverse events and laboratory studies will be graded according
      to NCI-CTCAE v. 3.0.
