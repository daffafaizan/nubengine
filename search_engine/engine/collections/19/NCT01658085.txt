      To disclose the potential advantages and outcomes of the new Harmonic Focus (HF) device
      compared to Harmonic Scalpel ACE14S (ACE-14S) in benign thyroid surgery.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Controlled randomized study.

      METHODS:

      Harmonic Focus was compared to former ACE14S device in patients undergoing total
      thyroidectomy for Multinodular Goiter. The primary endpoint was time of surgery. Secondary
      endpoints were time of use of the device, % of use along the procedure, number of ligatures,
      blood loss, hypocalcaemia, recurrent laryngeal nerve impairment, postoperative pain and
      quality of life.
