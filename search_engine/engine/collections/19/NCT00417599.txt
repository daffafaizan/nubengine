      provision of a self-help book, use of an interactive weight management web site for 6 months,
      and 2 brief motivational interviewing telephone follow-ups, plus usual care;and Usual Care
      (UC) which includes and orientation meeting and usual care (consisting of required USAF
      annual physical and fitness exam, participation in any mandatory weight loss or fitness
      programs, and the requirement to stay below a Maximum Allowable Weight [MAW], with penalties
