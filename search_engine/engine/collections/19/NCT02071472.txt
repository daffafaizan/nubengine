      concept of anesthesia safety. The main goal is to assess the anesthetic and surgical risk
      including clinical and drug features likely to interfere with the anesthesia. The medication
      reconciliation is a central part of this consultation especially in order to assess the
      allergic risk and hemostasis disorders.

      However, access to comprehensive and reliable data concerning the consumption of health
      products by the patient represents a major challenge. The "Dossier Pharmaceutique" (DP) is an
      electronic pharmaceutical record including medications (prescribed medications, over the
      counter medications, complementary and alternative medicines) delivered by community
      pharmacists over a four month period. Hospital pharmacists have access to the DP of
      hospitalized patients in order to improve the quality of the medication reconciliation. These
      informations regarding medication of the patients will be shared with anesthesiologists.
