    
      The purpose of this study is to determine aspects of abortion care most important to the
      patient in creating a "high quality" abortion experience, to investigate patients'
      expectations of abortion care, and to explore provider perceptions of patients' abortion
      experiences and assess concordance with patients' perspectives.

      The investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews with patient participants and
      providers separately to determine patients' expectations of abortion care as well as the most
      important aspects of the abortion experience and to explore providers' perceptions of their
      patients' abortion experience and assess concordance.
