    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study

      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 Days 1 & 8 Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 Day 1 Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg Day 1 (start
      cycle 3)

      Treatment during the induction phase will be administered in six 21-day cycles. During cycles
      1 and 2, gemcitabine plus cisplatin will be administered WITHOUT ipilimumab. During cycles
      3-6, combination therapy with gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus ipilimumab will be administered.
      Patients without evidence of disease progression (by irRC) after completion cycle 6 will
      continue single-agent ipilimumab maintenance every 3 months.

      Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 80% within 14 days prior to registration for protocol
      therapy.

      Life Expectancy: Not Specified

      Hematopoietic:

        -  White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 3.5K/mm3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL

        -  Platelets ≥ 100K/mm3

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) (except patients with Gilbert's
