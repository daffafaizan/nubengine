      those from the new algorithm in a subset of high-risk patients, and cumulative contrast media
      and irradiation doses associated with imaging will be presented. How other measures of
      pulmonary function (e.g. transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO)) and the
      presence/absence of operative complications might be predicted will also be investigated.
      Additionally, the potential links between (i) pre-surgical imaging data, (ii) post-surgical
      changes in respiratory function, and (iii) changes in health related quality of life will
      also be explored.
