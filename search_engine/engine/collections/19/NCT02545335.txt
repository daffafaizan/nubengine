      related mortality via complications of liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, and
      affects more than 185 million persons worldwide. Antiviral therapy evolved during the past 25
      years from standard interferon, the combination with ribavirin and pegylated interferon (P/R)
      to the addition of protease inhibitors and is currently on the edge to an interferon-free era
      with the first such substances being approved in 2014. However, current standard therapy for
      CHC genotype 1 patients without cirrhosis consists of ribavirin and pegylated interferon
      (P/R) in combination with boceprevir (BOC) or telaprevir (TPV), which are direct acting
      antivirals and represent the first-generation protease inhibitors.

      Triple therapy for CHC has been reported to be associated with a quantitative and qualitative
      increase in treatment-related (serious) adverse events compared to the former standard
      therapy without protease-inhibitors. Moreover, reports of serious infectious complications
      during triple therapy - especially in patients with acquired immune deficiencies like liver
      cirrhosis - that lead to considerable morbidity and mortality, have accumulated recently. The
      mechanisms of this increased susceptibility to infections remain unclear. However, BOC is
      known to inhibit neutrophil elastase activity.

      Aims of this study were therefore to analyse infections that occurred in CHC outpatients
      during therapy in the study centre, to prospectively characterize neutrophil function in
      patients undergoing CHC triple therapy in comparison to dual therapy with peginterferon and
      ribavirin and to thereby elucidate the possible mechanisms of protease-inhibitor associated
      infections.
