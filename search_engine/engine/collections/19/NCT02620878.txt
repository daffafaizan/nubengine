    
      The AP prototype is based on a Modular Model Predictive Control algorithm (MMPC) implemented
      on the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) wearable platform.

      The study will be divided in two parts: the first part will serve as a 3 days pilot study and
      will be conducted in a hotel/residence near the hospital.

      The investigators will recruit 6/8 children (5-12 years) and/or 6/8 adolescents (12-18
      years), with type 1 diabetes who have experience with insulin pump. DiAs will be used 72
      continuous hours of day and night.

      If part 1 will be successfully, after about 2-3 months, the study will move to the second
      part (the main part), that will consist in cross-over randomized study that will be conducted
      in a camp setting. The participants will be randomly assigned to the treatment arm
      (Artificial Pancreas) or to the control arm (sensor-augmented insulin pump). Then the same
      patient will be assigned to the other arm. Each treatment will be applied 3 consecutive days.
      During the first period (days 1-3) patients will do the same activites and will have the same
      diet as in the second period (day s 5-7).

      The investigators will recruit 30/40 children (5-12 years) and/or 30/40 adolescents (12-18
      years), affected by type 1 diabetes who have experience with insulin pump therapy.

      The study has the permission of the Ethics Committee reference and the permission for
      "clinical investigation with devices not CE marked" by the Health Ministry.
