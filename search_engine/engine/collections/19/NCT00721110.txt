    
      Subjects undergoing abdominal hysterectomy surgery are randomized into one of four groups:
      Intravenous Lidocaine, Intravenous Ketamine, Intravenous Lidocaine and Ketamine or Placebo.
      Subjects will perform a six-minute walk test prior to surgery and on the second day
      postoperatively. After surgery and on days 1 and 2 after surgery, subjects will rate their
      pain. On day 1 postoperatively, subjects will rate their fatigue. On postoperative days 1 and
      2 incisional pain will be analysed using von Frey filaments. Two hours after surgery, 10 ml
      of venous blood will be sampled for cytokine analysis. Telephone follow up will take place 6
      and 12 months postoperatively to access pain and quality of life.
