    
      The objective of this study is to quantify and draw inferences on the efficacy of a multiple
      level liposomal bupivacaine intercostal nerve blockade (LBINB) in patients with multiple
      traumatic rib fractures.

      The primary objective is to assess the quality and duration of analgesia based on numeric
      grading pain scale, improvement in pulmonary function parameters, reduction pulmonary
      complications, and duration of hospitalization in patients receiving LBINBs relative to those
      receiving the current standard of care, CEA, in patients recovering from multiple traumatic
      rib fractures.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess cost and rate of complications associated
      with LBINB relative to CEA.

      This is a two arm, randomized trial. Patients suffering multiple traumatic rib fractures will
      be offered CEA or LBINB. As the current standard of care, CEA will serve as the control, and
      outcomes measured in patients receiving LBINB will be statistically evaluated relative to the
      CEA control group.

      All patients will receive standardized NSAID and opioid analgesia protocol for break through
      pain, as well as standardized routines for pulmonary hygiene and physiotherapy.

      Indications for CEA and LBINB in this study include patients suffering from traumatic
      thoracic injury with greater than or equal to 3 fractured ribs
