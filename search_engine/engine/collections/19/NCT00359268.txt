      Viruses have also been identified as the probable cause of a number of malignancies including
      hepatocellular carcinoma and cervical carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to identify
      novel viruses (or known viruses) that are associated with diseases whose etiology is unknown.
      Blood samples, body fluids, or discarded tissues (e.g. previous biopsy or autopsy material)
      saliva swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, skin biopsies, or mucosal biopsies will be obtained from
      patients with clinical syndromes or diseases whose etiology is unknown. Highly sensitive
      assays using the polymerase chain reaction will be performed to attempt to identify novel or
      known viruses that might be present in the blood, body fluids, or tissues. Knowledge gained
      from this study could provide important insights into the cause of diseases whose etiology is
      presently unknown.
