      2010); all participants will continue to receive usual care from their GP. All patients will
      be examined at the beginning of the study and will undergo a check-up every 3 months. 355 of
      the patients will be randomly allocated to receive devices for Remote Patient Monitoring
      which will measure various parameters on a daily basis (e.g., weight, blood pressure, heart
      rate). The devices are mobile and can be used at home or elsewhere.
