    
      Patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 with and without without diabetic retinopathy (on
      biomicroscopy examination) who need cataract surgery, will undergo OCT angiography
      examination prior to their cataract surgery. Average vessel density (%) in superficial
      capillary plexus, deep capillary plexus and choriocapillaris, parafoveal vessel density (%)
      in the superficial and deep plexuses, FAZ area (mm2) in the superficial capillary plexus, FAZ
      circularity, retinal thickness, microaneurysms and capillary non-perfusion will be taken into
      analysis.

      Patients will be examined on the first day after the cataract surgery with
      phacoemulsification and in the bag posterior chamber lens implantation.

      All patients will undergo OCT angiography examination four weeks after their cataract
      surgery.
