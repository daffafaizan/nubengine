      history of cardiac events. Venous blood samples will also be collected from all subjects for
      measurement of sedimentation rate, myeloperoxidase, and IgG levels. Statistical analysis will
      then be done, in attempt to identify a difference in gum recession depth and/or serum
      inflammatory markers among those with and without prior cardiac events.
