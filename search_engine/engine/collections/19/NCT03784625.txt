      part that consists of an injection of [131I]ICF01012 at a diagnostic dose (185 MBq) in order
      to preselect patients who will receive the therapeutic dose according to the dosimetry
      results : binding of [131I]ICF01012 on at least a tumoral lesion and an acceptable radiation
      absorbed dose to major organs.
