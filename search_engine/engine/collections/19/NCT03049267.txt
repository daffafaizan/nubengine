      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent, debilitating skin
      disease. It is characterized by painful, deep-seated, inflamed boils in the inverse areas of
      the body, most commonly the axillae, inguinal and anogenital regions.

      Systemic therapy with immunosuppressive agents (systemic corticosteroids, dapsone,
      cyclosporin) has been investigated in the past decades and has shown limited efficacy. The
      use of the selective immunosuppressant apremilast has not yet been evaluated in HS. The
      investigators hypothesize a beneficial effect of apremilast in HS patients, similar to the
      efficacy of apremilast in psoriasis patients. Namely, it has been shown that the immune
      dysregulation in the pathogenesis of HS shows many similarities with that of psoriasis.
      Moreover, the TNF-Î± blocker adalimumab was registered for HS after approval for the treatment
      in patients with psoriasis.
