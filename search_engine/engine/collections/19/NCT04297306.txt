      million. Obesity surgery currently offers the only long term cure but it carries substantial
      risk to a group of patients who are often young with other obesity related health concerns;
      including of the heart and lungs.

      The need to improve the condition of the heart and lungs within this patient group prior to
      surgery is essential. Activity can improve these organs and promote a much lower risk during
      surgery, reducing the risk of heart attacks or dangerous abnormal rhythms of the heart from
      occurring during the procedure.

      Although exercise alone cannot support long term weight-loss it is vital to promoting a
      stronger healthier heart in the short term prior to surgery.

      This study aims to explore the use of Virtual Reality Gaming to increase activity within this
      patient group compared to simply encouraging exercise as is undertaken in standard current
      practice. The initial consideration is as to whether this new media is capable of increasing
      activity in this group and hopefully improve their heart and lungs going into surgery.
