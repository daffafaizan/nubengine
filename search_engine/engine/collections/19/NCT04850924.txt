      valley in the Nice hinterland were devastated by this natural disaster. Nine people died
      during this storm and hundreds of families were affected (house washed away or
      uninhabitable). This led to emergency evacuations on October 3 of several families. The
      inhabitants of some villages have been subjected to prolonged stress (lack of water and
      electricity, difficulty in supplying food, fear of another storm). These villages were
      isolated for a period varying from fifteen days to over three months. These people are
      particularly exposed to psychological consequences.

      Between October 3 and October 30, the CUMP (medico-psychological emergency unit) was
      mobilized to provide psychological first aid to these families. Among those seen in emergency
      116 children were taken care of. In order to assess the immediate symptoms of the children,
      the investigators used an assessment sheet specific to the developmental ages of the
      children.

      All children seen in an emergency between October 3 and October 30, 2020 were assessed by
      child psychiatrists or by psychologists trained in emergency and pediatric psychological
      trauma.
