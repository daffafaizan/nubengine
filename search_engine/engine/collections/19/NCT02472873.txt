    
      Women who are candidates for elective laparoscopy for the treatment of ovarian ensometriomas
      will be assigned to one of two groups - a) standard cystectomy treatment, b) aspiration and
      sclerotherapy using 95% ethanol. The women will be introduced with both operative options and
      they will choose which one they prefer. After an elaborate explanation about the study they
      will sign an informed consent form. the following data will be collected prior the operation:
      age, gravity & parity, operative history, general medical history, the cyst size, AMH (Anti
      Mullerian Hormone), AFC (Antral Follicle Count), symptoms related to endometriosis (through a
      questionnaire), fertility history including any fertility treatment in the past and planned
      pregnancy after the operation.

      The laparoscopy will take place in Meir Medical Center. in the study group the cyst content
      will be aspirated and flushed with normal saline. 95% sterile ethanol will be instilled into
      the cyst through a foley catheter. Ethanol will be left in the cyst for a maximum of 15 min
      then aspirated as completely as possible following normal saline flushing. In the control
      group we will follow the standard treatment which is cystectomy.

      The women will be followed 4 and 6 months after the surgery.
