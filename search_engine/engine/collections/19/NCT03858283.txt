      live independently, functional capacity and safety. Thus, patients often suffer
      neuropsychiatric disorders and need help from another person to live every day. Due to the
      burden of caregiving, the main caregivers can have anxiety and depression symptoms. With this
      scenario, we will conduct this randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of
      mindfulness program for caregiver's vs control group on: 1) neuropsychiatric disorders,
      cognitive function, daily activity living and quality of life in Alzheimer patients; 2)
      anxiety and depression symptoms, burden of caregiving, quality of life, psychological
      well-being, occupational balance, executive function and self-compassion in their caregivers.
