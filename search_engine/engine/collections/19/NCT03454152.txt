      the heart depends upon the pH level. In mild acidosis, there is increased catecholamine
      release which is compensated by increased inotropy, chronotropy, cardiac output and
      peripheral vascular resistance. When acidosis is severe, i.e. pH is less than 7.2, the H+
      ions have a direct cardiac depressant action.

      Fluid and electrolyte imbalance is very common in DKA, Potassium deficit is one of the most
      important of electrolyte imbalances seen in DKA as it can lead to fatal arrhythmias. The most
      common and perhaps the earliest ECG finding in hypokalemia is a prominent U wave, usually
      evident in leads II and III. The most common cardiac arrhythmias are atrial premature
      contractions, atrial tachycardia with or without atrioventricular block, supraventricular and
      ventricular premature contractions.
