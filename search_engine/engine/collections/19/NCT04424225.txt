      acute visual effects of the drug psilocybin by measuring the impact of acute psilocybin
      intoxication on a perceptual task known as visual surround suppression, compared to an active
      placebo control. The data collected in the proposed experiment will make important
      contributions to knowledge of how psilocybin impacts contextual processing in the brain.
      Moreover, this will in turn inform the neurobiology of visual surround suppression in
      general, providing the first investigation of links between surround suppression and
      serotonergic pathways in humans. Furthermore, the impact of psilocybin on surround
      suppression will complement recent discoveries of differences in surround suppression present
      in certain clinical populations. Taken together, these points suggest that this relatively
      simple and straightforward study could have significant payoff in its contribution to
      knowledge, not only of the effects of psilocybin but also of key brain processes underpinning
      human vision and context processing more broadly.
