      bronchial asthma in children. Sublingual immunotherapy seems to be the most promising
      alternative to traditional specific subcutaneous injection immunotherapy.

      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy applied
      preseasonal and seasonal in ultra-rush scheme in children with bronchial asthma allergic to
      grass pollen. We will assess clinical symptoms, reliever drugs usage, lung function, chosen
      markers of allergic inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity with methacholine, and presence
      and type of allergy after two years of SLIT in children with asthma.

      After two years the study will be unblinded, all the children will be given grass pollen
      allergen extract for a year.
