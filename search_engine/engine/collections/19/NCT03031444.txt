      curative resection rate was still low and more than 2/3 of the patients would experience
      tumor recurrence.This study was designed to formulate a more accurate and individual
      evaluation system via the multivariate analysis.

      Up to now, there was no data to demonstrate the addition of cetuximab to perioperative
      chemotherapy could decrease recurrence and prolong survival for RAS wild-type, high
      risk(Clinical Risk Scoreâ‰¥3) resectable colorectal liver metastasis patients. This study was
      also designed to elucidate this question and to observe the objective response rate(ORR) and
      the safety data of the regime.
