    
      1. Determine the choice of emotion regulation strategies used by frail sedentary older
           adults (60+ years; n=24). Frailty will be defined as a gait speed <0.8 m/sec.

           Hypothesis: Frail sedentary older adults will choose avoidant emotion regulation
           strategies.

        2. Examine whether a peer-led, community-based, group-exercise program lasting 12-weeks
           improves the selection of emotion regulation strategies in frail sedentary older adults
           as compared to those receiving support services (12/group).

           Hypothesis: Exercise will result in higher use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies
           than support services.

        3. Examine if improved selection of emotional regulation strategies with exercise
           translates into increased daily physical activity and reduced sedentary behavior by
           frail older adults as compared to those receiving support services.

           Hypothesis: Exercise will significantly increase daily physical activity and decrease
           sedentary behavior than support services.

        4. Determine if improvements in emotional regulation strategy selection and daily physical
           activity levels positively influence health and well-being (i.e. health status, physical
           function, mood, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and sense of loneliness and isolation).

      Hypothesis: Exercise-induced improvements in emotion regulation and increased daily physical
      activity will be associated with improved overall health and well-being as compared to
      support services.
