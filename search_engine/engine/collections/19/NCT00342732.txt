      adults over the age of 20 being overweight. In some populations, obesity is even more
      prevalent. Although there have been a number of advances in our understanding of the genetics
      of obesity, the environmental influences on the genetic expression of obesity requires
      further investigation.

      In an effort to understand some of the influences on the high prevalence of obesity, the
      present study was designed to investigate what drives how much people eat. More specifically,
      we will try to understand what drives food intake utilizing 1) questionnaires that assess
      eating behavior, 2) measurements in blood, urine or fat tissue, and 3) genotypic associations
      to investigate the various factors that control what and how much people eat. We will make
      these evaluations by assessing eating behavior, food preferences including usual fat intake
      and preferences for high fat foods, body image perceptions, and energy expenditure. It is
      hoped that the data gathered from this study will elucidate some of the risk factors for the
      development of obesity.
