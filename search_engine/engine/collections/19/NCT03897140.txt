    
      To validate clinical use of Bay Labs, Inc. EchoGPS guidance software by registered nurses
      (RNs) with no prior scanning experience to acquire limited two-dimensional echocardiograms.
      In this study an echocardiogram protocol using the EchoGPS interface with the Terason uSmart
      3200t, an FDA 510(k)-cleared, commercially available ultrasound device will be performed.
      Participants will have two scans, one by a registered nurse (RN) using the Terason uSmart
      3200t with EchoGPS (Study Exam) and one by a sonographer using the Reference Device without
      EchoGPS guidance (Control Exam), under the same protocol. Study is non-significant risk
      (NSR).
