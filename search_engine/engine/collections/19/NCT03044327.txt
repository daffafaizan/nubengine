      can be captured by gas-enhanced Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analysis of exhaled
      breath. While MRI is able to provide localized information on inflammatory processes, exhaled
      breath analysis can capture integral information over time. Assuming that these novel
      techniques correlate with cellular measures of inflammation, repetitive measurements to
      investigate onset and duration of action of investigational new drugs will be made possible.

      The evaluation whether LPS induced changes in the lung can be captured and monitored by MRI
      will be performed by correlation of multiple endpoints describing the cellular composition of
      the airways with variables derived from MRI and breath analysis.
