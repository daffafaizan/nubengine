      mechanisms, a process known as neuroplasticity, that intend to reorganize the neural
      connectivity and repair the damaged tissue around the injury region. Several studies revealed
      that rehabilitation during this acute period of injury would enhance the functional outcome
      of the paretic arm presumably by modulating the heightened neuroplastic mechanism.
      Specifically, it has been suggested that novel interventions that interact with the
      neuroplastic mechanisms of recovery are particularly needed for stroke survivors whom initial
      arm impairments are severe.

      The rationale of this study is to explore if an EMG controlled device can be added to the
      acute rehabilitation for stroke subjects with severe arm deficit. The study will also
      investigate if the application of such a device would lead to an even better enhancement of
      clinical outcomes compared to standard care. Because of such neurophysiological changes
      during the acute phase, the study aims to correlate the neurophysiological changes with the
      enhancement gained as a result of practicing with an EMG controlled device in this
      population. Thus, test the premise that adding practice with an EMG controlled device to the
      acute rehabilitation of subjects with severe arm impairments acts as novel rehabilitative
      tool that interact with the neuroplastic mechanisms of recovery to enhance clinical outcomes
      for these subjects.
