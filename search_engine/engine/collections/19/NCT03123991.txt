    
      The study has the primary aim to examine whether a transdiagnostic CBT intervention adapted
      as a school-based universal preventive intervention and delivered by professionals is more
      effective than the usual school curriculum in: (1) reducing symptoms of anxiety and
      depression and (2) preventing high levels of anxiety and depression from developing in 13-18
      years old adolescents.

      The study has the following secondary aims: (1) Examine the reduction in negative affect,
      anxiety sensitivity, emotional avoidance and emotional symptoms' interference levels at
      post-treatment as compared to pre-treatment levels; (3) Examine the improvement in positive
      affect, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, quality of life, school adjustment, and general
      indiscipline at post-treatment as compared to pre-treatment levels; (4) Examine the
      moderating role of gender, age, social economic status, personality traits, conduct problems,
      hyperactivity/inattention, and peer problems on the effectiveness of the UP-A program; (5)
      Assess the moderating role of home practice, understanding of basic concepts of the program,
      number of sessions attended, practice of specific strategies and behavior during sessions (6)
      Examine if the effects at post-treatment are maintained at the 3 month follow up; (7) Assess
      the feasibility and acceptability of implementing UP-A in a group format and in a school
      setting.
