    
      This pilot project, called "H2NOE-Wasserschulen" (Water Schools in Lower Austria), aims to
      increase the water consumption of school children in elementary schools, to raise awareness
      of water drinking in children, parents and school teachers and to promote water drinking in
      Lower Austria in general.

      By increasing the consumption of water, the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages may
      decrease and in the long run may have a positive impact on children's body weight and tooth
      status.

      All intervention schools receive refillable water bottles for each school child and drying
      racks for each classroom. Furthermore, in each school an information session for all school
      teachers is held and the teachers receive prepared educational material. The control schools
      do not receive the water bottles nor the educational material.

      For the study, the investigators recruited 22 intervention schools and 32 control schools.
      Outcomes will be measured by paper and pencil questionnaires of school children at third
      grade of participating elementary schools in Lower Austria and with online questionnaires of
      teachers at baseline, at the end of the intervention (after one school year/June 2019) and at
      the one-year follow-up (after two school years/June 2020).

      For process evaluation outcomes, the investigators will carry out focus group discussions
      with a subsample of school children and teachers and include questions in the respective
      questionnaires for school children, teachers and school headmasters. Parents will have the
      possibility to give feedback online.
