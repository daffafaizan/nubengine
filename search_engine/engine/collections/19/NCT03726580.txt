      regional anesthesia on the olfactory threshold, olfactory identification and endocrine
      regulation of associative memory in the postoperative period in old age group.

      Methods: 600 patients (> 60years ) fulfilling the criteria of the American society of
      anesthesiologists and II status were selected for this prospective single-blinded randomized
      controlled study. Patients were randomized into one of four groups to receive regional
      anesthesia (control group), general anesthesia with sevoflurane, general anesthesia with
      isoflurane and total intravenous anesthesia with propofol.

      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), olfactory threshold, and olfactory identification were
      tested at 12 hours preoperatively (T0), at 3 hours postoperatively (T1) and at the time of
      discharge or postoperative 3 days (T2). In addition, serum melatonin levels were estimated at
      T0 and T1.

      N-butyl alcohol was used to test the olfactory threshold and the Pocket Smell Test TM series
      (PSTs) was used to test olfactory identification. Data were analyzed using the one-way
      analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney tests.
