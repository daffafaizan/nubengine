      system in the morbidly obese adolescent population in the United States. We also propose to
      take advantage of the opportunity for liver biopsy and the data collected for the FDA study
      in adolescents to answer several questions: 1) what is the true incidence of non-alcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its variants in morbidly obese adolescents; 2) what is the
      course of the NAFLD disease in adolescents who have undergone weight loss, including the
      progression from steatosis to NASH/ fibrosis or the progression of NASH to cirrhosis? 3) What
      are the factors implicated in this progression and 4) Is there a link between the excess
      visceral fat, MS and NAFLD as assessed by parallel changes in metabolic syndrome (MS) and
      NAFLD following weight loss intervention. The LAPBAND may provide obese adolescents with a
      significantly less morbid and reversible surgical option for weight loss.
