      artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass, the conscious openness to participate in
      the study. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits, diagnosis, additional diseases,
      drugs used, surgery, intervention, peroperative supportive treatments, left ventricular
      ejection fraction, post operative blood and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (min), cross
      clamp time (min), duration of operation, postoperative extubation period, intensive care day
      of hospitalization, day of hospitalization will be recorded.The study was planned in 3
      groups. Group G5 (control group: no changes will be made to the value of PEEP). Group G10
      [after 30 minutes of admission (time 0) the PEEP will be raised to 10 cmH2O (time1) for 30
      minutes and then returned to 5 cmH2O (time 2)]. Group G15 [after 30 minutes of admission
      (time 0) the PEEP will be raised to 15 cmH2O (time 1) for 30 minutes and then returned to 5
      cm H2O (time 2)]. At each time of protocol (0, 1 and 2) will be collected: arterial blood gas
      measurements (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] and partial pressure of carbon
      dioxide ([PaCO2]), the ratio between the partial oxygen pressure, inspired oxygen fraction
      (PaO2/FiO2) and pH. Also, will be performed parameters of tissue perfusion: central venous
      oxygen saturation ([SVO2]), arterial blood lactate, venoarterial CO2 difference ([Dif VA
      CO2]) and vital signs. In all other respects, treatment will follow the standard of care.
