      populations and the prevalence of MG strains with macrolide-resistance associated gene
      mutations is increasing . While no MG diagnostic assays have FDA clearance in the United
      States (US), treatment for NGU is primarily focused on managing potential infection with
      Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) using single dose 1 gm Azithromycin (a macrolide class of drug).
      Without testing for MG that might alter NGU treatment strategies, the current paradigm may be
      contributing to selective pressure resulting in increased macrolide resistance in MG. In
      Australia, awareness of the prevalence of MG and macrolide resistance-associated mutations
      has been facilitated by an approved diagnostic test manufactured by SpeeDx. Ltd. As a result
      of the epidemiologic information generated by this diagnostic tool [MG ResistancePlus (MRP)
      Assay], the Australian Sexual Health Alliance, who publish the Australian Sexually
      Transmitted Infection (STI) Management Guidelines for Use in Primary Care, have revised the
      management of men with NGU and MG infection. The new management guidelines include initial
      treatment of NGU with doxycycline, and concomitant testing for MG and macrolide resistance,
      with subsequent treatment for MG infected patients according to resistance results. We
      propose using the MRP assay in a population of men with NGU to determine the clinical impact
      of the Australian treatment strategy compared to the current standard of care for NGU on
      clearance of MG infection.
