      suggests that micro-ultrasound system is more sensitive than conventional
      transrectal-ultrasound (TRUS) to detect prostate cancer (PCa). the PRI-MUS (prostate risk
      identification using micro-ultrasound) scoring system was developed and validated to assess
      the risk of prostate cancer for targeted biopsy with the micro-ultrasound platform, similar
      to the PIRADS scoring system for suspicious areas on mpMRI. This project will compare
      micro-ultrasound imaging modality to the current gold-standard imaging for prostate cancer,
      mpMRI. By applying both modalities to the same patients, the investigators will provide a
      direct comparison of their screening abilities in terms of sensitivity, specificity, negative
      predictive value and positive predictive value. It will build evidence to demonstrate that
      micro-ultrasound may replace MRI/Fusion biopsy in these patients.This project aims to
      demonstrate that the micro-ultrasound 1) provides more sensitive initial biopsy, reducing the
      need for repeated procedures, thus lowering the rate of severe sepsis and the number of
      cancers found after local or regional progression, and 2) reduces the need for mpMRI
      following initial biopsy.
