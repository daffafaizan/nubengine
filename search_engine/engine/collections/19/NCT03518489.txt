    
      This is a randomized, single -center study conducted in China to evaluate Lappaconitine
      Adhesive Patch in the reduction severity of radiation induced oral mucositis pain in patients
      receiving solo radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      Patients will reveive daily fractions of IMRT (2.0 - 2.2 Gy) to a total of 60 - 72 Gy over
      approximately 7 weeks, plus cisplatin administered 80 - 100 mg/m2 once every three weeks for
      3 doses or 30 - 40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6-7 doses (investigator's choice).

      Patients in both arms received Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy(IMRT) :All target
      volumes were outlined slice by slice on the axial contrast-enhanced CT with MR fusion images
      in the treatment planning system. The target volumes were defined in accordance with the
      International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements Reports 50 and 62. The
      prescribed dose is 68-72 Gy to PTVnx (Planning target volume of the primary tumor), 64-68 Gy
      to GTVnd (Gross tumor volume of the cervical lymph node), 60- 64Gy to PTVnd and PTV1
      (Planning target volume 1), and 54-58 Gy to PTV2 (Planning target volume 2) in 30-32
      fractions.

      Patients will be randomized equally to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

      Arm A: Lappaconitine Adhesive Patch per day, concurrent with stardard care for oral mucositis
      Arm B: stardard care for oral mucositis

      All patients will be assessed weekly for oral mucositis per WHO grading criteria until the
      completion of IMRT, and once weekly thereafter (if necessary) for 7 weeks, or until oral
      mucositis resolves to â‰¤ Grade 1.

      Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled to ensure that roughly 80 patients per arm
      complete treatments for primary endpoint analysis.
