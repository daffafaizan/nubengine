      compare the efficacy of a PU prevention programme versus usual PU prevention for older people
      in eight for-profit private nursing homes in Hong Kong. For-profit private NHs recruited will
      be randomly assigned as experimental or control groups. The nursing homes in the experimental
      group will be implemented a PU prevention programme. The programme includes a training course
      which was tailor-made for health workers(HWs) and persona care workers (PCWs) and also a
      16-week PU prevention protocol. The outcome measures are incidence and prevalence rate of PUs
      as well as level of PU knowledge and skill among care staff in the nursing homes. In data
      analysis, survival analysis will be adopted for identifying PU incidence and prevalence rate.
      GEE will be used to analyze the time and effect differences of PU knowledge and skills among
      the care staff between two groups.
