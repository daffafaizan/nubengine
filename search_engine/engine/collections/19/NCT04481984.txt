      comparative study with a 2-month follow-up period, conducted in a rheumatology outpatient
      clinic of a university hospital, between July 2016-June 2019. Female patients with SSc who
      fulfilled the 2013 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for systemic sclerosis were included in
      the study. Patients with neurological disorders, arthritis, myositis, amputation of fingers,
      serious contracture resisting handgrip, and history of undergoing hand surgery were excluded
      from the study. Patients were enrolled in the study after they signed the written informed
      consent. Following the assessment of patients in terms of eligibility, patients were
      randomized into an exercise and a control group. The computerized block randomization method
      was used to randomize subjects into groups. Both groups were informed about systemic
      sclerosis and they received the printed materials that include recommendations such as
      avoiding cold and trauma. The treatment group participated in a single hand exercise training
      (isometric hand exercise and self-administered stretching) applied by a physiatrist. They
      additionally received the printable instructions for exercises. Compliance was assessed by a
      checklist, which included all information on how to exercise and how many times to do them.
      The investigators aimed to investigate the impact of hand exercise program on hand function
      and demonstrate its influence on health status, quality of life, and psychological status of
      patients with SSc.
