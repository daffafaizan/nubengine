      hearing loss (SNHL), and a major cause of neuro-disability. High maternal CMV prevalence
      seems to be consistently associated with high prevalence of cCMV infection but the associated
      morbidity might be different from one population to another.

      There exists no serologic marker useful to differentiate non-primary infection from primary
      infection. Since the morbidity of cCMV is similar between both primary and non-primary
      maternal infection, and to be infected in the first trimester is the major risk factor for
      long-term sequelae in neonates. Hence, it is needed to focus on finding markers that predict
      cCMV after maternal infection in the first trimester of pregnancy.

      To date, the epidemiology of cCMV, the morbidity related to cCMV in Vietnamese population and
      the predictive value of Cytomegalovirus Polymerase Chain Reaction (CMV PCR) in maternal blood
      and urine in the first trimester remain unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct this
      study.
