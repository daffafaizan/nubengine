      consists of determining concentration, progressive mobility and morphology of spermatozoa.
      However, the diagnostic accuracy of conventional semen analysis is poor and has very limited
      relationship with the outcome of assisted reproductive medicine. Preliminary data suggest
      that differences in chromatin density and epigenetic status of sperm may be more relevant, in
      particular with respect to the growth and differentiation of early embryos.

      Chromatin density, morphology, mitochondrial status and epigenetic state in sperm of
      infertile men with disturbances of early embryo development in vitro will be compared with
      those of infertile men with normal embryo development and with fertile controls.

      Primary outcome:

      Features of chromatin density will be determined through staining of large numbers of
      spermatozoa. Differences in the staining results will be compared with known fertility
      outcome.

      Secondary outcome:

      Development of significant staining parameters towards the selection against sperm with
      reduced embryonic competence and/or in favor of sperm supporting embryonic development after
      assisted reproduction, thereby using flow cytometry and sorting (FACS) .
