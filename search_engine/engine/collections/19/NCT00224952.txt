      therapeutic drug use. A simple and clinically useful classification is to divide adverse
      events into those that are dose-dependent and largely predictable from the known
      pharmacologic properties of the compound in question, and those that are dependent on
      characteristics unique to susceptible individuals, or idiosyncratic in nature.

      The long term objective of this research is to characterize the mechanisms responsible for
      the pathogenesis of idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reactions in children, particularly those
      involving carbamazepine and other aromatic anticonvulsants.

      The study is divided into two phases. Phase 1 of the study involves collecting urine from 50
      patients taking CBZ therapeutically. Participants will be asked to provide a spot urine
      sample during routine health visits. The urine will be analyzed for the presence of CBZ and
      its metabolites. In Phase 2 of the study, urine will be collected from patients taking either
      CBZ or VPA therapeutically. If blood samples are drawn from these patients for medical
      purposes not related to this study the residual blood sample will be recovered before it is
      discarded for use in genotyping analysis. Participants will be asked to provide a urine
      sample covering one complete dosing interval of CBZ or VPA (preferably overnight). Patients
      will also be followed longitudinally, with urine collections at each clinic visit over at
      least a two year period.
