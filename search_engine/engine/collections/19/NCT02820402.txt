      trimester of pregnancy from eight obstetric (OB) offices of a multi-site group practice in
      eastern Massachusetts. 2,128 of the women had a live birth and approximately 1,600
      mother-child pairs are still involved in the study. Project Viva collects data annually from
      multiple sources, including questionnaires, interviews, medical records, examinations, and
      biospecimen samples. Project Viva intends to follow participants as long as there is grant
      funding and interest from the participants. Some of the most beneficial health findings come
      from long-term follow-up.
