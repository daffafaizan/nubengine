      standard care therapy for VOC or to receive standard care therapy plus a 15-minute virtual
      reality (VR) session. They will be additionally randomized into strata by age: 6 to 11 years,
      12 to 18 years, and 19 to 25 years. At the end of therapy or therapy plus the VR session,
      they will be asked to complete a 5-minute satisfaction survey. Information will also be
      collected from the medical record about the pain episode, including pain scores, medicines
      used, and time needed for pain to lessen.

      Standard care for management of an acute VOC includes parenteral hydration and pain
      management with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as Toradol or Ibuprofen, and
      opioids. Pain scores will be measured at three different time points: baseline at
      presentation, at 30±10 minutes after first intravenous (IV) analgesic medication, and at
      60±10 minutes after first IV analgesic medication.

      Use of VR will be included in addition to the standard care for management of patients
      randomized to VR arm. VR is an interactive technology that allows the user to interface with
      a three dimensional computer-generated environment by means of a lightweight head mounted
      display. The user is transported into a relaxing VR environment that diverts their attention
      away from pain. The duration of VR session is 15 minutes. Pain scores will be measured at
      three different time points: baseline at presentation, at 15±10 minutes after completion of
      VR therapy, and at 60±10 minutes after completion of VR therapy.
