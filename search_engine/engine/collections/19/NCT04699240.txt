    
      vulvovaginal candidiasis is common disease in women. Its refractory and high recurrence rate
      has always been a clinical problem. Some cases even recur several times a year, and those who
      recur more than four times a year are diagnosed as recurrent vaginal candidal infection
      Candidiasis, RVVC）。 The common clinical regimen for VVC is to strengthen and consolidate
      clotrimazole vaginal tablets for up to 25 weeks. However, long-term antibiotic treatment will
      lead to the decrease of vaginal microflora and the disappearance of inflammation and
      pathogenic bacteria, which will greatly increase the probability of repeated infection and
      become a barrier to clinical treatment. If probiotics are added in the treatment, the
      abundance of lactobacillus can be ensured while antibiotic treatment is carried out, the
      homeostasis of reproductive tract flora can be reestablished, the defense mechanism can be
      improved fundamentally, and the re invasion of pathogenic bacteria can be reduced, which will
      become a new treatment idea and method for radical cure of refractory RVVC.

      We hypothesize that Clotrimazole vaginal tablets with oral Lactobacillus is better than
      Clotrimazole vaginal tablets in Preventing the Recurrence of vulvovaginalcandidiasis.
