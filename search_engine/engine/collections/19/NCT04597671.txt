      patients. For radically treated patients, stage III has the highest risk for brain metastases
      with a cumulative incidence of brain metastases after radical treatment of approximately 30%
      for which there is no cure at the moment, decreasing the long-term survival and Quality of
      Life. Strategies to reduce incidence of brain metastases are necessary.

      Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) has been shown to reduce the incidence of brain
      metastases in patients with NSCLC. However, PCI leads to a neurocognitive impairment in about
      25% of patients without altering the QoL.

      The addition of durvalumab after chemo-radiotherapy in stage III NSCLC could reduce the
      incidence of brain metastases. In pre-clinical models, immunotherapy potentiates the effects
      of radiotherapy by a factor two to five. This makes the combination of PCI and immunotherapy
      interesting to evaluate whether it can further decrease the percentage of brain metastases as
      well as preserve organ function as a lower radiation dose can probably be used when combined
      with an antiprogrammed death (ligand)1 (PD(L)-1).

      The hypothesis of the NVALT28 trial is that the combination of PCI with durvalumab will
      decrease the incidence of brain metastases from 30% to 15 % with durvalumab and to a maximum
      of 5% with the addition of low-dose PCI. This strategy would make brain metastases in stage
      III NSCLC history and this would improve QoL.
