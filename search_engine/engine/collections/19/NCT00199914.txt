      morbidity and health care expense. It affects more than 60% of Western World adults over the
      age of 65 years. It causes pain and dysfunction in 20% of elderly persons. It can affect any
      joint containing hyaline cartilage; knee is the most commonly affected joint. There are many
      strategies for the treatment of knee OA but a curative method has not been found. Treatment
      is therefore aimed to relief symptoms and to prevent further functional deterioration. It is
      unclear whether any of the treatment modalities is efficacious. Shortwave diathermy (SWD) is
      one of deep heat widely applied to alleviate the symptoms associated with OA. The efficacy of
      SWD for the treatment of OA knee is still inconclusive. The outcome of treatment in previous
      reports varies from null to positive effect. This discrepancy is largely due to the different
      research methodology, the inadequate sample size, the methods used in outcome assessment, and
      the treatment protocols.

      Comparison(s): Peri- or postmenopausal women with OA knee are randomized into two groups,
      receiving a course of either therapeutic SWD or sham SWD. The main outcome measured is the
      change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index.
