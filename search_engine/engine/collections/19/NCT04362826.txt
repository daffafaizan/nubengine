    
      This study will investigate the efficacy of the investigational product (a novel probiotic)
      on altering the microbiome (bacteriomeand mycobiome) and polymicrobial biofilms in the gut of
      50 women with breast cancer given the novel probiotic, compared to 50 women with breast
      cancer given a placebo.

      The objectives of this study are to:

        1. Determine the efficacy profile of the novel probiotic

        2. Analyze bacteriome and mycobiome profiles as well as polymicrobial biofilm composition
           from breast tissue and stool before and after consumption of the probiotic.

        3. Compare quality of life (QoL) of those receiving novel probiotic compared to placebo.
