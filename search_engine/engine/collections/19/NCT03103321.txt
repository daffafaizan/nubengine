      I. To test the comparative effectiveness of decision aids (DA's) on patient knowledge.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the impact of in-visit DA's alone compared to usual care on quality of life
      outcomes and treatment utilization.

      II. To test the impact of out-of-visit DA's alone compared to usual care on quality of life
      outcomes and treatment utilization.

      III. To test the impact of combined in-visit and out-of-visit DA's compared to both usual
      care and individual DAs on quality of life outcomes and treatment utilization.

      IV. To test the comparative effectiveness of DA's on minority men's knowledge. V. To compare
      clinic time required to administer the DA's across arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive decision aids "Knowing your Options" before and "Prostate Choice"
      during their consultation visit.

      ARM B: Patients receive "Knowing your Options" decision aid before their consultation visit.

      ARM C: Patients receive "Prostate Choice" decision aid during their consultation visit.

      ARM D: Patients undergo usual care.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 12 months.
