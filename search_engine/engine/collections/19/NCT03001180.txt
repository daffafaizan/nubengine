      affected children and their families. Advances in diagnosis, monitoring and therapies will be
      significantly improved if non-invasive biomarkers that are sensitive and specific can be
      identified. Obtaining a tissue biopsy to help in diagnosis can actually worsen the disease
      and so identification of specific blood biomarkers is highly desirable. Studies will measure
      angiogenic factors in serum and plasma samples at baseline and on therapy. Tissue removed
      during surgical resection or blood removed prior to sclerotherapy will be used to obtain
      cells and tissue for the assessment of where biomarkers are coming from and to identify
      disease-causing pathways for new therapeutic targeting.
