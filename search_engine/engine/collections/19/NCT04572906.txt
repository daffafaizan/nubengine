      isolation chamber medical device (chamber or device) and two (2) other sterile solutions.

      NTX-001 has been developed as surgical product to be used in conjunction with standard suture
      neurorrhaphy of a severed nerve. Use of NTX-001 is intended to safely accelerate the often
      slow and diminished return of function in repaired nerves. It often takes months and/or years
      to determine if function will be restored. By that point, restoration is often incomplete and
      can result in lifelong motor and/or sensory deficits. By reconnecting (PEG-fusion) a
      substantial number of axons within a severed nerve, the degeneration-regeneration cycle and
      subsequent atrophy may be reduced or even prevented for those axons and their targets,
      respectively. NTX-001 (PEG-fusion) has the potential to avoid the consequences of protracted
      denervation of distal target tissues by eliminating the period of total denervation thus
      reducing the time to stable recovery and providing greater innervation to affected tissues.
