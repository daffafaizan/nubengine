      parenteral formulation of the 2010/2011-season influenza vaccine, Inflexal V, using HA
      antigen obtained from 2 different production facilities, and to compare the immunogenicity of
      both formulations to pre-defined EMA criteria for the annual relicensing of seasonal
      influenza vaccines. The evaluation will be done in young adults and elderly.
