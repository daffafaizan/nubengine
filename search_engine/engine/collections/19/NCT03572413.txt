      either directly or by compression of the capillary vessels, causing a variable degree of
      ischemia reperfusion injury. The immune system can identify damage to host cells by
      recognising Danger-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) that are released upon cell death in
      an uncontrolled fashion, such as during surgical trauma. DAMPs elicit an immune response
      similar to the response to invading pathogens and induce an anti-inflammatory immune response
      strongly related to postoperative recovery, infectious complications and mortality. Low
      pressure PNP is associated with lower levels of serum pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines
      and better preservation of innate immune function.

      Objective: to establish the relationship between the use of low pressure pneumoperitoneum
      with deep neuromuscular blockade and innate immune function after laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery.

      Study design: a multi-center, blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Study population: adult individuals scheduled for laparoscopic colorectal surgery with a
      primary colonic anastomosis.

      Intervention: participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to either the
      experimental group (group A): low pressure PNP (8 mmHg) with deep NMB (PTC 1-2) or the
      control group (group B): normal pressure PNP (12 mmHg) with moderate NMB (TOF count 1-2).

      Primary endpoint: mononuclear cell responsiveness ex-vivo as reflected by IL-6 and IL-10
      release upon LPS stimulation.

      Secondary endpoints: peritoneal mesothelial hypoxia as reflected by peritoneal HIF1Î± mRNA
      expression, histological peritoneal mesothelial cell injury and plasma levels of DAMPs and
      cytokines.
