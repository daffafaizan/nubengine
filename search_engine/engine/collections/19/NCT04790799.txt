    
      Patients with suspected occupational hand eczema are recruited to the study on basis of their
      referral from general practitioner to dermatologist. Patients are randomised to either
      control or intervention group. The control group is treated and followed-up by the
      dermatologist they have been referred to, while the intervention group is treated and
      followed-up at Gentofte Hospital skin department with a maximum waiting time of 3 weeks. At
      the skin department at Gentofte Hospital, the patients in the intervention group receive
      patient education in prevention and treatment of hand eczema, glove counselling, personal
      product screening by a chemistry engineer, extended allergy testing and the standard
      treatment of hand eczema. Patients in both the control and intervention group are asked to
      fill out a questionnaire at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after inclusion in the study. The
      questionnaire contains questions about quality of life, severity of hand exzema,
      jobsituation, use of healthcare service and use of medicine. Furthermore, prescriptions of
      medicine are registered in both control and intervention group at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
