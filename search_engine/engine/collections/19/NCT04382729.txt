      patients who had undergone mechanical or non-invasive ventilation following pneumonia-induced
      respiratory failure. Patients are randomized to a control group (routine physical therapy for
      3 weeks) or a NMES group (routine physical therapy plus NMES of quadriceps and gastrocnemius
      muscles for 3 weeks). The primary outcome is physical performance assessed through the Short
      Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcomes include independence level, perceived
      fatigue, muscle strength, rectus femoris thickness, and walking performance. The SPBB and
      walking performance will be assessed once (after the 3-week intervention period), while all
      other outcomes will be assessed twice (before and after the intervention).

      NMES is a simple and non-invasive technique for muscle strengthening that is usually well
      tolerated, does not produce adverse effects, requires no or little cooperation from patients
      and is quite inexpensive. Therefore, proving the effectiveness of NMES therapy for physical
      and muscle function in COVID-19 patients could support its systematic incorporation in
      post-ICU rehabilitation protocols of patients presenting with post-intensive care syndrome.
