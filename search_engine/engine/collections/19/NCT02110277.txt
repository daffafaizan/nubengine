      although it is the second most common gynecologic malignancy. Ovarian cancer is not usually
      detected earlier than Stage III or IV because it is usually asymptomatic; yet survival is
      high with early stage disease. In addition, women with a pelvic mass noted on ultrasound that
      undergo oophorectomy have only a 1-3% risk of malignancy and thus 97-99% will be overtreated
      because of our inability to reliably differentiate benign from malignant masses with
      ultrasound. BRCA1 testing and family history will identify certain high-risk individuals who
      have a higher risk of malignancy and need a modality that will be more reliable in detecting
      early cancers to provide more accurate surveillance.We are developing a new transvaginal
      imaging device optimized for ovarian cancer detection, diagnosis and validated from ex vivo
      and in vivo clinical studies. This automated system may provide an early diagnostic tool for
      ovarian cancer in the future.
