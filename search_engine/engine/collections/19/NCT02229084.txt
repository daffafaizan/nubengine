    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational agent, P10s-PADRE, a peptide
      mimotope-based vaccine, in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients
      with clinical stage I, II or III estrogen-receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast
      cancer.

      This is a single-arm, multi-site Phase I/II study designed with the two goals being (1) to
      evaluate the feasibility of combining vaccination with the P10s-PADRE formulation with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and (2) to determine if the polymerase chain reaction (pCR) rate
      among ER-positive, HER2-negativebreast-cancer patients treated with the combination is
      significantly higher than the 8% rate observed among ER-positive breast-cancer subjects in a
      pooled analysis of seven randomized clinical trials. P10s-PADRE vaccine with MONTANIDEâ„¢ ISA
      51 VG as adjuvant will be given in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in female
      patients with clinical stage I, II or III ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.
