        -  To assess the feasibility of an internet-based protocol to collect clinical information
           and biological specimens from 2,000 never smokers with non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  To perform genome-wide association studies to identify alleles that predispose to lung
           cancer in patients that never smoked cigarettes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete an internet-based questionnaire using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data
      Capture) survey to determine eligibility. The survey consists of a detailed smoking
      questionnaire and questions to collect information regarding diagnosis, sex, age, ethnicity,
      treatment history, and any history of previous malignancies. Blood samples are then collected
      from eligible patients for DNA and other laboratory analyses. Patients' pathology reports are
      also reviewed.
