      Following online consent, participants will be randomly assigned to one of four trial arms
      affecting the appearance of an online grocery store. Once in the online grocery store,
      participants will complete a shopping task. The participants will have 11 specified items to
      add to their shopping cart (1 pizza, 1 burrito, Burger patties [meat or vegetarian],
      Breakfast sausages [meat or vegetarian], 1 frozen individual meal, 1 fruit or vegetable, 1
      loaf of bread, 1 sandwich filling [for example, ham, turkey, or peanut butter], 1 pack of
      tortillas, 1 taco filling [for example, steak, chicken, or beans], 1 taco topping [for
      example, cheese, lettuce, or onions]). Participants will be informed that they will not be
      spending any of their own money to complete the shopping task. After completing the shopping
      task, participants will be redirected to a survey. They will provide self-reported responses
      to survey questions (e.g. perceived healthfulness from eating red meat, perceived risk of
      cancer from eating red meat, thinking about the health/environmental harms of food products).
      Participants will also answer demographic and health related questions.
