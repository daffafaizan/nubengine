      subjects, between the ages of 18 and 85 years. Two to three days before the start of each
      treatment period the subjects will have their teeth cleaned to remove all accessible plaque
      and calculus and will be provided with a non-fluoride dentifrice to use until their next
      visit. At the beginning of each testing period, two gauze-covered 4 Ã— 4 mm partially
      demineralized human enamel specimens will be placed in the buccal flange area of the
      subject's mandibular partial denture. In addition, two gauze-covered 4 mm round partially
      demineralized bovine enamel specimens will be placed in the buccal surface of two posterior
      denture teeth of the same side of the partial denture. Once specimens are placed, subjects
      will wear their partial dentures twenty-four hours a day and use their assigned toothpaste
      twice daily, as instructed, until their next visit. Specimens will be removed after two weeks
      and the subjects will undergo a four to five day washout period followed by another cleaning
      and two to three day lead in period. This process will be repeated until all subjects have
      used all four test products. Changes in the mineral content of the enamel specimens will be
      assessed using the SMH and TMR. Enamel fluoride uptake (EFU) will be determined using the
      microdrill enamel biopsy technique. In addition the net acid resistance (NAR) and the
      comparative acid resistance (CAR) of the remineralized enamel specimens will be determined.
