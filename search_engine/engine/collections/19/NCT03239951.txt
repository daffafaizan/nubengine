      long-term benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In the past it has represented an immediate
      indication for surgery. Between 25% and 30% of men who underwent transurethral prostatectomy
      (TURP) had AUR as their main indication in older series and today most subjects failing to
      void after attempted catheter removal still undergo surgery. For this reason alone, AUR is an
      important and feared event from the viewpoint of the subject. The subject originally has
      inability to urinate, with increasing pain, and eventually a visit to the emergency room,
      catheterization, follow-up visits to the physicians, an attempt at catheter removal, and
      eventual recovery or surgery, which is both painful and time consuming.

      After the acute period most men with AUR will be offered a 'trial without catheter' (TWOC)
      and about half will resume spontaneous voiding. Most men who fail a TWOC, experience a
      recurrent episode of AUR, or have moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that
      are refractory to medical management will be considered for surgery.

      In the older literature, the risk of recurrent AUR was cited as 56% to 64% within 1 week of
      the first episode and 76% to 83% in men with diagnosed BPH.

      (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1476058/). Additional researches show that ten
      percent of men in their seventies and 30% in their eighties will have AUR within the next
      five years.

      Benign prostatic hyperplasia is the cause for the AUR in at least 65% of men presenting with
      AUR.

      In the below study of the natural history of BPH, the risk of AUR was 1.6% at five years for
      men aged 40-49 years and 10% at 70-79 years.
