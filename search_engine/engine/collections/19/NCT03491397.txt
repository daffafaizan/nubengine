      the safety and efficacy of genicular artery embolization (GAE) for treatment of symptomatic
      knee osteoarthritis (OA). Subjects will be treated with a genicular artery embolization (GAE)
      procedure performed with Embozene Microspheres. The microspheres will be delivered in a
      saline-contrast medium solution and will be delivered to the arteries supplying the areas of
      the subject's pain. The primary objective of this investigation is to assess safety of
      genicular artery embolization (GAE) for knee osteoarthritis (OA) using Embozene particles.
