    
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder involving a variety of clinical,
      behavioral and cognitive symptoms. 83 to 97% of patients have episodes of temper tantrum,
      associated with an important emotional lability. These different cognitive and behavioral
      limitations are barriers to the social integration of patients. The PWS also has
      repercussions on well-being and quality of life of the family. Thus, the present project
      focuses on the characteristics of emotional control related to the anger of children with PWS
      and its behavioral, cognitive and social implications. In addition, at a therapeutic level,
      our project assumes that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (t-VNS), a non-invasive,
      safe and inexpensive method, could be effective in reducing the severity of behavioral
      disorders such as temper tantrums while improving cognitive performance and social
      communication in the PWS.
