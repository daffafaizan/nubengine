      examples are pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension. But rather unknown is the fact,
      that right heart function presents as a prognostic parameter in a lot of (left heart)
      diseases, for example myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, left heart failure, but
      also in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or may be even diabetes mellitus. Since
      the left part of the heart has been studied by researchers more than fifty years, the right
      heart has moved into scientific focus not long ago.

      The tool of choice to examine the living heart is echocardiography. There are no relevant
      risks or complications.

      During an echocardiographic examination a lot of parameters are collected. To judge data in a
      clinical way reference values belonging to healthy persons are essential. Those values are
      highly dependant on sex, body size, age etc.

      Since pregnancy changes a lot in the human body, reference values from non pregnant woman of
      same age (published by American society of echocardiography and European Association of
      Echocardiography) are presumably not representative. So the investigators want to establish
      echocardiographic reference values of the right heart for pregnant women. Therefore an
      echocardiographic examination will be applied within each trimester of pregnancy and after
      delivery. As side arms the investigators want to explore, whether illness of either fetus or
      mother is connected with right heart affection.
