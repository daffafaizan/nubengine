      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who, according to ACC guidelines, are indicated
      as having an indication for oral anticoagulants (OA), but who are not receiving them, will be
      identified. Recruitment of participating physicians will also take place through
      collaboration with the PINNACLE Registry. Physician and patient participants will be asked to
      complete clinical surveys characterizing use and perception of OA therapy for each individual
      patient. The Baim Institute for Clinical Research (Baim Institute) serves as an analytic
      center for the PINNACLE Registry and will collaboratively lead this project with the ACC. The
      information collected from the PINNACLE Registry will include patient characteristics, site
      characteristics (volume, region, etc.) and the treating physician characteristics.
      Information from the patient and physician surveys will provide the clinical reasons for
      prior nontreatment as assessed by the treating physicians as well as the patients' perception
      of OA treatment (overall and according to pre-specified subgroups based on patient and site
      characteristics). Information will also be gathered from the patients' chart.

      The above data will be compiled and reviewed by a committee of cardiologists who will assess
      whether OA treatment would be appropriate based on all the clinical factors assessed.

      The BOAT-AF data will be linked to data from the PINNACLE Registry for the patients for whom
      surveys have been collected. Linking the two datasets will allow assessment of whether or not
      the participating physicians prescribed OA treatment and whether those patients started OA
      treatment within approximately 12 months after completing the questionnaire.
