      two-sequence crossover study, performed under fasting conditions. Subjects were confined to
      the SFBC Clinical Research Facility from at least 10 hours prior to drug administration,
      until after the 24-hour post-dose blood draw, in each period. The treatment phases were
      separated by a washout period of 28 days.
