    
      Two populations were defined as below:

        -  Population I: Patients enrolled prior to the protocol amendment 1, who received
           bimagrumab 70 mg, 210 mg or 700 mg in the core study, were randomly assigned to two
           subgroups within each of three treatment arms to either receive bimagrumab at the same
           dose level or placebo. Patients receiving placebo in the core study continued receiving
           placebo in the extension study.

        -  Population II: Patients enrolled after protocol amendment 1, who received bimagrumab 700
           mg or placebo in the core study, did not receive study medication in the extension study
           and were followed-up per schedule defined in this protocol amendment.
