      attributable cause of preventable death in developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension
      greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal
      failure. As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if
      broad and effective preventive measures are not implemented. Despite the availability of
      antihypertensive agents, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about one third
      of patients continue to maintain control successfully.

      Although most antihypertensive agents are effective at the appropriate dose, the majority
      have side effects that limit their use. As a class, angiotensin II receptor blockers
      generally are considered more tolerable than other classes of antihypertensive agents.
      TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) is an angiotensin II receptor blocker that is being evaluated
      by Takeda to treat essential hypertension.

      Treatments for essential hypertension commonly include use of a thiazide-like diuretic,
      either alone or as part of combination treatment.

      This study is designed to compare the antihypertensive effect and the safety and tolerability
      of the azilsartan medoxomil plus chlorthalidone fixed-dose combination product (TAK 491CLD
      FDC) with azilsartan monotherapy and chlorthalidone monotherapy during 8 weeks of treatment.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive one of 11 possible dosing
      combinations of azilsartan medoxomil , chlorthalidone and placebo over an 8 week period. The
      total duration of the study will be approximately 13 weeks. Participants will make 12 visits
      to the clinic. Each participant will also be contacted by telephone 14 days after last dose
      of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
