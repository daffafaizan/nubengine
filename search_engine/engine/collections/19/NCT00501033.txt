      balloon (Cook medical, GPN: G48149). We will compare the failure rates, cesarean section
      rate, infections and postpartum complications, especially endometritis. The study will
      include 200 parturients, 100 primiparous and 100 multiparous women. We will randomize each
      group to induction with the foley catheter or the cervical ripening double balloon. We will
      compare the failure rates, cesarean section rate, infectious and other postpartum
      complications, especially endometritis.
