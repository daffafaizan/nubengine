      high burden for those affected and their families. In Canada, depressive disorders are on the
      rise and their onset is occurring earlier in life. There is a growing body of evidence
      suggesting that spiritual wellness may play a role in depression management and recovery.
      Considering the limitations of available treatments for depression and the significant burden
      of the disease there is a need for new treatment options that are safe, effective, affordable
      and acceptable to young people. Our previous research gives strong support to the idea of
      using a spiritually based intervention for depression. To our knowledge, no research has been
      conducted on using spirituality as a self-study intervention in the management of depression
      in young adults. Over the last two years our team has created a spirituality-based
      intervention program for adolescent depression. The program could present an innovative and
      low cost treatment option for young patients with major depression.
