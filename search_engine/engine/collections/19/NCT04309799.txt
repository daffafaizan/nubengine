      symptoms of MGD. Warm compress treatments have been recommended as part of the standard of
      care by eye physicians, and are an important means in treating MGD. However, current
      treatment options suffer from varied temperature maintenance and poor compliance. The
      TearRestoreâ„¢ mask offers patients a unique experience through providing sustained heat and
      the ability to see throughout the treatment, which will improve efficacy through improved
      compliance. If shown to be effective in altering Meibomian gland secretions at a single
      visit, this novel treatment could potentially offer the millions of patients suffering from
      MGD a more convenient and effective way to treat the condition.
