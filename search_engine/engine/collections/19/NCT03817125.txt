    
      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded study in adult
      participants with anti-PD-1 therapy na√Øve, unresectable or metastatic melanoma to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of SER-401, or matching placebo in combination with anti-PD-1
      therapy (nivolumab). Prior to initiating microbiome study intervention and nivolumab,
      participants will undergo an antibiotic or antibiotic placebo treatment lead-in to prime the
      gut microbiome for engraftment of the oral microbiome study intervention. Study intervention
      groups will be assessed for safety, changes in the microbiome, changes in the percentage of
      tumoral CD8 T cells, and antitumor activity. Participants must have measurable disease that
      can be biopsied and consent to baseline and on-treatment biopsies, as well as stool and blood
      biomarker collection throughout the study.
