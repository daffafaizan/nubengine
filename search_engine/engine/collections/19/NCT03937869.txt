      girls with bacterial vaginosis. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled. Patients
      determined to be eligible at the Baseline Visit (Day 1) will receive a single oral dose of
      Solosecâ„¢ granules (containing 2 grams of secnidazole) on Day 1. Patients will return to the
      site once between Days 7-14 for a "test of cure" (TOC) Visit. A follow-up telephone call will
      be performed at Days 21-30 to assess the continued clinical response to treatment and adverse
      events.
