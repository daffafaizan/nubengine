      monitored in order to reflect the current reality, due to the increase in ingestion of
      industrialized foods rich in phosphorus additives. Data from studies performed in the USA
      shows a reduction in phosphatemia with nutritional orientation to reduce foods containing
      additives from restaurants in the region of the study . In another study, also conducted in
      the USA, the researchers evaluated the phosphorus content and presence of additives in
      appetizers and side orders served at fast food restaurants in Cleveland. The results showed
      that of the appetizers, 52% were accepted by the traditional criteria for the renal diet (low
      content of sodium, potassium and organic or natural phosphorus), but only 16% were also free
      of phosphorus additives; of the side orders, 23% were accepted by the traditional criteria
      and 17% were exempt of phosphorus additives. Thus, only a small proportion of appetizers and
      side orders served at fast food restaurants were compatible with the renal diet. Considering
      that alimentary phosphorus has an important role in the control of phosphatemia, there is a
      lack of studies which evaluates the effect of foods containing phosphorus additives on
      phosphatemia and which, at the same time, evaluated the alimentary ingestion and the
      nutritional state of the chronic kidney disease patients treated with hemodialysis.

      Can the elimination of foods containing phosphorus additives and their substitution for foods
      without additives reduce phosphatemia without altering the nutritional state of
      hyperphosphatemic patients on hemodialysis?
