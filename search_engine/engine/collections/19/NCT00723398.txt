      Raloxifene and omega-3 fatty acids on surrogate markers of breast cancer development in
      healthy, postmenopausal women. The primary endpoint will be mammographic density for which
      the study has been powered. Breast density is a major risk factor for breast cancer and hence
      it is chosen to evaluate the potential chemopreventive efficacy of our interventions.
      Secondary endpoints would include markers of oxidative stress, parameters of estrogen
      metabolism, markers of inflammation, and markers of IGF-I signaling, all of which have been
      shown in the literature to have an influence on mammary carcinogenesis.

      Study Population: Healthy, postmenopausal women between the ages of 35-70 years, undergoing
      yearly mammograms as part of routine screening practice.

      Method of Identification of Subjects/Samples/Medical Records: Women reporting for yearly
      mammograms will be considered for this protocol. They will be given first a screening
      questionnaire to rule out any co-existing medical condition that would predispose them to
      thromboembolic events.
