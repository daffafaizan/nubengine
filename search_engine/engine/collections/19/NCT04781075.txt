    
      Subjects recruited into the study will undergo surgery as scheduled. During the procedure
      they will receive a TAP Block with one of the pain medications. TAP Block in the experimental
      arm will be performed with 20 mL (266mg) of liposomal bupivacaine with 25 mL (5 mg/mL) of
      bupivacaine diluted in 55 mL of normal saline. The control arm will have a TAP Block
      performed with 30 mL (5mg/mL) of bupivacaine diluted in 70 mL of normal saline. These doses
      are consistent with prior studies of TAP Block with liposomal bupivacaine. Subjects will be
      monitored for pain as per standard of care and will be given pain medication as needed.

      Subject Recruitment and Screening Patients will be recruited from the Ochsner Colorectal
      Surgery Clinic at the time of a preoperative visit.

      Study Procedures

      Screening & Baseline Visit After obtaining informed consent the subjects relevant medical and
      surgical history will be documented. Demographics and vitals will be documented. Current use
      of pain medication will be recorded. A physical exam will be performed.

      Day of Surgery Routine vital signs will be obtained preoperatively. During the operation
      subject will receive a TAP Block containing their randomized local injection mixture as
      described above. Following surgery the subject will recover the PACU and pain medication will
      be provided on demand. Initial postoperative vital signs and pain scores will be obtained at
      this time.

      Post-Operative Course Postoperatively subject will have regularly scheduled vital signs and
      pain scores obtained, and recorded for study use. Narcotic and non-narcotic pain medication
      will be provided on demand; dosages will be recorded for study use. Subjects will be followed
      until they are discharged at which time study participation will be complete.
