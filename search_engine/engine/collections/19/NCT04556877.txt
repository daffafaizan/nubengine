      Intra-abdominal pressure is often measured as high, especially after major abdominal surgery
      procedures. This situation creates ischemia in the abdominal organs in the patient, decreases
      venous return as a result of inferior vena cava compression and leads to a decrease in
      cardiac output. In addition, intracranial pressure frequently increases as a result of the
      venous circulation being affected. In recent years, various studies have reported that the
      increase in optic nerve diameter measured by ultrasound correlates with the level of
      intracranial pressure. Optic nerve diameter measurement with ultrasound is a non-invasive
      procedure. Intra-abdominal pressure measurements are also routinely performed in intensive
      care patients. In the measurement of abdominal pressure, the bladder catheter, which is
      already available in every patient who comes to intensive care, is used. In this study, the
      intra-abdominal pressure values present in the file of each patient undergoing major
      abdominal surgery who were taken to intensive care unit will be taken. Orbital USG will be
      performed on the 6th, 12th and 24th hours on admission to the intensive care unit to measure
      the diameter of the optic nerve, and the relationship between the intra-abdominal pressure
      value and optic nerve diameters will be investigated.
