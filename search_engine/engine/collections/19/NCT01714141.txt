      asthma with suboptimal medication adherence. Half of the sample were randomized to receive a
      multi-component technology-based intervention (MCTI) targeting adherence to daily controller
      medication. The MCTI consisted of two components: 1) 2 sessions of computer-delivered
      motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence, and 2) individualized text
      messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text messages were
      individualized based on Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). The remaining half of
      participants completed a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules matched for
      length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session. Control participants
      also received text messages between intervention sessions. Message content was the same for
      all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not tailored).
