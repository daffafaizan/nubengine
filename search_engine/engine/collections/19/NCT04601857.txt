    
      This study is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter Phase 2 study evaluating the
      combination of futibatinib and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic UC who
      are not candidates to receive a platinum-based treatment regimen.

      Approximately 46 subjects advanced or metastatic Urothelial Cancer (UC) will be enrolled in
      the trial at approximately 15-17 sites worldwide:

        -  6 patients in the safety lead-in

        -  20 patients with tumors characterized by specific genetic abnormalities (Cohort A)

        -  20 patients with tumors not characterized by specific genetic abnormalities (Cohort B).

      A treatment cycle is defined as 21 days. All enrolled participants will receive the same
      treatment

        -  Futibatinib at an oral (PO) dose of 20 mg daily (5 tablets) (QD); and

        -  Pembrolizumab at an intravenous (I.V.) dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W).

      Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable side effects, or any other of
      the criteria for treatment discontinuation is met; of note, pembrolizumab may be administered
      for a maximum of 35 doses or a maximum duration of 2 years, whichever is earlier. The study
      will begin with a safety lead-in period. During this period, a total of 6 patients with
      advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma will be enrolled and treated for at least one
      21-day cycle. Patients will be enrolled into this initial safety lead-in period without
      regard for FGFR alteration status.
