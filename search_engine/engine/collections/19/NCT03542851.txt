    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study of oral BTD-001 in
      adults with Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH). The objectives of this study are two-fold: 1) To
      evaluate the efficacy of BTD-001 in subjects with IH as reflected by changes in cognitive,
      sleep, functional, and quality-of-life measures and 2) To characterize the safety and
      tolerability of oral BTD-001 administered to subjects with IH.
