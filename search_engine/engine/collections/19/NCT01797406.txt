      water-related colonoscopy could shorten the cecal intubation time and relieve the pain of the
      patients,especially for training the beginnersï¼Œthe effect was notable, but the present
      researches on water assisted technique has still been confined to following aspects:1.Water
      infusing was based on air insufflation; predetermined amount of water was infused ,and water
      was infused while passing through certain segment of the bowel(such as the left half of
      colon) ; 2.When training the first-learners, certain dose of sedatives or analgesics was
      injected; 3.The patients recruited were less. Colonoscopies in this study would be performed
      by experienced endoscopists of air insufflation colonoscopy, water would be injected
      completely instead of air insufflation while advancing the colonoscope, the amount of the
      water infused would not be predetermined but vary from individuals, and all the patients
      would be examined without any sedatives or analgesics.
