    
      Objective: The goal of this protocol, broadly stated, is to evaluate the effects of the
      neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin on the neural systems involved in social cognition and
      emotional processing in healthy volunteers and individuals with autism spectrum disorders
      (ASD).

      Study population: The research participants will be adult healthy volunteers and adults with
      ASD (ages 18-40 years).

      Design: This will be a double-blind cross-over functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      study, requiring three visits in addition to a screening visit. At each visit, participants
      will receive an intranasal application of oxytocin, vasopressin, or placebo and will be
      scanned while performing social cognition tasks and tasks involving the processing of
      affective stimuli. Drug order will be randomized across participants in each group (healthy
      controls and individuals with ASD).

      Outcome measures: The outcome measures will include both performance scores and reaction
      times (RTs) on the behavioral tasks and changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
      activation in the brain, in both healthy volunteers and patients with ASD. Our main brain
      region of interest will be the amygdala.
