        1. Neonatology NCHD's from CUMH

        2. Participants must have completed Neonatal Resuscitation Programme (NRP)

        3. Participants must be working as doctors in the area of neonatology Exclusion criteria

      1. Any history of cardiac or respiratory disorder 2. Physicians who are post-call/sleep
      deprived

      Intervention:

      This will be a crossover trial. Each participant will be assigned to performing ether TT or
      TF chest compressions. The participant will each perform 5 minutes of simulated chest
      compressions either a term or preterm mannequin using 3:1 C:V CPR. Each participant will have
      NICOM leads attached to their body which will record HR and cardiac output. One week later
      the participant will cross over and perform the alternate CC technique. The trial will
      initially be performed on a term mannequin for the first 2 weeks before being repeated on a
      preterm mannequin.

      Data Collection:

      Recorded data will include: Age, gender, ethnicity, weight, height, BMI, HR and cardiac
      output. Participants will have an allocated study number, ensuring that the data collected
      will be anonymised. The list of study numbers and data will be stored in a secure password
      protected database in the Neonatal Unit. Only people involved in the study and other
      authorised persons will have access to this information.

      Outcome Measures:

      Primary Outcome Measure:

      Percentage change in cardiac output after 5 minutes of simulated neonatal CPR using two
      different chest compression methods (2-finger method vs. 2-thumb method) on term and preterm
      mannequins.

      Secondary Outcome Measure:

      Perceived level of fatique. At the end of the study session each subject will complete a
      Likert scale-based questionnaire on subjective feeling of fatigue.
