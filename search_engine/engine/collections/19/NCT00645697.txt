      International Uveitis Society were invited to contribute their consecutive cases of ION not
      responding to standard therapy (corticosteroids (CST) 4 or immunosuppression) and treated
      with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents. Cases with concomitant or prior cystoid macular edema,
      diabetes mellitus, or age-related macular degeneration were excluded. Most of the patients
      had initially been treated in a stepwise fashion with high doses of oral CST, with or without
      intraocular or subtenon CST or immunosuppressive therapy (as monitored by a rheumatologist).
      All patients opted to intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment after detailed information about the
      limited experience, potential side effects and the off-label character of the drug. The risks
      and benefits of intravitreal therapy were discussed with the patients (or their guardians)
      who signed an informed consent. Primary outcome measure: Best corrected visual acuity
      measured as logMAR. Secondary outcome measures:macular thickness on OCT, and stoppage of
      leakage by IVFA.
