      have evaluated the feasibility of this technique in sleeve gastrectomy. The investigators
      want to demonstrate the non-inferiority in terms of morbidity-mortality of use single trocar
      in sleeve gastrectomy compared the multiport technique. Moreover it should highlight the
      non-inferiority in terms of anatomical quality, reduction of excess weight lost, reduction of
      comorbidities, decrease post operative pain, improved quality of life and evaluate
      medico-economic impact of these technique to validating this new surgical approach for
      bariatric surgery. The study will be multicentric with 6 university center (Montpellier,
      Amiens, Lille, Creteil, Poissy and Montsouris Institut). 388 patients will be included in the
      tow group of the prospective randomise study.
