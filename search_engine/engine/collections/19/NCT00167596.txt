      persist despite the restoration of a normal hemodynamic profile and systemic oxygen
      transport.

      Therefore, the assessment of tissue oxygenation and perfusion is recommended in patients with
      severe sepsis.

      The InSpectra tissue spectrometer relies on continuous wave near infrared (NIR) technology to
      estimate non invasively local tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation in tissue (% StO2). This
      technology had been tested in a variety of systems: standard theoretical models of light
      transport, isolated blood, isolated blood-perfused animal organs and healthy human volunteers
      with induced limb ischemia. In critical-care medicine, NIRS has also been used to evaluate
      muscle oxygenation in trauma resuscitation and in lower extremity and abdominal compartment
      syndrome. However, NIRS has been rarely utilised to measure tissue blood flow and oxygen
      uptake in critically ill patients.
