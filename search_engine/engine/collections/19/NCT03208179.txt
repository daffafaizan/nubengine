      pillars of malaria prevention in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa, in addition to prompt case
      management and use of long lasting insecticide treated bednets. However, mounting resistance
      to SP by Plasmodium falciparum increasing renders IPTP-SP ineffective.

      Two exploratory trials in Uganda and Kenya demonstrated that IPTp with DP was superior to
      IPTp-SP for the prevention of malaria infection in pregnancy. However, neither study was
      adequately powered to look at adverse birth outcomes. This study is a confirmatory efficacy
      trial in Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya to determine the efficacy and safety of IPTp with DP
      alone or in combination with AZ.

      This will be a 3-arm trial, superiority, partial blinded, placebo controlled, randomized
      trial comparing IPTp with SP, versus IPTp with DP alone, and IPTp with DP+AZ with the
      following hypotheses:

        -  IPTp with DP is superior to IPTp with SP in preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes.

        -  The combination of DP with AZ further reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to
           IPTp with DP alone.
