    
      This is a pilot study to assess the safety and tolerability, as well as the immune response
      rate, of mDC3 vaccine in patients with colorectal cancer.

      Eligible patients that provide written informed consent will undergo apheresis to collect
      blood mononuclear cells for vaccine production approximately 1 week prior to vaccine
      infusion. Each study subject will receive cyclophosphamide 300mg/m^2 intravenously 3 to 4
      days prior to the vaccine dose to deplete regulatory T cells. For each vaccine dose, all
      subjects will receive autologous dendritic cells pulsed with mutated peptides. On Day 1, the
      subject will receive the primer vaccine dose; this will be followed by one booster vaccine
      dose approximately 8 weeks later. Peripheral blood will be taken weekly, and a second
      apheresis procedure will be performed at the end of study to monitor the immune response to
      the vaccine. Information will be gathered from usual clinic visits for approximately 1 year
      following the End of Treatment Study Visit to evaluate for disease progression.
