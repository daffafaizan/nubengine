      failed primary treatment with radical prostatectomy, and now have rising PSA as indicated by
      a recent PSA blood draw value > 0.1 ng/ml. Patients fitting our inclusion criteria for the
      study, will receive an Axumin scan as part of their standard of care (SOC) treatment. If the
      SOC scan is positive, patients under this protocol will either subsequently receive hormone
      therapy OR salvage radiation therapy (not both concurrently). Patient response to therapy
      will be assessed with serial Axumin scans identifying additional lesions present at 3 months,
      6 months, and 12 months (1 year) post-therapy, with the latter time point being our endpoint
      of the study.

      The study aims are as follows:

        1. The investigators would like to understand the hormonal therapy response based on Axumin
           scans administered over a time course of 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-hormone
           therapy treatment.

        2. The investigators would like to understand the salvage radiotherapy response based on
           Axumin scan results incorporated into radiation treatment planning over a time course of
           3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-salvage radiation treatment.
