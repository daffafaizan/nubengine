      of Early Breast Cancer 2017 strongly believed that sentinel lymph node biopsy to be
      appropriate and favored the biopsy be carried out after neoadjuvant treatment in patients who
      presented with a clinically negative axilla and who received neoadjuvant treatment.

      Patients with clinically node-negative early breast cancer treated in Breast Cancer
      Prevention and Treatment Center Peking University Cancer Hospital from February 2013 to
      August 2017 were retrospectively analyzed to investigate whether sentinel lymph node (SLN)
      biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy can reduce the positive rate of SLN and the rate of
      axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The study group underwent SLN biopsy after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, and the control group underwent SLN biopsy before chemotherapy. A total of 395
      patients were eligible, including 85 in the study group and 310 in the control group. The
      detection rate of SLNs was 95.3% vs 98.7%（χ2 = 3.922，P = 0.069） in the study group compared
      with the control group, the positive rate of SLNs was 1.2% vs 18.6%（χ2 = 15.207，P = 0.000）,
      and the rate of ALND was 5.9% vs 15.2%（χ2 = 5.024，P = 0.025） in univariate analysis.
      Multivariate analysis showed that the study group had lower SLN positive rate (OR = 0.052,
      95% CI: 0.0070 to 0.38, P = 0.004) and ALND rate (OR = 0.310, 95% CI: 0.118 to 0.812, P =
      0.017). There was no statistically significant difference in detection rate of SLNs （OR =
      0.244, 95% CI: 0.058 to 1.021, P = 0.053）between the two groups.

      The aim of this study is to explore the detection rate and positive rate of sentinel lymph
      nodes, the rate of axillary lymph node dissection, and the proportion of patients with
      axillary lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with clinically
      node-negative early breast cancer. A mathematical model of axillary lymph node status will be
      established to predict axillary lymph node metastases.
