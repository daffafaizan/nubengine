    
      Primary Objective: To ascertain whether patients with completely resected (R0 + R1), primary
      retroperitoneal sarcoma who are randomized to pre-operative IMRT and surgery have a longer
      recurrence-free survival compared to patients randomized to treatment with surgery alone.

      Secondary Objectives: To ascertain whether patients with completely resected (R0 + R1),
      primary retroperitoneal sarcoma randomized to pre-operative IMRT and surgery have longer
      overall survival compared to patients randomized to treatment with surgery alone.

        -  To compare the resectability rate between the two arms

        -  Determine the variability of NMR biochemical profiles and the variability of expression
           for genes/proteins involved in adipocyte differentiation, cell cycle control and
           apoptosis within different regions of the primary retroperitoneal sarcoma in patients
           treated with surgery alone and pre-operative radiotherapy.

        -  Analyze NMR biochemical patterns and expression patterns for genes/proteins involved in
           adipocyte differentiation, cell cycle control and apoptosis to identify markers that can
           provide an objective measure of sarcoma differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.

        -  Predict the response of sarcoma to radiation therapy and the risk of local recurrence,
           based on data derived from NMR biochemical and gene/protein expression patterns in
           patient tumors that recurred compared to those without recurrence.

        -  Determine if diffusion-weighted MRI early in course of radiation therapy can predict the
           ultimate pathologic response of sarcoma following resection and the risk of local
           recurrence.

        -  Analyze plasma levels of VEGF, FGF, Ang-1, Ang-2 and endostatin prior to and following
           therapy and correlate with treatment response, local and distant recurrence.
