      could improve the long-term quality of life and other psycho-social outcomes of men with
      prostate cancer and their spouse/partners. Aim 1. The first aim was to determine if the
      family intervention could improve several proximal clinical outcomes (less negative appraisal
      of illness or caregiving, less uncertainty, less hopelessness, better family communication,
      higher self-efficacy, and more problem-focused coping) and improve the distal clinical
      outcome, quality of life, in a culturally and economically diverse sample of men with
      prostate cancer and their spouses. Aim 2. The second aim was to test a stress-coping model
      designed to predict which prostate cancer patients and their spouses are at higher risk of
      poorer long-term quality of life.
