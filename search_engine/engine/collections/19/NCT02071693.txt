    
      In this observational study, we will retrospectively analyze 38 PD patients who received
      bilateral STN DBS in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University during the year
      of 2008-2012. All patients will be evaluated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part
      III(UPDRSIII) before and after operation. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) in the on medication condition pre-operation and on stimulation on
      medication condition post-operation. The follow-up time points are one week pre-operation and
      6, 12, 24 months post-operation. Before operation, white matter hyperintensities（WMHs）in the
      cholinergic pathways will be determined on a 3.0 Tesla MRI, using the visual rating scale of
      Cholinergic Pathways Hyperintensities Scale (CHIPS). A correlation analysis will be conducted
      to investigate the relationship between CHIPS score and the change of cognitive status of PD
      patients after bilateral STN DBS retrospectively.
