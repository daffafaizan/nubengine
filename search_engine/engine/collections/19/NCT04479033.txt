      needs (met, unmet, and latent) and that of their caregivers must be understood holistically.
      Local studies have yet to comprehensively examine the experiences of community dwelling older
      persons living with moderate to severe dementia and their caregivers, and the impact of an
      integrated community model of health care and psychosocial support. This study adopts a
      mixed-method approach to needs assessment and programme evaluation using qualitative in-depth
      interviews and quantitative surveys administered to participants assigned to control and
      intervention groups. The Hua-Mei Dementia Care System (HMDCS) is a programme that aims to
      empower and support both PLWDs and their caregivers through personalised care management,
      dementia-specific education, and cognitive training. The HMDCS addresses the multifaceted
      challenges faced by PLWD-caregiver dyads such as behavioural problems, psychological
      distress, lack of social participation, stigma, communication barriers, financial strain, and
      insufficient social support.

      The study aims are to:

        1. Explore the perceptions, behaviours, and underlying motivators and inhibitors of PLWDs,
           their caregivers, and members of the community

        2. Assess the health, social, psychological, and emotional needs of community dwelling
           PLWDs and their caregivers

        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the programme in reducing cognitive and functional
           decline, caregiver burden, as well as improving self-reported health status, social
           wellbeing, and quality of life of PLWD-caregiver dyads
