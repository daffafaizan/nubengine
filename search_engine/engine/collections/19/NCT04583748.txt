    
      Through a high-quality, single-blind, three-arm mixed-method pilot feasibility study using
      randomized treatment assignment, the study team will assess two new innovative interventions,
      Sahaj Samadhi Meditation (SSM) and Health Enhancement Program (HEP), both delivered
      virtually, to augment clinical care of patients with irreversible age-related vision loss
      (IARVL), with the goal of enhancing mental health and quality of life (QOL) for patients
      and/or their caregivers. Participants will be blinded to the treatment hypothesis, while
      investigators and treating clinicians will be additionally blinded to the intervention. Both
      SSM and HEP will be taught over 4 consecutive days in similar sized groups (10 patients
      and/or their 10 caregivers) followed by weekly reinforcement sessions for subsequent 11
      weeks. Self-rated questionnaires will be used to collect data on quality of life and mental
      health symptoms at 0-week and 12-week follow-up
