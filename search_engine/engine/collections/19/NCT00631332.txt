    
      WHISCA is an ancillary study to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the WHI Memory Study
      (WHIMS) and has enrolled 2303 women aged 66 to 84 years who did not meet the criteria for
      dementia. WHISCA is investigating the effects of hormone therapy on rates of change over time
      in memory, other aspects of cognition (language, attention, spatial ability), motor function,
      and mood.

      Objectives

        -  Does HT protect against age-associated memory and cognitive longitudinal decline in
           women age 65 and older?

        -  What is the rate of change in memory and other cognitive abilities in women receiving HT
           compared to women receiving placebo?

        -  Does the addition of progesterone to HT modify the effects of estrogen on memory and
           other cognitive abilities?
