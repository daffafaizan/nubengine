      predict glycemic response to dietary intake. Specifically, integrative analysis of dietary
      consumption, anthropometrics, physical activity and gut microbiota composition can be used to
      predict postprandial glycemic excursions. The investigators hypothesize that individualized
      assessment of glycemic responses to food, together with analysis of the gut microbiome, will
      allow the design of a personalized dietary approach to minimize glycemic excursions for
      patients with post-bariatric and other forms of largely postprandial hypoglycemia.
      Identification of factors predictive of glycemic excursions and subsequent hypoglycemia may
      ultimately allow individuals to tailor their diet towards foods which would not induce
      hypersecretion of insulin and subsequent hypoglycemia.
