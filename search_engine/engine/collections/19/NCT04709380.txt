      to meet the standard of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, in a 2: 1-proportional randomly
      assigned to the test group and control group. Patients in the experimental group will be
      given local vein tumor thrombus/hepatic vein tumor thrombus +/- intrahepatic large lesions
      with hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (tumor area dose 40-60Gy/10-20f),
      concurrent with and followed by 240mg Q3W of toripalimab within 1 week of radiotherapy
      started. Patients in the control group will be treated with sorafenib (400mg, twice a day).
