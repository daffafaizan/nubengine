      depression literacy and the use of effective self-help methods could improve depression
      across the community. The internet is an ideal promotional medium for health messages,
      because it is often used to search for information about mental health issues, and health
      messages can be widely disseminated at little cost. An email campaign could be a low-cost
      approach to improving self-help behavior and knowledge about depression in adults with
      depression symptoms.
