      arthroplasty using the G7 acetabular system and Taperloc Complete stem comparing regular
      plasma porous spray with HA coating using Bonemaster (BM) in an uncemented cup. DEXA scanning
      will be used to measure periprosthetic bone mineral density preoperatively and
      post-operatively at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 12 months for both the treated and
      contralateral hip joint. Clinical evaluations will be conducted preoperatively, and
      postoperatively at 6, 12, 26 weeks, 12 months and 24 months.
