      Current guidelines support the use of aspirin (AAS) 100 mg as a class I indication.

      Current evidence, mainly derived from transaortic valve implantation (TAVI) patients, have
      shown that aortic bioprosthesis suffer subclinical thrombosis which may explain the increase
      in gradient and bioprosthetic degeneration. Anticoagulation in this cases improve leaflet
      mobility and decrease in gradient. Evidence supporting early anticoagulation in patients with
      aortic bioprosthesis is not as strong as in the case of mitral bioprosthesis. Nonetheless,
      current American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines
      recommend (IIa) the use of warfarin for at least 3 months after aortic valve replacement.

      The aim is to conduct a single blinded (echocardiographist) randomized control study in
      patients who receive an aortic bioprosthesis. Comparison will be performed between the use of
      warfarin + aspirin vs aspirin alone. Duration of anticoagulation will be for 3 months and
      patients follow-up for 1 year. Clinical and echocardiographic evaluation will be performed in
      every patients. Some patients will undergo Positron Emission Tomography (PET-Scan).
