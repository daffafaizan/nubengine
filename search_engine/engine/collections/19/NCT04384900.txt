      treatment has been shown to improve the outcome of these patients.

      Mechanical ventilation in the prone position decreases mortality with around 50% when applied
      to patients with severe respiratory failure. Applying prone position earlier in patients with
      COVID-19 could have several benefits, but may also carry significant side-effects and an
      increased workload for the health-care personnel. It is urgently needed to assess whether
      this potential life-saving intervention is effective.

      The aim of the PROVENT-COVID is to determine whether prone position ventilation, initiated
      immediately after intubation, lead to more days alive without respiratory support compared to
      prone position initiated according to standard indication in patients with COVID-19
      associated respiratory failure.
