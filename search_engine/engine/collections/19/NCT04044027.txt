      (Speaking to the Potential, Ability, and Resilience inside Kids) Teen Pregnancy Prevention
      and Mentoring intervention with youth assigned to either the intervention or control group.
      As youth are referred to the study, grantee staff confirm their eligibility and then work
      with the youth's child welfare case manager to obtain youth assent and parental consent. Once
      approximately 40 to 60 youth are recruited, grantee staff selects a day for baseline survey
      administration. Survey administration and group assignment take place at the grantee agency
      and incentives to complete the survey are provided including a gift card and snacks. All
      eligible youth with a signed assent and informed consent forms are invited to attend the
      baseline survey administration and group assignment. The evaluation team generates random
      numbers using computer software, and the grantee staff uses these numbers to indicate youth
      assignment to the intervention or control group, after youth have completed the baseline
      survey.
