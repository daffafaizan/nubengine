    
      The primary object of this study is to evaluate the effect of CC-5013 on the response to
      hepatitis B vaccine in myeloma. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of immunologic
      and functional genomic changes following CC-55013.

      This study will be a two-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. A
      single dose of Hepatitis B vaccine will be administered to subjects. CC-5013 or placebo will
      be administered for 7 days prior to and 7 days after the vaccine. Collection of samples for
      immune analysis will be performed prior to the initiation of CC-5013 administration, at the
      time of vaccination, and 7, 14, and 28 days after vaccination. Safety assessment will be
      performed at each visit.

      Primary Endpoint

        -  Titer of antibodies to hepatitis B virus Secondary Endpoints

        -  Immune analysis

        -  Hepatitis B related T cell response

        -  Safety profile

      All the patients should not have a prior response against hepatitis B surface antigen. The
      study will be comprised of 64 multiple myeloma patients who have not taken any therapeutic
      agents in the 30 days prior to enrollment in the study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive or not receive CC-5013, and all will be vaccinated. The study is designed to detect a
      biological difference of 50% with an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.8.
