    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of introducing and expressing P140K MGMT cDNA from a
           lentiviral-based provirus in autologous hematopoietic stem cells harvested from
           Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.

        -  To assess the safety associated with infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells
           transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector expressing P140K MGMT in patients with GBM.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether any patients who receive P140K MGMT-transduced CD34 cells tolerate
           O6-benzylguanine (BG) and dose-escalated temozolomide (TMZ) without myelosuppression.

        -  To evaluate the ability to detect P140K-transduced BG and TMZ-resistant hematopoietic
           cells from the bone marrow and peripheral blood in patients infused with
           P140K-transduced CD34 progenitors.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of in vivo enrichment of P140K-expressing hematopoietic
           cells by repeated treatments of BG and TMZ at doses that appear therapeutic for GBM.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of various types of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy
           on conditioning the patient's bone marrow to host the transduced autologous hematopoetic
           stem cells.

        -  To evaluate tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts.

        -  Cohort 1 (LV P140K MGMT gene transfer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy): Patients
           receive radiotherapy (60cGy in 30 2cGy daily doses) and TMZ 75mg/m2 /daily for 6 weeks,
           cell infusion at week 7 (T0) followed by BG 120 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 1h and
           TMZ 50 mg/m2/day x 5 days, every 28 days (starting on T+28) for 6 cycles.

        -  Cohort 2 (LV P140K MGMT gene transfer prior to concurrent chemoradiotherapy): Patients
           receive BG 120mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 1h and TMZ 400 mg/m2 one dose given on day
           T-2 or T-3 days prior to cell infusion, followed within 72-96 hours by radiotherapy
           (60cGy in 30 2cGy daily doses) and concurrent BG + TMZ at 50 mg/m2/day x 5 days, every
           28 days,starting on T+28 for a total of 7 cycles of BG + TMZ.

        -  Cohort 3 (intra-patient dose escalation of TMZ in patients with evidence of P140K-marked
           cells): Dose escalation of TMZ in patients with evidence of P140K marked cells in vivo
           given as described above for cohort 1 or cohort 2. After completion of radiotherapy,
           patients will receive BG + TMZ at 50 mg/m2/day x 5 days. Patients not experiencing any
           grade 3 toxicity will be increased to the next TMZ dose level of 65 mg/m2/day x 5.
           Subsequent dose escalation without grade 3 toxicity will be 80 mg/m2/day, 100 mg/m2/day,
           120mg/m2/day and 140 mg/m2/day x 5. If at subsequent cycles a grade 3 or greater
           hematologic toxicity occurs, the dose level for the next cycle will be reduced one
           level.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for replication-competent lentivirus detection and
      other laboratory biomarker studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months.
