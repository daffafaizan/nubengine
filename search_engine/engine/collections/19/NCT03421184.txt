      are largely unknown even though genetic and environmental factors have already been
      identified. Estrogens, on one side, have been shown to negatively influence the incidence and
      severity of the disease while testosterone and progesterone on the other side are thought to
      be protective. Endocrine disruptors can potentially influence the occurrence and severity of
      the disease. Among these disruptors, soy isoflavones which are ubiquitous in modern processed
      food are known to be estrogenic and anti-androgenic. Their depleting effect on luteinizing
      hormone (LH) secretion can also lead to progesterone plasma level impairments. For these
      reasons, estrogenic isoflavones, appear as potential environmental risk factors for SLE and
      its flares. Although some data exist in transgenic rodent, there is actually no clinical data
      in young women.

      The study is an observational, monocentric, preliminary study aiming at determining if
      estrogenic isoflavones can be risk factors for SLE. No treatment is planned. The intervention
      will be the collection of extra blood and urine samples on SLE subjects and on autoimmune and
      healthy counterparts.

      Consumers are unintentionally exposed to estrogenic isoflavones through their diet. A dietary
      habit enquiry and a 48h dietary recall (based on pharmacokinetics of soy-isoflavones) will be
      proposed to the included subjects. Urine and blood samples collected during a clinical visit
      performed 7 days after the onset of previous menses will be analyzed for soy isoflavones,
      metabolites and for enterolactone both free and conjugated. Free estradiol will be assayed as
      a potential confounding risk factor.
