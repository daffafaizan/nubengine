      growth and repair, reduce the recurrence of intrauterine adhesion and improve the
      menstruation and reproductive prognosis after surgery for severe intrauterine adhesion.
      Menstruation was evaluated for the first time with a method similar to visual analogue scale
      (VAS) in which the menstruation was assessed by the patients themselves with 0 as amenorrhea
      and 100 as normal menstruation. This evaluation avoids the vague terms (such as large or
      small menstrual blood volume) in previous evaluations and considers the individual difference
      in menstrual blood volume and different understanding about the menstrual blood volume. Thus,
      this evaluation is easy to master, quantify and analyze.
