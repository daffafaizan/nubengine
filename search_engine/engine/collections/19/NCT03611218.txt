      post-dilution online HDF) is non-inferior to two comparator dialyzers (Sureflux-17UX (Nipro)
      and Polyflux 170 H (Baxter/Gambro) in removing Î²2-microglobulin. The secondary objective is
      to exploratively compare the efficacy in removing other uremic solutes between the new FX
      P600 and the Sureflux-17UX as well as the Polyflux 170 H membranes. Additionally, the safety
      of the FX P600 dialyzer with a modified polysulfone membrane will be investigated.
