    
      The present study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm non-interventional study to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety and health economics of NOVOCART® 3D in the treatment of
      cartilage defects of the knee in pediatric patients with closed epiphyseal growth plates.

      In this non-interventional study NOVOCART® 3D, which is marketed in Germany under Paragraph
      4b Medicinal Products Act, will be used in routine clinical practice according to the
      authorized Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). As stated in this SmPC, NOVOCART® 3D
      may only be used by physicians who are trained on the product. The treatment with NOVOCART®
      3D requires two surgeries. During the first surgery cartilage biopsies will be harvested
      arthroscopically and sent to TETEC AG (Tissue Engineering Technologies AG) for NOVOCART® 3D
      manufacturing, then NOVOCART® 3D will be transplanted during a second surgery about 3 to 4
      weeks later.

      All patients will be followed up for 5 years post NOVOCART® 3D transplantation and data will
      be collected at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months as outlined at the end of this
      synopsis.

      NOVOCART® 3D post treatment rehabilitation should follow the recommendations given in the
      SmPC and during product training.

      The primary and secondary variables (see below) will be assessed after a follow-up of 24
      month post NOVOCART® 3D transplantation (primary analysis).

      Long-term data will be assessed after an additional 3 years follow-up (follow-up analysis).

      The collected data will be documented using dedicated case report forms (CRFs) which are
      created and printed by TETEC AG.
