      were recruited through churches, Chinese schools, immigrant service centers, kindergarten, or
      recommendations from LHAs in Kaohsiung City in Taiwan. Overall, 30 and 25 Vietnamese
      mother-child pairs were randomized into the IG and CG. G*Power (version 3.1.9.4) was used for
      power analysis. A power analysis was established by effect size as the mean difference of
      filled teeth change between baseline and 8-month follow-up measurement between the IG and CG,
      with sample size and 0.05 alpha level. The power was greater than 0.802, and research results
      have adequate power.All children underwent oral examination at baseline and at 1-week, 2- and
      8-month follow-ups. Each child was examined by a dentist in accordance with the primary
      dentition caries experience.Each immigrant mother completed surveys at baseline and at 1-week
      and 8-month follow-ups.
