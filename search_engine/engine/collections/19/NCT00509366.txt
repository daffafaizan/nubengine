      patients with lung cancer have non-small cell type (NSCLC). The current standard of care for
      treating select stage IIIB and stage IV NSCLC is a doublet chemotherapy regimen, such as
      cisplatin plus gemcitabine, carboplatin plus paclitaxel, or a platinum agent plus
      vinorelbine. All of these regimens have comparable response rates as first-line therapy. In
      addition, the combination of cisplatin plus pemetrexed has recently been approved for
      non-squamous histology, based on results of a large randomized prospective trial in advanced
      stage NSCLC. Alternative doublet therapy for first-line treatment of NSCLC per ASCO and NCCN
      guidelines also include a non-platinum doublet or single agent therapy.

      An individual patient's response to chemotherapy is the result of complex interactions
      between the drug(s) and the patient's genetics and environment. Using Affymetrix gene
      expression data with corresponding drug response data for cisplatin from the NCI60 lines
      panel, a gene expression based model predicative of cisplatin-resistant has been developed.
      However, reevaluation of the genomics-based prediction model showed that it was
      irreproducible, suggesting inaccurate patient assignments into the two cisplatin cohorts. As
      a result, it would be inappropriate to separately analyze outcomes for the different
      treatment groups. Instead, information from both cisplatin cohorts will be combined to
      reflect the overall measure of one-year progression-free survival in this study. Secondary
      outcomes will also reflect the overall measures of median time to disease progression and
      quality of life.
