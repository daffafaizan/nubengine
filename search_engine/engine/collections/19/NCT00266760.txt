      triggered by stress or exertion. EA is likely caused by an inherited genetic mutation; many
      individuals with EA have abnormalities in the KCNA1 or CACNA1A genes. To date, two known
      subtypes of EA have been identified, and other types likely exist. Specific characteristics
      of each EA subtype, however, have not been adequately described. The purpose of this study is
      to better define the clinical features and genetic basis of the various subtypes of EA and to
      evaluate disease progression. The study will also establish relevant study endpoints for use
      in future therapeutic trials.

      This multi-center observational study will involve both a cross-sectional data analysis and a
      prospective longitudinal analysis. Participants will initially attend an outpatient study
      visit that will last 7 hours. This initial evaluation will include a medical history, a
      physical examination, neurological testing, and an ataxia assessment. Blood will be collected
      for genetic testing. Additionally, the following procedures may be conducted: ocular motor
      test, electromyography/nerve conduction study, electroencephalogram, MRI, and digital
      videotaping. Follow-up evaluations will occur on a yearly basis for at least 2 years; each
      will last 4 hours.
