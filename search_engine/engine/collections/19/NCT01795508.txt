      Danish context. The study design is an RCT where PMTO is compared to Treatment As Usual
      (TAU). The target population is parents with children aged 3 and 12 showing behavioral
      problems. The primary outcome estimates changes in child behavior, and is measured three
      times: baseline, seven months follow-up, and 19 month follow-up.
