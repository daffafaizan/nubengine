      anxiety and improve general well-being and future outlook? Outcomes measured: Pre- and
      post-intervention surveys to assess well-being and anxiety (primary outcomes), future
      outlook, hopefulness, and sleep habits (secondary outcomes). Many of these survey questions
      come from well-validated surveys (WHO-5 Well-being survey, GAD7 Anxiety survey). Post
      intervention surveys will be administered at the end of the 30d intervention, as well as 2
      months after the completion of the 30d intervention.

      Question 2: Can 30 days of daily use of a mindfulness app during the Covid-19 pandemic
      improve nutritional habits? Outcomes measured: Pre- and post-intervention surveys to assess
      general nutrition habits, including frequency of consuming whole foods (fruits, vegetables,
      whole grains) and frequency of consuming prepared meals (secondary outcomes). Post
      intervention surveys will be administered at the end of the 30d intervention, as well as 2
      months after the completion of the 30d intervention.

      Question 3: Will study participants be more likely to continue to use the mindfulness app
      after completion of the study? Outcomes measured: Post-intervention survey administered at
      the end of the 30d intervention will be used to assess likelihood to continue using app and
      frequency of anticipated continued use. The post-intervention survey administered 2 months
      after the completion of the 30d intervention will ask if participants continued to use the
      app, and the frequency of use (secondary outcomes).
