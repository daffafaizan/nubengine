      In particular we will be looking a neurotransmitter called GABA. In some Parkinson's disease
      patients we see too much GABA activity in the brain. This target engagement study examines
      the target engagement effect of GABA-A receptor modulation by transdermal flumazenil
      (previously clarithromycin). [11C]-flumazenil Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging
      results will be used to assess for possible GABA-A receptor target engagement effects of
      transdermal flumazenil (previously clarithromycin).
