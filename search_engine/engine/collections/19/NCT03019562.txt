      studies on the efficacy and side effects of oxycodone. Oxycodone has been known to have the
      same potency with morphine. Many studies demonstrated good efficacy of oxycodone on
      postoperative pain. In this study, we designed a prospective, randomized, and double-blind
      study to assess the efficacy and side effects of bolus intravenous of oxycodone injection
      compared to those of fentanyl in patients who underwent the total hip replacement surgery.
