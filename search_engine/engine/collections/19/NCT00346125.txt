      Primary

        -  Determine whether measurements of fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
           (PET)/CT imaging can accurately predict disease-free survival of patients with soft
           tissue sarcoma who are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate histological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas
           with FDG-PET/CT imaging findings.

      Tertiary

        -  Determine the changes in FDG-PET/CT imaging over time as each course of chemotherapy is
           given.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 1 of 2 standard chemotherapy regimens:

        -  Preferred regimen: Patients receive pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome IV on day 1,
           ifosfamide IV continuously on days 1-6, and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 8.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Alternative regimen: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously on days
           1-7. Patients also receive ifosfamide and pegfilgrastim as in the preferred regimen.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT scan at baseline,
      after course 1, and after completion of chemotherapy. Patients undergo surgery within 4-6
      weeks after completion of chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment and surgery, patients are followed every 6 months for 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study.
