      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with breast cancer, early onset (BRCA)ness.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To further determine the efficacy of olaparib in the study population.

      SAFETY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of olaparib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify tissue based biomarkers of defective homologous recombination repair (HRD).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
