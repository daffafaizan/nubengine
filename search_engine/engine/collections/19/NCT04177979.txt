      along with selected highly-performing, trained peer-instructors. The participants were
      randomly allocated to two groups, an intervention group supervised by the instructors and the
      control group that had to practice independently. They would attend OSCE sessions and had
      their performance evaluated, later on, in an exam. In addition to comparing their performance
      with each other, scores of the previous batch were considered in the comparison.
