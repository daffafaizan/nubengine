      and increased inflammatory activity is associated with vascular access failure,
      cardiovascular disease and death in HD patients. The interaction of Axl and its ligand Gas6
      plays an important role in modulating immune response, inhabiting toll-like receptor (TLR)
      signaling and suppressing inflammatory cytokines production. Thus, we want to investigate the
      relationship between tyrosine kinase receptor Axl and the dialysis prognosis in HD patients
      in three-years follow-up.
