      I. Determine the antitumor activity of polyglutamate paclitaxel (CT-2103) as third-line
      treatment for patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal
      cancer.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive polyglutamate paclitaxel (CT-2103) IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
