      elderly. Depression is common among CAD patients and has a major negative impact on treatment
      outcomes and life expectancy. Late-life depression is also associated with symptoms of
      cognitive impairment and subsequent nonresponse to medications. Coronary artery disease and
      depression together can detrimentally affect autonomous seniors, resulting in increased
      caregiver dependence and health care resource use.

      Forty-seven percent of patients with CAD have depressive disorders. About 64% of these do not
      respond to antidepressant treatments. Recent evidence shows that depressed CAD patients have
      lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids than do non-depressed CAD patients. Along with the known
      role of omega-3 fatty acids in brain health, this suggests that deficiencies may affect
      depression.

      Our study, CAROTID (CAD Randomized Omega-3 Trial In Depression), is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial in persons with CAD who are attending a
      cardiac rehabilitation program. Patients will receive either omega-3 fatty acids supplements
      or placebo daily during three months of cardiac rehab. We hypothesize that patients who
      receive omega-3 fatty acids will show greater improvements in depressive symptoms and quality
      of life. This research will determine whether there is an antidepressant effect of omega-3
      fatty acids in CAD patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. If successful, then CAROTID
      will provide evidence to guide health care providers in the recommendation and use of these
      supplements.
