    
      This is a phase III, prospective, randomized (1:1), multicenter, open label study comparing
      the effects of two HAART regimens:

        -  Arm A: Raltegravir 400 mg PO BID + TDF/FTC (Truvada, 300/200 mg) One PO Daily

        -  Arm B: Efavirenz + TDF/FTC (Atripla) Once PO Daily

      The following local sites: Mt. Sinai, Rush University Medical Center, Stroger Hospital,
      University of Chicago and University of Illinois will work together to enroll 10 eligible
      women meeting all eligibility criteria (5 per study arm) over a one year time period. These
      10 women will be randomized 1:1 to receive either TDF/FTC + Raltegravir or TDF/FTC +
      Efavirenz (Atripla). There will be 2 baseline evaluations prior to initiation of study
      therapy. Subjects will be followed for 48 weeks after initiation of study treatment.
