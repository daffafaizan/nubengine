      Study A6181094. The DMC determined Study A6181094 had met pre-specified futility criteria and
      was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint to demonstrate a statistically significant
      improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with sunitinib plus
      paclitaxel versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel. Pfizer notified clinical trial investigators
      involved in the study and regulatory agencies of these findings. Enrollment in this study has
      been stopped.
