      (more than 3 months posts-stroke)were randomly assigned to experiment (EXP) and control (COT)
      groups. All participants received regular conventional rehabilitation programs. The EXP and
      COT received additional upper extremity TS protocol for 30 minutes a day for 20 days. The TS
      temperature of EXP for noxious stimulation was set at 46-47째C for heat and 7-8째C for cold
      stimulation; the temperature of COT for innoxious stimulation was set at 40째C for warm and
      20째C for cold stimulation. The motor and sensory performance were evaluated at baseline and
      post-20th- TS by Brunnstrom's recovery stage, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Barthel Index
      (BI), Upper Extremity Subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Assessment (UE-FM) and
      Thermal Quantitative Sensory Testing (tQST). At pre-1st-TS, post-1st-TS, post-10th-TS and
      post-20th-TS, focal TMS was used to obtain measurement of motor threshold (MT), motor evoked
      potentials (MEPs), size of cortical motor output map and location of the amplitude-weighted
      centre of gravity of the motor output map (CoG) from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in
      bilateral upper extremities.
