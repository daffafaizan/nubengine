      proof of concept and early efficacy of TREAT (1:1 alexithymia treatment) for post-TBI
      alexithymia. It is anticipated that our target sample size is 44. The purpose of this study
      is to examine differences in post-treatment self-reported alexithymia and emotional
      self-awareness in participants with TBI randomized to TREAT or WLC. In addition to examining
      the differences in post-treatment self-reported emotion regulation (general), anxiety, anger,
      depression, positive affect (PA), global emotional function and quality of life in
      participants with TBI randomized to TREAT or WLC.
