      defibrillator clinic. Patients with ICDs will be identified before scheduled clinical visit.
      Patients will be approached and educated about the study rationale and their involvement.
      Patients will be consented for participation in the study after their approval. Patients will
      be educated about donating fecal samples. Patients will be given fecal sampling kits to
      collect and subsequently mail in those samples to the University of Florida physiology
      laboratory where there will be processed in a HIPAA compliant way. These samples will be
      subjected to laboratory analysis which will be outsourced. Fecal samples will be analyzed by
      shotgun metagenomics to characterize the taxonomy of the gut flora and compare the taxonomic
      and physiologic differences between the groups.
