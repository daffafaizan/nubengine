      postoperative period until the 7. postoperative day. Samples are collected every 4-hour.
      Samples will be analyzed continuously but the results will not be included in the clinical
      evaluation of the patient. Before removing the microdialysis catheter a CT whit rectal enema
      is preformed. Every day the patient will be evaluated whit a standardised clinical scoring
      system with attention at anastomotic leakage.

      A total of 150 patients will be included in this study. The results of the peritoneal
      microdialyses will be compared with the clinical scorings system in each patient. The results
      form the uncomplicated courses will be used to define the normal variations in peritoneal
      microdialysis. This will be compared to results from patients with various complications.

      The study is approved by the local scientific ethical committee No. ------
