      spindle in the oocyte, its retardance, the distance between the spindle and the PB, and the
      thickness and retardance of the ZP.

      In the experimental group the embryos for transfer will be selected based on these
      parameters, whereas in the control group they will be selected based on conventional
      morphologic criteria.
