        -  Evaluate the efficacy of irinotecan hydrochloride and cisplatin in patients with
           local-regionally recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of irinotecan hydrochloride and cisplatin in these patients.

        -  Determine the palliative effect of irinotecan hydrochloride and cisplatin on head and
           neck cancer symptoms using the Vanderbilt Cancer Center (VICC) Head and Neck Cancer
           Symptom Survey.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes and cisplatin IV on
      days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete the Vanderbilt Cancer Center (VICC) Head and Neck Cancer Symptom Survey at
      baseline, before each course, at the completion of study therapy, and then at each follow-up
      visit.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 6 weeks for 1 year and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
