      has adverse effects and should be avoided or minimized. Intravenous propofol induction is the
      most common technique used for anesthetic induction. There is preliminary evidence that there
      is less redistribution hypothermia when anesthetic induction is achieved by inhalation
      induction compared to intravenous induction. There is not enough data to compel a change in
      practice patterns. This study will enroll a larger number of patients in order to provide
      stronger evidence that there is a significant difference between induction techniques on body
      temperature. Patients will be randomly assigned to two variation of inhalation induction
      techniques and two variations of intravenous induction. The effect on temperature between the
      four groups will be compared. Reducing the degree of hypothermia has the potential to
      decrease surgical infection rate as well as providing other benefits to patients.
