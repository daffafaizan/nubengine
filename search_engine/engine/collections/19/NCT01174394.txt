      patients develop post-stroke depression (PSD), either in the early or late stages after
      stroke. Although antidepressant agents, represented by selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs), are recommended as first-line drugs in pharmaco-therapy of PSD, its
      effectiveness is limited and the clinical use is largely hampered due to broad side effects,
      especially on cardiovascular system. In addition, since stroke patients are often medicated
      with various classes of drugs, the addition of antidepressant agents may increase risk of
      drug-drug interactions, resulting in unexpected and unpredictable adverse events.

      The objective of this proposed study is to determine whether electro-acupuncture (EA)
      combined with antidepressants could produce significantly greater improvement on depressive
      symptoms in patients with PSD compared to antidepressants alone.

      In this 4-week, assessor-blind, randomized, controlled study of electro-acupuncture (EA) as
      additional treatment with the antidepressant drug called fluoxetine (FLX), a total of 60
      patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) will be recruited. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to FLX (10-30 mg/day) combined with active cranial and body acupuncture (n =30) or
      FLX with placebo cranial and active body acupuncture (n =30) (12 sessions, 3 sessions a
      week). Changes in the severity of depressive symptoms over time are measured using depressive
      scale instruments. Clinical response and remission rates are also calculated. The study will
      be conducted at HKU School of Chinese Medicine, Tung Wah Hospital, and Kowloon Hospital, Hong
      Kong.
