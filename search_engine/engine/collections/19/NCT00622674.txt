      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when given together with cetuximab
           in patients with advanced solid tumors expressing epidermal growth factor receptor
           (EGFR).

      Secondary

        -  To obtain preliminary information about the anti-tumor activity of bortezomib and
           cetuximab.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and cetuximab IV over 60-90
      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, an additional 10 patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.
