      reconstruction within 24 hours of injury. Patients within each group will be randomized to
      either PEG fusion mediated repair (n=10) or PEG mediated reconstruction (n=10); or
      conventional nerve repair (n=10) or conventional nerve reconstruction (n=10). We hypothesize
      that (1) the rate of complications within 1 month of surgery in patients treated with PEG
      fusion will be comparable to that of patients treated with conventional nerve repair, (2) the
      rate of complications within 1 month of surgery in patients treated with PEG fusion will be
      comparable to that of patients treated with conventional autograft reconstruction, (3) there
      will be no detrimental effects from PEG fusion on nerve regeneration over 2 years compared to
      patients treated with conventional nerve repair or reconstruction, (4) recovery of sensory
      and motor function will occur earlier (within 6 months) among patients treated with PEG
      fusion compared to patients treated with conventional nerve repair, (5) recovery of sensory
      and motor function will occur earlier (within 6 months) among patients treated with PEG
      fusion compared to patients treated with conventional autograft reconstruction (6) patients
      treated with PEG fusion will have better range of motion, greater hand strength, less
      disability, less pain, and higher rates of treatment satisfaction compared with patients
      treated with conventional repair or autograft reconstruction.
