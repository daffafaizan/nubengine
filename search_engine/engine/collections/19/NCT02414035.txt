      compared with warfarin (international normalized ratio, but only hundreds of evidence from
      Asia events in several multicenter, prospective, randomized trails. It remains unclear that
      whether Dabigatran is safety in China clinical practice and no need of monitor test. We
      identified participants as those diagnosed as having nonvalved atrial fibrillation, and who
      initiated dabigatran after diagnosis.We followed up each individual from the first
      prescription of dabigatran until discontinued use or switch of anticoagulants, death, or
      other outcomes or until one year later. We categorized bleeding events as major and minor
      events according to anatomical position. We defined time to bleeding as days between the
      first dabigatran prescription and the date of the bleeding event. We analyzed the time to the
      first bleeding event, as well as the time to the first major hemorrhage, intracranial
      hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, vaginal bleeding, hemarthrosis, hemoptysis,
      and epistaxis.
