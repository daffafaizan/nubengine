      with ALL remains dismal with a 5-year survival rate of around 20%, even after intensive
      chemotherapy.

      Inotuzumab ozogamicin (PF-05208773; CMC-544) is an antibody-targeted intravenous (IV)
      chemotherapy agent composed of an anti-CD22 antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent
      cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic.

      After a prephase treatment, induction therapy will be based on inotuzumab ozogamicin and
      intrathecal therapy only. After a maximum of three cycles, patients will receive an age
      adapted intermediate dose consolidation chemotherapy based on the backbone of the German
      Multicenter Study Group for adult ALL (GMALL). This will be followed by a conventional
      maintenance therapy. All patients will be followed for cytological response, minimal residual
      disease and safety parameters.
