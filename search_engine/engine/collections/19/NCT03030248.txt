      patients may be particularly important in transplant recipients. The usual treatment
      prescribed for CDI at the Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital is oral vancomycin. While this
      drug has excellent activity against C. difficile and commonly suppresses its growth to
      non-detection, it does not eradicate carriage and its use results in marked and prolonged
      disruption of the lower intestinal microbiota. Meanwhile, the degree of lower intestinal
      microbiota disruption at the time of HSCT engraftment has been demonstrated to be an
      independent predictor (controlling for other markers of underlying disease) of overall and
      transplant-related 3-year mortality.14 In addition, recent findings suggest that bone marrow
      suppressive effects of antibiotics, in this case potentially unnecessary oral vancomycin
      (which is not appreciably absorbed), may be solely mediated via microbiota disruption. All
      these data supports the notion that antibiotic treatment of NAAT(+), toxin(-) C. difficile
      patients might have significant negative repercussions without a clear clinical benefit.
