      for infants < 1 y.o. and children > 1 or < 12 y.o. are based on clinical and X-ray criteria.
      The CDC definition of Tracheitis are based on absence of clinical and radiographic evidence
      of pneumonia and the following criteria: positive culture obtained by deep tracheal aspirate
      and 2 signs of symptoms with no recognizable cause [such as fever (>38.5Â°C), cough, new or
      increased sputum production, rhonchi, or wheezing].

      The new CDC definition is used to identify patients with VAC and IVAC. The new definitions
      includes all associated complications (infection included) related to mechanical ventilation
      and exclude X-ray criteria.

      VAP, VAT, VAC, IVAC rate, expressed as the number of VAP/VAT/VAC/IVAC episodes per 1000
      mechanical ventilator days (VAP/1000 MV days), were calculated for phase 1 and phase 2.
