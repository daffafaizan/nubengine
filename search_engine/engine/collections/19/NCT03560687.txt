    
      This randomized, single blind (Outcomes Assessor), non-profit study is aimed at verifying
      whether routine preoperative supplementation with SucrosomialÂ® Iron in patients scheduled for
      cardiac surgery may increase baseline haemoglobin, constrain the haemoglobin decrease between
      postoperative day 2 and 3 (haemoglobin drift), and reduce the postoperative transfusion
      requirements, in order to identify a new strategy for pre-hospitalization optimization and
      post-operative recovery.

      Secondary Objectives are

        -  Changes in blood chemistry and biochemical tests between pre- and post-intervention

        -  Evaluation of tolerability and compliance of supplementation with Sucrosomal Iron

        -  Reduction in the number of transfusions and blood bags used

        -  Evaluation of cost-effectiveness
