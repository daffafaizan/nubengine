    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses, to
      identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and designate a dose level for Phase II study
      (RP2D) of ALT-803 administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients
      with advanced pancreatic cancer.

      To access the anti-tumor activity of ALT-803 administered in combination with gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel as measured by objective response rate, overall survival, progression-free
      survival, time to progression, and duration of response in patients with advanced pancreatic
      cancer.

      To Characterize the pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and serum cytokine profile of ALT-803 in
      combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in treated patients. To correlate circulating
      cell free DNA and circulating tumor DNA with clinical outcomes of the study in treated
      patients.
