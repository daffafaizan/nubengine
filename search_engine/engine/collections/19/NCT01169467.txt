    
      Primarily, this study seeks to explore whether there is a difference in mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) variability, incidence of intracranial hypertension, intracranial pressure
      (ICP) variability, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and Cerebrovascular pressure reactivity
      index (PRx) in two groups of subjects.

      Patients must be submitted to the ICU and be endotracheally intubated and receiving
      mechanical ventilation with continuous IV sedation for less than 24 hours after recruitment
      into the study.
