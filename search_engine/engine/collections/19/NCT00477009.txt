      increasingly used over the world, although the number of prescriptions of this therapy varies
      between countries. The appliance widens the upper airways during sleep in order to reduce
      sleep-disordered breathing. The device is easy to use and has become popular among patients.
      Despite this, the evidence for effects of this treatment is not very strong and based on only
      a few studies. The aim of this study is therefore to test the hypothesis that a mandibular
      repositioning appliance reduces sleep apneas, daytime sleepiness and other sleep apnea
      symptoms and increases the quality of life in sleepy patients with mild to moderate
      obstructive sleep apnea and in patients with symptomatic snoring. Secondary outcomes include
      effects on headaches, blood pressure and markers of stress, inflammation, cardiovascular
      health and oxidative stress. At baseline and after 4 month's treatment, the patients will
      respond to questionnaires about symptoms and quality of life. They will undergo measurements
      of sleepiness, sleep apneas and blood pressure as well as sampling of saliva, urine and
      blood. Factors that predict a successful treatment outcome will be analyzed in order to more
      exactly clarify the indications for this treatment modality in a group of patients who have
      been suggested to benefit from mandibular repositioning appliances according to previous
      studies and reviews.
