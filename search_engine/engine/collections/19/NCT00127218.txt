      with a 20 percent or greater increase in serum HDL induced by long-acting niacin, reduces
      plaque size in older individuals with cardiovascular disease. The specific aims of testing
      this hypothesis are:

        1. to determine the effects of statin plus placebo vs. statin plus niacin therapy on plaque
           size and composition,

        2. to determine whether alterations of inflammatory markers of atherosclerosis induced by
           lipid lowering therapy parallel alterations of plaque architecture and composition in
           older patients with cardiovascular disease,

        3. to determine the effects of these interventions on the incidence of cardiovascular and
           cerebrovascular events.

      The results of the trial will be directly applicable to developing strategies for plaque
      stabilization in the elderly who suffer the most from the severe complications of advanced
      cardiovascular atherosclerosis.

      A total of 144 participants aged 65 and older with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease
      will be recruited. Participants will be randomized to receive either statin plus niacin or
      statin plus a placebo for 18 months. Participants will be provided a prescription for
      fluvastatin 80 mg to be taken on a daily basis, or they may continue their ongoing or any
      other cholesterol-lowering drugs such as pravastatin 80 mg daily, simvastatin 20 mg daily,
      atorvastatin up to 20 mg daily or rosuvastatin up to 20 mg daily. Ten visits are expected,
      initially every 4 weeks for dose adjustment. Then visits will be every 6 months; MRI,
      Inflammatory Markers tests, and other lab tests will be done at baseline and the visits at
      months 6, 12, and 18.
