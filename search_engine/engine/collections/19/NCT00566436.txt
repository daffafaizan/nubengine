      femoral artery and yet we still suffer a significant percentage of restenosis, re-occlusions
      and even major amputations, reason for continuous development of new techniques. One such
      technique is the recently developed minimal invasive remote endarterectomy, which shows
      promising patency rates and possibly less complications with earlier recovery. A more
      experienced and the most implemented technique is the suprageniculate femoropopliteal bypass
      graft, which, when using the saphenous vein, has proved durable. A randomized trial comparing
      both modalities was lacking so far, what makes the objective of this study a comparison of
      patency rates between those 2 techniques in a randomized fashion.
