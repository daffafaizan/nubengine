      undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging on three separate days. Across the three
      days, three difference conditions are tested in a double-blind manner, in randomized order.
      In all test sessions, participants receive a skin patch and swallow a capsule. In one
      session, both are a placebo. In another, the patch is a low-dose nicotine patch, and the
      capsule is a placebo. In another session, the patch is a placebo and the capsule contains a
      low dose of mecamylamine.
