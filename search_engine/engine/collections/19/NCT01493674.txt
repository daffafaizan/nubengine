      with eating disorders and attempts have been made to find some association between this and
      the high rates of depression and cognitive function impairment recorded in these patients. It
      is still not known what causes this increase in homocysteine levels, whether the levels
      return to normal after the nutritional state is normalised and what strategies must be
      employed to carry out this normalisation.
