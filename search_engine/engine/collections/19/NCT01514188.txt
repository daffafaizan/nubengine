      doxorubicin. INNO-206 at a dosage of 350 mg/m2 (doxorubicin equivalents of 260 mg/m2) will be
      administered as a 30 minute IVI on Day 1 of each cycle to approximately 70 subjects.
      Doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) will be administered to approximately 35 subjects on Day 1 of each
      cycle. An individual cycle of therapy will be defined as a 3-week (21-day) period. Cycles
      will be repeated every 3 weeks. Multiple cycles may be administered until the subject is
      withdrawn from therapy or until a maximum of 6 cycles are administered. Overall response
      rates as well as individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will be determined
      using RECIST 1.1.[28] Time-to-event endpoints, including PFS and OS will be assessed using
      the Kaplan Meier method.[30] Evaluation of 4- and 6-month progression-free survival will also
      be performed. Toxicity (adverse events) will be recorded using the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0
      (published 28 May 2009).
