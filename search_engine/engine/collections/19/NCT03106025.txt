      ultrasound in the diagnosis of ocular complaints in the emergency department with specific
      focus on the accuracy of diagnosis when compared to that of a blinded ophthalmologist. Ocular
      complaints represent between 2% and 3% of ED visits (Walker et al, 2011). This percentage may
      include vision-threatening diagnoses including retinal detachment, which can occur in 3-4% of
      patients presenting with ocular complaints (Alotaibi et al, 2011). However, the equipment and
      expertise required to adequately assess for conditions such as retinal detachment are limited
      in busy emergency departments due to the time consuming and challenging nature of the
      examination. Incorporating the use of an ultrasound could provide a more available, focused,
      and timely assessment.
