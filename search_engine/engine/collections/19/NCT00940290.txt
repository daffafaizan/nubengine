      are demanding more rigorous processes to ensure that health decisions are well informed by
      the best available research evidence. More than 60 different grading systems are used today
      to grade evidence and recommendations in CPGs. The investigators aimed to provide information
      about which of the four most common grading systems used today (GRADE, SIGN, NICE and
      CEBM-Oxford) could change physicianÂ´s behavior when reading a clinical recommendation in a
      CPG. The investigators will randomize 216 pediatricians and pediatricians in training into
      four groups (one for each grading system) to read a clinical case and to make a decision
      before reading the CPG statement graded with any of the four grading systems. After that they
      will re-consider their answer and post a new one based on the graded recommendation. The
      investigators will measure change in their decision and among groups.
