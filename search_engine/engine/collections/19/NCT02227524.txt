      (MS) to determine whether their walking function and ability is different depending on which
      walking assistive device is used. In addition, the investigators will examine the
      psychosocial impact and amount of fatigue induced by each assistive device. Data collection
      will consist of a series of assessments via survey and physical performance. The analyses
      will consist of appropriate comparisons of means to determine if the use of different
      assistive devices alters any of the outcomes.
