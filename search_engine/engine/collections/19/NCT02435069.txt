      Antegrade continence enema (ACE) therapy administered through a catheterizable stoma
      surgically placed in the cecum has helped children with intractable fecal incontinence attain
      continence for stool. There are a number of retrospective studies demonstrating the variable
      effectiveness rates of ACE therapy. This variability may be due to what is used to flush.
      There are no prospective trials evaluating the effectiveness of different flushing regimens.
      The catheterizable stoma used for the antegrade administration of enema solution is
      frequently made by bringing the appendix out through the abdominal wall or by placing a
      skin-level device (button) in to the cecum. ACE therapy administration through the appendix
      or into the cecum has the potential to cause colonic dysfunction. The effects of ACE
      administration on colonic mucosal health has not been investigated. This pilot study will
      compare a high volume normal saline (NS) flush and a low volume United States Pharmacopeia
      (USP) glycerin flush. The primary aims of the study are to compare which solution, given at
      an optimal dose and frequency, is associated with fewer side effects, while promoting the
      higher degree of fecal continence, and to determine if antegrade enema solution
      administration through an appendicostomy/cecostomy causes electrolyte abnormalities or
      affects gut health.
