      stents (SESs) decrease major adverse cardiovascular event(MACE)and restenosis rates compared
      with bare metal stents (BMSs), but relatively small proportion of patients of complex lesions
      were enrolled in these studies. Moreover,with the increase in complexity of lesions,
      different DES shows different effects. The long term effects of DES for treatment of complex
      coronary lesions remains to be established. This study aims to investigate the long term
      efficacy and safety of Firebird sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in a high-risk
      population, that is, the patients who had complex coronary lesions, including multivessel
      diseases,diffuse long lesions, left main lesions, chronic total occlusion, bifurcation
      lesions, small vessel diseases,severe calcification or angulation lesions, ostial lesions,
      restenotic lesions after bare metel stent implantation .
