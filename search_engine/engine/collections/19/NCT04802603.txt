      radiosurgery was developed as an alternative treatment for localized spine metastasis.
      Stereotactic radiosurgery is an alternative treatment option to conventional palliative
      radiotherapy, which has gained acceptance over the last decade. Clinical experience with
      spine stereotactic radiosurgery has showed high rates of pain control and improvement in
      neurological function in patients with epidural compression.
