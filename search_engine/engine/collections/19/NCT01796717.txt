      will receive piperacillin/tazobactam of 4.5g Q6h, intermittent infusion for 30 minutes.
      Therapy group will receive piperacillin/tazobactam of 4.5g Q6h, prolonged infusion for 4
      hours. The duration is 7-14 days.

      Two sets of blood cultures (for aerobic and anaerobic culture) were obtained before the study
      and post-treatment period if first blood culture is positive. Cultures from the lower
      respiratory tract infection were obtained before (within 48 h) the study and on the last day
      of therapy. The lower respiratory tract specimens obtained either by endotracheal aspiration,
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), a protected brush procedure (PBP) or as sputum were required to
      show > 25 polymorphonuclear cells and < 10 squamous epithelial cells per field (at 100Ã—
      magnification).

      The plasma concentration of piperacillin and tazobactam will be determined by LC/MS/MS
      method. The QC samples will also be analyzed simultaneously with each run for the method
      stability testing, according to the laboratory standard procedure.
