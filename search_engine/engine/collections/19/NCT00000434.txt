      improvements in muscle strength, fitness, and physical activity in people under the age of
      70. This study seeks to determine if those same benefits can be achieved in an older
      population (mean age 84) with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The study will examine the
      long-term effects of a structured exercise program that seeks to promote adherence to
      continued exercise.

      We will randomly assign people who meet the study criteria to the exercise intervention or
      control group. We will conduct measures at baseline, at 8 weeks, and at 3-month intervals for
      2 years following the intervention. The exercise component of the intervention will include
      lower extremity muscle strengthening, range-of-motion exercises, and fitness walking. An
      educational component will focus on arthritis self-efficacy and perceived self-reported
      exercise efficacy. We hypothesize that treatment group participants will exhibit higher rates
      of adherence to exercise and higher functional status outcomes over time compared to
      controls.
