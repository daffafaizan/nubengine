      acetate 22.5 mg administered with a 3-month interval to patients with histologically proven
      carcinoma of prostate who might benefit from medical androgen deprivation therapy. A total of
      up to 160 male patients will receive their first single intramuscular injection of leuprolide
      acetate 22.5 mg on Day 0 (after baseline assessment) and then after 3 months (Day 84). The
      study duration will be 6 months. Thirty(30) patients will be screened per protocol and
      enrolled at selected centers to form the PK cohort. The PK/PD analysis will be performed
      using plasma specimens from the first 20 of 30 patients enrolled in the study (and included
      in the PK/PD cohort). Patients not belonging to the PK cohort will be screened and enrolled
      per protocol and will follow the same study schedule as those enrolled in the PK portion of
      the study, except they will provide only sparse PK sampling.
