    
      To achieve these goals, healthy male and female volunteers will be enrolled into a one month
      longitudinal, prospective study on the influence of hypercaloric overfeeding (+50% of daily
      caloric needs) on different tissues (adipose tissue, muscle and blood).

      They will be separated into two different groups: hypercaloric nutrition and placebo, and
      hypercaloric nutrition and polyphenols (2g/day), where polyphenols administration will be
      randomized and administered in a double blind fashion. Whole body and hepatic insulin
      sensitivity, total energy expenditure, glucose hepatic production, protein and gene
      expression in muscle, adipose tissue and blood as well as intestinal microbiota will be
      assessed at base line, and after one month of overfeeding.
