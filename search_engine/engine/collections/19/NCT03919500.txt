      morbility and mortality. Studies have reported that EPO treatment decreases the incidence and
      severity of experimental NEC in animal models. Evidence from previous clinical studies about
      the effect of EPO treatment against NEC have all been hampered by small numbers of patients.
      The study is to investigate whether repeated low-dose EPO protects against NEC. Preterm
      infants with gestational age â‰¤32 weeks who are admitted to neonatal intensive care units
      within 72 hours after birth are randomized to EPO (500IU/kg, intravenously every other day
      for 2 weeks) or control group (the same volume of saline). Primary outcome is the incidence
      of NEC at 36 weeks of corrected age. Secondary outcome is growth and neurodevelopment at 18
      months of corrected age in infants with NEC.
