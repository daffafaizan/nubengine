    
      Prior to the procedure, the patient will be instructed to fast overnight. Upon arrival to the
      hospital intravenous (IV) access will be placed, and Additionally, a scopolamine patch may be
      placed the night prior to treatment. Additionally a Foley catheter will be placed.

      Starting 30 minutes prior to the administration of 90Y-DOTA-TOC, an amino acid solution will
      be administered via IV. An angiographic catheter will be directed under fluoroscopic guidance
      to the appropriate location in the hepatic artery.

      The 90Y-DOTA-TOC dose will be administered over thirty minutes via the hepatic arterial
      catheter in an outpatient setting.

      Ten patients also enrolled in the correlative sub-study will receive 68Ga-DOTA-TOC concurrent
      with the therapeutic dose and 90 minutes after treatment, these patients will be imaged 90
      minutes after treatment using a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) combined with Computerized
      tomography (CT) (PET/CT) and the following day using Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
      combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (PET/MR).

      All study participants will be followed up on protocol for six months for evaluation of
      toxicity and response to treatment.
