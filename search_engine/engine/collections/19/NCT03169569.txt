    
      A multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study

        -  High-risk patients of post-ESD bleeding will be prospectively enrolled in the study.
           High-risk of post-ESD bleeding is defined as patients with taking antithrombotic agents
           or with large resection (specimen size ≥ 40mm).

        -  All ESDs were performed according to the standard procedure sequence in the hemostatic
           powder group and control group. The Only difference between two groups was hemostatic
           powder (Endo-clot™) application after standard hemostasis using hemostatic forceps in
           the hemostatic powder group. For patients in the study group, after hemostasis on the
           post-resection ulcer using conventional method and removal of specimen, Endo-clot™
           (EndoClot Plus, Unc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) was applied immediately onto the
           post-resection surface.

        -  Bleeding rate of study group within 4 weeks after ESD will be compared with the control
           group. "
