      vessels supplying the brain. Approximately 500,000 people in the United States experience
      this type of stroke each year. The only approved treatment for acute stroke is to attempt to
      dissolve the blood clot using t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator). This treatment must be
      given within 3 hours of symptom onset and is associated with a risk of brain hemorrhage
      (bleeding in the brain) of about 6% (6 in 100 patients).

      Activated Protein C (APC) is a protein in the blood that is important in dissolving blood
      clots and reducing inflammation. Studies in animals suggest that APC may also protect brain
      cells from injury caused by a stroke. We are doing this study to determine if giving APC to
      individuals who have had a stroke will be safe and will reduce the damage to brain cells
      caused by the stroke. APC is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      use in patients with severe, life-threatening infections.
