      motion interaction in ABI population. The study consists of 4 primary phases: recruitment,
      assessment, intervention and post-intervention assessment. Two arms involve a randomized
      controlled study with inpatient participants, where participants are randomly assigned to an
      intervention or control group. Recruitment phase includes cognitive assessments to evaluate
      eligibility for the study. In the assessment and post assessment phases cognitive performance
      is established.

      Intervention includes 10 computerized training sessions of 30-45 minutes over 3 weeks period
      using Intendu Functional Brain Trainer (FBT). The control group intervention involves playing
      commercial iPad games for the same duration. Interventions will be performed in addition to
      standard inpatient treatment.

      In addition to the randomized control study, a third experimental arm will be performed, were
      participants living in the community will perform a similar protocol with cognitive
      motion-based video games. The recruitment, assessment, post assessment and intervention
      phases will be similar to the above.
