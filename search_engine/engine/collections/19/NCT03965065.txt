      stented bio-prostheses among patients undergoing a surgical aortic valve replacement. The
      prostheses are not pre specified to be provided by a specific manufacturer, so that any bio
      prosthesis but transcatheter and scentless aortic valves can be implanted.

      The estimated sample size is 350 patients. They will be randomised 1:1 to any of the two arms
      of the study (standard Vs. sutureless prostheses). The randomisation will be stratified
      according to the need for a concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting procedure.

      Six hospitals in Madrid (Spain) will take part in the study. The period of recruitment will
      start as soon as June 2019 and is supposed to finish by June 2020 or earlier.

      The main outcomes of the study will be measured 6 months after the aortic valve implantation
