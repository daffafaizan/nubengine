      disrupting sleep, emotional balance and social life of the patients. Acoustic deprivation
      causes hearing loss and is responsible for a cascade of processes that result in the
      reorganization of the cortex through a synchronization of neuronal activity related to a
      cortical re-mapping. Consistent with the hypothesis that tinnitus is caused by abnormal
      activation of the auditory cortex, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can
      temporarily reduce cortical hyperactivity through direct neuromodulation of the temporal
      cortex. Furthermore, studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      can also suppress tinnitus. Objective: To determine the effectiveness of rTMS and TDCS in the
      treatment of patients with chronic tinnitus and auditory loss. Methods: We performed an
      analytical experimental double-blind study using rTMS and tDCS in patients with chronic
      tinnitus and hearing loss.
