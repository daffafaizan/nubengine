      efficient treatment of perianal fistulas in patients with CrohnÂ´s Disease (CD). In a
      prospective observational study 57 % of 21 patients with complex fistulas refractory to
      combined surgical and/or medical treatment achieved complete clinical healing of the treated
      fistulas from one to three injections.

      This randomized and placebo controlled study aims to confirm the efficacy of injections with
      freshly harvested autologous adipose tissue in CD patients with perianal fistulas. 140 CD
      patients with complex perianal fistulas refractory to standard surgical and/or medical
      treatment will be included and randomized to either treatment with freshly harvested
      autologous adipose tissue or placebo (saline). Clinical evaluation of the treatment efficacy
      will also be performed in a blinded manner.
