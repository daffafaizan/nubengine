      selective inhibitor (approx. 106.0 times more selective for COX-2 inhibition over COX-1).
      Doses are 120 mg/day for acute pain. Current therapeutic indications are: treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute
      pain and gout. Note that approved indications differ by country.

      Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor, Etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of
      cyclo-oxigenase enzyme (COX-2). This reduces the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from
      arachidonic acid. Among the different functions exerted by PGs, their role in the
      inflammation cascade should be highlighted. COX-2 selective inhibitor (aka "COXIB") showed
      less marked activity on type 1 cycloxigenase compared to traditional non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). This reduced activity is the cause of reduced
      gastrointestinal toxicity.

      Quantitative sensory tests (QST) are techniques employed to measure the intensity of stimuli
      needed to produce specific sensory perceptions. They are used to evaluate a sensory detection
      threshold or other sensory responses from supra-threshold stimulation. The common physical
      stimuli are (i) touch-pressure, (ii) vibration, and (iii) coolness, warmth, cold pain, and
      heat pain. In QST, the subject must be able to comprehend what is being asked by the test,
      alert and not taking mind-altering medications, and not biased to a certain test outcome.
