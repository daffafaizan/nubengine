      late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). A recent review by the World Health Organization
      highlighted the potential protective role of physical activity and exercise against cognitive
      decline, all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia in healthy individuals. In an 18-month
      longitudinal observational study, investigators showed that sedentary e4 carriers experience
      significant declines in episodic memory and hippocampal volume compared to 4 carriers who
      engaged in moderate PA. Importantly, among 4 non-carriers, no significant longitudinal
      changes in cognition and brain imaging were observed whether the non-carriers were sedentary
      or engaged in moderate PA, suggesting that PA has a specific neuroprotective role in delaying
      the progression of AD in e4 carriers. Based on the results, a pragmatic, randomized
      controlled trial with blinded clinical and imaging outcomes is proposed to determine the
      impact of a home based, high intensity exercise intervention in healthy, cognitively intact
      e4 carriers between the ages of 65 and 80 years. The CYCLE-AD (CYcling to Cease or Limit the
      Effects of Alzheimer's Disease) trial will recruit otherwise healthy sedentary carriers
      randomized to one of two groups (n=75 each): 1) an Indoor Cycling (IC) group that
      participates in high-intensity interval training (HIIT; 60-90% of heart rate reserve) in
      their home via the commercially available PelotonÂ® cycling system or 2) a Usual and Customary
      Care (UCC) group, in which participants engage in their habitual level of PA. Investigators
      hypothesize that an 18-month high-intensity aerobic exercise regimen will slow AD-related
      disease progression in sedentary elders at genetic risk for AD. Participants in the
      intervention group will engage in exercise 3x/week (minimum 90 minutes/week) for 18 months.
      Primary outcome measures, obtained at study entry and at 18 months, will include
      comprehensive cognitive testing and brain MR imaging to assess disease progression and a
      comprehensive PA/fitness assessment to measure the degree of change in physical fitness due
      to high intensity aerobic exercise.
