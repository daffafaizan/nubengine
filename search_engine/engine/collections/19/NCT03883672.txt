      during the transplant process :

        1. Pre-admission transplant questionnaire: given and collected by the transplant physician
           during the pre-graft consultation before entering hospitalization (approximatively 15
           days before). To be completed by the patient on site (approximately 45 minutes to
           complete the questionnaire)

        2. Transplant admission questionnaire: given during the first days of hospitalization. To
           be completed within 6 days and returned to the transplant physician (approximately 30
           minutes to complete the questionnaire)

        3. Post-transplant follow-up questionnaire: given in consultation at 6 months by the
           transplant physician (between 30 and 45 minutes to complete the questionnaire in
           consultation)

      The questionnaires include validated and standardized scales.

      The first questionnaire contains scales on dispositional factors (i.e. personality factors) .
      The second one is on the so-called transactional adjustment factors. And the third is on
      post-transplant factors (e. g. post-traumatic growth). Scales from the first and second
      questionnaire will be used to obtain a longitudinal view.

      The study population concerns all patients going to receive an allograft transplantation,
      aged over 18 years, who have consented to answer the various questionnaires over a period of
      approximately 7 months . The participants come from the hematology departments of the
      Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris, the Estaing University Hospital in Clermont-Ferrand and the
      Brabois Hospital in Nancy.
