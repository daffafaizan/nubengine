      pre-treatment of the area with topical aminolevulinic acid for 1 hour, followed by treatment
      with blue light. In a previous study, the investigators showed pretreatment of microneedles
      enhance penetration of topical aminolevulinic acid as compared to the control group.

      The aim of this study is to investigate how varying incubation periods of topical
      aminolevulinic acid after pretreatment with microneedle application can facilitate the
      penetration and efficacy of photodynamic therapy.
