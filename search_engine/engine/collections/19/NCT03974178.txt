      melarsoprol, a very toxic drug.

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate fexinidazole as an alternative treatment
      over melarsoprol in patients with stage 2 of HAT disease due to t.b rhodesiense in a Phase
      II/III cohort trial with 34 stage 2 patients. All stages of the disease will be recruited but
      the recruitment will stop once 34 evaluable stage-2 patients have reached the end of
      treatment.

      The trial will be a multicentre, non-randomized, clinical trial in patients with r-HAT.

      Subjects will be recruited among the patients reporting to Lwala Hospital (Uganda) and Rumphi
      District Hospital (Malawi). If feasible, r-HAT patients from other hospitals and centres in
      Kaberamaido/Dokolo Districts (Uganda) and Rumphi/Mzimba North District (Malawi) and well as
      Zambia bordering areas, will be referred to Lwala and Rumphi Hospitals, respectively, for
      treatment.

      Fexinidazole is an oral treatment which has to be taken every day for 10 days. In case of
      lack of efficacy (e.g. disease relapse) the patients will be switched to the standart
      treatment that is part of the National Control Program in each country (melarsoprol for
      stage-2 patients and suramin for stage-1 patients)
