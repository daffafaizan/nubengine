      dermatitis-like rash report a personal and/or family history of atopy (asthma, allergies and
      atopic dermatitis). In addition comparisons will be made between the presence of atopy
      between patients with and without the skin rash. Comparisons will be made of systemic
      immunosuppressive therapies between patients with and without the atopic dermatitis-like
      rash. Determination will be made as to whether histologic characterization of a skin biopsy
      specimen is consistent with AD. Thorough evaluations will be made of patients in the clinic
      with this rash and the presence of bacterial superinfection will be ruled out.
