      and young adults (6 to 20 years of age) with SMA. This is a multicentric, randomized,
      double-blind study versus placebo, with two parallel groups treated and followed during 2
      years. It has been preceded by a 7 days pharmacokinetic phase, concerning 14 patients, aiming
      to provide information on the kinetic profile of Riluzole in children. The drug could
      stabilize patients condition, and especially interrupt paralysis progression; those are the
      desired effects.

      There is an open-label study of the long term safety of riluzole therapy in spinal muscular
      atrophies types II and III, with patients previously enrolled in ASIRI double-blind study.
