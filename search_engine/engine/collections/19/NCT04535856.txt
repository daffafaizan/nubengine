      caused by the Coronavirus show respiratory distress. To date, the incidence rate has been
      more than 3 million each year; however, as the increase and globalization of the
      environmental pollution has been expanded, the number of patients is expected to increase due
      to acute diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory virus, SARS, and coronavirus.

      Since 2015, Daewoong Pharmaceutical intends to use stem cells for product research on rare
      and intractable diseases including respiratory distress. Stem cells are also called
      pluripotent cells or truncal cells that can convert to any organ. It is an embryonic stage
      undifferentiated cell that has stopped differentiating before forming a specific organ whose
      differentiation has not been determined and has the ability to differentiate into muscle,
      bone, and internal conformal body organs. There are three types of stem cells: embryonic stem
      cells, adult stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Daewoong Pharmaceutical intends
      to develop cell therapy products using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).
