    
      This is a randomized, double-blind study to compare the long term safety profile and
      effectiveness of acetaminophen, given at a dose of 1000 mg every four to six hours, and
      naproxen, given at a dose of 375 mg twice daily (with matching placebo given four times daily
      to maintain the blind), in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. There are two
      groups of subjects. Group 1 has approximately 480 subjects randomized and a treatment
      duration of 12 months. Group 2 has approximately 80 subjects randomized and a treatment
      duration of 6 months. The primary measure of efficacy is the change from baseline in the
      WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale at month 6. Safety evaluations, throughout the
      course of the study, include monitoring adverse events, laboratory tests and assessments of
      vital signs including respiration rate, pulse, blood pressure, and body weight. Subjects are
      instructed to take a dose of medication orally, every 4-6 hours. The acetaminophen subjects
      take a total daily dose of 4 g of acetaminophen. The naproxen subjects a total daily dose of
      750 mg of naproxen. The treatment duration is 12 and 6 months in Group 1 and Group 2,
      respectively.
