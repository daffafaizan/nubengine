      visible lesion more than 4.0 cm in greatest dimension and stage IIb was classified tumor
      invades parametrium must not to pelvic wall. These were the common stages in Thai cervical
      cancer patients,and made a troublesome effect to Thai women. According to this study,stage
      early IIb with 1/3 of parametrium involvement. Mostly these two stage was treated with
      concurrent chemoradiation, challenging the possibility of late sequelae of radiation effect.
      This specific group of patients can be avoid the referred side effect by using neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy followed by radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and para-aortic
      node sampling in operable cases (at least partial response- PR) and concurrent chemoradiation
      (CCR) in inoperable cases (less than PR). Due to high risk type of these subspecific group,
      combination chemotherapy instead of single chemotherapy was used as CCR. However in operable
      cases with identified poor prognostic factor should be receive post operative radiation as
      the usual manner.
