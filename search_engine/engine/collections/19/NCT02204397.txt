    
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of
      subcutaneous (SC) daily administration of INGAP-P (600 mg SC once a day in three separate
      injection sites) with ustekinumab (two single injections of 45 mg SC, one as pretreatment two
      weeks before INGAP-P treatment begins and the second one after 2 weeks of INGAP-P treatment)
      in adult patients with established type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Safety will be evaluated
      by assessing local tolerability, recording incidence of hypoglycemia, performing safety
      laboratory measures at frequent intervals, and following subjects very closely for any
      adverse events (AEs).

      Secondary objectives of this study are to generate preliminary data on the efficacy of
      INGAP-P and ustekinumab in adult patients with established T1DM, specifically by change from
      baseline to Week 12 in: 1) Maximal C-peptide (Cmax) during mixed meal test (MMT) and glucagon
      stimulated test (GST); 2) C-peptide release (AUC) during MMT and GST; 3) Fasting C-peptide;
      4) Fasting glucose (before breakfast and after at least 8 hours of fasting); 5) Longer term
      glycemic control as reflected by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and 1,5-anhydroglucitol
      (1,5-AG); and, 6) Total daily insulin dose relative to body weight.
