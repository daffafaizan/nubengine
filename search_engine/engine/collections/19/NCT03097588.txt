      I. To assess the efficacy of netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride (NEPA) to prevent
      nausea and vomiting both during and after a highly emetogenic (BEAM) conditioning regimen for
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To differentiate response to NEPA over different phases of chemotherapy-induced nausea.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 60 minutes before standard of care BEAM treatment, patients receive netupitant and
      palonosetron hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1, 3, and 6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days.
