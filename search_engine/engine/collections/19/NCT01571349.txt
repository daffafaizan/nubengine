      evidence for a rebalanced hemostasis. Previous study showed that the platelet count may not
      predict the risk of bleeding since the platelet count is not an indicator of platelet
      function. Thromboelastography may be the choice of investigation when platelet function is in
      question especially in patients with idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
      Previous study have shown that maximum clot formation is the most important
      thromboelastography parameter in predicting bleeding in ITP patients that makes
      thromboelastography superior to other hemostatic tests. The investigators are trying to
      evaluate the rebalanced hemostasis in patients with ITP by comparing the value of platelet
      count, von Willebrand factor antigen level, and thromboelastography parameters.
