      mechanism of acupuncture in reducing Bortezomib-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (BIPN) in
      multiple myeloma patients. It will examine the effect of acupuncture on serum proinflammatory
      cytokine and β-endorphin levels to further understand the mechanism of acupuncture on a
      molecular level. This study is the first clinical trial studying the effect of acupuncture on
      treating BIPN. It is also the first study to explore the mechanism of acupuncture through
      frequent small amount of blood draws at six time points to detect changes in proinflammatory
      cytokines and β-endorphins. It has the potential to identify a minimal risk
      non-pharmacological intervention to alleviate BIPN symptoms, and to significantly improve our
      understanding of the mechanism of acupuncture.
