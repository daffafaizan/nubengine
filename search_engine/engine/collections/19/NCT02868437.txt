      products of conception. The risk of adhesion is higher after second trimester abortion. This
      complication may result in infertility, recurrent miscarriages and irregular periods with
      dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain.

      They have been reported that the intrauterine application of auto-crosslinked hyaluronic acid
      gel following hysteroscopic adhesiolysis or hysteroscopic surgery significantly reduces the
      formation of post-operative intrauterine adhesions.

      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      self-crosslinked hyaluronic acid gel in the reduction of development of de-novo
      post-curettage adhesions at 2 months follow-up.
