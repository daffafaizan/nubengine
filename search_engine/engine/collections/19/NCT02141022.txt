      promise for neuroprotection, a feature relevant to the progressive neurologic damage
      associated with the disease. Cognitive impairment accompanies MS in 40-60% of cases and when
      present, additional symptomatic treatment combined with DMT is required. To date no
      symptomatic pharmacologic therapy has shown a consistent benefit on MS associated cognitive
      dysfunction. However, non-pharmacologic approaches show promise. With recent technical and
      scientific advances, cognitive training is rapidly evolving to become the most effective
      intervention for the cognitive impairments associated with a wide range of neurological
      conditions. However, these training programs have not yet been studied in MS.

      This study will be a randomized open-label clinical pilot trial to compare a plasticity-based
      and adaptive cognitive remediation (PACR) program to an active control (ordinary computer
      games) in 20 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) starting Gilenya therapy. Primary outcome
      measures will be used as preliminary indicators of effect, with improvements on program
      task-related measures and changes in cognitive measures. Secondary outcome measures will
      determine the feasibility of the use of these programs in patients with MS, as indicated by
      compliance and patient-reported experience.
