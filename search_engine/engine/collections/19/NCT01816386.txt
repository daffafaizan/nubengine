      last decade. In this regard, it might be appropriate to develop a simply applicable (a) and
      effective (b) acupuncture regimen for the complementary support of fast-track anaesthesia.
      Regarding practicability (a), it might be of interest to reduce the amount of necessary
      acupuncture points. Trials have shown that single-point acupuncture is strong enough to cause
      relevant clinical effects (Fleckenstein et al., 2009; Lee and Fan, 2009). In addition,
      practicability means to reduce the amount of needling events; therefore the investigators
      suggest the use of press needles, making complete peri-anaesthetic availability possible.
      Regarding effectiveness (b), it has been reported that acupuncture at Governing Vessel 26
      (Du-26) may be successful in shock resuscitation (Hsu et al., 2006). In combination with
      other points it has been evaluated in a Chinese study improving the vegetative state after
      operation of acute subdural hematoma (Zheng, 2005).
