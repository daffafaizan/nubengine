      tobacco cessation conducted by oral health professionals incorporating an oral examination
      component in the dental office or community setting may increase tobacco abstinence rates
      among both cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users (Cochrane Database Syst
      Rev.6:CD005084.) However, efficacy of tobacco cessation for oral diseases by oral health
      professionals are not elucidated. There are few studies on tobacco cessation intervention by
      dentists but none in terms of reduction of oral diseases or further disease prevention.

      Academy of Clinical Periodontology, Japanese Society for Oral Health, Japanese Society of
      Dentistry for Medically Compromised Patient and Japanese Society of Oral Oncology conduct a
      study to verify the efficacy of tobacco cessation in patients with oral diseases;
      periodontitis, dental implant and oral mucosal diseases by a multicenter prospective trial.
