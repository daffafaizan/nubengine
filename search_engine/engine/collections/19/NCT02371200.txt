    
      This study "A Pivotal, Phase III Trial of Detecting generalized tonic-clonic seizures with a
      Seizure Detection and Warning System in Epilepsy Patients " is a phase III, pivotal,
      prospective study of an electromyography (EMG) based seizure detection and warning system
      (tentatively named Brain Sentinelâ„¢ Seizure Detection System) for detecting generalized
      tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures. The detection device is worn on the bicep brachii muscles and is
      intended to alert a remote caregiver of a GTC seizure and provide a record of GTC seizure
      activity. This is to facilitate a faster intervention to the GTC seizure, and to more
      accurately document GTC seizure frequency in a home, skilled nursing, or inpatient setting.
