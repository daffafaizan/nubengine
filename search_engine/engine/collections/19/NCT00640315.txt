    
      In addition to the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic variables, the following laboratory
      variables were assessed:

        -  Hematology: Leucocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume
           (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration
           (MCHC), platelets, white blood cell (WBC), partial thromboplastin time (PTT),
           prothrombin time (Quick), international normalized ratio (INR) (prothrombin time
           expressed in relation to normal value) ;

        -  Clinical chemistry: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
           alkaline phosphatase (AP), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), creatine phosphokinase
           (CK), lipase, cholinesterase (CHE), glucose, creatinine, urea, uric acid, bilirubin,
           total protein, serum albumin, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride.

      And due to the small number of subjects analyzed at several local labs, no summary statistics
      were provided.
