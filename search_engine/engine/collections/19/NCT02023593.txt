      some studies have showed that irinotecan, fluorouracil may be effective in treating patients
      with metastatic esophageal carcinoma after failure of first-line treatment. Since irinotecan,
      fluorouracil, and leucovorin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor. Giving more
      than one drug may be more effective. In this phase â…¡ trial, the investigator would like to
      observe the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI(Irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin ) as second-line
      treatment for metastatic esophageal carcinoma.
