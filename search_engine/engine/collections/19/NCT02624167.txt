    
      This is a prospective, 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study designed
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of an oral dose range of
      NW-3509A of 30 to 50 mg/day (15 to 25 mg, BID) in patients with chronic schizophrenia on a
      stable dose of an antipsychotic (aripiprazole or risperidone). A minimum of 90 patients will
      be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either NW-3509A (n=45) or placebo (n=45). Dose
      increases will be performed only during in-patient setting.

      Safety and efficacy assessments will be done on a weekly basis during the randomized
      treatment period. The assessment of safety will be based on laboratory tests (biochemistry,
      hematology, and urinalysis), 12-lead standard ECG, vital signs, physical examinations,
      neurological examinations, C-SSRS, ESRS-A, subjective reporting of any AE by the subject,
      objective observation of any AE by the Investigator. Pharmacokinetic samples will be taken at
      various time-points. Efficacy assessments will include the PANSS, CGI-C, CGI-S and the
      Strauss-Carpenter Level of Functioning (LOF) scale.
