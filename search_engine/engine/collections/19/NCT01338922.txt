      randomized 1:1 to either starting with CSII as soon as possible or to continuing MDI while
      waiting six months for transmission to CSII, stratified by center. The primary outcomes were
      patient-reported diabetes-specific health-related quality of life , and diabetes burden of
      the main caregiver. We also investigated the impact of CSII on main caregiver stress,
      psychological well-being, fear of hypoglycemia, main caregiver's and adolescent's treatment
      satisfaction, family conflict, and HbA1c.
