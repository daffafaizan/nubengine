      trials. After 3 d on a standardised diet, participants performed 60 min of treadmill running
      at 65% VO2max on Day 4 following an overnight fast (FAST) or a standardised breakfast (FED).
      Blood samples were collected at baseline, before exercise, during exercise, for 3h after
      exercise and on four consecutive follow-up days (FU1-FU4). Plasma/serum were analysed for β
      CTX, P1NP, OC, bone ALP, PTH, ACa, PO4, OPG, cortisol, leptin and ghrelin.
