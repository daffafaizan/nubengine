      cm wide (Pardo et al., 2003; Mazouni et al., 2005; Robert et al., 2013). The ectocervix is
      the portion of the cervix projecting into the vagina. It is composed of non-keratinized
      stratified squamous epithelium and is divided into anterior and posterior lips. The
      squamocolumnar junction is the area where the epithelial cells of the endocervix and
      ectocervix meet (Herfs et al., 2013). In this area, the columnar cells of the endocervix
      undergo metaplasia to the squamous cells of the ectocervix. The opening of the ectocervix to
      the vagina is called the external os. Although studies of cervical length in non-pregnant
      women are few, it is acknowledged that the size and shape of both the cervix and the external
      os differ in women (Pardo et al., 2003; Mazouni et al., 2005) and vary with age, hormonal
      changes, parity and surgical treatments to the cervix.

      Further evaluation of any cervical abnormalities by hysteroscopy eg. (choronic cervicitis ,
      microcycstic epethelium ,micropolypi , cervical stenosis) before ICSI could address us to a
      hidden cause of infertility and may improve the pregnancy rates in ICSI cycles with prompt
      medical or surgical managment of such pathologies.
