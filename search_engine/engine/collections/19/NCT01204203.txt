      malignant mesothelioma. Evaluation will be limited to patients with standard (CT scans) and
      functional instruments (FDG PET Scans) of tumor assessment after the administration of
      standard doses of zoledronic acid (4 mg IV every 3 weeks). We will also explore the biologic
      effect of zoledronic acid in patients using new serum markers as well as several blood level
      markers.
