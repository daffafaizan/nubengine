    
      Women are recruited starting from the sixth month of pregnancy; forty-one eventually agreed
      to participate and they were randomly assigned to two groups: an Experimental group (treated
      with the expressive writing task, one weeks-three months after childbirth) and a Control
      group (no intervention).

      Psychological health is measured at three stages:

      before intervention, at 8-9 months pregnant (T0); after intervention, from 1 week to 3 months
      after delivery (T1); and a follow-up after 1 to 3 months (T2). The assessment protocol
      consists of the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), the Prenatal Attachment Inventory
      (PAI), the Toronto Alexythimia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13), the
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), the Rating Scale For Rapid Stress Assessment (VRS)
      and the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12). The healthcare costs are collected at baseline
      (T0) and follow-up (T2) with a survey created ad hoc, in which participants reported the
      number and the type of the medical examinations, hospitalisations, prescribed drugs etc.
      Social and personal data are collected from the first survey.
