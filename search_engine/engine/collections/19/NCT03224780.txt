      pregnant women. As one of the leading causes of postpartum hemorrhage, abnormal placentation
      involves the attachment of placental villi directly to the myometrium with potentially deeper
      invasion into the uterine wall or surrounding organs. Surgical procedures that disrupt the
      integrity of uterus, including cesarean section, dilatation and curettage, and myomectomy,
      have been implicated as key risk factors for placenta accreta(Megier et al., 2000).Prenatal
      diagnoses of placenta accreta through the use of gray-scale ultrasonography, color Doppler
      imaging, and magnetic resonance imaging have been reported previously (Chou et al., 1997).

      Placenta increta and percreta have rarely been diagnosed antepartum, and ultrasonographic
      findings may provide the only objective evidence of placenta accreta.A biochemical marker for
      this condition would therefore be useful (Ophir et al., 1999).It is critical to make the
      diagnosis before delivery because preoperative planning can significantly decrease blood loss
      and avoid substantial morbidity associated with placenta accreta (Shih et al., 2009).
