    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most important causes of morbidity
      and mortality worldwide and has a tremendous impact on the individual patient, the healthcare
      system, and the general public.

      Contrary to other chronic diseases, the natural history of COPD, commonly described with the
      natural decline of lung function, has not been investigated sufficiently and the presence of
      various phenotypes is still under intensive investigation.

      The investigators aim to study the natural course of lung function and the development of
      COPD in a longitudinal, observational, population based cohort in Austria.

      Study population (male and female, age 6 - 80 years) will be randomly recruited via the
      national inhabitants register in both Vienna (urban cohort) and Lower Austria (rural cohort).

      Health examinations will include lung function testing, cardiovascular examinations, body
      composition and metabolic testing as well as socioeconomic counseling. Furthermore, the
      initiation of a bio bank will provide serological testing on biomarker and epigenetic
      analysis.

      In particular, the investigators intend to assess a) the age-related natural decline in lung
      function in the general population, b) the prevalence of COPD and the development of major
      respiratory symptoms in this disease, c) the prevalence of the most important COPD
      comorbidities (cardiovascular, metabolic and cognitive dysfunction) and d) the association
      between lung health and social status, individual long term exposure to air pollution and
      other toxic inhalants.

      This health examination will be the first investigation in Austria providing information
      about the most prevalent respiratory disease and it's comorbidities in a longitudinal
      approach.
