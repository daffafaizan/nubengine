      medical treatment at the "Ospedali Riuniti" of Ancona, Italy, and the "University Hospital"
      of Chieti, Italy. All the participants will be examined utilizing echocardiography before and
      after the treatment. The two-dimensional speckle-tracking analysis will be performed with an
      off-line dedicated software from the apical 4-chambers-view. All the unroofing procedures
      will be performed under cardiopulmonary bypass.
