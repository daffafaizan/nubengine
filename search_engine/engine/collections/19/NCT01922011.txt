      approximately 5/10,000 children each year and accounting for approximately 1% of all
      pediatric hospitalizations. In children, osteomyelitis arises from bacteremic seeding of the
      bone metaphysis.

      Daptomycin, is a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial active against most clinically significant
      gram-positive pathogens including drug-resistant strains such as Methicillin Resistant
      Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin Susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Daptomycin
      has proven clinical efficacy in adults in the treatment of complicated skin and skin
      structure infections (cSSSI) caused by aerobic gram-positive pathogens and the treatment of
      S. aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia; SAB), including those complicated by
      right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by MSSA and MRSA. Although not indicated for
      osteomyelitis, daptomycin has been successfully used to treat osteoarticular infections in
      adults and children as salvage therapy and at medical centers with increasingly high rates of
      vancomycin resistant organisms.

      In addition, more comparative clinical trials are needed in pediatric AHO to better elucidate
      the optimal treatment regimen and clinical response.
