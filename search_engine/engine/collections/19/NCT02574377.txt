      pDC/myDC (arm C, n=10). Subsequent vaccinations will be performed according to the protocol:
      2 biweekly vaccinations of intranodal injections with pDC, myDC or the combination with pDC
      and myDC. After each vaccination the investigators will examine peripheral blood for
      proliferative and humoral KLH immune responses. After the vaccinations, a DTH with peptide
      loaded blood DC is performed from which biopsies are taken for T cell analysis. lf patients
      remain disease free, the investigators will repeat this cycle with a 6 months interval up to
      a total of three cycles. lf a tumor recurrence occurs a biopsy will be taken for laboratory
      evaluation.
