    
      Part I was a 22-week parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled period (8 weeks baseline,
      2 weeks double-blind titration, and 12 weeks maintenance). After completing the baseline
      period, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the 3 ESL dose levels or to
      placebo.

      Part II was a 1-year open-label extension for patients who had completed Part I. The starting
      dose was 800 mg once daily and could be titrated up or down at 400-mg intervals between 400
      and 1200 mg.
