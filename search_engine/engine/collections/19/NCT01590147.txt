      I. To establish the feasibility of implementing a YST among patients undergoing chemotherapy.
      This includes the feasibility of implementing yoga in a treatment setting, and patient
      recruitment, adherence, and retention.

      II. To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of a YST for reducing fatigue among patients
      undergoing chemotherapy.

      III. To obtain exploratory data on the impact of a YST on other treatment-related symptoms
      (e.g., pain, distress, nausea) and QOL.

      IV. To obtain exploratory data on the impact of a YST on potential psychological
      (self-efficacy for coping with cancer, response expectancies for symptoms) and physiological
      (interleukin [IL]-6 [IL-6], IL-1 Receptor Antagonist [IL-1Ra], tumor necrosis factor- alpha
      [TNF-a], soluble TNF receptor I [sTNFRI], C-reactive protein [CRP]) mediators that may
      explain the impact of the YST on fatigue.

      OUTLINE: Patients (n=20) are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients participate in three 15-minute YST sessions, comprising awareness meditation
      practice, movement practice, and breathing practice and relaxation. Patients also receive a
      compact disc (CD) recording of a 15-minute YST session and are instructed to practice the YST
      at home 4 times weekly.

      ARM II: Patients participate in three 15-minute CE sessions, comprising empathic attention
      with an interventionist who allows patients to direct the flow of conversation and provides
      supportive comments according to standardized procedures. Patients also receive CDs with
      recorded information related to coping with colorectal cancer similar in length to the
      suggested practice time in Arm I.

      The interventions (Week 2, Week 4, Week 6) and assessments (Week 0, Week 4, Week 8) are
      implemented during visits for chemotherapy (every two weeks).
