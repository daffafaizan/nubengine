    
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study of orally administered
      tivozanib in combination with capecitabine to approximately 24 subjects with advanced solid
      tumors and, in the expanded MTD cohort, subjects with locally advanced or metastatic breast
      or colorectal cancer. This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      dose-limiting toxicities, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic, and antineoplastic
      activity. The number of cohorts evaluated and the maximum doses to be administered will
      depend upon the observed tolerability. Dose level "0", tivozanib HCl 1.5 mg and capecitabine
      1000 mg/mÂ² BID, is the starting dose level. Once assigned to a cohort, each subject will
      continue to be treated at the same dose level and schedule throughout the course of the
      study.
