      This is a randomized double blind clinical trial of the BioVac suction device versus standard
      endoscopy suction for UGIB. The study will be performed at London Health Sciences Center
      Victoria Campus and University Campus with an anticipated recruitment period of 2.5 years.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      All patients over the age of 18 admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of UGIB will be
      considered for recruitment. Patients already admitted to hospital with another diagnosis who
      develop UGIB will also be included.

      INTERVENTION:

      Patients will undergo EGD for UGIB as per standard clinical practice. If the bleeding source
      is not found within the first 5 minutes (timer starts once EGD passes upper esophageal
      sphincter) due to blood clots, the patient may benefit from additional suctioning. The
      patient will be randomized in blocks of 2-6 stratified by site to either the BioVac device or
      endoscopy suction. Those randomized to the BioVac device will use it to irrigate and suction
      as much blood as possible until the bleeding source is found or until the endoscopist feels
      that additional time would not help. Those randomized to endoscopy suction will do the same
      without the BioVac device. Due to the suctioning power of the study device, a placebo is not
      possible. Our original intention was to record the endoscopy video to blindly assess the
      outcome. Unfortunately, this ended up not being possible for technical reasons.
