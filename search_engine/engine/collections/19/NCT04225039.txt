      Arm A (Cohort A) is a nonsurgical arm (N=16) that will serve as the primary study cohort and
      evaluated for the primary study endpoint. Subjects in this arm receive a single priming dose
      of both INCMGA00012 and INCAGN01876 prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), then undergo
      SRS (8 Gy x 3 fractions). Following SRS, INCMGA00012 (IV every 4 weeks) and INCAGN01876 (IV
      every 2 weeks) are resumed and continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      for 2 years, whichever occurs first.

      Arm B (Cohort B) is a surgical arm (N=16) that will allow for evaluation of the effects on
      the tumor immune microenvironment of INCMGA00012, INCAGN01876, and SRS. In order to be
      enrolled on this arm, subjects must have a clinical indication for surgical resection of the
      recurrent GBM tumor. Prior to planned surgical resection, subjects receive neoadjuvant
      immunotherapy (one of two possible combinations, as outlined below). Subjects then undergo
      surgery. Postoperatively, the immunotherapy combination of INCMGA00012 (IV every 4 weeks) and
      INCAGN01876 (IV every 2 weeks) is resumed and continued until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, or for 2 years, whichever occurs first. Subjects in the surgical arm
      with a focus of contrast-enhancing tumor that is amenable to SRS will be assigned to surgical
      sub-arm #1 of Cohort B (N=8). These subjects will receive neoadjuvant INCMGA00012 +
      INCAGN01876 + SRS. All other subjects enrolled on Cohort B (N=8) are treated with neoadjvuant
      INCMGA00012 + INCAGN01876 (without SRS).
