        -  Determine the feasibility of ex vivo expansion and reinfusion of autologous CD4+ T cells
           after interferon therapy or high-dose chemotherapy with CD34-selected autologous
           peripheral blood stem cell rescue in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous
           leukemia (CML).

        -  Determine the frequency of hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular remissions of CML
           following infusion of ex vivo expanded T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo mononuclear cell leukapheresis to obtain T cells for ex-vivo
      expansion, preferably before they receive interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) daily on a
      therapeutic trial.

      At least 1 month after interferon is stopped, mobilization chemotherapy is administered.
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 12 hours on day 0, etoposide IV over 2 hours on day
      1, sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 3 and 4, and filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 5.
      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected by leukapheresis when blood cell counts have
      recovered.

      Approximately 2-3 weeks later, high-dose chemotherapy begins. Patients receive gemcitabine IV
      over 100 minutes on day -5, carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2, followed 6 hours later by
      gemcitabine IV again, and melphalan IV over 20 minutes on day -1. CD34 selected PBSCs are
      infused on day 0, at least 18 hours after melphalan administration. Patients receive GM-CSF
      SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood cell counts recover.

      Patients then receive ex vivo expanded autologous T cells on day 14 after
      autotransplantation. Interferon alfa is administered three times a week starting about 3
      months after transplantation.

      Patients who only receive expanded T cells, without high-dose chemotherapy and
      autotransplantation, but show no response after 3 months, may proceed to autotransplantation
      followed by a second ex vivo expanded T-cell infusion.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 7-22 patients will be accrued for this study.
