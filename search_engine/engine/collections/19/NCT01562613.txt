      group, randomization, or blinding involved. The target subject population is hypertensive
      patients who are being treated with eprosartan under standard clinical conditions and the
      locally approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs). Treatment selection is
      independent of the study conduct according to the local requirements of the Health
      Authorities for the definition of non-interventional studies being conducted in Greece.
      Therefore, the inclusion/exclusion criteria of this study follow the clinical decision of the
      participating physician, when prescribing the study medication(s) under standard clinical
      practice. The study plans to enroll 600 patients from 100 participating centers (hospitals
      and private physicians). This number includes an additional 25% cushion compared to the
      required sample size to ensure that sufficient data is collected for the subsequent
      statistical analysis. The study has been designed to be non-interventional and subsequently
      follows the per center standard practice of treatment, medical care and visits. As a result a
      rigid visit schedule could not be imposed. However, when taking into account the overall
      local standard practice, an overview of the visit schedule is indicated per subject:

        -  A baseline visit at the beginning of the 6-month observation period where the
           investigator will check the eligibility of the subject and will record the baseline data
           provided that the subject is eligible and has given the signed and dated informed
           consent.

        -  A final visit at the end of the 6-month treatment period (also observation period), and

        -  At least one interim visit (according to the standard clinical practice, within baseline
           and final visit)
