    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of NAC or placebo
      in about 200 participants with IPF with a TOLLIP rs3750920 TT genotype.

      Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to NAC or placebo, stratified by
      stable concomitant IPF therapy use (i.e., pirfenidone or nintedanib administered for at least
      6 weeks prior to screening) versus no pirfenidone or nintedanib use. Participants will
      receive 600 mg NAC orally or matched placebo to take three times daily for 24 months.
