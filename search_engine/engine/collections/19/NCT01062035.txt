      peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) telomeres has been associated with renal and other cancers.
      The investigators' preliminary data shows an association between shorter PBL telomere length
      and ACPs.

      I. Specific Aims

        1. Develop a DNA and data repository from individuals with advanced colon polyps (ACPs) and
           controls

        2. Confirm that individuals 50 to 60 years of age with ACPs tend to have shorter peripheral
           blood lymphocyte (PBL) telomeres than those without ACPs

        3. Identify a potential optimal PBL telomere length cut-off to differentiate between
           individuals with ACPs and those without for evaluation in a larger scale study

      The over reaching long term goal is to decrease disease and death from colorectal cancer
      (CRC) using a biomarker strategy to target colonoscopy to those at higher risk.
