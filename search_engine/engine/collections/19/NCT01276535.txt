      remains over what truly initiates lesion formation. Experts agree that an increase in
      androgen production plays a significant role in the onset of acne. Androgens promote the
      increase in size of sebaceous glands and stimulate sebum production. The simple act of
      sebaceous gland stimulation via androgens could ultimately promote the upregulation of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1α)
      without propionibacteria even being present. The synthesis of IL-α and other pro-inflammatory
      cytokines including prostaglandins occurs via the inducible enzyme known as cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX-2). Studies analyzing the pathogenesis of mucositis have identified COX-2 as an
      important contributor to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus a major
      contributor to the progression of the disorder itself.

      Recent evidence indicates that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is able to significantly
      diminish the expression of COX-2, resulting in the reduction of inflammation. The ability to
      modulate the COX-2 pathways via LLLT is believed to inhibit the production of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α and IL- α) present in acne-prone skin.
