      worldwide.

      A potential benefit of vitamin C with thiamine and low-dose hydrocortisone in the treatment
      of septic shock has recently been described(PMID 27940189) . The patients with septic shock
      who received this combination of medications weaned off pressors earlier, suffered less organ
      failure, and had improved mortality. The doses of vitamin C used in this trial are high, yet
      seemed to be safe and can be considered for use.

      In this randomized controlled trial, we aim to evaluate the effect of the combination therapy
      (vitamin C,thiamine and hydrocortisone) on septic shock.
