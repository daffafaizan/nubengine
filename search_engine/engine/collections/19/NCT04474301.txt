      I. Assess experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., exposure, risk factors, testing,
      isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family or friends); COVID-19-specific
      psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms); health, financial and
      social disruptions; perceived benefits and social support; and health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) in melanoma patients who participated in protocol PA15-0336.

      II. Evaluate the extent to which COVID-19 experiences are associated with COVID-19-specific
      psychological distress, health, financial and social disruptions, perceived benefits and
      social support, and HRQoL.

      III. Evaluate the extent to which resiliency factors such as social support and perceived
      benefits moderate the effects of COVID-19 experiences on COVID-19-specific psychological
      distress and HRQoL.

      IV. Explore the association between prior lifestyle data collected as part of PA15-0336 and
      COVID-19-specific psychological distress and HRQoL.
