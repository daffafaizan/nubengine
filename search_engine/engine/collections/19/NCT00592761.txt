      (voluntary prolongation of laryngeal excursion at the midpoint of the swallow) on the
      physiology of the swallow in individuals who have suffered a stroke and exhibit signs of
      pharyngeal dysphagia (specifically, reduced duration of hyoid maximum elevation, reduced
      extent of hyoid maximum elevation, reduced duration of hyoid maximum anterior excursion,
      reduced extent of hyoid maximum anterior excursion, and reduced duration of upper esophageal
      sphincter (UES) opening with subsequent residue in the pyriform sinuses and, potentially,
      aspiration). Participants are assessed with videofluoroscopy at the initiation of the study
      and after each week of the study. After the 4 weeks of participation are complete, all
      participants will be discharged from treatment and will be brought back to the clinic for a
      final Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) evaluation after 2 weeks. This means that
      individuals in Group 1 will be re-analyzed after 1 month of additional no-treatment, and
      Group 2 will be re-analyzed after 2 additional weeks of no-treatment.
