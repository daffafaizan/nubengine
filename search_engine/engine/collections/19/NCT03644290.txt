      neural correlates and functional connectivity of patients with vascular lesions. The first
      strategy is associated to the ability to apply efficient organizational semantic category
      strategy to a list of words. This strategy will be trained in activities similar to everyday
      life activities. There will be in total 5 sessions, two for measuring the generalization
      effects before and after training and three sessions to apply the semantic strategy in order
      to improve encoding and episodic memory performance. The second strategy is related to the
      ability to remember face-names and the strategy will involve the identification of a salient
      face feature, creation of a nickname and association of the nickname to the real name. There
      will be 5 sessions in total, two for measuring the generalization effects before and after
      training and three sessions to apply the face-name association strategy in order to improve
      encoding and episodic memory performance. These two cognitive training procedures will be
      carried out in two separate moments. Before and after each procedure all participants will be
      examined by functional MRI during resting state and during a active task using a memory
      encoding paradigm. The same procedure will be carried out with normal control participants.
