      cloths, a chemical skin antiseptic agent effective on gram positive and gram negative
      bacteria, as an intervention to reduce the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs). The
      intervention group will be women undergoing non-scheduled cesarean delivery randomized to
      receive preoperative abdominal application of 2% chlorhexidine cloths. The control group will
      be women undergoing non-scheduled cesarean delivery randomized to receive standard
      preoperative care. The impact on women's health is significant, as a reduction in SSIs in
      this prevalent patient population can reduce the number of prolonged hospital stays,
      outpatient follow-ups for infection, hospital readmissions and health care costs.
