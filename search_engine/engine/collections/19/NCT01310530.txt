      for patients with early stage breast cancer. In selected patients, delivering the radiation
      treatment to only the part of the breast involved by the tumor may be a viable alternative.
      This can decrease the amount of normal tissues exposed to irradiation, potentially decrease
      side-effects and shorten the treatment time. Proton beam can decrease the volume of normal
      tissues treated compared to standard forms of radiotherapy. This study will recruit patients
      with early stage breast cancer following surgical removal to undergo partial breast
      radiotherapy with proton beam and determine the recurrence rates and side-effects of
      treatment.
