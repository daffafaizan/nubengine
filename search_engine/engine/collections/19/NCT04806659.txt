    
      SH1573 is an IDH2 mutation inhibitor.

      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of SH1573 capsules in treatment of subjects
      with advanced relapsed, refractory acute myeloid leukemias (AML) that harbor an IDH2
      mutation.

      The study consists of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part (Phase Ia) and a dose-expansion part
      (Phase Ib). The dose-escalation part will determine the MTD/R2PD. The dose-expansion part
      will administer the MTD/RP2D to subjects with mIDH2-positive AML.
