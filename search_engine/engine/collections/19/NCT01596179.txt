      the success of treatment is getting the right dose at the right time, but many women do not
      receive optimum treatment. Treatment delays, missed appointments, and failure to take
      medication on a regular basis lead to poorer survival from breast cancer. In a study among
      low income women only 60% of women adhered to the treatment, that is, taking their medication
      at least 80% of the time. Twenty percent of women, who were supposed to take 5 years of
      hormone treatment, had stopped their medication in the first year. Similar problems occur
      with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Many barriers interfere with adherence to treatment,
      including poor symptom management, missed appointments, and cancelled appointments. Nurse
      navigation can help manage and minimize symptoms, assist with appointment reminders, and
      answer questions to obtain optimum breast cancer treatment. The goal of the proposed study is
      to rigorously test the delivery of nurse-navigation through a web-based knowledge and
      communication portal (Technology Enhanced Nurse-directed Navigation (TENN) for its impact on
      treatment adherence and symptom management. The success of this program will be measured by
      improved treatment adherence, health outcome measures such as fatigue and symptom management,
      patient-reported quality of life, reduced distress, and patient satisfaction.
