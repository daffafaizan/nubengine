      alcoholics. It has been estimated that 15%-30% of heavy drinkers develop advanced Alcoholic
      liver disease (ALD). The prevalence of ALD in the United States is conservatively estimated
      at 2 million persons. Nearly 50% of liver-related deaths and 30% of hepatocellular carcinomas
      in the US are due to alcoholic cirrhosis. Despite recent advances in our understanding of
      ALD, there is currently no FDA approved medication for any stage of ALD. Zinc sulfate is
      inexpensive, available over the counter, and has an excellent safety profile. If zinc
      positively influences the mechanisms postulated to play a role in human ALD, this affordable
      treatment would become relevant to millions of people worldwide.
