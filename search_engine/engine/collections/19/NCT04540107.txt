      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of hyperpolarized 13C MR metabolic imaging as a new
      and unique tool for making an early assessment of progression and evaluation of response to
      therapy in patients with lower grade glioma II. To determine whether changes in levels of
      hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate, lactate and bicarbonate may provide early evidence of tumor
      progression in patients with lower grade glioma who are being followed with surveillance
      scans.

      III. To determine whether patients with lower grade glioma who are receiving treatment
      exhibit a reduction in levels of hyperpolarized 13C lactate/pyruvate at follow-up compared to
      their baseline scan.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo MR imaging (MRI) and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) scans over 1
      hour at baseline. Patients then continue to undergo MRSI scans that follow the clinical MRI
      schedule set by doctors to monitor patients' care.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo MRI scan at baseline. Patients then receive hyperpolarized carbon
      C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) over less than 1 minute and undergo MRSI scan at baseline.
      Patients then continue to undergo MRSI scans that follow the clinical MRI schedule set by
      doctors to monitor patients' care.
