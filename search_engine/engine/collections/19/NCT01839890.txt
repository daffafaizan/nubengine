    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open study

      After the permeabilization of the clinical event responsible artery and the insertion of a
      bare metal stent, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following
      treatment groups:

      Group 1: post-dilatation with a paclitaxel eluting balloon (Pantera Lux Â®) Group 2: no
      post-dilatation Patients (or their legal representative) must sign the consent before
      randomization.

      After surgery, patients will be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus
      clopidogrel) for at least one month to group 2 patients; and at least 3 months in those who
      are also treated with the paclitaxel eluting balloon (group 1). Aspirin is prescribed
      indefinitely according to the usual practice in these patients.

      Patients will be monitored 30 days after surgery, at 6 and 12 months, and the ninth month (in
      which patient will receive an angiographic control).

      The primary efficacy endpoint is late lumen loss (PLT) comparing it value during surgery and
      control angiography at 9 months

      This study will involve patients over 18 years olds with systolic time elevation myocardial
      infarction, or new left bundle branch block or posterior AMI (ECG) that occur within 12 hours
      of onset of symptoms to treatment by primary angioplasty.

      They include a total of 220 patients.
