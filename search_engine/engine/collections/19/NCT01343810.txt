      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) classes at Duke Integrative Medicine in Durham,
      North Carolina. The central hypothesis of this NIH-funded clinical trial (R00 AT004945, PI:
      Greeson) is that mindfulness meditation training is associated with increased levels of
      mindfulness and improved cognitive-emotional functioning that, together, are associated with
      reduced psychological distress, improved sleep quality, and less exaggerated physiological
      responses to emotional stress, including blood pressure and inflammation. This study is
      designed to examine psychological and biological mechanisms that may explain individual
      differences in MBSR outcomes. This knowledge is important because it will help us better
      understand who is most likely to benefit from mindfulness meditation training, and why. The
      results from this study are expected to elucidate mechanisms underlying the mental and
      physical health benefits of stress reduction, which can help guide clinicians in referring
      the most suitable patients to local MBSR programs.
