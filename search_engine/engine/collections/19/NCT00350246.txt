      light scatter, density of keratocytes and subbasal nerves, corneal sensitivity, corneal
      topography and wavefront between PRK performed with epithelial removal by a laser or by a
      rotary brush and between LASIK performed by using a microkeratome or by using a femtosecond
      laser. Measurements will be made at baseline and at intervals over 5 postoperative years in
      21 LASIK patients, 20 PRK patients, and 20 unoperated controls.
