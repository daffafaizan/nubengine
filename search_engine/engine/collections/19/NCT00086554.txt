      diseases known collectively as the inflammatory bowel diseases require access to clinical
      samples of intestinal tissue as well as blood samples for genotyping. This protocol provides
      a mechanism for procurement of intestinal samples obtained at the time of medically-indicated
      surgical procedures from patients with IBD or some other non-IBD diagnosis (to act as a
      control group). In addition it allows for the procurement of blood for DNA preparation as
      more IBD susceptibility genes are discovered and we further our work on association of
      genetic polymorphisms/mutations with the phenotype and immune abnormalities observed in our
      IBD patients.
