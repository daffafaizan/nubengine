      thus reducing operator induced errors. It also measures the thickness of the entire optic
      nerve head so as to allow for another anatomic area of the eye to be measured for assessment
      of glaucoma. In addition, it permits collection of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness data
      in three concentric circles instead of just one in order to account for different sizes of
      optic nerves.

      Subjects who are receiving routine SDOCT (CPT 92133) will be recruited from the Duke Eye
      Center and its associated satellite clinics. Following informed consent, subjects undergo
      additional imaging using the SDOCT-GMPE software at the Duke Eye Center and its associated
      satellite clinics. The imaging results may be used in clinical care for the subjects.
