      diabetes mellitus,which of the initial manifestation of PDR is retinal neovascularization at
      the disc or elsewhere.Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) has been the standard treatment for
      PDR since the Diabetic Retinopathy Study demonstrated its benefit nearly 40 years ago,but PRP
      has inevitable adverse effects on visual function including peripheral visual field defects,
      night vision loss, loss of contrast sensitivity.Recent evidences have indicated that
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) treatment can reduce the severity and delay the
      progression of DR.However,the impact of this treatment on visual function and the effect of
      anti-VEGF agents on retinal neovascularization compared with PRP remain unclear. It is
      possible that a long-acting anti-VEGF agent such as conbercept. So we design the study with
      is a prospective randomized controlled trial about Intravitreal injection of conbercept
      versus PRP on PDR.Primary outcome is the change in BCVA from screening to 12 months in the
      study eye measured in the ETDRS letter score at 4 m
