        -  Invasion and metastasis are the main reason of death in metastatic cancer, and abundant
           evidence find circulating tumor cells(CTCs) take the core position in breast and
           colorectal cancer metastasis.

        -  Platelets play multiple role to facilitate the epithelial to mesenchymal transition of
           tumor cells and protect CTCs to survival in the circulation, which enrolled in the whole
           process of metastasis.

        -  Several clinical trials and observational study have validate the primary and secondary
           prevention effect of aspirin to both breast and colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effect of aspirin on CTC number of metastatic breast and colorectal
           cancer;

        -  Determine the effect of aspirin on CTC subtype (epithelial/mesenchymal/mixed type) of
           metastatic breast and colorectal cancer.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Adults age from 18-75 years old.

        -  Patients were diagnosed for metastatic breast or colorectal cancer by pathology.

        -  Patients who were not currently receiving intravenous chemotherapy , oral administrated
           with capecitabine was permitted. Concurrent endocrine therapy ( for at least 2 months
           before enrollment), bisphosphonate therapy, and/or monoclonal targeted therapy were
           permitted.

        -  No disease of hemorrhagic tendency or history of non-steroid drug allergy.

        -  CTCsâ‰¥5 / 7.5ml blood

      STUDY DESIGN:

        -  Aspirin will be administered orally once a day in 28-day cycles.

        -  The CTC was evaluated every 28 days for 2 months.
