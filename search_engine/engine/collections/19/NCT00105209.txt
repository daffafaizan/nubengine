      daily and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily. Platelet function is assessed with plasma P-selectin
      levels and aggregometry after exposure to adenosine diphosphate, arachidonic acid, and
      collagen. We will assess serum levels of thromboxane B2 and urinary metabolites of
      thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2 (Tx-M and PGI-M, respectively).
