    
      This clinical trial was performed as a multicentre, add-on, double-blind, randomised,
      placebo-controlled, phase II study. During the double-blind treatment phase (12 weeks)
      patients were assigned to three treatment groups receiving BIA 2 093 once daily (ODG -
      once-daily group), BIA 2 093 twice daily (TDG - twice-daily group) or placebo (PLG - placebo
      group), respectively. Daily doses of BIA 2 093 were increased at four-weekly periods (400 mg,
      800 mg and 1200 mg).

      On completion of the 12-week double-blind treatment period, a 1-week tapering period was
      scheduled.
