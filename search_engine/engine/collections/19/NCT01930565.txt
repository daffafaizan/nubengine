      steadily required considering various side effects of acne medications.However, previous
      studies have mainly focused on experimental tests without clinical trials and
      histopathological analysis.

      To compare the clinical efficacy, safety and histopathological changes between Lactobacillus
      fermented Chamaecypris obtusa (LFCO) and existing tea tree oil (TTO)

      Total thirty four patients were instructed to apply 5 % LFCO to the involved areas of
      randomly allocated side and 5 % TTO extract to the other side for 8 weeks in a double blind
      split-face clinical trial.
