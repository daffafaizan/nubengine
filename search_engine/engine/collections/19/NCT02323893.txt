      healthy human volunteers who provide informed consent. Following injection of this tracer
      each volunteer will have four whole-body PET scans inside a PET scanner to obtain images of
      tracer biodistribution at four different time points. This will allow studying the kinetics
      of the tracer as well analysis of tracer dosimetry. Safety of the tracer will also be
      analyzed in each volunteer.
