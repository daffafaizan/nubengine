        -  Determine the efficacy of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and paclitaxel in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic urothelial cancer (nontransitional cell histologies).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1
      and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously
      daily beginning on day 6 and continuing through day 17 or until blood counts recover.
      Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of stable or
      progressive disease after completion of course 2 or complete response after completion of
      course 4.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
