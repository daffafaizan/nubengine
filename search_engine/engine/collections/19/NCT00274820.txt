    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy (in terms of response rate) of arsenic trioxide, ascorbic acid,
           dexamethasone, and thalidomide in patients with chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis or
           myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorders.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of disease progression or progression to acute leukemia in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess improvement in bone marrow pathology (including degree of fibrosis, percentage of
           blasts, and resolution of cytogenetic abnormalities) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine time to response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the reduction of spleen size in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Measure clinical responses and quality of life in subgroups treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours for 5 days and oral ascorbic acid once
      daily for 5 days during week 1. Patients then receive arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid
      twice a week in weeks 2-12. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone once daily for 5 days in
      weeks 1, 5, 9, and 12 and oral thalidomide once or twice daily in weeks 1-12. Courses repeat
      every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after every course.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
