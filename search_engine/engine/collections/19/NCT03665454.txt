      crossover safety, tolerability, and efficacy study of the investigational compound,
      PF-06412562, in advanced Parkinson's patients. The primary purpose of this study is to test
      the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug PF-06412562 compared to the current
      medical standard of care medication for Parkinson's disease, carbidopa/levodopa, in these
      patients. This secondary purpose of this research is to find out if the investigational drug
      PF-06412562 can help improve the motor (movement) function, alertness, and cognitive
      (thinking) skills of people who are considered to be in the advanced-stage of Parkinson's
      disease. This study will inform the field as to whether PF-06412562 is safe and
      well-tolerated in advanced Parkinson's patients, and also may provide preliminary data on its
      efficacy in several domains.
