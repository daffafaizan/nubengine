      Primary

        -  To determine patient acceptability, feasibility, and side-effect profile by evaluating
           records of adverse events.

        -  To determine patient acceptability, feasibility, and side-effect profile by evaluating
           urinary symptoms and erectile function before study stage 1 (verification), before study
           stage 2 (treatment), and at each follow-up visit.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy by post-treatment transrectal
           ultrasound-guided biopsies at 6 months and if there is evidence of biochemical failure.

        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy by post-treatment MRI to evaluate area of
           necrosis and presence of any residual tissue.

        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy by measurement of prostate-specific antigen
           (PSA) at each follow-up visit and measurement of time to PSA nadir.

        -  To determine the effectiveness of therapy by recording the need for secondary or
           adjuvant treatment following therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo hemiablation using high-intensity focused ultrasound to the side of
      the prostate with cancer and up to 5 mm over into the contralateral side to ensure adequacy.

      Patients complete questionnaires periodically during study to assess urinary symptoms and
      erectile dysfunction. These include the International Index of Erectile Function-15
      [IIEF-15]; the International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] and IPSS-QoL; the Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P); and the Continence Questionnaire.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2-7 days, 7-14 days, and at 1,
      3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
