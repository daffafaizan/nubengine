      recurrent DLBCL or FL and their providers at three medical oncology practices. Utilizing the
      PPSDM tool in the Carevive electronic platform, patients will report their needs,
      preferences, values and goal prior to the treatment decision-making focused clinical
      encounter. The treating provider will receive the patient results prior to the visit and can
      use these to facilitate SDM in treatment selection during the clinical encounter.
      Post-encounter, patients and providers will complete measures designed to assess feasibility
      and utility of SDM intervention. Patients will also complete measures to assess patient
      satisfaction with the treatment decision, patient activation, and patient perceived
      achievement of desired role in shared decision making and satisfaction with care.
