    
      Primary Aim To assess the relationship between baseline clinical, physiologic, biologic and
      imaging markers and response to bronchial thermoplasty, defined by improvement in asthma
      quality of life, in patients with severe refractory asthma.

      Secondary Aims

        1. To assess the relationship between baseline clinical, physiologic, biologic and imaging
           markers and response to bronchial thermoplasty, defined by reduction in severe
           exacerbations or healthcare utilization, in patients with severe refractory asthma.

        2. To evaluate if baseline clinical, physiologic, biologic and imaging markers are related
           to safety of bronchial thermoplasty in patients with severe refractory asthma.

        3. To evaluate and validate statistical models that predict response to bronchial
           thermoplasty in patients with severe refractory asthma.
