      Visit #1 (2-3 hours), includes: (a) detailed description of study and study consent, (b)
      interviews about the child's mental health, mood, and behavior, and (c) a screening IQ test
      (word games, playing with blocks).

      If a child fits our study criteria, they will play some special computer games, provide a
      spit sample for DNA, and parents/children will complete questionnaires.

      All children fitting our study criteria, will also be invited to complete visit #2 (2 hours)
      consisting of a special MRI brain scan at Brown University (Providence, RI). To make sure all
      children feel comfortable in the MRI, they will spend time in our practice MRI (i.e., "MRI
      simulator") that looks and sounds just like the real MRI. During the actual MRI, children
      will play a computerized game in which they can win and lose points. The MRI lasts one and a
      half hours (at most).

      Participants are compensated for their time.
