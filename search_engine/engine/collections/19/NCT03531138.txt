      period in the field tests used in determining the exercise capacity of these patients is
      extremely difficult. The exercise capacity, which is considered as an important criterion in
      the decision of the lung transplant decision and in the determination of the clinical profile
      of the patient, necessitates the development of different test methods which are more
      suitable for the application of the measurement in this patient population.

      In this study lung transplantation candidates will be performed a 3-month hospital-based
      preoperative exercise training. A 6-minute walk test, a 10-meter walking speed test and a
      5-times sit to stand test will be performed to determine the exercise capacity of the
      patient. The tests will be carried out at the beginning and end of rehabilitation. At each
      testing session, the tests will be performed sequentially by the same physiotherapist, giving
      20 minute rest periods within the same day. It will be analyzed how the test data correlate
      with each other and how the delta values calculated for each test reflect the rehabilitation
      outcomes calculated after the exercise program.
