    
      Objective:To determine differences in metabolic profiles and Intestinal microbial abundance
      among healthy human individuals and patients in a vegetative state (VS) and minimally
      conscious state (MCS) and to identify metabolites in human plasma that can accurately
      distinguish VS patients from MCS patients.

      Method: Plasma samples and fecal sample were obtained from patients with chronic disorder of
      consciousness, and healthy volunteers. A comprehensive metabolic profile was obtained with
      targeted metabolomics analysis and untargeted and targeted lipidomics analysis, as well as
      intestinal microbial abundance from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.
