      Effective pain control after surgery is an important component in the overall management of
      these patients. Good pain control encourages early participation in rehabilitation program,
      increases success of the surgery, and improves patient satisfaction. Typically, postoperative
      analgesia is provided to these patients either with nerve blocks or opioid medications. Both
      these methods provide good pain relief but nerve blocks are associated with weakness of lower
      extremity muscles which interferes with early ambulation and increase the risk of falls while
      narcotic medications increase the risk of nausea, vomiting, itching, constipation, ileus,
      urinary retention, sedation and respiratory depression.
