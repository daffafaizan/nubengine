      sub-bandage pressure at the ankle was shown in several studies to be safe and effective.The
      efficacy of compression bandage considerably depends on the applied pressure and it is
      therefore largely dependent on the individual applying bandages. The lower pressure leads to
      treatment failure while the higher pressure leads to skin complication.

      The use of objective devices to proof that the bandage is sufficiently applied is not
      available for every patients. To help the patients to apply the bandage with optimal
      pressure, investigators developed the customized pressure guide elastic bandage (CPG-EB) by
      using sub-bandage pressure guidance.

      Objective of this study are to compare the interface pressure by applying ordinary elastic
      bandage (OEB) and CPG-EB. In addition,investigators compared the percentage of inexperienced
      staffs who could apply the optimal pressure with OEB and CPG-EB.
