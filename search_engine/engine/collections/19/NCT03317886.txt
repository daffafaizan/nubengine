      artery (SMA) and finally performs Kocher's maneuver during PD. The aims of this approach are
      1) decrease of intraoperative blood loss volume, 2) increase of R0 rate, and 3) prevention of
      squeezing cancer cells out into the vessels. However, there have been no evidence of the
      efficacy of this procedure. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      mesenteric approach during PD for PDAC, by multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing
      oncological and surgical outcomes between mesenteric approach and conventional approach
      during PD for PDAC.
