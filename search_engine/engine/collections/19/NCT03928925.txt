    
      The BOUGIE trial is a prospective, parallel group, pragmatic, randomized trial comparing the
      effect of bougie use versus endotracheal tube with stylet use on the incidence of successful
      intubation on the first attempt among adults undergoing urgent or emergent tracheal
      intubation.

      Patients admitted to the study units who are deemed by their clinical team to require
      intubation and fulfill inclusion criteria without meeting exclusion criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 to use of a bougie or use of an endotracheal tube and stylet on the first
      attempt at intubation. All other decisions regarding airway management, including the choice
      to use a bougie or endotracheal tube and stylet on subsequent attempts, will remain at the
      discretion of the treating provider.

      The trial will enroll 1,106 patients. Conduct of the trial will be overseen by a Data Safety
      Monitoring Board. An interim analysis will be performed after the enrollment of 553 patients.
      The analysis of the trial will be conducted in accordance with a pre-specified statistical
      analysis plan, which will be submitted for publication or made publicly available prior to
      the conclusion of enrollment.

      The primary outcome is successful intubation on the first attempt

      The secondary outcome is severe hypoxemia (lowest arterial oxygen saturation between
      induction and two minutes following intubation of less than 80%)
