      long-term efficacy of the combination of antiretroviral therapies and interleukin-2 (IL-2), a
      cytokine with immunomodulatory properties. Currently 73 patients have been approved to
      receive IL-2 at a starting dose of 18 MIU/d for 5 days. Multiple courses of IL-2 will be
      administered, at approximately 2 month intervals. Clinical, laboratory, immunologic, and
      viral parameters will be closely monitored during this time for evidence of toxicity and
      preliminary evidence of efficacy.
