    
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of nasal glucagon (NG) administered
      under clinical use conditions in treating episodes of hypoglycemia in persons with T1D.

      This study also aims to assess the ease with which caregivers can administer the experimental
      medication in treatment of hypoglycemic events.

      The study will also generate data on the participants' assessment of local tolerability and
      provide information on immunogenicity of nasal glucagon with regards to the potential
      development of anti-glucagon antibodies.
