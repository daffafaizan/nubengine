      addition the developmental aspect of this study, certain information may be used to obtain
      normal values for healthy adult structural and functional information. This information would
      be valuable if and when the developed methods are incorporated into future clinical studies
      involving patient populations which would be recruited under separate protocols. Our
      hypotheses is that imaging and spectroscopy methods can be developed to a level where the
      increased sensitivity and resolution of 7 Tesla (7T) MRI will improve the non-invasive
      studies of the human body.
