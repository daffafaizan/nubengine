    
      Phase A: A global, prospective, multicenter, 2:1 randomized trial evaluating the safety and
      effectiveness of the DES BTK Vascular Stent System compared to standard percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty to treat infrapopliteal artery lesions in subjects with critical
      limb ischemia(CLI). Phase A RCT will begin with one size of the device: 3.5 mm x 80 mm.

      Phase B: A global, prospective, multicenter, non-randomized trial collecting additional
      safety and effectiveness data for the DES BTK Vascular Stent System to treat infrapopliteal
      artery lesions in subjects with CLI. Additional stent sizes will be added to the trial upon
      regulatory approval.

      Approximately 201 subjects will be randomized/enrolled to support a 2:1 randomization in the
      phase A RCT. Assuming the effectiveness endpoint is met in phase A RCT, approximately 100
      additional subjects are expected to be enrolled in phase B non-randomized which is structured
      as a single arm where the enrolled subjects are treated with the DES BTK Vascular Stent
      System.
