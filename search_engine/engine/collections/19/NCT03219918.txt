      adenomas, which are precursors of most colorectal cancers. It has been shown that there is a
      direct correlation between adenoma detection rate and the risk of developing colorectal
      cancer subsequently. However, patients undergoing colonoscopy are still at risk of developing
      colorectal cancer, mainly because precursor lesions are missed during the procedure. This may
      be due to insufficient bowel preparation, difficulties in visualising flat lesions or the
      location of lesions behind haustral folds.

      Improving the ADR can be achieved by different means; better training of endoscopists,
      improved bowel preparation, optimal sedation and medico technical developments. The technical
      improvements have mainly been in the optimising of image and improved scope thickness and
      flexibility, including devices that improve visualisation by increasing the exposed colonic
      surface . One of these new inventions is the EndoRings II Distal Attachment.

      According to the Danish Colorectal Cancer Screening Database, the ADR of standard screening
      colonoscopy is between 34 and 67 % with a national average of 49 % of patients with detected
      adenomas. Due to the known adenoma miss rate in standard screening colonoscopies, it is
      important to increase the ADR on average as well as finding ways to improve ADR for centres
      with a lower than average ADR.
