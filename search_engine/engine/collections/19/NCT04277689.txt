      resistant motor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD) and provides the only opportunity
      to record and stimulate in the human basal ganglia. Most recently, the concurrent use of
      research electrocorticography (ECoG) during DBS surgery, including pioneering work from
      Pittsburgh, has further enabled basic neuroscience investigation of human
      cortical-subcortical network dynamics. The discovery that aberrant synchronization of
      rhythmic neuronal activity recorded in PD patients is suppressed by DBS has advanced the
      concept that measures associated with pathological activity may be used as biomarkers to
      control the delivery of DBS therapy. Pilot studies of aDBS in PD have reported promising
      clinical results from triggering DBS stimulation when the signal recorded from the DBS
      electrode showed a high level of oscillatory power in the beta frequency range (13 - 35 Hz).
      That approach, however, has important limitations. Most importantly, beta power recorded from
      the DBS lead is suppressed by movement including PD tremor, its detection is highly dependent
      on lead location and the recording montage needed to record during stimulation is
      incompatible with directional current steering, a recent innovation employing segmented
      stimulation contacts. The inherent complexity of the increased parameter space through DBS
      innovations also overwhelms standard programming techniques. Finally, use of additional
      biomarker signals (e.g., recorded from cortex) is likely to improve the ability to adaptively
      control DBS for disorders marked by complex multidimensional symptomatologies such as PD. The
      current proposal will establish methods for overcoming these limitations by developing
      techniques for multi-feature classification from ECoG recordings, using advanced machine
      learning algorithms.
