      chest pain and paresthesia, we choose the prospective, randomized, open label, blinded end
      point design for this study. According to this design, both patients and physicians making
      first assessment are aware of the treatment but the investigators making second and third
      assessment are blinded to treatment. Therefore, two separate cardiovascular surgeons wil
      select and randomize the patients and a cardiologist blinded to treatment assignments will
      evaluate the patients at second interview at thirty day and 3 months later. The study was
      approved by the Local Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from each patient.
      The study was conducted in Usak State Hospital with collaboration the Department of
      Cardiology of Ataturk Education and Training Hospital.
