    
      Qualifying participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups: 1) Early
      progressive feeding without MEF or 2) Progressive feedings preceded by 4 days of MEF.
      Regardless of study group assignment, donor human milk will be offered if not enough of the
      mother's expressed breastmilk during the intervention phase of the trial.

      Intervention group: Progressive feeding of 20-24 ml/kg/d on day 1 of feeding, followed by
      daily increments of 24-25 ml/kg/d as tolerated until full enteral feeding achieved.

      Control group: MEF with feeding volumes of 20-24 ml/kg/d for 4 days followed by progressive
      feeding (daily increments of 24-25 ml/kg/d) as tolerated until full enteral feeding achieved.

      Both groups will receive fast progressive feeding (>/= 24 ml/kg/day)

      If parent agrees, stool "dirty" diapers will be collected 5 times (at birth, 1, 2, 3 and 4
      weeks of life).
