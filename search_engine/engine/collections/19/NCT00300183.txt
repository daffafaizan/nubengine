      of CitiWide Harm Reduction are followed for 18 months to assess HIV-related health outcomes.
      Data elements include (1) face-to-face interviews focusing on housing, HIV disease severity,
      utilization of health care services, utilization of non-medical services, substance use,
      mental health, and quality of life; (2) medical chart information focusing on CD4 count,
      viral load, and HIV primary care visits; and (3) outreach services. The study hypothesis is
      that involvement with CitiWide Harm Reduction will improve HIV-related health care
      utilization and outcomes.
