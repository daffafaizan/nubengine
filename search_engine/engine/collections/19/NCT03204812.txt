      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab plus tremelimumab in patients with
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of durvalumab plus tremelimumab in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. II. To explore immunological changes in peripheral
      blood and tissue (e.g. peripheral blood cluster of differentiation [CD] 4+ [Inducible
      COStimulator (ICOS)]+ T cells, CD3 expression in tissue) in response to durvalumab plus
      tremelimumab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and durvalumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 cycles for tremelimumab and up
      to 13 cycles for durvalumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days, and
      then every 3 months thereafter.
