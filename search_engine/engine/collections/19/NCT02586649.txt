      cervical SCI (tetraplegia) is associated with obstructive airway physiology similar to that
      associated with asthma. The investigators hypothesize that these aspects of obstructive
      physiology stem from unopposed increases in cholinergic airway tone as a result of autonomic
      imbalance; where vagal innervation (cholinergic neurotransmission) to the lungs is intact,
      and the bronchodilating adrenergic influences of sympathetic pathways are interrupted. The
      investigators demonstrated using spirometric criteria, significant bronchodilator responses
      in approximately 50% of subjects with tetraplegia following inhalation of short acting beta-2
      agonists (albuterol sulfate) and anticholinergic agents (ipratropium bromide). When specific
      airway conductance (sGaw), a more sensitive indicator of bronchodilation, was assessed via
      whole body plethysmography, significant bronchodilation and restoration of normal airway
      caliber was noted in all subjects.

      Intuitively, one might expect that through bronchodilation susceptible individuals with
      tetraplegia who already have compromised respiratory muscle strength and weakened cough might
      benefit from better airway clearance, and via increases in lung volumes improve the
      length-tension relationship of residual expiratory muscles for initiation of more forceful
      coughs. Based upon a comparative study of the bronchodilator effects of ipratropium bromide
      versus albuterol in persons with tetraplegia (in publication), it appears that ipratropium
      bromide elicited greater bronchodilation, perhaps because of the specificity of action in
      blocking acetylcholine binding to the muscarinic-3 (M3) airway smooth muscle receptor. The
      investigators purpose in this preliminary study is to assess whether salutary effects upon
      pulmonary function, cough strength, and airway inflammation are observed across a twenty-four
      hour period following inhalation of a single dose of tiotropium bromide 18 mcg inhalational
      capsule versus placebo utilizing a double-blind crossover design in persons with chronic
      stable tetraplegia.
