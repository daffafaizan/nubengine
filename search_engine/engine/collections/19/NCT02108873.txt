      medical practice, representing a significant cost to the health care system, and resulting in
      disruption of daily work planning.Nonattendance at medical appointments has consequences not
      only for doctors (as it requires a greater use of resources and time), but also for patients,
      because there may be deterioration in the quality of care, and dissatisfaction associated
      with delays in obtaining a new appointment.

      Previous studies have reported that nonattendance at scheduled appointments is most
      frequently associated with those patients attending follow-up appointments, generally those
      assigned to another professional, those with appointments on Fridays, and those with
      appointments assigned 1 - 2 weeks in advance. Nonattendance was also associated with younger
      patient age, greater psychological problems, and lower socioeconomic status.Furthermore, in
      patients with chronic diseases, the nonattendance rate was also reported to be lower.
      Clinical patient characteristics can be important predictors of nonattendance, but they
      required high quality electronic health records to predict nonattendance accurately In the
      United States and Europe, the nonattendance rate is estimated to be between 6.5%-55%; there
      is little evidence regarding nonattendance in Latin America. Many studies have described the
      prevalence and impact of nonattendance at scheduled medical appointments, and possible
      strategies to decrease the nonattendance rate. However, few studies have utilized the
      characteristics associated with nonattendance for building predictive models, which might
      better identify those patients who may not attend a scheduled appointment
