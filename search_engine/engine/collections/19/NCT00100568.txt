      in Senegal. Data on mutations that confer resistance to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are
      limited to HIV subtype B; adherence data are also limited. The study will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of an ARV regimen given to treatment-naive HIV infected adults and adolescents.
      The study will also examine the characteristics of virologic failure and adherence in this
      treatment group. Participants will be recruited at two sites in Dakar, Senegal.

      This study will last 96 weeks. At study entry, all participants will be given an ARV regimen
      of lamivudine/zidovudine twice daily and efavirenz once daily. If toxicity or treatment
      failure occurs, some participants may require changes in their ARV regimens. There will be 14
      study visits during the study; a physical exam, blood collection, and sociodemographic and
      medication history assessments will occur at each visit. Participants will also be asked to
      complete quality-of-life and adherence questionnaires. An off-study visit will occur at
      approximately one month after Week 96, with assessments and procedures similar to visits
      during the study.
