      TV at their routine gynecological exam at participating clinics will be referred to the
      nurse/study coordinator to screen for eligibility, provide a description of the study, and
      obtain written, informed consent (N=700). Subjects will undergo an audio computer assisted
      self- interview (ACASI), and will self-collect vaginal swabs for Trichomonas testing by
      InPouch and Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT), Gram stain testing, and a future
      microbiome specimen. They will be randomized into one of two arms; metronidazole (MTZ) 2 g
      single dose (CDC recommended treatment regimen) or MTZ 500 mg twice daily x 7-day dose (CDC
      alternative treatment regimen). All enrolled women will be scheduled for a follow-up visit at
      four weeks post treatment completion (window 3-13 weeks).
