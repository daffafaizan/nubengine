      research suggests that such "multiplex" families might hold the key to the discovery of new
      PD genes.

      To take part in PaGeR, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire and to undergo
      an interview, a neurological exam, a short memory test, and a blood draw. Enrollment in the
      study usually takes between one and two hours. There is no cost to participate, and all study
      information is kept strictly confidential.

      There are a number of designated sites across the country where families can enroll. However,
      for family members who are unable to travel to one of these sites, other arrangements can be
      made.
