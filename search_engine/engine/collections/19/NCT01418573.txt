        -  blood glucose

        -  plasma insulin

        -  satiety scores

        -  plasma gut hormones It is hypothesised that lower post prandial blood glucose
           concentration, a lower insulin response and increased satiety will be seen after the
           Palaeolithic meals compared with a reference meal
