      effect on the quality of life. Normal bowel habits vary considerably from person to person
      with regard to frequency of bowel movements, and bulk and consistency of stools. Constipation
      is the common digestive complaint in European populations, and softening stool consistency
      can be regarded as beneficial for such population in terms of reducing incidence of hard or
      lumpy stools .

      The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BS) is validated as a surrogate measure for gastrointestinal
      transit time, and has been also applied to an evaluation of stool consistency. Subjects
      compare their stool with the BS chart consisting of seven categories and choose one score
      which has a nearest analog form. The BS has been widely used in the studies to evaluate
      changes in stool consistency after dietary intervention using probiotics and/or prebiotics.
      However, there is a lack of evidence in the validity of BS to yield consistent and
      reproducible estimates of changes in stool consistency over time. In order to obtain a closer
      estimate of its change, it would be preferred to use a more directly observable and objective
      parameter or combination of parameters.

      From the above mentioned backgrounds, this study is conducted to validate a new direct method
      for the measurement of stool consistency, using Texture Analyser: TA.XTExpress Texture
      Analyser (Stable Micro Systems Ltd.).
