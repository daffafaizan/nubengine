      I. To determine the efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride controlled-release (bupropion) versus
      placebo in reducing fatigue in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical
      trial of breast cancer survivors with fatigue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo on depression and quality of life in
      breast cancer survivors with fatigue.

      II. To assess the tolerability of bupropion in breast cancer survivors with fatigue.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo on symptomatology and cognition in
      breast cancer survivors with fatigue.

      II. To explore the effects of bupropion on putative mechanisms of cancer-related fatigue.

      III. To explore associations of CYP2B6 genotype with bupropion metabolism and changes in
      fatigue.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bupropion hydrochloride controlled-release orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) for up to 13 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for up to 13 weeks in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.
