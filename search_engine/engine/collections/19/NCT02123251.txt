      known that certain populations are at greater risk for diabetes. In Hawaii, diabetes
      disproportionally affects Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders as they are three times more
      likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. In addition, in 2010 the U.S. Department of Health and
      Human Services Office of Minority Health reported that Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders in
      Hawaii were 5.7 times as likely as Caucasians living in Hawaii to die from diabetes(Office of
      Minority Health, 2010).

      In order to address the challenges that chronic diseases impose on individuals and the health
      care system the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is assessing the impact of
      incentivizing patients to increase self-care and disease management. Previous studies have
      demonstrated that monetary incentives have been associated with an improvement in behavioral
      outcomes, most notably when the incentive is received immediately following the targeted
      behavior (Volpp, K.G., et.al., 2008; Mitchell, M.S., et.al., 2013). Cahill et al. (2008)
      showed that economic incentives were tied to smoking cessation and led to a decrease in
      relapse within a year. Our study seeks to build on these findings and determine whether
      financial incentives may provide a way to improve diabetes self-management.
