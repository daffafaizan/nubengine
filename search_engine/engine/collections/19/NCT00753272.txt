      After the analyses for this study were completed, questions arose regarding the integrity of
      study data from a single study site in Romania, which enrolled 102 subjects in the trial.
      Because evaluation of data from this site did not reveal irregularities when compared with
      overall study data and because GSK has no current plans to use the data from the study in
      support of any regulatory filings, they were not excluded from the analyses reflected in this
      results summary.
