      identified in human patient samples with corresponding tumors, before molecular markers can
      be validated in animal models. Just because these soft tissue and bone tumors are rare
      (compared to breast and lung carcinomas), it is of great importance that samples from all
      patients treated at Balgrist University Hospital are collected systematically und stored
      correspondingly. Only like this valid statements can be done. Therefore the investigators
      intent to collect tissue and blood samples from all patients who agree in participating in
      the study. The samples will be taken during routine biopsies and operations. To compare tumor
      tissue and healthy tissue it is also planed to take samples from tumor free patients who
      undergo a knee replacement surgery. The investigators would store the surgical waste and
      involve these samples in the analyzes.

      Clinical data regarding diagnosis and examination findings, as well as tissue from biopsies
      and surgeries will be collected prospectively. The tissue will be frozen in liquid nitrogen
      according to standard procedures and stored until the molecular analyzes at the Laboratory of
      Orthopedic Research at Balgrist University Hospital. The processing involves expression
      analyzes such as polymerase chain reaction, Western Blot, micro arrays, immunohistochemistry
      and tissue array. The DNA from the taken blood samples shall be compared with the DNA found
      in the tumor.
