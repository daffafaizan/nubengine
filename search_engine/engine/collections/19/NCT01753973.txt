      hemodynamic disorders such as hypertension (HBP ) , abdominal obesity , dyslipidemia,
      abnormal glucose metabolism and insulin resistance , resulting in increased cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality and the risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The concept of metabolic syndrome (MS ) was first described by Reaven in 1988 as a
      combination of obesity , dyslipidemia , hypertension and fasting hyperglycemia , insulin
      resistance and inflammation as common pathophysiological disorders in cardiovascular disease
      (CVD). But the first comprehensive definition of MS was established only in 1998 , the World
      Health Organization ( WHO ) , in order to facilitate research in this area and points as a
      key indicator of SM the presence of hyperglycemia and / or resistance to insulin associated
      with days or more metabolic abnormalities (hypertension, dyslipidemia , obesity, and
      microalbuminuria).

      In the general population , the presence of MS is associated with increased risk of
      developing diabetes mellitus ( DM ) and cardiovascular disease . Some studies have associated
      the SM to the appearance of proteinuria and reduction in the value of the glomerular
      filtration rate ( GFR ), suggesting an association SM with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) .

      Metabolic syndrome (MS) consists of complex disorder that involves assembly cardiovascular
      risk factors related to abdominal fat deposition and insulin resistance . MS is associated
      with cardiovascular disease , increasing overall mortality by about 1.5 times and
      cardiovascular mortality by about 2.5 times.

      In 2001 , the National Cholesterol Education Program - Panel of the National Cholesterol
      Education Program ( NCEP - ATP III ), prepared another proposal. According to the NCEP ATP
      III, SM represents the combination of at least three components.
