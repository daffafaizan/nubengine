      lower limb amputation and twenty-four (24) with any unilateral upper limb amputation.
      Subjects will be randomized for assignment into three treatment conditions: eight (8) lower
      and eight (8) upper limb subjects (50% with left-sided amputations) will use mental
      visualization of foot or hand movements, eight (8) lower and eight (8) upper limb subjects
      (50% with left-sided amputations) will use an open mirror- box to visualize the reflected
      image of their intact foot or hand, and eight (8) lower and eight (8) upper limb subjects
      (50% with left-sided amputations) will use a closed mirror- box (unable to visualize a
      reflected image). Subjects will use their assigned therapy for 20 minutes daily. Subjects
      using the closed mirror-box or mental visualization treatments will be switched to mirror
      therapy if they have not significantly improved following 4 weeks. The subjects for this
      study will be recruited from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center Amputee clinic. Up to sixty
      (60) subjects will be recruited and screened according to the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria since we expect that some may not qualify or drop-out sooner than the scheduled
      4-month completion time.
