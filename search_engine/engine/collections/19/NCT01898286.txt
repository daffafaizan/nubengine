      eventual loss of the preserved beta-cell function. Indeed, extension of phase 2 studies has
      shown that patients who were initially treated with DiaPep277® and maintained their initial
      beta-cell function, required continuation of treatment, losing beta-cell function if switched
      to Placebo. These extension studies were too small for the outcome to be statistically
      significant, but they suggested that continuation of treatment is needed for long-term
      maintenance of efficacy.

      Therefore, in this extension study, patients who complete the 1001 phase 3 study
      (NCT01103284) and maintain clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a 2-year
      continuation of active treatment, since they are likely to benefit from use of the
      medication. The participation in the extension study will be offered to all eligible subjects
      who complete the 1001 study, regardless of the treatment arm allocation in the initial study.

      By achieving long-term preservation of beta-cell function, patients are expected to maintain
      good management of the disease, manifesting as better glycemic control and fewer hypoglycemic
      events.
