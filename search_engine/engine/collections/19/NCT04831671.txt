      fractures. Traditionally this has been done via an infra-patella approach. More recently the
      use of a supra-patella approach has become more popular. However, there are concerns that the
      supra-patella approach may cause unacceptable damage to the cartilage of the patello-femoral
      joint (PFJ).

      This study will use a novel MRI technique developed at the University of Cambridge to compare
      the amount of damage caused to the knee joint by both infra- and supra-patella nailing
      techniques. Specific cartilage assessment sequences will enable a fuller assessment of
      cartilage damage than can be achieved with normal structural sequences. Participants will
      also be asked to complete Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) regarding their injury to
      assess their clinical outcome.

      Infra-patella and supra-patella nailing techniques are now both routine methods of carrying
      out intra-medullary nailing of the tibia. Further evidence is required, however, in order to
      fully assess whether one method is superior to the other.
