      of collagen-PVP versus hylan GF 20, using the International Knee Documentation Committee
      (IKDC) score, 6 months after treatment. Hypothesis to test is: If effectiveness of
      intra-articular collagen-PVP is not lower than hylan GF 20 treatment in knee osteoarthritis
      subjects, then, statistically significant difference would not exist in IKDC score mean
      increase among treatment groups, after six months.
