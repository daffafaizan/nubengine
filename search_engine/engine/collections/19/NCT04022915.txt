    
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most common causes of death in the United States,
      resulting in more than 100,000 deaths annually. Current diagnostic techniques rely on
      indirect measures of clot for diagnosis and therefore suffer from the problems of both under
      and overdiagnosis and cannot always be performed on patients with renal failure and lung
      disease. In this study, we will use the novel fibrin-specific probe 64CU-FBP8 (Copper-64
      labeled fibrin binding probe 8) for PET imaging of fresh blood clots in PE and DVT. Our
      long-term goal is to establish a novel thrombus body scan (TBS) using 64CU-FBP8 for PET
      imaging to overcome the limitations of indirect venous thromboembolism diagnosis, and, with
      one single test, provide a total-body assessment of fresh intravascular clot.
