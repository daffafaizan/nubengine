    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BKM120 (PI3K inhibitor BKM120) that
      can be administered in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) in
      patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      II. To define the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and other toxicities associated with the use
      of combination BKM120 and carboplatin and pemetrexed.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of BKM120, when used in combination with
      carboplatin and pemetrexed.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity with this combination.

      III. To evaluate downstream inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120. Patients receive
      pemetrexed disodium intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes followed by carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1, and PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      may receive courses of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 alone or PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and pemetrexed
      disodium after 4-6 courses with carboplatin in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
