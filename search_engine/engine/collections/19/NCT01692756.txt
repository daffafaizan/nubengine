      the ACL. ACL tears cause pain, swelling and inflammation. While the swelling and inflammation
      usually goes away in time, individuals with ACL injuries may experience pain and notice knee
      instability (knee slipping, etc.). Often surgery can repair or replace the ACL within the
      joint, allowing individuals the ability to walk or run again pain free or participate in
      sports. Unfortunately, osteoarthritis of the knee, which also causes pain and swelling, can
      occur in that same knee 10-20 years later for reasons which are not well understood.

      In this research study, we hope to prevent and reduce the initial post-operative pain. The
      reduction of pain will allow for earlier movement of the knee joint and preparation for
      surgery. It may also reduce the risk to develop osteoarthritis in individuals with ACL
      injuries by treating them within 1-2 days after their injury.
