    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 i.v. q 3 wks

      All patients will also receive folic acid 350-1000 mcg. po once daily beginning approximately
      1 week prior to the first dose of pemetrexed and continuing until completion of pemetrexed,
      Vitamin B12 1000 mcg. IM every 9 weeks beginning approximately 1 week prior to the first dose
      of pemetrexed and continuing until completion of pemetrexed, and dexamethasone 4 mg po bid
      the day before, the day of, and the day following each treatment with pemetrexed

      Chest x-ray will be performed prior to each cycle (if other disease assessment by imaging is
      not performed) in order to ensure patients are not rapidly progressing.

      Cycles are repeated every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles or PD or intolerable side effects.
