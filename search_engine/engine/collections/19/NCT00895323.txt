        -  Assess the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of anti-CEA x anti-HSG bispecific
           monoclonal antibody TF2 in patients with colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive iodine I 131-labeled anti-CEA x anti-HSG bispecific monoclonal antibody TF2
      (^131I-TF2) IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo whole-body external
      scintigraphy at various times during the study.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically after ^131I-TF2 infusion for
      pharmacokinetic studies and ^131I-TF2 biodistribution by ELISA and radioactivity
      measurements.
