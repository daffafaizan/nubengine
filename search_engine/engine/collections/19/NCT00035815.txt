      of weakness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Three hundred thirty patients with ALS
      from 20 medical centers participated in this double blind, placebo-controlled two-year study.
      Half the patients received IGF-1 and the other half received placebo. The drug will be
      administered twice a day.

      ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness and loss of motor
      neurons. IGF-1 is a neurotrophic factor essential for normal development of the nervous
      system and shows protection of motor neurons in animal models and cell culture systems. It is
      thought to block cell death pathways and promote muscle re-innervation and axonal growth and
      regeneration.
