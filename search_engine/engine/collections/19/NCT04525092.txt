      intermittent dialysis, there is limited data comparing these modalities in AKI from various
      aetiologies in critically ill patients. As RCTs involving renal replacement therapy at the
      ICU are exceptionally challenging to complete, thus a rigorous RCT based on appropriate
      sample size and relevant clinical outcomes is crucial. The objective of this pilot RCT is to
      assess the feasibility of a larger multicentre RCT to determine whether, in patients with AKI
      requiring acute renal replacement therapy, does exposure to Post-dilution Hemodiafiltration
      or Pre-dilution Hemodiafiltration reduce the inflammatory status and improve renal recovery
      compared to conventional intermittent hemodialysis at the ICU. As post-dilution HDF has never
      been adequately evaluated in an ICU context, comparison between pre-dilution and
      post-dilution HDF is also required to confirm feasibility.

      This proof-of-concept pilot trial will focus on three feasibility endpoints. It will be
      considered successful if the following criteria are achieved :

        -  Protocol adherence: If ≥85% of overall dialysis sessions are administered per-protocol
           according to the allocated modality

        -  Adherence to follow-up: If it was possible to obtain end-of-study outcomes in ≥90% of
           participants, and

        -  Participant accrual: If the average monthly enrolment is 4 or more participants per
           months.
