      terms of medical resources used in postpartum women with hypertension. These are both
      antihypertensives we commonly use in the postpartum period for women with hypertension in
      pregnancy but we do not know which medication works better at decreasing prolonged
      hospitalizations, the number of unscheduled medical visits and/or readmissions to the
      hospital.

      Nifedipine is more traditionally used and well-validated by current medical literature.
      However, enalapril's mechanism of action is better suited to the dysregulation of blood
      pressure that can occur with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Therefore, we hypothesize
      that enalapril is superior to nifedipine in terms of medical resources used in the postpartum
      period.
