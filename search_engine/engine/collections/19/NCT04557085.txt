    
      Subjects will undergo an 8-week Screening/Baseline Period to assess seizure frequency.
      Subjects with a high enough number of seizures will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to
      receive placebo or cenobamate 100, 200, or 400 mg given once per day in the morning. Subjects
      will first enter the 18-week Titration Phase, during which the initial dose will be 12.5
      mg/day or placebo. The dose of cenobamate will be increased in a double-blind fashion from
      12.5 mg/day to 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day (or matching placebo) at 2-week intervals and then
      will be titrated by 50 mg/day (or matching placebo) every 2 weeks. After 18-week
      up-titration, subjects will enter the Maintenance Phase. During the Maintenance Phase,
      subjects are recommended to maintain their dose for 6 weeks. Subjects who have completed the
      Double-blind Treatment Period and who choose to participate in this OLE will enter an 18-week
      Double-blind Conversion Phase before starting the 34-week Open-label Maintenance Phase.
      Subjects who do not enroll into the OLE will enter a 5-week FU period.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cenobamate as adjunctive
      therapy compared with placebo in subjects with POS. The secondary objectives of this study
      are: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of cenobamate in subjects with POS, to evaluate
      the effect of cenobamate in POS and in specified seizure types, and to assess blood plasma
      exposure of cenobamate in subjects with POS.
