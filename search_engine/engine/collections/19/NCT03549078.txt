      multi-dimensional intervention for older adults with subjective cognitive concerns (SCC). The
      goal of this intervention is to enhance compensation skills related to everyday executive and
      everyday memory functions through training in the systematic use of a calendar system, goal
      setting and task list system, and organizational strategies within the context of the
      individual's daily life. This multidimensional intervention program also targets engagement
      in healthy lifestyle activities (physical exercise, intellectual stimulation, positive
      emotional functioning) to further promote brain health and functional resilience.
      Importantly, both treatment components work synergistically as the use of compensation
      strategies assists in building healthy activities into daily routines (e.g., scheduling
      exercise into one's calendar and putting it on a task list).
