      treatment plan as either chemoradiation-based or surgically-based (laryngectomy). Treatment
      will be assigned by the patient's physician, it will not be assigned by the study.

      Patients will be asked to complete a series of 4 questionnaires addressing swallowing
      function, generic health status, head and neck cancer-specific quality of life, and
      self-reported speech function at 3 time points (baseline, 6 months and 12 months after the
      end of treatment). The treating physician will provide basic clinical information at these
      same time points. In centers where swallowing and voice assessments are done as part of
      standard of care, data from these studies will also be provided.

      Study entry is open to all adults regardless of gender or ethnic background. Specific
      information regarding the definitive treatment (surgery or chemoradiation) will be provided
      to the patient by the treating physician as part of the routine standard of care. Any
      treatment related side effects, as well as the duration of therapy and follow-up will be
      managed by the treating physician. Participation in this study will have no effect on the
      initial treatment decisions or the course of care.
