      human and animal health. In addition to causing outbreaks of winter flu, it sometimes mutates
      to create a new virus that spreads quickly around the world. It is puzzling that the same
      virus appears to cause minor or absent symptoms in some people while killing others. Much
      remains to be understood.

      The investigators have assembled an unprecedented group of internationally renowned
      scientists from England and Scotland who will together focus on studying a few hundred people
      hospitalised during the current swine flu pandemic. Such a large scale project has never
      before been attempted, but we are now poised to work together and integrate the many recent
      advances in biomedical science that relate to understanding how influenza causes disease.
