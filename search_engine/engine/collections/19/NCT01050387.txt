      vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in young children are obvious: acutely, hypocalcemic seizures may
      occur in VDD, and rickets can result in long-term skeletal deformities. Previous research has
      emphasized the importance of identifying optimal supplementation doses and appropriate target
      thresholds for circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), the best described marker of vitamin
      D status. The timely next step is to objectively establish effective doses for the prevention
      of VDD, without creating risk from overzealous supplementation, in a population
      representative of those most at risk for overt disease.

      Although the primary role of vitamin D is considered to be its effect on intestinal calcium
      absorption, enormous variability of fractional calcium absorption in relation to 25-OHD
      levels exists. We provide evidence that a significant component of this variability is
      genetic in nature and in particular, relates to vitamin D binding protein (DBP) genotype.

      The aggregate data suggest that the critical mechanism for the development of nutritional
      rickets is reduction in availability of calcium to the skeleton, which is largely determined
      by vitamin D status and intestinal calcium absorption. Our proposal focuses on the
      establishment of a workable definition of vitamin D deficiency in an underserved and highly
      vulnerable population and to assess the impact of genetic variance in VDR and DBP as factors
      to be considered in the recommendation of vitamin D status assessment, taking into account
      the outcome of 25-OHD level, and in additional studies, potential functional consequences of
      vitamin D related to both its classical and non-classical effects.
