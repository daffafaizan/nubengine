      the study is to assess the eï¬€ect of FGM on glycemic control compared with standard blood
      glucose monitoring (SMBG) using a randomised controlled study design in adults with type 2
      diabetes. Subjects will use unmasked FGM once a month or SMBG to monitor glucose level for 3
      months. Patients in the SMBG group will wear masked FGM to collect glycaemic variability data
      for comparison to the intervention group of the study. The primary outcome, HbA1c, will be
      cpmpared at baseline and 3 month. Glucose control parameters provided by unmasked and masked
      FGM will be compared in the two groups, including mean blood glucose (MBG), coefficient of
      variation (CV), area under the curve (AUC), Time in Range(TIR), etc.
