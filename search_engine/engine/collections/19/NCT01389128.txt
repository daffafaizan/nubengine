      prioritizes the quality of care, as indissolubly concerns the employment of technology,
      knowledge, the centrality of dialogue between professionals and patients and individualized
      choice resources deemed suitable for safe delivery. Seeking to implement a less
      interventionist care with evidence-based practice and greater incentive to vaginal delivery,
      the programs were created humanization of labor and birth, with the use of various
      non-pharmacological resources. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      combination of non-pharmacological resources during the dilation in relieving the pain of the
      mothers. The research will be of type randomized controlled trial, consisting of low-risk
      primigravidae admitted at the Reference Center for Women's Health in Ribeir√£o Preto. The
      mothers will be distributed in two groups (intervention protocol features non-drug) and
      Control (routine maternity) and will be evaluated before and after application of each
      resource, and the control group in the same time according to cervical dilation. Evaluation
      will be conducted by a visual analog scale and / or facial pain and pain location diagram and
      postpartum will be applied a validated questionnaire Experience and Satisfaction with
      childbirth. After collecting the data, the groups are statistically analyzed using the linear
      regression model with mixed effects (fixed and random), taking into account a value of p
      <0.05 to obtain the statistical significance of 5%.
