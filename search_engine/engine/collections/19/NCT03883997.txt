      in professional male soccer player aged 18 years and older. Standardized and certified
      personnel carried out anthropometric measurements and DXA whole body scan the same day.

      Body fat was estimated with several anthropometric equations. These equations were divided
      into two groups: 1) Derived from non-athletic samples; and 2) Derived from athletic samples.

      The body fat estimated from anthropometric equations was compared with DXA, and those with
      non-significant differences were further analyzed for calculating mean differences and 95%
      limits of agreement with DXA. This analysis was carried out for all equations.
