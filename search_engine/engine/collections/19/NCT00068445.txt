        -  Compare the efficacy of lamotrigine vs placebo in reducing pain and symptoms of
           chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with cancer.

        -  Compare symptom distress, mood states, functional abilities, and overall quality of life
           of patients treated with these agents.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of lamotrigine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients are
      stratified according to neurotoxic chemotherapy received (taxanes vs platinum-based compounds
      vs vinca alkaloids vs combination vs other), status of neurotoxic chemotherapy (actively
      receiving therapy vs discontinued or completed), and duration of pain or neuropathy symptoms
      (1-3 months vs 3-6 months vs more than 6 months). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.
