      numerous cysts in both kidneys and progressive renal function decline leading to renal
      replacement therapy (RRT) at a median age of 58 years. The first (and at the moment only)
      drug to slow down renal function decline, is a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist (V2RA).
      This medicament slows renal function decline by 26 to 34%. V2RA also causes aquaresis
      associated side-effects such as polyuria of >6 liter per day in the majority of patients.
      These side-effects limit wide spread use among ADPKD-patients. Therefore, there is a need to
      improve its tolerability. While using a V2RA, urine concentrating ability is strongly
      diminished. Therefore, urine volume is largely determined by total osmolar excretion. This is
      a well-known fact in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a disease with clear pathophysiological
      similarities to treatment with a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist (a defect receptor versus
      pharmacological blockade). A recent study found osmolar excretion to be associated with
      urinary volume during V2RA treatment. Whether a change in osmolar load changes polyuria
      during V2RA has not yet been investigated. The investigators hypothesize that changing sodium
      and protein intake will reduce polyuria.
