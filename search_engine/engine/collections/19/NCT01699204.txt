      reactivity via oxidative stress, particularly in asthmatics. To test this hypothesis, we use
      a crossover in vivo experimental model in mild asthmatics and normal controls using a
      state-of-the-art diesel exhaust exposure facility.

      Participants took N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) or placebo capsules three times daily for six
      days. On the final morning of supplementation, participants were exposed for 2 hours to
      either filtered air or diesel exhaust (300 µg·m-3 of particulate matter smaller than 2.5
      microns). Twenty-six non-smokers between 19-49 years were studied under three experimental
      conditions (filtered air with placebo, diesel exhaust with placebo and diesel exhaust with
      N-acetylcysteine) using randomized, double-blind, crossover design, with a two week minimum
      washout between conditions. Methacholine challenge was performed pre-exposure (to determine
      baseline airway responsiveness) and post-exposure (to determine the effect of exposure).
