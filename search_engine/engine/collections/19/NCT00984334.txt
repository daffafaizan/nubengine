    
      Naloxone has been used for many years as an IV or IM injection for the reversal of opioid
      effects (following opioid overdose) and has been evaluated as an oral formulation to manage
      opioid-induced constipation. Immediate release oral naloxone preparations have however led to
      reversal of opioid effects and withdrawal. This has initiated the development of prolonged
      (slow release) naloxone preparations which prevent the systemic levels of naloxone reaching
      levels where the central opioid effects may be reversed. Naloxone has a high first pass
      metabolism (98%) and short half life (~1hr).

      The objectives of this trial are to identify the optimum dosage regime of Naloxone SR
      capsules based on tolerability level, to improve spontaneous bowel movement frequency, and
      relieve GI symptoms, in patients suffering with opioid induced constipation.
