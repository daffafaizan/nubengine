    
      REAL-TICA is a retrospective non-interventional study to assess the long-term use of
      ticagrelor in patients with ACS and to evaluate the reasons for discontinuation of
      ticagrelor.

      For this purpose, selected sites from the ALKK-PCI registry and the respective patients will
      be identified. The sites' eligibility for this study includes the frequent use of ticagrelor
      during the acute phase of ACS. Eligible patients are characterised by the diagnosis of ACS
      and the use of ticagrelor during PCI.

      The eligible sites will be contacted by IHF and asked to contact their eligible patients by
      letter to obtain informed consent of the patients for the planned 12M follow-up by IHF. A
      detailed questionnaire on events within the last 12 months, current symptoms, current
      medication and the use of ticagrelor will be added to the patients' letters. Patients then
      are asked to return their responses on consent to participate in the study as well as the
      filled in questionnaire to IHF. Alternatively, patients may choose to receive a telephone
      call by IHF to answer the detailed questionnaire in person. In case of essential information
      missing, IHF will contact the primary care physician of the patient directly to obtain
      information about clinical events and medications.
