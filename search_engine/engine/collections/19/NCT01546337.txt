      Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs). However, some patients do not respond to treatment.
      Thus, only 50-60% of patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma respond to ESAs.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of endogenous erythropoietin
      rate on the response to erythropoietin beta. First, by confirming the predictive value of
      endogenous erythropoietin observed / predicted ratio on this response. Then if it is
      confirmed by establishing the optimal value of this ratio.
