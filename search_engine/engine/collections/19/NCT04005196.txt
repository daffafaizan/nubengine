    
      Aim 1: To quantify EEG phase synchrony changes, both globally and locally by brain region,
      during emergence from medically induced coma required for performance of a cardiovascular
      related operation (deep sedation defined as a Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale [SAS] of 1-2).

      Hypothesis: The global R-index will be increased above baseline at multiple frequency
      bandwidths and the magnitude of R-index will correlate with the sedative dosage (as a crude
      measure of depth). The rate of fluctuations of the R-index will decrease with deeper
      sedation.

      Aim 2: To compare the magnitude of the EEG phase synchrony globally and locally in patients
      emerging from coma; a patient's pre-anesthesia phase will serve as a control.

      Hypothesis: Fluctuations in R-index will vary; fluctuations will be greater in awake adults
      as compared to while comatose or emerging from coma.

      Aim 3: To determine EEG phase synchrony changes in patients with and without delirium during
      their CVICU stay.

      Hypothesis: Lower scores of R-index consistent with increased phase synchrony and lower
      spatio-temporal variability will be seen while delirious as compared to days when patients
      are not delirious.
