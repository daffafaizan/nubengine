      patches can be used for localized pain control and can be placed every 24 hours. The use of
      lidocaine patches in post-operative patients has been reported in one case report in
      obstetric literature. There is one study that reports decreased immediate postoperative pain
      when lidocaine patches were placed at laparoscopic port sites following gynecologic surgery
      as measured by visual analog scale score and the Prince Henry and 5-point verbal rating pain
      scale . There have been no studies looking at the impact of lidocaine patches in obstetric
      surgical procedures, specifically cesarean sections.
