      no accurate methods of establishing the risk of rupture for an individual patient with an
      asymptomatic AAA. In vascular disease, microcalcification occurs in response to necrotic
      inflammation. Using computed tomography and positron emission tomography (PET-CT), early
      micro calcification can be identified using uptake of the radiotracer 18F-sodium fluoride.
      This can identify high risk-lesions in the aorta, coronary and carotid arteries, and appears
      to be indicative of necrotic and heavily inflamed tissue. The study investigators therefore
      propose to evaluate the ability of 18F-sodium fluoride to identify regions of necrotic
      inflammation in AAA and predict AAA expansion. The study investigators will explore its value
      as part of an ongoing clinical trial assessing the identification of macrophage activity
      using magnetic resonance imaging - the MA3RS Study (ISRCTN76413758). Patients already
      enrolled in the MA3RS Study will be recruited for the SoFIA3 study. Control patients with a
      normal calibre aorta will be recruited from the National AAA Screening Programme.
