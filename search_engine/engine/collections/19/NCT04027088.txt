      Perioperative nutritional status is a key factor in the evolution, as well as, postoperative
      morbidity and mortality of cancer patients. Particularly, digestive neoplasms have a high
      risk of malnutrition and this is related to a higher rate of surgery complications and
      mortality in the postoperative period. The immunonutrition seems to modulate the immune
      system and the inflammatory response in patients operated on for digestive neoplasia.
      However, the results to date are controversial.

      Aim:

      To compare the effect of an immunomodulatory oral nutritional supplement (enriched in
      arginine, nucleotides, omega 3 fatty acids, olive oil polyphenols, L-carnitine, and
      antioxidants) against an equivalent in protein-energy without immunonutrients, administrated
      in the preoperative period, in the surgical evolution of the cancer patient with neoplasia of
      the upper digestive tract.

      Methods:

      It is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial. 178 patients with neoplasms of
      the esophagus, stomach or pancreas, with indication of surgical treatment, will be included.
      The patients will be randomized into two groups (intervention group and control group) and
      both will receive 2 daily bricks of the assigned formula (with or without immunonutrients,
      respectively) 5 days prior to surgery. The main variables of the study are: appearance of
      infectious or noninfectious complications in the postoperative period, length of hospital
      stay, and mortality. These variables will be compared by group (immunonutrition vs. non
      immunonutrition).
