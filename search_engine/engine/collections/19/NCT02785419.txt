      tasks. In healthy adults, planning plays a vital role in the control of skilled movement,
      however, the behavioral and neural correlates of planning have largely been unexplored in
      individuals recovering from stroke. Action selection is an important motor planning process
      that engages dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in controls. While PMd activation is a commonly
      reported neural correlate of motor recovery after stroke, the role of PMd in action selection
      and motor training are not known. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the
      effect of training that includes action selection demands on the behavioral and neural
      correlates of movement after stroke. Thirty-eight individuals in the chronic phase of stroke
      will be recruited. After completion of clinical measures of impairment and function, all
      participants with stroke will complete a motor action selection task and functional MRI
      followed by arm training. Arm training will consist of three weeks (15 sessions) of arm motor
      training (1.5 hours per session) that includes action selection demands on movement.
      Follow-up clinical testing will occur at the end of treatment and three weeks later.
