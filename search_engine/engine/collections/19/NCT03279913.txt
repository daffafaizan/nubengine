    
      Primary objective : To demonstrate a decrease in the intensity of depressive symptomatology
      following EEG-neurofeedback training in association with TMS and see if there is a
      correlation with a change in frontal asymmetry.

      Secondary objective : To demonstrate a cognitive improvement in patients with respect to
      motivation and control of thoughts, as well as perceived health, self-esteem and anxiety
      following EEG-neurofeedback training in association with TMS and to see if there is a
      correlation between the change in scores on psychometric scales with a change in frontal
      asymmetry.

      The expected outcomes of this study are:

        -  Better characterization of the pathophysiological processes involved in depressive
           disorder;

        -  An evaluation of the effectiveness of EEG-Neurofeedback training in recurrent depressive
           disorder in association with TMS, both emotionally and cognitively;

        -  The development of innovative technologies in the field of brain-machine interfaces and
           optimization of procedures.
