      (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China. The virus, which causes atypical pneumonia
      progressing to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in some
      individuals, was named COVID-19. The burden of fibrotic lung disease following SARS-CoV-2
      infection is likely to be high; therefore, given the scale of the pandemic, the global burden
      of fibrotic lung disease will probably increase considerably. The aim of this study is to
      check the cardiorespiratory fitness level and the effect of Physical therapy intervention to
      improve the Cardiorespiratory fitness level in patients recovered from COVID-19. Quality of
      life has also been affected due to COVID19 due to decreased Cardiorespiratory fitness level,
      and this study also aims to improve the quality of life of people recovered from COVID19.
