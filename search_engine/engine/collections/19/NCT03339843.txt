      diseases with a high negative predictive value (NPV) through a whole-body quantitative
      assessment of treatment-induced changes in tumour glucose uptake soon after treatment
      initiation, before any structural changes are observed. Progress in the standardisation of
      FDG-PET/CT imaging and response analysis now allow its use in multicentric trials opening the
      possibilities for trials where treatment allocation will be based on early metabolic
      response. MiMe has been built on the assumption that a medication which does not induce any
      metabolic changes in a given clinical setting is unlikely to induce a significant benefit and
      does consequently not deserve further investigation as a single agent in this setting.

      MiMe, by assessing metabolic response early during the treatment course, will hopefully
      provide useful information about the drug activity in various cancer types, and about
      mechanisms of resistance through a potential ambitious translational research program with
      serial collection of circulating-tumour DNA (ct-DNA).
