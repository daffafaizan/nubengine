    
      Introduction: Laparoscopic procedure produces adverse effects on splanchnic organs.
      Pneumoperitoneum is a non-physiologic condition that causes a higher intra-abdominal pressure
      (IAP) and is associated with significant direct and indirect effects on renal physiology.

      Aim of the study:

      To establish AKI incidence in patients who are undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      To identify the potential risk factors associated with the development of AKI. To establish
      the relationship between the IAP during the procedure and the AKI incidence.

      Study Design:

      Study population: A single center prospective cohort study will be conducted. 100 patients
      undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the Galilee Medical Center will be
      included.

      Inclusion criteria: age > 18 years, able to sign the consent form, stable kidney function.

      Exclusion criteria: end stage renal disease, acute kidney injury or need of dialysis three
      months prior the procedure, acute infection, acute inflammation, BMI > 40, malignancy and
      pregnancy.

      The diagnosis of AKI will be made based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
      Clinical Practice Guideline 2012, by comparing the baseline and post-operative serum
      creatinine and cystatin C and monitoring urine output during the procedure and after the
      procedure for 24 hours.

      Data Analysis: Results will be presented as mean Â± standard deviation for quantitative data.
      A p value of <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
