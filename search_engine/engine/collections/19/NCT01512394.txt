      not standardized amongst our Pediatric Surgical attendings. There are seven different
      attendings, each of whom individually dictates if a patient is to undergo a preoperative
      bowel prep, and if so, which bowel prep will be used. This is no different than the majority
      of practices across the US, including adult and pediatric patient populations. The aim of
      this study, therefore, is to standardize our current management and assess if the presence or
      absence of a preoperative bowel prep has an effect on post-operative outcomes. The goal is to
      evaluate the effect of the bowel preparation not the surgical procedure itself.
