      controls and will be assigned to the four experimental conditions (resting, HIIS, MICC and
      SDS), 1 week apart, in a counter-balanced order.

      Participants will be asked to come to the Unit five times: one preliminary session and four
      experimental conditions (resting, HIIS and MICC isocaloric sessions and SDS). In the
      preliminary session, anthropometric data (weight and height) will be collected and a maximal
      fitness test performed, using a cycle ergometer.

      For the four experimental conditions, participants will be asked to arrive at approximately
      8.00, having fasted for at least 10 hours, and a cannula will be inserted into an antecubital
      vein. Two fasting blood samples will be taken and a standard breakfast offered. After that,
      serial blood samples will be taken at regular intervals for a period of 3h.

      Participants will be asked to rate their subjective feelings of hunger and fullness using
      visual analogue scales (VAS) throughout each study morning at different time points. Three
      hours after breakfast, participants will be placed in individual rooms, presented with a
      standardized lunch and instructed to rate the taste and palatability of the food presented.
