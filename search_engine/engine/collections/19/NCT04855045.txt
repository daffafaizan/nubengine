    
      This is an open-label, dose escalation and double-masked, randomized, controlled study
      evaluating safety and tolerability of sepofarsen administered via intravitreal (IVT)
      injection in pediatric subjects (<8 years of age) with LCA10 due to the c.2991+1655A>G
      mutation. The study consists of two parts: an open-label dose escalation part, followed by a
      double-masked randomized part.

      In the open label part; subjects will be assigned to one of 3 planned dose groups using a
      staggered dose escalation design. After at least 1 patient is dosed in each group; the Data
      Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review at least 4 weeks of safety data post dosing; and may
      recommend initiation of the next dose group. The DMC may recommend initiation of the
      double-masked randomized part of the study after completion of the last dose group in the
      dose escalation part of the study.

      In the double-masked, randomized, controlled part of the study; subjects will be randomized
      to one of 2 planned dose groups .

      Subjects will receive a unilateral IVT injection of sepofarsen on Day 1. Thereafter a
      6-monthly dosing schedule is planned.

      After each dosing subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability at follow up visits.
