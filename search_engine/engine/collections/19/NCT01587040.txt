    
      The duration of the study for an individual participant included:

        1. Baseline assessments: within 7 days prior to the first dose of investigational medicinal
           product (IMP).

        2. Study treatment period(s):

           Participants started study treatment at the beginning of the initiation or extension
           periods based on the length of prior therapy with SAR245408 or SAR245409

             -  if <2 cycles, started with initiation period; Participant must have had completed
                all the visits in the initiation period before moving to the extension period.

             -  if >=2 cycles, started with extension period; duration of extension period was
                unlimited.

             -  Participants who took a SAR245408 or SAR245409 daily dose higher than their
                established dose of SAR245408 or SAR245409, respectively, in the parental study
                entered the study on Day 1 of the initiation period.

             -  Participants who had dose interrupted in the parental study but fulfilled parental
                protocol criteria to restart IMP treatment entered the treatment-extension study on
                Day 1 of the initiation period.

             -  Participants who fulfilled the parental study criteria for IMP treatment
                continuation but had ongoing Grade 2 adverse events (AEs) entered the
                treatment-extension study on Day 1 of the initiation period.

           Participants continued to receive study treatment until disease progression,
           unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or until commercial supplies of SAR245408
           or SAR245409 were available to them outside of the clinical trial.

        3. Follow-up assessments: 23 to 37 days after the last dose of IMP.
