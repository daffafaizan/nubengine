        -  Provide source of patient tissue, blood, and body fluid samples for ongoing diagnostic,
           prognostic, or immune-monitoring studies.

        -  Support and enhance translational, clinical and basic research for Lineberger
           Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) members (and non-members who have an LCCC member as
           sponsor and collaborator) with IRB-approved studies.

        -  Maintain responsible and appropriate policies and procedures that ensure good patient
           care and responsible conduct of research.

        -  Address medical and legal issues, and protect participant and patient privacy and
           confidentiality.

        -  Provide a responsible and uniform mechanism for the integrated coordination of the
           hemato-pathologist and surgeon or hematology/oncology staff, researcher, and protocol
           office to obtain appropriate specimens for researchers.

        -  Support young investigators to obtain pilot data for grant funding.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo tissue, blood, and body fluid collection during diagnostic or
      routine procedures for future correlative studies. Tissue samples may include, but are not
      limited to, lymph node or non-nodal biopsies, bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate, blood and
      serum, and buccal swabs for germline DNA analysis.
