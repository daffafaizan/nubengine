    
      LYR-210 is a combination product comprised of a drug depot, which contains the
      anti-inflammatory medication mometasone furoate (MF) pre-loaded in a single use applicator.
      LYR-210 is intended to be placed bilaterally into the sino-nasal passages by an
      otolaryngologist. Once in place, each LYR-210 drug depot is designed to gradually deliver
      sustained topical doses of MF to the inflamed mucosal sinus tissue over 24 weeks.
