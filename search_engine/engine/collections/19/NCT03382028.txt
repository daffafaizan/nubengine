      children with "Equinus Deformity Idiopathic" compared to the general population

      The secondary objective is to identify the prenatal and / or neonatal characteristics that
      could be predictive of the occurrence of developmental abnormalities in

      Prenatal and postnatal follow-up data are derived from the child's medical file. To complete
      these data and after inclusion, parents of children carrying "Equinus Deformity Idiopathic"

      medical events since the birth of their child (scoliosis, epilepsy ...).
