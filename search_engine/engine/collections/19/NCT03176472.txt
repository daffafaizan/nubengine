    
      The study includes an approximately 12 week randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      Treatment period in which patients will receive either ricolinostat or placebo, followed by
      an approximately 12 week open label Safety Extension period during which all patients will
      receive ricolinostat 120 mg daily.

      Prior to randomization, patients will be enrolled in a baseline Pain Observation period from
      Day -14 to Day -1, during which the NRS (average and worst pain) will be recorded daily using
      an electronic daily diary that will be completed by patients to allow patients to familiarize
      themselves with the pain rating procedures, and to establish a baseline and confirm
      eligibility to participate. Patients will also initiate daily dosing during this time to
      evaluate compliance eligibility for participation. A daily diary will be used by the patient
      to record the pain assessments and rescue medication use. A follow-up phone contact will be
      conducted at Day -7 to Day -5 to review diary and dosing compliance.

      Following the baseline Pain Observation period, patients who meet entry criteria will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ricolinostat or placebo. During the 12-week
      double-blind, placebo-controlled Treatment period, patients will return for assessments in
      accordance with the schedule of assessments. At the conclusion of the approximately 12 week
      open label Safety Extension period, patients will enter a Follow-up safety washout and
      assessment period, which will incorporate 2 visits at approximately 2 and 4 weeks following
      the final Safety Extension visit, with assessments performed as outlined in the schedule of
      assessments.
