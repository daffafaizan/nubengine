    
      Oral lichen planus is a mucosal inflammatory disease of unknown origin. It can be very
      painful especially if erosions appear on the oral mucosa.

      In this study the efficacy of pimecrolimus compared to placebo in treatment of erosive oral
      lichen planus will be investigated. To this end the subjective pain and the amount of
      affected mucosa will be monitored before and after treatment.
