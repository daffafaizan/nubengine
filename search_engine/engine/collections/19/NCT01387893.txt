      Digital Repetitive Infrapubic Pressure maneuver (immediate intervention group) or to a return
      appointment to receive instructions in the maneuver four weeks after the initial assessment
      date (delayed intervention group). Patients were to utilize the procedure on every occasion
      they had difficulty initiating, maintaining, or completing urine flow between the time of
      their instruction and their subsequent visit. At the initial assessment visits and the final
      visit, the patients completed an International Prostate Score Sheet (IPSS). A telephone
      survey was conducted with all patients an average of nine months following their instruction
      in the maneuver, to determine the extent to which they were still using it.
