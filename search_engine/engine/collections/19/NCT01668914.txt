        -  Determine the impact of routinely performed internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy
           on the systemic and locoregional treatments plan.

        -  Evaluate the metastasis rate of internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes in patients with
           clinically axillary node-positive.

        -  Draw the learning curve of internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy.

      OUTLINE:

      3~18 hours before surgery, under ultrasonographic guidance, 0.5~1.0 mCi 99mTc-labeled sulfur
      colloid in sterile saline (total volume 0.2~2.0 mL) is injected intraparenchymally into 2
      quadrants of breast. Subsequently, lymphoscintigraphy is performed 0.5~1.0 hour before
      surgery. internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed during the surgery and the
      internal mammary sentinel lymph nodes were sent to histologic examination.
