      Primary

        -  To compare outcomes of patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal
           tumor that expresses KIT (CD117) treated with low-dose imatinib mesylate vs high-dose
           imatinib mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  To assess response rates in patients treated with two different doses of imatinib
           mesylate.

        -  To assess the toxicities of two different doses of imatinib mesylate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating
      center, measurability of disease (measurable vs non-measurable), and WHO performance status
      (0-2 vs 3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive low-dose oral imatinib mesylate once daily in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive high-dose oral imatinib mesylate twice daily in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In the event of disease progression, patients on arm I may cross over to arm II and receive
      high-dose imatinib mesylate. Patients who continue to progress despite treatment with
      high-dose imatinib mesylate are removed from the study.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
