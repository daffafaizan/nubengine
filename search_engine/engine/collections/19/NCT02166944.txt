      correlate the score to the neurological outcome of the patients with and without tamoxifen
      treatment at dose of 40mg daily for one year.

      The study will be able to prove the investigators hypothesis: Tamoxifen, a protease and
      autophagy enhancer, has synergic effect with riluzole in ALS patients to slowing the
      progression of neurological dysfunction, and respiratory insufficiency.
