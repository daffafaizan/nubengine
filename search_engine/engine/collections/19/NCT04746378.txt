      cumulative stone diameter, a linear measurement of the stone burden. Multiple nomograms
      rather use the stone burden's surface area to predict post-operative outcomes. More recently,
      volume has been prposed as the most accurate measure of stone burden and the variable to be
      reported in stone treatment literature. Although inuitively a three dimensional evaluation is
      most likely the most accurate representation of the stone burden to be treated.

      Several reports however have compared different ways of measuring stone burden and could not
      confidently identify volume as the most accurate predictor of surgical outcomes.

      With this study, we aim to prospectively collect data on a large group of patients that have
      a pre-operative CT scan available. This imaging will be used to assess the stone burden in
      different ways, linear, two dimensional and three dimensional. Both procedural and
      post-operative data will be collected to identify which of the measurements is most accurate
      in predicting outcomes such as stone free status, operative time and complications such as
      bleeding. Patients can be included regardless of the procedure that is proposed to treat the
      stone. After inclusion and after having undergone the procedure, at least one post-operative
      assessment is necessary to be able to evaluate the pre-operative variables against
      post-operative outcomes.
