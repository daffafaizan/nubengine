      (conducted in more than one center), dose-titration (dose escalation/reduction) study of
      topiramate in participants with migraine. This study is a continuous study for the
      participants who were enrolled in the JNS019-JPN-02 study. Participants who completed the
      JNS019-JPN-02 study will receive treatment for 52 weeks starting at Visit 4 of the
      JNS019-JPN-02 study. The present study will consist of 3 weeks of Transfer period (during
      this period the dose titration will take place and along with dose titration the new
      treatment will be initiated at 25 milligram per day [25mg/day]), Continuous treatment period
      (32 weeks), Exit period (up to 3 weeks) and Follow-up period (4 weeks). Participants in the
      Continuous treatment period will receive topiramate tablets orally in the dose range of 50
      mg/day to 100 mg/day. Dose can be increased or decreased as per Investigator's discretion.
      The maximum daily dose will be 200 mg/day. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by change
      from Baseline in the number of monthly migraine attacks in Continuous treatment period.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
