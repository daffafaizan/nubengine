      high intensities, reduced craving and increased inhibitory control can be observed in alcohol
      or cocaine dependent individuals. As the focus of this study is the potential of exercise to
      be integrated into treatment, individuals in treatment for their dependence, who have been
      abstinent for a short period, will be recruited.
