      surgery followed by postoperative whole breast/chest wall irradiation+/- an additional boost
      (= irradiation restricted to the tumour bed in the case of breast-conserving therapy). In
      case of lymph node involvement in most patients require additional radiation of the regional
      lymph nodes. Adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduces ipsilateral breast cancer
      recurrences, breast cancer specific mortality, and overall mortality. The optimal time of
      radiotherapy in patients, who are candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has never
      been addressed in a randomised controlled trial.
