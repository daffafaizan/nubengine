      clinical practice setting on symptom relief, specifically, improvement in bowel habits and
      IBS pain. Patients planning to initiate commercially available LOTRONEX® therapy will be
      consented for study participation. Patients will complete study questionnaires related to
      bowel symptoms, prior therapies, quality of life, productivity loss and treatment outcome.
      Investigators will also be asked to complete questionnaires related to the patient's disease
      characteristics, patient progress on study medication and treatment outcome.
