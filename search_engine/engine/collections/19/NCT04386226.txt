      subjects for several years. It has been shown to enhance immunity, improve cognitive
      performance, and enhance antioxidant capacity. To date, the treatment with Ambrotose has been
      very well tolerated, with adverse events limited to "mild" or "self-limiting" or absent
      altogether.

      This study evaluates the impact of two Ambrotose products on immunity, gut health, and
      associated measures in healthy men and women. Subjects are randomly assigned in double-blind
      manner to one of five conditions: 1) 2 grams Advanced Ambrotose, 2) 4 grams Ambrotose
      Advanced, 3) 2 grams Ambrotose LIFE, 4) 4 grams Ambrotose LIFE, or 5) placebo. Subjects
      ingested their assigned condition daily for eight weeks.
