      drugs are now an established treatment for bronchial asthma and rhinitis. Drugs that inhibit
      the biosynthesis of leukotrienes are likely to be more effective than the currently available
      drugs that antagonize a single leukotriene receptor. Dietary supplementation with gamma
      linolenic acid (GLA) in borage seed oil provides effective inhibition of leukotriene
      generation but also increases circulating free arachidonic acid (AA), which has
      pro-inflammatory potential. The n-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), prevented the
      conversion of GLA to AA. However, EPA is extracted from fish oil, is not well-tolerated due
      to its taste, and at higher doses appeared to blunt the inhibition of leukotriene
      biosynthesis by GLA. Stearidonic acid (SDA) is a precursor of EPA that is extracted from
      Echium plantagineum; it is converted to EPA in humans and it does not have the organoleptic
      properties of EPA.

      We recently completed a dose-ranging study in which we determined the dose of SDA that is
      sufficient to inhibit the rise in circulating levels of arachidonic acid while maintaining
      effective inhibition of leukotriene generation.

      The goal of the present study is to test the efficacy of dietary supplementation with GLA and
      SDA (provided in borage seed oil and echium seed oil) in treating bronchial asthma.
