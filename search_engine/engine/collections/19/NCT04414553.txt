      pragmatic effectiveness trial of a community-based obesity treatment program, Community
      Active and Healthy Families (AHF), among 5-12 year old overweight and obese Latino children
      in immigrant families using a wait-list control randomized design will be conducted.

      The hypothesis is that children randomized to Community-AHF will demonstrate a reduction in
      child body mass index (primary outcome) and improved diet physical activity behaviors
      (secondary outcomes) at intervention completion compared with wait-list controls. The trial
      will evaluate whether Community-AHF is effective at decreasing BMI among overweight or obese
      Latino children. Overweight (BMIz score>85th%ile) and obese (BMIz score>95th%ile) 5-12
      year-old patients referred by their primary care pediatrician will be enrolled in the trial.
      The primary outcome will be change in BMI from baseline to 10 months.Other measures include
      diet and physical activity for children and parents, hypothesized mediators of the
      intervention, and important sociodemographic characteristics. The trial will aim to have â‰¥
      120 participants in each arm at the conclusion, 10 months after baseline. To accomplish this,
      300 participants will be randomized for optimal statistical power. The sample size for was
      calculated to detect 0.7 kg/m2 lower mean BMI in the Community-AHF versus the waitlist
      control at 10 months after randomization.
