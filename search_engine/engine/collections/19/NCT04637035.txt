    
      This is a single-arm pilot study of recently hospitalized patients with advanced cancer to
      assess the the feasibility of delivering a remote monitoring and home-based program,
      Supportive Oncology Care at Home, the acceptability and satisfaction with the Supportive
      Oncology Care at Home program, and changes in the quality of life and symptoms of patients
      who receive the Supportive Oncology Care at Home program.

      Oncologists at the MGH Cancer Center developed the Supportive Oncology Care program to
      address the symptoms and frequent hospital visits that patients face as a result of their
      cancer and the treatment they receive.

      The research study procedures include:

        -  Remote monitoring of symptoms, vital signs, and body weight

        -  Questionnaires asking about demographic information (e.g. gender, ethnicity, income) and
           participant experience with cancer (e.g. your quality of life, your symptoms)

        -  Interviews to assess participant impressions of the program

        -  Caregiver Interviews, Questionnaires and Surveys to assess caregiver impressions of the
           program and caregiver perceptions of participant symptoms while in the program

        -  Clinician Interviews and Questionnaires to assess impressions of the program

        -  Data collection from participant medical record.

      Patients will take part in the program for two weeks following hospital discharge.

      It is expected that between 75 and 110 people will enroll, including up to 30 patients, up to
      30 caregivers, and up to 15 clinicians.
