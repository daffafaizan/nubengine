      To investigate if a short copingintervention reduces anxiety in patients undergoing an IVF or
      ICSI treatment in the UMCU during the waitingperiod after an embryotransfer.

      Study design:

      In this research a randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be used for three groups. The
      choice for three groups has been based on earlier research with a daily record keeping (DRK).
      The DRK is a daily measurement for emotions, copingstyle and physical complaints. Previous
      research with the DRK showed an increase of anxiety. More research must be done of the impact
      of the DRK. Group 1: Positive Reappraisal Coping Intervention (PRCI) & DRK & questionnaires
      Group 2: DRK & questionnaires Group 3: Standard care & questionnaires

      Study population:

      Patients undergoing an IVF or ICSI treatment in the UMCU.

      Intervention (if applicable):

      A selfhelp coping intervention

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

      Anxiety

      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):

      Risk of emotional problems copingstyle depression vital pregnancy quality of life

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness (if applicable):

      Using the coping intervention may reduce anxiety for the patient. The use of this instrument
      is not a burden for patients. The burden for patients is to complete questionnaires before,
      during and six weeks after the embryotransfer. Partners are asked to fill in a questionnaire
      at three times.
