    
      This Phase I / IIa study will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of GLS-5310
      DNA vaccine.

      The Phase I portion of this study is an open-label, dose escalation study to assess two dose
      levels of GLS-5310 DNA vaccine (0.6 and 1.2 mg) as part of two vaccination regimens (0-8
      weeks and 0-12 weeks).

      The Phase IIa portion of this study is designed as a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study with only a single active study drug arm. Subjects will be
      randomized to receive either placebo or GLS-5310 vaccine in a 1:2 ratio.
