      of palifermin and assess the impact of the combination of palifermin and heparin on
      tolerability. Approximately forty-three (43) eligible healthy adult men and oophorectomized
      or postmenopausal women between 18-45 years of age will be assigned to one of three treatment
      groups where treatment group A will receive a daily dose of palifermin 40 µg/kg for three
      consecutive days as intravenous (IV) bolus injections and continuous heparin IV infusion,
      treatment B will receive a daily dose of palifermin 40 µg/kg for three consecutive days as IV
      bolus injections and treatment C will be a control group without any treatment administered.
      The subjects will be randomized in a 20:15:8 ratio (Treatment A:B:C).

      The study consists of a up to 21-days screening period, a 5-days treatment period and a up to
      45-days follow-up period.
