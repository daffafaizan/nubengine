      arthroplasty that will receive one of the two total knee device systems.

      Primary total knee replacement is an effective treatment for relieving pain and improving
      function for patients with degenerative joint disease. Recently, design of knee implants in a
      total knee replacement have received increased interest, particularly the medial pivot
      designs. Single-radius implants are designed to minimize instability throughout the
      functional range of movement. Medial pivot total knee designs theoretically recreate more
      normal knee motion when compared to single radius designs. Both implant designs are commonly
      used for total knee replacements. Outcomes of TKA are evaluated by multiple methods including
      implant/device survivorship, radiographic assessments, clinical examinations, and patient
      reported outcome measures (PROMS). Laboratory based gait analysis performed at a specialized
      research facility is not commonly conducted in patients with positive outcomes post-surgery
      as this is associated with high cost. There is currently not enough research comparing these
      two designs directly. Research is required to determine which design may provide better
      clinical outcomes and satisfaction with the procedure.

      In addition to your normal standard clinical care, there will be scheduled pre-operative,
      operative, 6-week, 6 month, 12 month, 24 month, 36 month, and 60 month follow-up visits.
