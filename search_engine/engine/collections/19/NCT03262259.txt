      alcohol use and related harms in six intervention cities relative to six matched comparison
      cities. The trial is expected to expand to nine intervention and nine comparison cities in
      2018. Intervention components include screening and brief interventions by health providers,
      other evidence-based interventions (e.g., enforcement of drink-driving or underage drinking
      laws), and novel or partially tested interventions that warrant further evaluation. Key
      outcomes of interest include alcohol-related harms such as alcohol-related motor vehicle
      crashes and fatalities, heavy/binge drinking, underage drinking, and drinking and driving.

      Multiple years of pre- and post-intervention survey data will be collected from
      cross-sectional samples of adults and youth in each city to assess intervention effects on
      harmful alcohol use. Multiple years of archival data will also be collected from each city to
      assess intervention effects on alcohol-related harms such as motor vehicle crashes and
      fatalities, violence and unintentional injuries. Multi-level analyses will be conducted with
      data for the total sample of 18 cities and for each pair of cities to determine whether the
      overall goal of reducing harmful alcohol use by at least 10% is achieved.
