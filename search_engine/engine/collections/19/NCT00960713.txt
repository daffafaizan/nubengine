      hospitals of the Midi-Pyrénées County (France) is eligible for the study, whatever the dose
      and the number of planned infusions. The enrollment is definitive at the time the first
      rituximab infusion begins. Follow-up visits are planned at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 after
      the first infusion. At each visit, the investigators will record the adverse events that have
      occurred since the last visit. Serious or unexpected adverse events will be systematically
      monitored and declared to the Pharmacovigilance. Imputability will be quoted according to the
      French method. A biological collection will be constituted to allow pharmaco- immunological
      studies.
