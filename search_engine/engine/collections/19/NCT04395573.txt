    
      SpineNav3DTM technology facilitates image interpretation of individual 2D lumbar spine scans
      by automating spinal bone landmark detection and depth measurements and providing a real-time
      assessment of scan plane orientation in 3D.

      All the subjects will have their lumbar area scanned for the measurements of the depth of the
      epidural space (recorded in cm) by two blinded anesthesiologists, one using standard
      ultrasounds and the other the Accuro Device.

      All measurements will be performed either in the sitting or in the supine position at L1/L2,
      L2/L3 and L3/L4 levels. Neuraxial anesthesia will be performed by using the previously marked
      interspace by a blinded anesthesiologist who will measure the epidural space depth during
      epidural or spinal insertion by marking the needle.
