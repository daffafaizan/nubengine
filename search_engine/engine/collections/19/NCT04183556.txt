      our study, in branches such as cardiology, neurology, infertility and chest diseases due to
      its anti-inflammatory, anti-aging properties.

      The data are planned to be evaluated by the researchers using the SPSS(Statistical Package
      for the Social Sciences ) 17.0 program on computer. The responses of all groups to the VAS
      scores are planned to be entered into the system by using the SPSS program before and after
      treatment. statistics (number, percentage, mean, standard deviation), chi-square and logistic
      regression analysis are used to compare categorical variables. Chi-square test and Mann
      Whitney-U test are planned to be used in comparison between groups.When examining the
      difference between the groups, if the p value is less than 0.05, it is planned as a proof of
      significant difference.
