      recurring ulcers after the first ulcer. While treatment of the underlying venous disease,
      depending on the mode of treatment, can lower the recurrence rate in many patients, it does
      not affect recurrence. Aurix is a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel used in the treatment of
      non-healing chronic wounds. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness,
      measured as complete wound healing, in a prospective, randomized trial in which venous leg
      ulcers will be treated using Aurix and standard of care and compared 1:1 to patients
      receiving undefined Usual and Customary Care (UCC).
