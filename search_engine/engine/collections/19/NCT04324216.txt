      is becoming increasingly critical to promote successful aging strategies that are effective,
      easily usable, and acceptable to institutionalized older adults. Although many practitioners
      and professionals have explored aromatherapy and identified its positive psychological
      benefits, the effectiveness of a combination of 3D virtual reality and hands-on aromatherapy
      remains unknown.

      Objectives: A quasi-experimental trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this
      combination in promoting happiness, perceived stress, sleep quality, experience on
      meditation, and life satisfaction among institutionalized older adults in Taiwan.

      Methods: Sixty institutionalized elderly participants underwent the combination program or
      were in a control group. Weekly two-hour sessions were implemented for 9 weeks. The outcome
      variables were happiness perceived, stress, sleep quality, experience on meditation, and life
      satisfaction, which were assessed at baseline, and after the intervention.
