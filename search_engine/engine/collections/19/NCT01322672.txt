      ages. However, over the past several years, concern has been growing that for patients at the
      extremes of age, some anesthetic agents may harbor subtle, previously minimally examined,
      serious neurotoxic effects which can cause lasting decline in the function of the central
      nervous system (CNS). For the elderly, these effects may manifest in lasting post-operative
      deterioration of memory and the capacity for normal information processing that can result in
      the inability to perform the activities of daily living (ADLs) with eventual early demise.
      Unfortunately, even though our ability to evaluate anesthetic risk has grown asymptotically
      for virtually every organ system, the brain remains neglected. And even though we know a good
      deal about effect sites for general anesthetic agents, we still have an incomplete
      understanding of the potential toxic effects of anesthetics on the brain. Therefore,
      employing a human surgical model (endoscopic prostatectomy), we propose a pilot study of 15
      otherwise neurologically intact, ASA I - III, males, 65+ year of age. After pre-enrollment
      screening (MMSE & BDI) and standard pre-op evaluation, subjects will undergo both anatomic
      and functional MRI studies plus a battery of neurocognitive tests (NCT) at two time points
      approximately 2-3 weeks apart prior to surgery. These pre-op studies will establish both a
      "non-surgical control" for the study as well as a baseline for post-op studies. 2-3 weeks
      after surgery, MRI and NCT will be repeated. The study aims to determine if MRI can
      demonstrate changes in the CNS pre-op vs post-op that relate to anesthesia and surgery and
      how those changes might correlate with NCT over the same interval.
