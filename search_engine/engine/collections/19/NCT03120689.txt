      organizations, optimizing learner satisfaction with vaginal surgery learning experiences is
      of paramount importance. Our purpose was to investigate if this unique camera system may have
      advantages in learner satisfaction both in the operating room and in video learning settings,
      therefore increasing the interest of the learner pool in vaginal surgery and optimizing their
      experience. This study has two main, non-dependent aims:

      Aim 1: The investigators aim to perform a randomized, controlled trial that compares a
      vaginally-mounted high-definition telescopic camera system (VITOM®) that can project live
      images in the operating room during vaginal surgery to traditional learner surgery
      observation practices, with the primary outcome of learner satisfaction as measured by
      validated adult learner satisfaction measures.

      Aim 2: The investigators aim to investigate in a randomized, controlled trial whether
      learners watching videos acquired with the VITOM® camera feel the video is more
      learner-friendly and optimal that videos acquired with traditional, tripod-mounted standard
      definition cameras.
