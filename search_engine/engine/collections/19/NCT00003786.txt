      recurrent adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum treated with 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene
      (MGI-114). II. Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.
      III. Study pharmacokinetics of MGI-114 in these patients. IV. Determine the relationship
      between pharmacokinetics of MGI-114 and clinical outcomes including toxicity and response to
      therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive 6-hyroxymethylacylfulvene
      (MGI-114) IV over 5 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses are repeated every 4 weeks. Treatment
      continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxic effects or disease
      progression. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
