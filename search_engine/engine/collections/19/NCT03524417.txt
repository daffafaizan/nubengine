      of post-exposure prophylaxis. RIG should not be given after day 7 following the first rabies
      vaccine dose, because circulating neutralizing antibody will have begun to appear.
      Nevertheless, no study was conducted to evaluate the rabies neutralizing antibody titers
      after RIG injection on day 7.

      The only study that has supported the delay of RIG administration was done in 1996 by our
      institute, of which RIG was given on day 5 with the original Thai Red Cross intradermal
      regimen (2-2-2-0-1-1). The ongoing study would prove the validity of the recommendation and
      eliminate the controversies in clinical practice.
