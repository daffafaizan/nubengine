      gastrointestinal microbiome on the intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). For this purpose,
      investigators are planning to recruit 63 women with a diagnoses of IUGR and 63 pregnant women
      with a normal intrauterine growth.

      Samples will be taken during third trimester (fecal and blood maternal sample), intrapartum
      (maternal blood, umbilical cord blood and placenta tissue sample) and post partum samples
      (meconic and newborn fecal samples at 6 weeks of life).

      Also, obstetric and nutritional information will be registered by means of specific
      questionnaires.

      Fecal samples will be use to study the gastrointestinal microbiome by Next Generation
      Sequencing techniques, whereas inflammatory biomarkers will be determine in plasma samples.
