    
      This is a phase I study of positron emission tomography (PET/CT) with ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C in
      patients with selected solid malignancies (NSCLC, SCLC, SqCCHN, melanoma, merkel cell tumor,
      renal, bladder, hepatocellular, triple negative breast, or gastroesophageal cancer) or
      Hodgkin's lymphoma. Up to 24 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this clinical study.

      This phase 1 study is a dose escalation study of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, optimal time window and protein dose for imaging, biodistribution, radiation
      dosimetry, as well as the ability of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C to detect CD8+ expressing T cells. The
      investigational imaging agent to be administered in this study will be 3.0 (±20%) mCi dose of
      ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C injected intravenously. Up to six cohorts of up to 6 patients each will be
      studied sequentially with dose escalation at 0.2 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 5.0 mg, and 10.0
      mg total protein doses followed by an optimal dose expansion cohort. Safety as well as
      lymphoid visualization (LV) on imaging (i.e. signal in tumor and lymphoid organs including
      spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow) will be evaluated to drive dose
      escalation/de-escalation.

      At least 2 weeks will separate the ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C administration in the first patient and
      subsequent patients of each dose cohort to provide an opportunity to detect any acute
      reaction to the study drug and any adverse events. Tracer administration for subsequent
      patients in each cohort will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours

      Each patient will undergo five (5) post infusion PET/CT scans ( 1 - 2 hours, 6-8 hrs
      (optional), 24 ± 4 hours, 48 ± 4 hours and 92 - 144 hours).

      Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be drawn at the following timepoints: pre-infusion; then
      post-infusion at 5-10 min, 30 (+/-10) min, 60 (+/- 10) min, 120 (+/- 10) min, 240 (+/- 10)
      min, 350-490 (+/- 10) min (optional), 24 hrs (visit 3), 48 hrs (visit 4), 92-144 hrs (visit
      5). The imaging data collected across the dosing cohort and time series of PET/CT scans will
      assess biodistribution, dosimetry, and be used to recommend a protein dose and an optimal
      time window for imaging in future studies
