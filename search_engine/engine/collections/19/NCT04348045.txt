      been controlled using an induction chemotherapy is crucial for two main reasons:

        1. Patients may stop IV toxic chemotherapy while their tumor remains under control.
           Although up to 70% of PDAC patients achieve tumor control when treated during induction
           with mFOLFIRINOX, toxicity of this regimen, particularly neuropathy and fatigue, remains
           a key concern.

        2. Tumor control may be extended, which might improve quality of life (QoL) and survival.

      Patients are included in MAZEPPA study based on the genetic profile of their tumor.

        -  If a BRCA gene mutation is present in the tumor, treatment with the drug olaparib will
           be proposed (arm A), regardless of the status of the other genes analyzed.

        -  In the absence of a mutation in the BRCA gene and in the presence of a mutation in the
           KRAS gene, a treatment combining immunotherapy and targeted therapy (durvalumab and
           selumetinib - Arm B) or chemotherapy by FOLFIRI (arm C) will be proposed.
