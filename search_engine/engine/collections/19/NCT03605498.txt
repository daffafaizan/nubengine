      serial manner in order to detect transmission of pathogenic bacteria. Patient care will not
      change due to their participation in this study; the patients will undergo sedation and
      surgery according to usual practice. This study involves taking microbiology cultures from
      various places in the operating room before and after each procedure. Cultures will also be
      taken from the two patients after they are asleep and from their intravenous tubing. From
      both patients anesthesiologist, surgeon and their surgical team, cRNA, and nursing staff will
      also have cultures obtained. Each cultures will be de-identified and given a study ID number
      before transport to the research laboratory for microbiological assay. The patient's medical
      record will be reviewed for 30 days after surgery to surveil for documentation of a potential
      hospital acquired infection.
