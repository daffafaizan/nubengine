        1. To test the feasibility of low concentration inhalative CO2 gas mixture (5% CO2 + 95%
           air) administration to achieve a desired range of pCO2 of 40-60 mmHg in asphyxiated,
           cooled, mechanically ventilated newborns at risk of hypocapnia with moderate to severe
           hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

        2. To test the safety of CO2 gas mixture (5% CO2 + 95% air) inhalation in asphyxiated,
           cooled, mechanically ventilated newborns at risk of hypocapnia with moderate to severe
           hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

      Term infants (≥ 36 weeks of gestation) will have to be at risk of hypocapnia to be eligible,
      as defined by a temperature corrected pCO2 ≤ 40 mmHg in blood gas analysis, at any time
      within six hours of life.

      The gas mixture will be administered through patient circuits in conventional ventilators.
      Administered CO2 level will be closely monitored at the inhalation circuit (constant 5% = 36
      mmHg). Blood gas samples will be taken hourly to ensure targeted and tolerable pCO2 levels.
