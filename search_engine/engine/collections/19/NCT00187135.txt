        -  To compare 0.5 mg/kg versus 1.0 mg/kg of fentanyl to control pain in patients who have a
           BMT/LPIT procedure in the context of propofol anesthesia and topical anesthesia with
           EMLA or L•M•X 4™cream (or when necessary, lidocaine for injection).

        -  To compare placebo versus fentanyl (0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg) in these same patients. The
           first BMT/LPIT for which patients receive any fentanyl will be used in this comparison.

      The study focusses on the following secondary aims:

        -  To determine which dose regimen ensures best conditions to perform bone marrow
           aspiration (lack of motion) and maintains hemodynamic and respiratory stability as
           indicators of adequate levels of analgesia during bone marrow aspiration.

        -  To evaluate the safety and complications for each dose regimen.
