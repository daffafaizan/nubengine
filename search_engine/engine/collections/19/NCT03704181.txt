      America. The histopathological characteristics of Chagas' disease are the presence of
      myocarditis, destruction of heart fibers, and severe myocardial fibrosis. Colchicine had a
      protective effect on myocardium, indicated by decreased interstitial myocardial fibrosis and
      attenuated myocardial inflammation. It is an inflammatory cause of cardiomyopathy and
      myocardial fibrosis is the hallmark of this disease. Colchicine is a drug used in
      inflammatory diseases, and could also act on myocardial remodeling interfering in the
      synthesis of collagen
