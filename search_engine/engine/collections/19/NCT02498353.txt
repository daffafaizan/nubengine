      group,patients in study group are given the dose of PTV(planned target volume)-CTV(clinical
      target volume) 25Gy/5F with a local boost of PTV-GTV(gross tumour volume) 30Gy/5Fï¼›patients in
      control group are given the dose of PTV-CTV 25Gy/5F without a local boost. The other
      inventions are the same during the whole treatment,after the radiotherapy,they will receive a
      surgery under TME((total mesorectal excision) principal.Comparing the toxicity of
      radiotherapy, R0 resection rate,pathological complete remission rate, complications of
      operation and sphincter retention rate of these two groups to find out weather local boost
