      infusion, once weekly for 2 weeks followed by a rest week (3 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma who are either sorafenib-refractory, sorafenib-intolerant
      despite dose reduction and best supportive care, or for whom neither sorafenib nor other
      suitable therapy is available. During the Phase 1b portion of the study, the highest safe
      dose of DCR-MYC that can be administered will be identified. In addition, the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile, potential pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the preliminary antitumor
      activity of DCR-MYC will be evaluated. During the Phase 2 portion of the study, up to 30
      patients will be treated at the MTD identified in Phase 1b in order to further evaluate
      safety and tolerability, as well as assess the antitumor activity, of DCR-MYC.
