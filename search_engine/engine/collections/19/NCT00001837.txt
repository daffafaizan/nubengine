    
      Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor-modulating agent that has been recently approved
      by the FDA for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal patients. A phase II trial
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of raloxifene in premenopausal patients at high risk for
      developing breast cancer has been recently approved by the IRB (98-C-0123). In this protocol,
      for assessment of the effects of raloxifene on the endometrium and ovaries, patients are
      scheduled to be studied with transvaginal sonography and hysterosonography, once during their
      menstrual cycle at periodic intervals. They are also scheduled to have endometrial biopsies
      as indicated. It is known that all SERMs (clomiphene, tamoxifen and in one small study
      raloxifene) raise the area under the curve of estradiol levels throughout the cycle in
      premenopausal women. Our study is designed to study the reproductive effects of raloxifene in
      these young women with competent ovaries using sonography of the ovaries and endometrium, and
      correlating it with steroid hormone levels which would be obtained under protocol 98-C-0123.
