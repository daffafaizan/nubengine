      prevent healthcare professionals from working while ill. Currently, facilities are asking
      screening questions and measuring temperatures to help identify symptomatic healthcare
      professionals and exclude them from providing patient care. Simulations can be used to inform
      the effectiveness of different screening approaches, but the results of these simulations
      depend upon the effectiveness of the intervention, e.g., the ability to identify healthcare
      professionals on their way to work, or to study the impact of healthcare professionals
      returning to work too early. Thus, simulations must necessarily depend upon realistic disease
      parameters: for example, it is suspected that a non-trivial proportion of patients with
      COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms, but the relative size of the
      asymptomatic subpopulation is unknown.

      The plan for this study is to develop a method for granular measurement of twice-daily
      symptoms from healthcare professionals and other research subjects of similar ages. After
      being diagnosed, the goal is to determine what symptoms participants have and how long they
      have had them. This will be done using a previously-developed bidirectional texting platform
      to query participants about symptoms at least twice a day for ten days post diagnosis.
      Participants will be asked about subjective symptoms, including fevers, chills, cough,
      shortness of breath, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, etc. They will also take their
      temperature twice daily during the recovery period, which will help determine the
      effectiveness of screening based on symptoms and/or thermometer readings.
