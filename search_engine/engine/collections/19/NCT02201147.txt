      biopsy for diminutive polyps when assessed for completeness of resection. However, it is
      expected that cold biopsy polypectomy with advanced endoscopy, such as chromoendoscopy or
      narrow-band imaging endoscopy, increase completeness of resection. One study showed 90% of
      the diminutive polyps were completely resected using cold biopsy polypectomy with
      chromoendoscopy. However, no study compared cold snare polypectomy and cold biopsy
      polypectomy using Narrow-band Imaging endoscopy for Removal of Diminutive Colorectal Polyps.

      The aim of this study is to compare cold snare polypectomy and Cold biopsy Polypectomy Using
      Narrow-band Imaging Endoscopy for Removal of Diminutive Colorectal Polyps
