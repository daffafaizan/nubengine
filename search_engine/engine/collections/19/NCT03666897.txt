      research, which would combine the use of neuroimaging and identify neural repair metabolites.
      The objective and sequential step in fulfilling our long-term goal, is to identify
      differential expression of select stroke plasma biomarkers of neural repair, and image CST
      integrity in patients with good and poor recovery following an ischemic stroke. Diffusion
      tension imaging (DTI), will be used to image the neural repair as it occurs, further
      enhancing our understanding of stroke recovery. There are currently no known plasma
      biomarkers of neural repair. Identification of such biomarkers would be extremely valuable
      for designing stroke recovery drugs and timing rehabilitation therapies.
