      physicians' offices at random to one of two arms: intervention (multi-component academic
      detailing including an interactive, digitized CD-ROM, focused on the discussion of risks and
      benefits, screening options or alternatives, values clarification, and mutual
      decision-making, alongside patient education materials designed for low literacy patients) or
      to a service-as-usual control arm. We will query 200 physicians about their PC knowledge,
      attitudes/beliefs toward screening and screening options, and PSA testing at baseline, 6, and
      12months post-randomization, compared to the rate observed in a service-as-usual control.
      Physician counseling in cancer control will be verified by a chart review at baseline and at
      12months post-randomization (N=750). The instruments will assess prostate cancer knowledge,
      attitudes and beliefs toward screening, and uptake of the PSA. The nested design uses the
      physician's office as the unit of randomization, and the office as the unit of analysis.
