    
      Physicians and nurses will be asked two questions regarding each of their peritoneal dialysis
      patients:

        1. Will the participant be surprised if this patient transfers to hemodialysis in the next
           6 months?

        2. Will the participant be surprised if this patient dies in the next 6 months?

      Patients will be followed for 6 months for outcomes (with two extra months for ascertainment
      of outcomes).
