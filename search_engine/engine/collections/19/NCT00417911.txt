      ASCT prolongs EFS and OS for myeloma patients < 65 years of age. During the period from ASCT
      to progression most myeloma patients experience few symptoms and have a good quality of
      life11. A further prolongation of EFS would be a big step forward in myeloma treatment.
      Bortezomib is a new promising agent, which has shown clear anti-myeloma effect in heavily
      pre-treated patients. After ASCT the tumour cell burden is low and it is the hypothesis of
      this clinical trial that the unique mechanism of action of bortezomib may reduce the number
      of tumour cells even further and by doing so prolong EFS.

      Primary objective:

      * Evaluate the effect on EFS (an event is defined as either progression or death of any cause
      without preceding progression) of consolidation treatment with bortezomib after ASCT compared
      to no consolidation

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Overall survival from ASCT

        -  Overall survival from start of relapse treatment

        -  Time to need for relapse treatment

        -  Response rate in patients not in CR following ASCT

        -  Toxicity from consolidation treatment

        -  Quality of life

        -  Cost utility

        -  Planned subgroup analysis: comparison of primary and secondary endpoint in patients
           receiving one vs. two high dose treatments
