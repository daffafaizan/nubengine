      will be enrolled. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed separately in the section on
      eligibility. The target enrollment population listed in the study design section provides a
      greater than 85% power to achieve the pre-specified goal for the sensitivity and specificity
      of the pre-specified model. Saliva will be collected in vials pre filled with mRNA
      stabilizer. Seven mRNA biomarkers (BRAF, CCNI, EGRF, FGF19, FRS2, GREB1, and LZTS1) will be
      measured in a central laboratory by quantitative PCR with the laboratory personnel blinded to
      the patient diagnosis. The primary outcome is the validation of a pre-specified multi-marker
      model. This pre-specified model incorporates 3 of the cancer genes and the housekeeping gene.
      The model will be validated based on the sum of sensitivity and specificity exceeding 1.3
      with the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval exceeding 1.0. A secondary endpoint is
      the development of new multi-maker models with potential improved performance. These new
      models will be developed by logistic regression and compared with the pre-specified model
      based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the maximum sum of
      sensitivity and specificity. Individual candidate biomarkers will also be validated based on
      a statistically significant up-regulation in cancer patients compared with controls.
      Potential new housekeeping genes will be evaluated based on their equivalence in cancer and
      control as well as their performance in multi-marker models in comparison with the
      pre-specified housekeeping gene which is GADPH..
