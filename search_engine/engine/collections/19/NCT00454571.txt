      I. Determine if pazopanib hydrochloride is able to increase time to progression, as measured
      by prostate-specific antigen (PSA), after 6 months of limited gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      (GnRH) agonist therapy comprising leuprolide acetate or goserelin in patients with
      androgen-sensitive relapsed stage D0 prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the adverse events in patients treated with this regimen. II. To monitor for
      changes in testosterone in relationship to pazopanib therapy versus observation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive androgen blockade comprising GnRH agonist therapy (e.g., leuprolide acetate
      or goserelin acetate) for 6 months. Patients who develop metastases or have PSA progression
      while on GnRH agonist therapy are removed from the study and placed on total androgen
      blockade. The remaining patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo observation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 12
      months.
