      performed. At the same time, an acquisition sequence centered on the quadriceps will follow
      the brain sequences. Up to three brain CT scans coupled with a quadriceps imaging will be
      performed between the day of admission and on the tenth day of hospitalization. An ultrasound
      of the quadriceps will be performed concomitantly. The thickness of the quadriceps is
      measured by an independent operator on CT and ultrasound images.
