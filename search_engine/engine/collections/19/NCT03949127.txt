      femur. This can be painful and is called a femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), and could lead
      to ones cartilage being destroyed and possibly lead to osteoarthritis of the hip. People with
      this deformity in their femur have been found to move their hips differently when doing tasks
      such as walking, squatting or climbing stairs compared to those without this problem. The
      investigators are testing whether exercise that targets this difference in movement can help
      reduce pain, improve function and prevent cartilage damage. There will recruit 84 patients
      with divided into 2 groups. 42 patients will do a 8 week exercise program on strengthening
      muscles responsible for extending the hip and stretching muscles that are associated with
      flexing the hip. The intensity of the program will change with visits to the physiotherapist
      through the course of their exercise program. This research hopes to develop an innovative,
      non-surgical, low-cost, highly feasible and accessible intervention for patients with FAI.
