      the lung. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung
      carcinoma (NSCLC). Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted
      in 1.6 million deaths. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.

      Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive with specific viral
      antigens has proven to be effective. Here, the investigators aim to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of multiple infusions of lung cancer specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes cells in
      patients.
