    
      Healthy Volunteer (HV) Cohort:

      The HV Cohort comprises a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover
      study. Eligible healthy adult and elderly participants will be randomized to treatment
      sequence A, B, or C, each consisting of 3 Treatment Periods, each of one night's duration, in
      which participants will receive a single dose of lemborexant 10 milligrams (mg), or
      lemborexant 25 mg, or placebo. Treatment Periods will be separated by a washout interval of
      at least 14 days. A sufficient number of participants will be randomized to ensure that 8
      evaluable adult participants (<65 years) and 4 evaluable elderly participants (≥65 years)
      complete the study.

      OSA Cohort:

      The OSA Cohort comprises a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      2-period crossover study. Adult and elderly participants with mild OSA will be randomized to
      treatment sequence D or E, each consisting of 2 Treatment Periods, each of 8 nights'
      duration, in which participants will receive lemborexant 10 mg or placebo. The Treatment
      Periods will be separated by a washout interval of at least 14 days. A sufficient number of
      participants will be randomized to ensure that 20 evaluable adult participants (<65 years)
      and 10 evaluable elderly participants (≥65 years) complete the study.
