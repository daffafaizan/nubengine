      increased longevity and changed the nature of risk factors for morbidity and mortality.
      Alcohol consumption has become an increasingly serious health issue among HIV primary care
      patients. Drinking is a key factor in progression to severe liver damage (especially those
      co-infected with hepatitis), and liver disease is now one of the most common causes of death
      among those with HIV. Excess drinking is also associated with medication noncompliance,
      reduces the effect of antiretroviral treatment, and is linked to other health problems.
      Therefore, helping HIV patients reduce unsafe drinking is crucial to their long-term health.
      This study aims to evaluate an evidence-based approach, the Clinician Guide, when combined
      with an innovative smartphone application designed to help users track drinking and ART
      adherence and other aspects of health. An effective, easily implemented alcohol-reduction
      intervention could be incorporated into standard care in HIV clinics to help prevent or slow
      the progress of some medical problems in HIV-infected individuals, improve ART medication
      compliance, prolong lifespan and decrease risk behavior associated with alcohol use.
