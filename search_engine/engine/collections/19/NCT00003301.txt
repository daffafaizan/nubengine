      administered weekly for 4 weeks in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. II. Describe
      the pharmacokinetics of this route of administration, measuring both irinotecan and the
      active metabolite SN-38, and determine the effects of hepatic enzyme inducing drugs, such as
      anticonvulsants, on the pharmacokinetics in these patients. III. Determine preliminary
      response data and activity of irinotecan in this patient population. IV. Correlate response
      with topoisomerase I levels in brain tumor tissue from patients undergoing treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified based on their use/kind of anticonvulsant drugs. This
      stratification yields two arms for this study. Arm I consists of patients who use
      anticonvulsant drugs that induce hepatic metabolic enzymes. Arm II consists of patients who
      use anticonvulsant drugs that cause modest to no induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes or no
      anticonvulsant drug. Three patients in each arm receive irinotecan by 90-minute IV infusions
      every week for 4 weeks, followed by a 2 week rest period. The dose is escalated for the next
      cohort of 3 patients in the absence of unacceptable dose limiting toxicity. The 6 week course
      is repeated until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Once the maximum tolerated
      dose has been established for each arm, additional patients are treated at that dose level.
      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 3 patients will be accrued into the phase I portion of the
      study and a total of 18-35 patients will be accrued into each arm of the phase II portion of
      the study.
