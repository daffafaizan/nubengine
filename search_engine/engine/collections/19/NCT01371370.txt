    
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 12 weeks of low-intensity resistance
      exercise training (LIRET) and diet on arterial function, autonomic function, and body
      composition in obese women with high blood pressure (BP). Specific aims of the study are to:

        -  To evaluate the extent to which diet and LIRET will improve body composition assessed by
           changes in fat mass and lean mass using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and waist
           circumference.

        -  To investigate that combined diet and LIRET are more efficacious than either treatment
           alone in ameliorating cardiovascular disease risk factors by assessing arterial
           stiffness (aortic, systemic, and leg), aortic BP and wave reflection, and autonomic
           function (heart rate variability, vascular sympathetic activity [low-frequency power of
           systolic BP variability], and baroreflex sensitivity). Circulating levels of
           adipocytokines (adiponectin and leptin) and endothelial-derived vasodilators (NO
           metabolites [NOx] and prostacyclin) and vasoconstrictors (endothelin-1 and prostaglandin
           F2Î±) will be assessed as secondary outcome variables.
