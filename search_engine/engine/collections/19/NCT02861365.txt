      congenital heart disease using established cardiac MRI techniques and correlating perfusion
      with clinical outcomes. The investigators objectives are to examine myocardial perfusion both
      during stress and at rest in adults with repaired or palliated congenital heart disease as
      well as quantify ventricular function, regional myocardial strain and evidence of myocardial
      fibrosis with quantitative measures of myocardial perfusion. The specific aim of this study
      is to understand whether clinical subendocardial perfusion defects contribute to the late
      decompensation of adult subjects that have single ventricle physiology and adult subjects
      that have a systemic right ventricle.
