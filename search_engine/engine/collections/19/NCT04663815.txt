      recovery. It is assumed that animal-assisted interventions can have a positive effect on the
      level of stress, but this has not yet been sufficiently researched. This study aims to
      measure a possible effect. Children who are hospitalized will receive an animal-assisted
      activity. A normal afternoon in their hospital room counts as a control activity. The stress
      level is measured through saliva cortisol, blood pressure, heart rhythm variability and a
      visual analogue stress scale.
