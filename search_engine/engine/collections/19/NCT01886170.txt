      that only 25% of patients understand the hemoglobin A1C value (A1C). The A1C is a blood test
      value reflecting average blood sugars over the previous 3 months and is used as both a
      clinical indicator of diabetes control with guideline-set targets and as a communication
      format to express level of disease control to patients.Past work has demonstrated the
      potential effectiveness of translating poorly understood medical values, like the A1C, into
      more universally understood forms. We believe applications can be used to address the problem
      of the poorly understood A1C. This study is two-phase mixed methods approach. We will design
      alternative communication formats to convey the information provided by the A1C to patients
      and evaluate the effectiveness of these formats in improving glycemic control, increasing
      patient understanding of their diabetes control, and altering patient behaviors. In Phase I
      of the study,we will use patient feedback from semi-structured interviews with 17-25 patients
      with diabetes to explore the ways in which patients assess and gauge their diabetes control,
      as well as to elicit patient feedback on promising communication formats. Potential
      alternative communication formats include categories represented by color-based scales
      (red/yellow/green), comparisons to averages or norms, trajectories of control over time and
      modified medical terminology (i.e., changing the name of the test). In phase II, patients
      with poorly controlled diabetes will be randomized to receive information on their glycemic
      control through one of three study arms, A1C (control) or one of two experimental format arms
      (chosen based on phase I results) and the effects of these different communication formats
      will be evaluated.
