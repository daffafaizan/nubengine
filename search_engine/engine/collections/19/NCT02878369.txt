      is not always possible, especially in case of mechanical ventilation, often responsible for
      air interposed between the ultrasound probe and the heart, thus stopping the ultrasound. Use
      the blood pressure increase as a reflection of the increase in cardiac flow induced by fluid
      replacement is not a fully satisfactory alternative since its performance is at best just
      acceptable.

      Flow measurement in the femoral artery could be an attractive alternative to the cardiac
      output measurement as:

        -  It is easy: the femoral vascular ultrasound is booming with resuscitators, including the
           laying of intravascular catheter or thrombosis diagnosis.

        -  It is painless: it is based on the application of the ultrasound probe on the root of
           the thigh for less than 5 minutes.

        -  It is not subject to limitations echogenicity by interposition of air (except in
           exceptional circumstances)

        -  It measures the same physiological parameter (arterial flow) as measuring ultrasound
           cardiac output (based on measurement of the flow at the outflow tract of the left
           ventricle).

      Pathophysiology study, multicenter (conducted in three French ICUs), open, prospective in
      order to evaluate the flow doppler from the femoral artery as a reflection of cardiac flow in
      a vascular fluid test in patient with signs of acute circulatory failure in intensive care
      unit.
