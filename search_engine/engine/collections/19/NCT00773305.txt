      without external beam radiotherapy and/or hormonal therapy will be reviewed and abstracted.
      The abstracted data will include pathology reports including Gleason score and T stage, PSA,
      treatment assignment and dosimetry parameters including dose and percent compliant with
      established criteria based on guidelines established by the American Brachytherapy Society.

      A database will be developed for capture of the abstracted data. Outcomes will be determined
      based on PSA levels at 2 and 5 years after prostate seed implantation. The role of hormonal
      therapy with prostate seed implantation and outcomes will be evaluated. The outcomes will be
      compared to national statistics.
