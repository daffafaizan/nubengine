      surgery is reported to be as high as 100%, while timely Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy
      is effective to treat visual axis opacification (VAO) caused by PCO. Therefore, long-term
      follow-up, timely diagnosis and treatment is important to improve patient's outcome.

      The major and central part of lens is easy to be observed through a dilated pupil.
      Especially, opacification in the lens and/or lens capsule is distinctive showing as "white"
      on the "black" background. The characteristic features of the disease and advances in
      photographic technique with mobile phone make it possible for patients and/or their guardians
      to monitor the progress of cataract or PCO with mobile application in a "self-help" manner
      under non-clinical settings. In this way, patients and/or guardians could adjust the time of
      return to clinical follow-up visit accordingly. Furthermore, standardized and analyzed
      pictures could be sent to clinicians for remote diagnosis when necessary.

      The investigators developed a mobile phone application LenZOC. The investigators aimed to
      assess whether mobile phone application for parents of children with cataracts would improve
      their adherence with follow-up and increase rates of timely detection and management of
      treatable conditions such as posterior capsular opacification (PCO).
