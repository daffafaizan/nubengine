    
      Patients treated with conventional hemodialysis for at least 3 months and interested in
      learning home nocturnal hemodialysis will be screened in the Rockefeller Outpatient Research
      Center. If eligible, during the first 8 day hospital stay, participants will receive a
      standard diet and dialysis treatment nearby at the Rogosin Institute Dialysis Center. During
      the last 2 days, their blood will be frequently sampled for cytokines, fats and sugar.
      Dialysate will also be sampled. They will have the same diet and tests repeated during a
      second admission after either 4 months of conventional dialysis or 1 month training for
      nocturnal dialysis followed by 3 months of home nocturnal dialysis (randomized 1:1). After
      the second admission, patients treated with conventional dialysis will be discharged from the
      study and trained in nocturnal hemodialysis. Off-site computer monitoring will be utilized
      when patients dialyze themselves at home or during the admission in The Rockefeller
      University Hospital.
