      GSK1349572 in seminal fluid, rectal mucosal fluid, and rectal tissue compared to blood plasma
      (BP) in HIV-1 negative males. GSK1349572 is an investigational next generation integrase
      inhibitor currently in Phase III trials. Understanding the concentrations of GSK1349572 in
      multiple male biological compartments will inform its role in preventing HIV infection by
      making an HIV-infected person less likely to transmit the virus, and protecting uninfected
      persons from acquiring the virus.
