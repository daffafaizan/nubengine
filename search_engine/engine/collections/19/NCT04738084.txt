      resilience, insomnia, quality of life, days spent engaging with the program per week and
      hours spent in various program activities per week between those in the MHP group versus WL
      group

      Endpoints*:

      Primary Endpoint: Depressive symptoms and adverse events at 12 weeks

      Secondary Endpoints: Anxiety, worker productivity, burnout, resilience, insomnia, and quality
      of life at 12 weeks; days spent engaging with program per week and hours spent in various
      program activities per week, program satisfaction, therapist rating, system usability scale..

      Description of Study Intervention/Experimental Manipulation: The Meru Health Program (MHP) is
      a 12-week mobile health app delivered via Smartphone that includes components of several
      evidence-based treatments (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Behavioral Activation Therapy,
      Mindfulness Meditation) and also several promising therapies (heart rate
      variability-biofeedback [HRVB], nutritional psychiatry, sleep training) that is overseen by a
      licensed clinical therapist. This study will test the MHP versus a WL control group, of which
      patients enrolled will be offered access to the MHP after 12 weeks in the WL control group,
      to compare groups on depressive symptom outcomes and, secondarily, on other mood and
      behavioral outcomes, engagement, and patient satisfaction outcomes.

      Study Duration*: 1 year
