    
      This is a prospective multicenter study with consecutive eligible subject enrollment at each
      site. Enrollment will include up to 150 subjects (120 ChEVAS subjects and up to 30 infrarenal
      roll-in subjects). The ChEVAS study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness outcomes
      following appropriate government and ethics committee/IRB requirements and guidelines.

      All enrolled (ChEVAS and Infrarenal) patients will undergo a high resolution,
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CT) scan of the relevant aortic and
      aortoiliac vasculature within three months of the scheduled procedure and at specified
      follow-up intervals post-implantation. Follow-up visits will occur at 30-days, 6-months, and
      annually to 5-years to assess aneurysm morphology, the status of the implanted devices, and
      relevant laboratory test results.
