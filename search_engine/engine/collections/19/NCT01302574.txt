      also operate in the gut. It is suggested that open-type enteroendocrine cells directly sense
      nutrient via alpha-gustducin coupled taste receptors to modulate the secretion of glucagon
      like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Several nutrient responsive G-protein coupled
      receptors have been identified in the human gut, including the sweet taste responsive
      T1R2/T1R3 heterodimer, the amino acid/umami responsive T1R1/T1R3 as well as GPR120 for
      unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids. The functional significance of sweet taste receptors
      in mixed liquid meal-stimulated secretion of GLP-1 and PYY will be determined by intragastric
      infusion of a 500 mL mixed liquid meal with or without lactisole (450 ppm)in a double blind,
      2-way crossover trial including 16 healthy subjects.
