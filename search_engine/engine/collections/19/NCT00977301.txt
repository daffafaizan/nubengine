      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). New-onset psychosis is estimated to occur in up to 15% of
      patients infected with HIV while 5 to 7% of patients with HIV-infection suffer from
      pre-existing mental illnesses including schizophrenia. Olanzapine could be an attractive
      antipsychotic in HIV/AIDS patients with schizophrenia.

      Because olanzapine is a substrate for both UGT and CYP1A2, the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine
      might be influenced by low-dose ritonavir in combination with fosamprenavir. The current
      study is designed to test this hypothesis. Furthermore, in this study we evaluate the safety
      of such combination.
