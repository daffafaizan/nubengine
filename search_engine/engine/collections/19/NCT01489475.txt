      child's blood is subjected to hemodilution, hypothermia, nonpulsatile blood flow and exposure
      to foreign and non-endothelialized surfaces. These non-physiologic conditions trigger the
      host's innate systemic inflammatory response which results in capillary leak, increased total
      body water and can lead to end organ dysfunction. Since the early 1990's, modified
      ultrafiltration (MUF) has been shown to decrease excess tissue edema, reduce postoperative
      bleeding, improve cardiac contractility, maintain hemodynamic stability, and decrease
      hospital length of stay. Angiopoietins are a family of vascular growth factors necessary for
      both normal and abnormal blood vessel formation and appear to play a role in capillary leak.
      Though MUF has been shown to improve clinical outcome following CPB, there continues to be
      conflicting reports whether this is a result of the filtration of inflammatory cytokines or
      simply excess fluid removal. Since angiopoietins appear to play a role in both inflammation
      and capillary leak, the investigators aim to determine whether MUF's clinical benefit is also
      secondary to its ability to filter out these molecules, more specifically angiopoietin-2.
