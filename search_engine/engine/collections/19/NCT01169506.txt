      order to assess tissue perfusion. This set up is non-invasive, cheaper than previous
      tonometry devices and easier to apply in clinical routine. We have recruited patients with
      stable COPD and healthy individuals.

      Sublingual tonometry results were evaluated after 15 min of tidal breathing with a capnometer
      for CO2 tension. Corresponding end tidal CO2 (PETCO2)and arterial blood gas values (pH,
      PaCO2, PaCO2) were also investigated.
