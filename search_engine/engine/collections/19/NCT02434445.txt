      development of hepatorenal syndrome in patients with advanced cirrhosis. The biomarkers
      tested include plasma cystatin C, plasma NGAL, plasma NAG, plasma IL-18, plasma ADMA, plasma
      BTP, urinary KIM-1 and urinary LFABP. These biomarkers will be checked in advanced cirrhotic
      patients who have or have not developed hepatorenal syndrome and compared between the two
      groups. These biomarkers will also be correlated with the occurence of hepatorenal syndrome.
