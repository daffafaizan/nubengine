      time that Orthopaedic Surgeons are exposed to while using the mini c-arm fluoroscopy machine.
      The amount of radiation that the Surgeons will be exposed to will be recorded by a ring
      dosimeter located on the Surgeons' hand, and two badge dosimeters (one above the scrub
      collar, and one underneath a lead gown at waist level).
