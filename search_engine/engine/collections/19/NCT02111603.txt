      fecal bile acids and improve bowel function in patients with IBS-diarrhea and Mayo's HPLC
      method can demonstrate a response to the Colesevelam.

      The study design will be a single center, unblinded, single dose trial to study the ability
      to identify the effect of taking 1875 mg (3 tablets [625 mg/tablet]) of Colesevelam orally
      twice daily for ten days on fasting serum 7alphaC4 and total 48 hour fecal bile acid
      excretion. Stool and fasting serum samples will be collected predose and during final 48
      hours' dosing for assessment. Participants will also fill out an 8-day stool diary assessing
      frequency, consistency, ease of passage of bowel movements before and during treatment with
      Colesevelam.
