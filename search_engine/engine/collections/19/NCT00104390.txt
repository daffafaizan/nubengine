    
      Grass MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients
      with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross reacting grass pollens.

      MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A), a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of
      Salmonella minnesota, is included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the
      immunogenic effect of the product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to
      a TH1-like T cell profile.

      The grass pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an
      allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities, is not seen.

      The modification is greater than 75 %, so that only a small amount of unmodified allergen is
      remaining in the product. The purpose of this study is to assess residual allergenicity of
      the modified grass/rye pollen in Grass MATA MPL using skin prick testing.

      In this skin prick test, the following test products will be compared:

        -  7 concentrations of aqueous native allergen

        -  aqueous modified allergen

        -  modified tyrosine adsorbed allergen

        -  Grass MATA MPL (modified tyrosine adsorbed + MPL)
