      exert a number of psychotropic effects and the monoterpenes in particular seem to be
      responsible for the cognitive and mood effects attributed to them.

      The current study aims to investigate the cognitive and mood effects of mint essential oil in
      humans and to ensure the efficacy of the investigational product by conducting in vitro
      analysis on central nervous system receptor binding properties.

      This will be achieved by analysing gamma-Aminobutyric acid A (GABAA), neuronal nicotinic and
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) glutamate receptor binding efficacy,
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
      analysis will quantify % Limonene, % Carvone, % Menthone and % Menthol levels in the
      investigational treatment.

      Cognitive and mood assessment will be via a randomised, placebo controlled, crossover design
      in 24, healthy adults aged between 18-35 yrs which will involve x1 training and x3 testing
      visits to the lab (placebo, 50 (micro Litre) μL and 100 μL Mentha piperita essential oil).
