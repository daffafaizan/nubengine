      Primary

        -  Determine whether very low-dose cytarabine can improve event-free survival (EFS) rates
           in infants with high-risk transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), using high-risk
           TMD patients from clinical trial COG-A2971 for historic comparison, and in infants with
           intermediate-risk TMD, using intermediate-risk TMD patients from clinical trial
           COG-A2971 for historic comparison.

        -  Maintain the current high overall EFS rate in low-risk TMD patients.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, crossover study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease risk (high or intermediate vs low).

        -  Group I (patients with high- or intermediate-risk transient myeloproliferative disorder
           [TMD]): Patients receive very low-dose cytarabine subcutaneously twice daily on days
           1-7. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease or complete or
           hepatic clinical remission undergo observation.

        -  Group II (patients with low-risk TMD): Patients are observed. If symptoms of
           intermediate- or high-risk disease develop, patients may crossover to group I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients will be accrued for this study.
