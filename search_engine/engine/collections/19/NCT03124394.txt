      in quality of life. Cytoreductive surgery with intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS HIPEC)
      offers a small but proven chance for cure. The implementation of a CRS HIPEC and PIPAC
      programme in a Swiss tertiary care hospital is evaluated.

      When a patient is deemed non resectable, pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy
      (PIPAC) administered laparoscopically may confer effective palliation.
