      of the opening excursion at the joints. To investigate this possibility in the face, the
      investigators developed a method of stretching associated with large dynamic jaws during
      chewing using a special device (Spring Device Â®) for ten minutes, allowing the muscles of the
      oral cavity to relax. The height of the bite was set as two-thirds of the maximum opening
      (max. 2 cm.) of the mouth at rest (without forcing) thus avoiding maintaining the head of the
      condyle at maximum aperture for a long time. The subjects were then analyzed by means of
      kinesiography to determine the changes in the vertical dimension. Increasing stretching
      produces neuromuscular relaxation and a reduction of pain. This study showed that this
      therapy induces oral and extraoral pain reduction and increases neck mobility and mouth
      opening. The stimulation of trigeminal receptors is an important drive for therapy in the
      trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR).
