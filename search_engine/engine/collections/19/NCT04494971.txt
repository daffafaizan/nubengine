      smartphone apps that claim to facilitate healthy eating and weight loss incorporate
      evidence-based principles. Such innovations are important as humans fundamentally cannot
      accurately estimate portion size. Indeed, portion size estimation errors account for ~50% of
      the error in self-reported food intake, and data from our laboratory has demonstrated that
      extensive training results in only modest improvements in portion size estimation accuracy
      and that portion size estimates remain inaccurate. Our long-term goal is to create simple and
      accessible interventions that assist individuals with weight control. In particular, we aim
      to provide easy-to-use phone apps that allow participants to monitor the portion sizes of the
      foods they consume. These apps guide participants on appropriate portion sizes and provide
      recommendations of food groups that should be consumed. To that end, we have developed the
      PortionSize app. We propose to improve the accuracy of portion size measurement, as it is
      poorly determined by self-report measures. This will occur via the development of the
      PortionSize smartphone app and this pilot study will test the usability as well as
      preliminary validity and reliability of the app functionality.
