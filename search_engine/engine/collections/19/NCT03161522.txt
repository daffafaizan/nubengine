      I. To evaluate whether esophageal or gastric patients with oligometastatic cancer without
      disease progression after first line chemotherapy therapy will demonstrate improved overall
      survival (OS) with early local therapy (concurrent chemotherapy/radiation and surgery).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the relationships between progression-free survival and overall survival between
      both treatment arms.

      II. Report local control, loco-regional control. III. Report time to progression of distant
      metastases. IV. Report toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive induction chemotherapy for a minimum of 6 cycles and a maximum of 8
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants are then
      randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (MAINTENANCE CHEMOTHERAPY): Participants receive fluorouracil and capecitabine per
      instructions of the treating physician in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP II (LOCAL THERAPY): Participants receive fluorouracil and capecitabine and undergo
      radiation therapy (RT) per instructions of the treating physician in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants may also undergo surgery to some or all of
      the remaining sites of disease as is clinically prudent and indicated by treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 4-8 weeks, 2-3 months,
      every 3-6 months for up to 3 years, and then every 6-12 months thereafter.
