    
      The investigators plan to recruit from approximately 45 male and female University of
      Kentucky Swimmers and Divers, at least 18 years of age in August 2011. Approximately equal
      numbers of men and women will be recruited. The entire athletic team(s) will be recruited.
      With a conservative dropout rate of 30%, the investigators final sample size should be
      approximately 22 participants (per group).Following baseline measures, participants will be
      randomized to one of two groups (Vitamin D 4000 IU or Placebo control) and monitored over the
      course of their athletic season. Measurements will be repeated at Midpoint (3 months) and
      Endpoint (6 months).

      Participants will have no recent history of Vitamin D supplementation beyond what is normally
      found in a multivitamin (400 IUs).

      Following the informed consent process a medical history and Vitamin D questionnaire
      (screenings), and urine pregnancy test (for female athletes) will be administered prior to
      more invasive baseline testing procedures (blood draw and DXA). A blood draw will then be
      conducted at baseline, midpoint and endpoint. Collected blood for the purposes of this study
      will assess Vitamin D status (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium, bone turnover
      markers, and inflammatory cytokines. A Vitamin D lifestyle questionnaire will be administered
      at all 3 time points and incidence of illness and injury will be documented over 6 months
      following randomization. DXA measures will only occur at Baseline and Endpoint.
