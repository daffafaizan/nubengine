      a long tube (inducing CO2 rebreathing) (resulting in a sensation of both increased
      respiratory effort and air hunger). tDCS will be applied during 15 minutes either over the
      motor/premotor or over the insular cortex (i.e. 2 brain regions that have previously been
      shown to be involved in dyspnea perception and/or modulation) in 2 parallel groups of healthy
      subjects. For each study group, the effect of tDCS on dyspnea perception and on respiratory
      parameters will be compared between 2 active (anodal and cathodal) and a sham tDCS
      stimulation (placebo).
