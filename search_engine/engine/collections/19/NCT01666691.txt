    
      This protocol is designed to test the safety and efficacy of a drug called beloranib (ZGN-440
      for injectable suspension). It is to be tested for its ability to reduce weight in obese
      subjects. The study will provide information on how much ZGN-440 gets into the blood, how
      long it stays in the body, and how it affects other biological markers.
