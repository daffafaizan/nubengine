      Study members will be Veterans, over the age of 40, who have been identified as RLS cases as
      part of our larger study of "The Prevalence and Outcomes of Restless Legs Syndrome among
      Veterans." We will use a cross-over design in which Veterans will be randomly assigned to the
      exercise intervention or control. Each arm of the study will be 3 months duration.

      The protocol for the intervention will consist of twice weekly supervised exercise sessions.
      The goal for exercise participants will be to engage in continuous aerobic exercise for 45
      minutes at an intensity of approximately 60% of VO2max. The control will be weekly support
      group meetings.

      Outcomes will be measured using standardized sleep scales, actigraphy, and daily sleep and
      exercise logs.
