      large tertiary care hospital with acute pain (moderate to severe 4-10 NRS scale). Those who
      met inclusion criteria were approached. Informed written consent was obtained from all
      participants. The study was approved by local Institutional Review Board (IRB). Demographics
      (age, gender, ethnicity) were recorded. Baseline pain scores on NRS were obtained prior to
      administration of the drug. Pain scores (NRS) after administration of the drug (intranasal
      ketorolac) were recorded. All adverse events/side effects were recorded. Data was obtained
      for the time the individual patient was in the emergency department being treated.
