    
      This is a pilot study to explore whether High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) aerobic
      exercise can improve performance on hippocampal dependent behaviors or anxiety measures .
      HIIT is a form of interval training that alternates short periods of high effort exercise
      with less intense recovery periods. Participants in this study will undertake a 6-week
      protocol of HIIT exercise, performed at home on a portable stepper device. Outcome measures
      for this study will be performance on two hippocampus-dependent behaviors and responses to
      mood and anxiety questionnaires.

      The hippocampus is a brain structure that is involved in learning and memory, and is one of
      the two sites of adult neurogenesis, the process of generating of new neurons from stem cells
      in the adult mammalian brain. Adult neurogenesis may represent a new target for the treatment
      of anxiety disorders. The tests in this study consist of a picture-based memory task and a
      location memory task. Eligible participants will complete both game tasks. In each test,
      participants will sit in front of a computer and play these games using the computer keyboard
      or a handheld video game controller.
