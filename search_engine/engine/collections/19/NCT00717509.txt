      side effects, which put patients with schizophrenia at risk for cardiovascular morbidity or
      diabetes.

      The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 53.8% of patients who taking clozapine. The high
      interindividual variability in antipsychotic-induced metabolic abnormalities suggests that
      genetic makeup is a possible determinant.

      The genotypes of the multiple gene such as HTR2C, LEP, adrenergic receptor,PPAR,GNB3 are
      suggested to have associations with the metabolic side effects
      (weight,glucose,lipid,BP,metabolic syndrome) in patients using antipsychotics.

      We are going to investigate whether those multiple genetic polymorphisms are associated with
      the metabolic side effects in patients taking clozapine.
