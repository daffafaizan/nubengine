      according to the CTCAE3.0 scoring system. As after 14 days, the activity of Zr89 is low (four
      half-lives of Zr89 is 4 x 3.2 days = 12.8 days), no additional toxic effect is expected.
      Blood sampling will be done weekly (haematology, liver and kidney function).

      When in 0/3 patients a toxicity of grade 3 or more has occurred step 2 is considered safe. If
      in 1/3 patients a grade 3 has occurred, 3 more patients will be included in this step. If
      another grade 3 toxicity occurs in 1/3 patients, the study will be stopped. When at maximum
      1/6 patients experience a grade 3 toxicity, this step will be considered safe. When step 2 is
      considered safe, the study is ended.

      After the injection, visualization of all tumour sites will be analyzed by performing a
      PET-CT scan on day 4, 5 and 6 post injection. An additional scan on day 3 or 7 is optional.*
      At day 5 post injection a perfusion PET-CT will be performed.
