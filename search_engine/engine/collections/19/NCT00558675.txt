      allogeneic immune cells that have been expanded and differentiated ex-vivo. These cells are
      conjugated to monoclonal antibody coated microparticles prior to infusion. The immune cells
      are living CD4+ memory Th1-like T-cells (T-Stim) that are differentiated from precursors
      purified from normal donor blood. AlloStim is a composition of T-Stim cells conjugated to
      paramagnetic epoxy covered microparticles (4.5micron) with covalently bound
      anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (Dynabeads® ClinExVivo™ CD3/CD28) at a 2:1 bead:cell
      ratio. The T-Stim cells are intentionally mismatched to the recipient.

      The graft vs. tumor (GVT) effect that occurs after allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) is
      a curative therapy for advanced hematological malignancy but the clinical application of GVT
      is severely limited by graft vs. host disease (GVHD) toxicity. AlloStim is designed to elicit
      the "mirror" of the GVT/GVHD effects in the host immune system. Rather than trying to
      separate these effects, we have proposed that the effects could remain associated and
      "mirrored" onto the host immune system creating linked host vs. tumor (HVT) and host vs.
      graft (HVG) effects. We hypothesized that allogeneic Th1 memory cells activated at time of
      infusion to produce type 1 cytokines and express CD40L would elicit HVT/HVG "mirror effects"
      in immunocompetent cancer patients.
