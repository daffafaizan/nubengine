      suspected dysfunction of central motor pathways or nerve roots and as a tool to localize and
      characterize suspected corticospinal abnormalities in neurologic disorders and systemic
      disorders with neurological manifestations. The protocol is intended for clinical use.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been used for diagnosis of neurologic disorders since
      1987. The principles of magnetic stimulation and its use for diagnosis are described in
      current textbooks of clinical neurophysiology as a routine procedure and should be included
      in the training program for fellows in clinical neurophysiology and electrodiagnostic
      medicine at NIH.

      The magnetic stimuli are to be given as single or paired pulses at repetition rates less than
      1 per second.
