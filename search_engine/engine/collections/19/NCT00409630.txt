      asthma will receive inhaled fluticasone propionate. Fifteen patients will receive low dose
      inhaled fluticasone 88 mcg twice daily. Fifteen patients will receive inhaled fluticasone 440
      mcg twice daily. The primary outcome will be biochemical markers of bone turnover. These will
      include 1) serum biochemical markers of bone formation [osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) and procollagen I C-terminal propeptide (PICP)] and 2) markers of bone
      resorption, serum collagen type 1 C-Telopeptide (CTx) urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) and
      immunoreactive free deoxypyridinoline (iFDpd)]. Secondary endpoints will include, parathyroid
      hormone (PTH), Urinary Calcium/creatinine, and adverse events.
