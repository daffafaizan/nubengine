    
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Youth presenting to the emergency
      department with an intentional injury (gunshot wound, stab wound, or assault) will be given a
      behavioral assessment. Participants will be categorized according to risk (low, moderate,
      high). Only moderate or high youth will continue in the study and be randomized. Low risk
      youths will receive the medical standard of care and be re-assessed at 18 months.

      Randomization will place participants in one of two arms. Arm 1 will receive the standard of
      care PLUS a brief intervention with AIM outreach workers. Arm 2 will receive standard medical
      care PLUS a brief intervention PLUS case management.

      Every randomized youth will be assessed for risk and protective factors and have have data
      collected at 6-month intervals (0, 6, 12, 18 months).
