      systems, biochemistry markers, ECG, DXA, metabolic/respiratory function, VO2max, muscular
      fitness, lipidomic/inflammatory/oxidative markers and psychological outcomes.

      After baseline testing, participants will be randomly allocated into one group receiving
      standard of care (control group) or a group performing personalized resistance training
      intervention two times a week over a period of 6 weeks. The randomization procedure involves
      a computer-generated block randomization schedule in a ratio of 1:1 stratified by an
      independent person. Following the 8-week intervention period (with a 1-week washout period),
      both groups will complete a series of follow-up tests (as baseline testing). A 12-week
      follow-up experimental day is also planned in order to evaluate physio/psychological changes.
