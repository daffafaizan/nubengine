      concurrent with 3 cycles of 5-FU/Leucovorin) followed by 3 additional cycles of
      5FU/Leucovorin, followed by close follow-up (every 4-6 weeks for one year)has had good
      success in achieving complete clinical response, avoiding surgical intervention. If at
      follow-up remaining disease is found or if there is recurrent disease, surgery can be
      performed.
