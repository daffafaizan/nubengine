    
      The main objective is to study the function of the superior airways (tongue and pharynx) in
      an non invasive way in neuromuscular patients followed in the home ventilation unit of the
      Raymond POINCARE hospital (myopathy, neuropathy, disease of the neuromuscular junction or
      anterior horn) or of Necker Hospital and to detect prematurely the bulbar dysfunction.

      The secondary objectives of this prospective monocentric observational physiopathological
      study are:

        1. to study the correlation between the possible swallowing dysfunction and the anomalies
           of the respiratory parameters

        2. to establish correlations between infraclinical or clinical and presence of
           morphological tongue anomalies detected by magnetic resonance imaging like in acid
           maltase deficiency.

      The maximal tongue strength protrusion will be measured according to a method already used in
      the laboratory to explore sleep apnea syndromes.

      Swallowing will be estimated by a non invasive method already used to highlight swallowing
      disorders in neurological and muscular pathologies This method will be associated with a
      method of recording of thoracic and abdominal movements.

      Data wil be compared to a control database obtained for a previous study
