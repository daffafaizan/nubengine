      and regulate synthesis and release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), upregulate ANP
      receptors on vascular endothelial cells, leading to significant diuresis and natriuresis.
      Adding glucocorticoids to standard care may potentiate the diuretic and natriuretic effects
      of diuretics and improve renal function, thus improve the clinical outcomes.
