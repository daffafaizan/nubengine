      as a pacemaker will have base line white blood cell telomeeres measured at Repeat Diagnostics
      in Vancouver. They will be supplied with a two inch foam mat in the center of which is copper
      screen with one pound of crushed sapphire. The mat looks like a mattreess and is placed on
      top of the regular mattress. Participants are provided with a Tesla coil to be attached to a
      copper wire coming from the copper screen. They will also be provided with a timer so that
      they can set the Tesla coil to be activated for a maximum of 60 minutes while they sleep.

      Telomeres will be measured at the end of each year for 5 years.
