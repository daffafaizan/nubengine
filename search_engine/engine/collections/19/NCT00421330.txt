      benefits and drawbacks of this new technique have been reported. To assess whether the new
      technique is an adequate substitute of conventional AAA repair, a randomised study is
      required. The DREAM trial is a randomised multicenter trial enrolling patients eligible for
      elective treatment of infrarenal AAAs. The primary endpoint is combined operative mortality
      and morbidity. Secondary endpoints and additional assessments include event-free survival,
      quality of life,and costs.
