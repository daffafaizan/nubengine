      diagnostic methods for premature preterm rupture of membranes including the sterile speculum
      exam and the amniodye test as the gold standard.

      The procedure includes the insertion of a swab into the subject's vaginal vault without a
      speculum for one minute. Once the swab is obtained, the treating physician will place the
      swab in a solvent vial for one minute. A developing strip is then placed in a vial and
      allowed to develop for five minutes. The results are read from the developing strip.
      Processing of this swab will be performed without further involvement of the study
      participant. The insertion of the swab is a one time procedure and is the only addition to
      any standard of care that would applied to the patient during their clinical evaluation at
      that time. Given the study group and both pregnant and non-pregnant controls, standard of
      care procedures will include a wide variety of obstetrical and/or gynecological (OB/Gyn)
      procedures including but not limited to a vaginal exams, sterile speculum exams (including
      pap smears), biopsies, and amniocentesis. The swab for the PAMG-1 immunoassay will be
      performed after other evaluations are performed. Medical records of the subject and (if
      applicable) her newborn infant will be reviewed for data pertaining to the study, including,
      but not limited to, maternal and fetal outcomes at the time of enrollment and after delivery
      and history of the present illness requiring an OB/Gyn evaluation. The study participants
      will not be asked to do anything in addition to what is expected for the swab and their
      clinical visit. The PAMG-1 immunoassay will be obtained during the subjects regularly
      scheduled clinic appointment or hospital visit. No follow appointments will be needed.
