      Ventilation may be inefficient or with too high pressures result in stomach inflation and
      aspiration. Studies suggest that with a supraglottic airway device, such as the laryngeal
      tube, a basically skilled rescuer may ventilate more efficient and also safer. No prehospital
      study has been conducted comparing laryngeal tube and bag-valve mask ventilation during CPR.
      This study intends to compare ventilation with laryngeal tube and bag-valve mask performed by
      paramedics during CPR. This study may provide information if paramedics in an emergency
      should ventilate as they do traditionally with bag-valve mask ventilation or if they should
      ventilate with a laryngeal tube.
