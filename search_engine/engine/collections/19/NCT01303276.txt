      Growth Factor (VEGF), which is responsible for the neovascularization and retinal edema
      responsible for interference of normal vision in central retinal vein occlusion. However,
      VEGF has a role in the vasculature as a vasodilator where it alters the expression of tight
      junction proteins and upregulates the release of the vasodilator nitric oxide. Consequently,
      intravitreal ranibizumab injections could result in systemic inhibition of VEGF, leading to
      long-term retinal arteriolar vasoconstriction and potentially adverse cerebrovascular and
      myocardial accidents. Therefore, evaluating retinal blood flow would provide a physiological
      foundation to this concern and provide physicians with valuable information regarding the
      risks of continued ranibizumab therapy.

      Given the role of VEGF as a vasodilator in the vasculature where it works to alter the
      expression of tight junction proteins and the production of vasoactive substances especially
      nitric oxide, inhibiting this molecule with ranibizumab could result in vasoconstriction in
      these vessels. We hypothesize that vasoconstriction and decreased retinal blood flow will be
      observed after an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab for treatment of central retinal vein
      occlusion.
