      that ~40-50% of patients with HF have preserved ejection fraction (EF). Patients with heart
      failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) have normal systolic function, but impaired
      cardiac relaxation. The main causes of HFPEF include left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and
      hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis with a normal EF, coronary artery
      disease and restrictive cardiomyopathies.

      Only a few small clinical trials have tested therapeutic interventions in patients with
      HFPEF, producing either small or negative effects. Relatively few drugs have effects on
      cardiac relaxation and are not candidates for chronic use, as they may have significant side
      effect profiles and/or are inconvenient to administer. Paricalcitol, an FDA-approved
      activated form of vitamin D, has been shown to slow LVH progression and improve parameters
      associated with diastolic function in animal models (see refs). Treatment with paricalcitol
      has also been associated with decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a
      historical cohort study of patients with end-stage renal disease (see refs).

      This is a single-center, single-arm, pilot study in 20 patients with HFPEF and normal renal
      function on stable medical therapy to evaluate the effects of paricalcitol on cardiac
      structure and function.
