      interfere with an individual's thoughts, behavior, mood, and physical health. People who
      suffer from MDD often experience feelings of worthlessness; they may feel hopeless and may be
      unable to cope with problems in their life. In addition, they often experience sleep
      disruption, loss of appetite, and chronic pain.

      The purpose of the study is to compare images taken of the brains of people who are depressed
      and the brains of healthy volunteers. Specifically, we want to see if symptoms of depression
      are related to a decrease in a brain chemical called GABA. We measure the concentration of
      GABA using a brain-scanning device called "magnetic resonance spectroscopy" (or "MRS"), which
      is a type of MRI.

      The study lasts for 14 weeks and involves 8 visits to our MGH clinic in Boston. The first
      visit is the screening visit, which can last up to 3 hours. The rest of the visits are about
      a half hour long and take place every other week. In addition to these 8 visits, there are
      also 2 visits to McLean Hospital Brain Imaging Center for the MRS scans. The first scan takes
      place within a few days after the screening visit, and the second scan will be at the end of
      the 14 weeks. Each scan visit lasts between an hour and a half and two hours. Subjects are
      reimbursed $50 per MRS scan and $25 per visit to McLean to cover travel costs.

      All subjects in this study will receive escitalopram (or Lexapro), which is an antidepressant
      medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Subjects start at 10 mg daily of the
      escitalopram, but may be increased up to 30 mg if the study doctor thinks it is appropriate.
