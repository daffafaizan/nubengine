    
      -  Inclusion of affected subjects with familial history of chronic renal failure, early
           gout ,renal cysts in several hospital in France

        -  Characterization of the phenotype; dosage of the urinary uromodulin in all subjects

        -  Collect DNA samples

        -  Screen for UMO mutations first

        -  Then for REN or TCF2 depending on the phenotype

        -  Validate the use of the dosage of urinary uromodulin for the diagnosis of UMOD
           associated disease.

        -  Identify new genes responsible for hereditary HTIN (Hereditary Tubulointerstitial
           Nephritis).
