      monitoring, using the Cepheid Gene Xpert HIV-1 VL®, to SOC VL monitoring, using the Roche
      AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman system. The trial will be conducted at two sites in Plateau State,
      Nigeria.

      ART-naïve patients initiating ART will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to the SOC VL monitoring
      control arm or the POC VL monitoring arm. VL monitoring will occur according to the current
      Nigerian ART guidelines-recommended algorithm, with the addition of a baseline VL test. For
      the month 6 and 12 visits, patients that are enrolled in the POC VL monitoring arm will be
      provided their VL results. Participants in the SOC arm will receive their Roche VL test
      results after the results become available per SOC protocol. All other aspects of their HIV
      care and treatment will be identical to services that they would normally receive at these
      treatment centers.

      The investigators will follow all patients up through their Month 12 follow-up visit. At
      trial exit, the investigators will ask patients, caregivers of patients under the age of 18
      years, and providers for their participation in surveys on the operational performance and
      acceptability of the POC versus SOC VL monitoring. Following that time point, the patients
      will continue receiving HIV care and treatment utilizing the SOC procedures for the clinic.
