      achieving successful implantation of the embryo. 1/3 of implantation failures are estimated
      to be caused by a problem with the receptivity of the endometrium. In recent years, several
      measurable parameters have been reported to assess endometrial receptivity. However, one
      parameter remains undescribed, the endometrial fluid viscosity.

      It is generally believed that the viscosity change post ovulation is influenced by the luteal
      phase endocrine milieu, and it is possible that the viscosity of the endometrial fluid has an
      impact on implantation.
