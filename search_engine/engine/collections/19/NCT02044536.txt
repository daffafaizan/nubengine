      diseases and screening for the neoplastic lesions. Especially, in Korea where the stomach
      cancer prevalent area, high-quality endoscopic examination is required not to overlook
      pathologic lesions. Endoscopic biopsy is the gold standard for the confirmation of endoscopic
      diagnosis. It is usually decided based on the abnormal morphology of the lesions or color
      change of the mucosa. Diagnostic accuracy is known to be improved by training or using
      optical techniques or chromoendoscopy. With the development of endoscopic imaging
      technologies such as narrow band imaging (NBI), confocal imaging or magnifying techniques,
      the diagnostic accuracy can be enhanced. However, inspection with conventional white light
      endoscopy is still the most prevalent and basic form of screening or surveillance endoscopy.
      Thus, detecting lesions by meticulous inspection and accurate approach by targeted biopsy are
      important for the diagnosis of pathologic lesions. However, the optimal number of biopsy and
      the detection rate of neoplastic lesions are not established. This study aimed at evaluating
      the current practice pattern and effect of training in conventional upper endoscopic biopsy.
