    
      The disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) aim to slow down the disease
      process and consequent damage to central nervous system. This study is an open-label,
      multicentric study planned to assess the tolerability of Rebif New Formulation in an
      Australian clinical setting by the incidence of ISRs. A total of 100 subjects having
      relapsing MS across approximately 20 sites in Australia will be enrolled into the study.
      Subject visits will be scheduled at baseline (month 0) and months 3, 6, 9 and 12 and the data
      related to demographic factors, disease history, quality of life and adverse drug reactions
      (ADRs) will be recorded in the case report form (CRF).

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the tolerability of Rebif New Formulation in an Australian clinical setting by
           the incidence of ISRs

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Observe the number of and reasons for missed injections of Rebif New Formulation at 3,
           6, 9 and 12 months

        -  Assess changes in quality of life [Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life
           Questionaire (MusiQoL)] at 6 and 12 months compared to baseline

        -  Number and type (telephone, face-to-face, written) of interactions with nurse support at
           3, 6, 9 and 12 months.

        -  Assess relapse rate at 12 months

        -  Assess any differences in tolerability of Rebif New Formulation between subjects who
           were treatment na√Øve or on previous MS therapy

        -  Observe the proportion of subjects with dose reductions to 22 mcg as a result of
           tolerability
