      solution. This will be done the night before a routinely scheduled visit to the home dialysis
      clinic. In the clinic the fluid will be drained in usual fashion and the fluid- which would
      otherwise be discarded- will be analyzed as below:

      HPMCs will be isolated as previously described by Kinashi et al. and stored at -80 degrees
      until analysis. Changes in the protein expression of EMT markers such as E-cadherin, alpha
      smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), Snail, and fibronectin in the HPMCs will be evaluated by Western
      blot analysis.
