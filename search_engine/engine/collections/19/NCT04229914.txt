      surface. Balance can be affected due to muscle weakness after stroke, abnormal muscle tone,
      loss of deep sensation and disturbances in vestibular mechanisms. Among all sensorimotor
      results of stroke, it is stated that the balance of postural control has the greatest effect
      on daily living activities and gait. Accurate assessment of balance in stroke patients is
      important in identifying appropriate aids for mobility, choosing an effective treatment
      program, determining safe and unsafe activities, and setting rehabilitation goals. The most
      common risk factor for falls is one of the most important risk factors for stroke. Therefore,
      reliable and accurate measurement of dynamic gait balance is an important issue in stroke
      patients.The 3 m walk-back test is used to assess neuromuscular control, proprioception,
      protective reflexes, fall risk, and balance. In a study of healthy elderly adults, a 3-m
      walk-back test showed better diagnostic accuracy compared to the most commonly used
      measurement methods for falls in the past year. Reliability is extremely important,
      especially for research and clinical applications. In order to assess the risk of falling,
      measurement methods need to be reliable and change accurately over time. 3 m walk back test
      was found to be reliable in healthy elderly individuals. However, there are no studies
      investigating the validity and reliability of this test in stroke patients.
