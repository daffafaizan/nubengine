      of alveolar recruitment, preventing of ateletasis. On the contrary, it has disadvantange of
      intrinsic PEEP, air trapping. There is few study on one lung ventilation in lateral decubitus
      position about this ventilation method. We were going to investigate effecf of this
      ventilation method.
