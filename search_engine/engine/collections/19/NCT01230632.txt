      conceived through ART have different metabolic responses at baseline or in response to high
      fat overfeeding as compared to age and body mass index-matched spontaneously conceived
      controls. Furthermore, the investigators will identify any differences in DNA methylation of
      candidate genes involved in lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and blood, to determine
      whether this is related to adverse outcomes during high fat overfeeding. The results from
      this study will help answer growing questions of the future health of In vitro fertilisation
      (IVF) babies, and may stimulate further research into optimising protocols for ovarian
      stimulation or in-vitro conditions during early blastocyst development.
