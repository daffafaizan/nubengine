      liquid-based cytology specimens from women with normal cytology, low-grade squamous
      intraepithelial lesions (LSILs), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs),
      microinvasions and invasive cervical cancers. Specimens will be tested for HPV DNA using HPV
      blot and type-specific PCR including type 16, 18, 52, 58, 31, 33, 39, 45, 51, 56, 59, 68, 6,
      and 11. Cervical specimens from women with HPV DNA types 16, 18, 52, 58, 31 and 33, which are
      the most prevalent oncogenic types in Taiwan, will be examined for physical status of viral
      DNA tested by real-time PCR and FISH, along with level of expression in mRNA.
