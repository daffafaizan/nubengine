      of older survivors of critical illness. Most adults, including older adults, survive critical
      illness. While recovery with minimal sequelae occurs, a substantial proportion of survivors
      are left with physical disability and cognitive impairment, have an increased risk of death,
      and incur high health care costs after hospital discharge. In prior work the Investigators
      have shown that about 75% of older survivors of respiratory failure are phenotypically frail
      and that these frail ICU survivors have a high burden of uncontrolled symptoms at hospital
      discharge and 1-month later. Moderate to severe post-ICU fatigue is the most prevalent
      symptom and may interfere with functional recovery.

      This study is designed to determine whether consultation with a palliative care team may help
      alleviate any physical symptoms or psychological distress that the patients and their
      caregivers (surrogates) have coming out of the ICU.
