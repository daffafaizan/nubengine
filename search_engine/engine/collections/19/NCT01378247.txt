      to other patients with chronic diseases. Besides, there are still a number of patients who
      misunderstand or have difficulties remembering the counseling they are provided during the
      course of illness. International guidelines recommend that the patient's relatives are
      involved in patient education as well as the treatment. Family interventions might contribute
      to improvement in quality of life, enhanced illness-management and delayed readmission and
      mortality among patients with heart failure. However, up till today, only two observational
      studies have investigated the effect of family intervention on outcomes of treatment for
      heart failure.
