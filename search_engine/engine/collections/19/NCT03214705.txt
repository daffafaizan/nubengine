    
      Cerebral vasospasm is a serious complication of subarachnoid haemorrhage . In the first 2
      weeks of SAH, angiographic vasospasm is seen up to 40-70% of patients and causes ischemic
      deficits in 15-36% of patients.

      The best clinical indicator of significantly reduced brain perfusion (cerebral blood flow
      (CBF)<20 ml per 100 g/min) is the presence of new neurologic deficits. However, clinical
      symptoms may be vague and mimic other conditions in patients with SAH.

      CT Perfusion can be used in the evaluation of patients with possible vasospasm after
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It can thus be used to assess cerebral ischemia and infarction
      as a result of vasospasm after SAH.

      The presence of cerebral vasospasm identified with transcranial Doppler, digital subtraction
      angiography, or CT angiography (CTA) is frequently used to confirm DCI. Presence of
      vasospasm, however, does not prove the presence of ischemia and absence of vasospasm does not
      rule out. Better diagnostic tests in the acute stage of deterioration, possibly caused by
      DCI, are therefore needed. In patients with SAH, CTP has recently been shown to be promising
      for detection of early ischemia.
