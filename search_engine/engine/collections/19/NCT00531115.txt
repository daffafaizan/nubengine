    
      -  This open-label, non-controlled, multicentre, phase II study will recruit 53 elderly
           patients with diagnosis of metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  All patients will receive 4 cycles of treatment with cetuximab plus XELOX followed by
           cetuximab plus capecitabine as maintenance therapy until progression of disease,
           occurrence of unacceptable toxicity to the study drugs, or withdrawal of consent by the
           patient.

        -  The planned duration of a cycle is 3 weeks.

        -  Cetuximab therapy will not be delayed for chemotherapy-related toxicity and vice versa.
           If patients benefit from combination therapy, but develop unacceptable intolerance to
           oxaliplatin and/or capecitabine, cetuximab may be continued in combination with the
           other chemotherapy drug and/or as a single agent. In case of cetuximab intolerance,
           patients should continue with chemotherapy treatment until progression disease.

        -  Evaluations:

             -  Efficacy data (response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response and
                survival) and safety data will be collected. The investigators will assess
                responses to treatment.

             -  When the treatment is stopped either because of disease progression or occurrence
                of unacceptable toxicity, the patients will enter a follow-up period where the
                progression-free survival, the subsequent lines of treatment and the survival data
                will be collected every 12 weeks.
