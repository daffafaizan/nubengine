      diabetes, the changes of the state may affect the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine.
      Besides,the clearance of dexmedetomidine is parallel with liver function and it is excreted
      by kidney, so differences in the obese may be expected.

      About 10 obese patients and 10 matched healthy volunteers with normal weight would be chosen
      to receive a normal dosage of dexmedetomidine. And venous samples will be collected in
      different time points. Next the investigators can get the plasma concentration of
      dexmedetomidine by the use of HPLC-MS. And then the plasma concentration could be analyzed.
