      repair. Although some seromas may not have clinical impact postoperative seroma formation
      often causes pain and discomfort and may even compromise wound healing. Several
      interventional procedures have been investigated to reduce or avoid postoperative seroma
      formation such as removal of the hernia sac, VAC (vacuum-assisted closure) therapy, talcum
      application to the subcutaneous layer, suction etc., but results are conflicting and evidence
      is of poor quality. The use of postoperative abdominal binder is often recommended after
      ventral hernia repair to prevent seroma and diminish pain, but still with no scientific
      evidence. Randomized, controlled, multi-center, investigator-blinded study supplemented with
      blinded statistical analysis (see below). 56 patients (2 x 28, umbi/epi) Due to power
      calculations. An intention to treat analysis is done. Patients are randomized either to
      abdominal binder or no abdominal binder. The abdominal binder is worn from immediately after
      the operation and continuously for 7 days, night and day. The belts are standard elastic
      belts (ostomy belts) from "ETO garmentsÂ©" with standard height of 22 cm. and five different
      sizes in width (S, M, L, XL, XXL- depending on waist measure). A fitting will be done before
      the operation by waist measurement according to the recommendation from the company. Patients
      are followed-up for 30 days with clinical follow-up at day 7 and 30.
