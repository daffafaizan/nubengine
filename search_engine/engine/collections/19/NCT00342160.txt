      (HIV) infection is of great importance for the development of preventive and therapeutic
      strategies. Evidence suggests that a number of host immunologic and virologic factors play
      critical roles in protection against sexually transmitted HIV infection in HIV-discordant
      partners. Among these, the antiviral role of CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals has
      been extensively studied. At least two types of CD8+ T cell-mediated antiviral activities
      have been described in HIV infection. The first is a suppressive activity against HIV
      involving lysis of infected cells in an antigen-specific, HLA-restricted fashion, while the
      second mechanism inhibits viral replication via either cell- or soluble mediated factors in
      the absence of cell killing. It has been demonstrated that cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL)
      are present in both cervical and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a
      subpopulation of highly-HIV-exposed but persistently seronegative individuals. However,
      studies addressing the effect of non-cytotoxic soluble factor-mediated antiviral activity by
      CD8+ T cells in preventing seroconversion in HIV-discordant couples have been lacking. This
      study proposes to examine the role of CD8+ T cell-derived CC-chemokine activities and the
      copy numbers of one of the chemokine genes, CCL3L1, along with other host anti-HIV and
      virologic factors in resistance to HIV infection in persistently seronegative HIV-discordant
      partners of HIV infected individuals.
