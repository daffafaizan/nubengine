    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study that will be conducted at up to 22
      centers in Italy. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to Cypher
      Select-TM Stent or SONIC-TM Stent. Patients will have repeat angiography at 8 months and
      clinical follow-up to 2 years. The study population will consist of 150 patients with single
      chronic total occlusion in a native coronary artery with a reference diameter between 2.75 mm
      and 3.75 mm. The occlusion has to be dilatable by balloon angioplasty and can be fully
      covered by < 2 stents of â‰¤33 mm of length each. The CTO is defined as obstruction of a native
      coronary artery, at least 30 days old, with no luminal continuity and with Thrombolysis in
      Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0 or 1. Following confirmation of eligibility
      criteria and successful pre-dilating of the CTO, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to receive SES CYPHER SELECT Stent or BMS SONIC Stent.

      The coronary angiograms will be assessed at a core laboratory with Quantitative Coronary
      Angiography. Quantitative angiographic parameters including minimal luminal diameter, binary
      restenosis rate, total reocclusion rate, late luminal loss, will be evaluated at 8 months.
      The incidence of clinical events, including death, myocardial infarction, target vessel
      revascularization, stent thrombosis, will be evaluated at 8, 12 and 24 months.
