      breaks. It is the only reliable repair mechanism that can repair the consequences of DNA
      adducts caused by bifunctional alkylating agents (such as cyclophosphamide, thiotepa or
      carboplatin). Alternative DNA repair mechanisms exist, but these unavoidably induce DNA
      mutations, deletions and chromosome aberrations, giving give rise to genetic instability. HRD
      may be a consequence of inactivation of the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genes (as in hereditary breast
      cancer), but it may also be caused by defects in the Fanconi anemia pathway or by
      amplification of the EMSY gene. HRD is present in breast cancer cells but not in healthy
      cells of BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, and also in about half of the sporadic
      triple-negative breast cancers.

      This phase II/III controlled multicenter trial will investigate the ability of individualized
      chemotherapy to improve the objective response rate of 'triple-negative' breast cancer
      (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor-negative, no HER2 amplification) to preoperative
      (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. It will answer the question whether intensified alkylating
      chemotherapy improves the response rate of tumors with a Homologous Recombination Defect
      (HRD) and it will gather data required for the design of a phase III study documenting the
      efficacy of response monitoring by contrast-enhanced MRI in TN breast cancer without HRD.
