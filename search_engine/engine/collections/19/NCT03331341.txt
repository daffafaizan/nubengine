    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the safety of delivering 2 cycles doxorubicin hydrochloride (adriamycin),
      pembrolizumab, vinblastine and dacarbazine (APVD) to patients with previously untreated
      classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)2 negative
      (Deauville score 1-3) rate after 2 cycles of APVD.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV), vinblastine IV, and
      dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 22 of cycle 1 and on day 15 of cycle 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to
      2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then for up to 5
      years.
