      hospitalized patients. The automated electronic alert for AKI may help to improve the
      outcomes of these patients through identifying all cases of AKI early. Therefore, the
      investigators conduct a randomly controlled study to test whether automated electronic alert
      for AKI could improve the outcomes of hospitalized patients.

      The patients were randomly divided into two groups:

      Usual care : patients will receive standard clinical care by the primary physicians AKI alert
      : an AKI alert will be sent to the doctor in charge. The team of kidney experts would give a
      suggestion if the doctor in charge need a renal consultation.
