      cancer treated with neoadjuvant cisplatin/fluorouracil vs. surgery alone.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two groups. The first
      group receives cisplatin and fluorouracil every 4 weeks for 3 courses followed by
      esophagectomy and regional lymphadenectomy. The second group undergoes esophagectomy and
      regional lymphadenectomy alone. All patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be entered over 4 years.
