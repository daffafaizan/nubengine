    
      Akynzeo contains a combination of the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist netupitant and the
      serotonin receptor antagonist palonosetron. Akynzeo is approved as antiemetic prophylaxis in
      patients receiving high emetogenic chemotherapy e.g. high dose cisplatin administered every
      three weeks.

      From a previous clinical trial (GAND-emesis trial) we know that patients receiving
      radiotherapy and concomitant weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 are better protected against nausea
      and vomiting when a triplet antiemetic prophylaxis (neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist,
      serotonin receptor antagonist, and corticosteroid) is applied.

      In the Akynzeo phase III clinical trials, Akynzeo was administered every three weeks. The
      neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, netupitant, has a long plasma half-life (approx. 90 hours),
      and theoretically the drug could accumulate when administered on a weekly basis.

      The DANGER-emesis trial is designed to collect safety and efficacy data in patients receiving
      Akynzeo weekly as antiemetic prophylaxis in combination with dexamethasone in patients
      treated for cervical cancer with radiotherapy and concomitant weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2.
