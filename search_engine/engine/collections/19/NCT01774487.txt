      characterized by bile duct obstruction, live fibrosis, and cirrhosis. BA has no known medical
      treatments. The only proven treatment is a surgical portoenterostomy (the Kasai procedure, or
      KP) which can achieve bile drainage and improve outcomes in some cases. The KPs success is
      variable depending on several factors including age of the infant, experience of the surgeon,
      and extent of liver fibrosis at the time of KP.

      In this study, the investigators conduct a phase II trial of a potential new medical therapy
      for BA: pentoxifylline (PTX). PTX is a methylxanthine derivative closely related to caffeine
      that has been used safely in infants with other diseases such as sepsis. In adults, PTX has
      been shown to have a number of properties beneficial to the liver, including preventing liver
      fibrosis, improving liver regeneration, and reducing cirrhosis-related complications.

      The trial's objective is to determine whether PTX has sufficient biological activity against
      BA to warrant further study. PTX will be administered orally for 90 days as an adjunct to
      standard therapy (i.e. KP if appropriate). The primary outcome will measure the change in
      serum conjugated bilirubin levels after 90 days. Secondary outcomes include changes in body
      weight, serum markers, liver imaging, and time to liver transplant in infants with BA.
