    
      This is a Phase I, open-label study of PLB1001 administered orally to patients with
      PTPRZ1-MET fusion gene positive recurrent high-grade Gliomas. The aim of dose-escalation
      study is to estimate the MTD and to identify the dose-limiting toxicity(DLT) and the
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for PLB1001 single agent as well as to determine the PK/PD
      profile. Aprox. 20 patients will be enrolled in this study.

      PLB1001 is a potent selective c-Met inhibitor. PLB1001 acts on cancer by blocking abnormal
      cMET-mediated signaling (including PTPRZ1-MET fusion gene), leading to profound tumor growth
      inhibition in xenografts of PTPRZ1-MET fusion gene positive glioblastoma tumor.
