      cancer (CRC) with or without liver metastasis, sequenced transcriptomes, performed whole
      exome sequencing, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling for triplets, each
      comprising normal colorectal tissue, primary colorectal carcinoma, and its synchronous
      matched liver metastasis, as well as analyzed genomics of CRC characterized previously by The
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to conduct integrated proteogenomic analyses.
