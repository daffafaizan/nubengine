      a diagnosis of PD. Twenty-nine patients will receive Melatonin and 29 placebo. A blood sample
      will be taken to determine the expression levels of the PER1 and BMAL1 clock genes by a
      real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and as secondary variables, to
      determine the activity of the mitochondrial complex 1, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA)
      and 4-hydroxyalkene (4-HDA) and the production of nitric oxide will be quantified by
      spectrophotometric methods. The SCOPA-Sleep and EPWORTH questionnaires will be applied to
      assess sleep. To evaluate the clinical evolution of PD in each patient, the UPDRS scale will
      be used. It will be given the assigned treatment, with the printed patient code. They will be
      supplemented with 50 mg of Melatonin at a dose of 25 mg orally every 12 hours for 12 months.
      The double-blind of the medication for this study will be maintained by the use of gels
      identical to the Melatonin supplement. The blind's break will only be authorized in case of
      emergency events that require it, and the date, time and reason for the break should be
      noted. It will be given a follow-up diary, and the patient will be explained how they should
      take the treatment and that they should record the date and time of administration, the
      description of adverse events that may occur, raising the patient's awareness that It is
      important to keep the diary and take it at each appointment to assess the attachment to
      treatment. Concerning the medications that patients ingest, before entering the protocol, it
      will be indicated to follow their usual administration. Finally, the patient will be
      instructed to schedule their appointment 3,6, 9 and 12 months later of starting treatment.
