      storage disorder. Afegostat tartrate (also known as AT2101 or isofagomine tartrate) is
      designed to act as a pharmacological chaperone by selectively binding to misfolded
      Î²-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and helping it fold correctly, intended to restore GCase
      activity. The study consisted of a 21-day screening period, a 24-week treatment period, and
      follow-up visit (Day 183, end-of-study). Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of
      2 treatment regimens for afegostat tartrate (3 days on treatment/4 days off or 7 days on
      treatment/7 days off).
