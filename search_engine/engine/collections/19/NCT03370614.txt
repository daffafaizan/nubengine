      help restore homeostasis to the gastrointestinal system targeting a reduction in inflammation
      as an important element in helping to relieve symptoms. One of the most problematic issues
      though is to determine where in the GI tract the inflammation is occurring and then
      evaluating improvements in inflammation as any intervention proceeds.

      Participants will undergo a small battery of diagnostic tests that include magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). A secondary goal of
      this study is to evaluate the utility of FDG PET-MRI for assessing reductions in inflammation
      in patients managed with an integrative medicine approach based upon diet and nutritional
      counselling.
