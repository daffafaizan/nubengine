      risk for developing the disease, will be evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center. Studies will
      include characterizing the disease s clinical and laboratory features, observing the natural
      history of the disease and its complications, evaluating responses to standard treatments.
      Protocol enrollees may be asked to contribute blood and/or urine samples for immunological
      research studies, and/or for studies designed to find parameters that increase a subject s
      risk for diabetes and/or its associated complications.
