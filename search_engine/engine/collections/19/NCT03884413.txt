    
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. With the increase of the survival rates,
      a growing attention is paid to the side effects of the treatments, particularly
      chemotherapy-induced infertility.

      The FEERIC study will give insights into spontaneous fertility outcomes following breast
      cancer in comparison with a control cohort and will provide data to help patients counselling
      towards spontaneous fertility rates following breast cancer. It will also provide data on
      contraceptive prevalence and unintended pregnancy rates in French breast cancer survivors.
      Reasons for unmet need for family planning will be deciphered, in order to point out pitfalls
      (lack of patient's information or orientation/ignorance of contraception methods
      available/topic insufficiently or not discussed with the physician/ lack of family planning
      offer etc…); and target the appropriate actions to lead (oncologist and oncology nurses
      education/ dedicated consultations in breast cancer centers/etc…).
