      diuretics, which remove the extra fluid from the body through urination. Another way to
      remove extra fluid in patients with heart failure is called ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration
      may result in more rapid removal of excess fluid and more rapid improvement in your symptoms
      compared to standard diuretic treatment. Currently, it is unknown what effects these
      therapies (diuretics or ultrafiltration) have on the small blood vessels in your heart. These
      small blood vessels are important to supply blood and oxygen to your failing heart. Thus, the
      purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) of ultrafiltration
      treatment with standard intravenous (in your vein) diuretic therapy on your heart function
      and blood flow.
