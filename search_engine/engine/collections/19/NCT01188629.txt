      what actually takes place in pediatric primary care settings, especially in the areas of
      preventive care. Furthermore, although medication management (safety and effectiveness)
      issues have emerged as an important factor for children, little is known about how medication
      is actually used by families at home.

      With growing use of the electronic health record (EHR) come new opportunities to link
      patient-centered information with clinical health information systems. Linkage of these
      systems has the potential to inform and activate parents, provide much richer data to drive
      decision support at the point-of-care, and to provide ongoing support for long-term behavior
      change following primary care visits. The use of conversational technologies as the
      foundation for the project offers a number of unique advantages especially the support of
      lower-literacy populations and near-universal access. Systems like the Personal Health
      Partner (PHP) represent a model for the future of ambulatory care and the sustainable,
      affordable delivery of higher quality and safer care by primary care clinicians in the
      future.
