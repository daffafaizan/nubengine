      increasing rate of parental resistance in recent years has led to a reemergence of
      vaccine-preventable diseases. This project seeks to determine the effect of a multi-tiered
      school and community-based approach to improving rates of parental intent to vaccinate for
      middle school-aged vaccinations including Human Papillomavirus (HPV), meningitis (MCV) and
      Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (TDap).

      By randomizing participating schools, parents receiving the intervention will participate in
      (1) a community-based event to raise parental awareness of the importance of vaccination and
      (2) a social marketing to target parents' attitudes and knowledge around vaccinations.

      The Investigators hypothesize that participation in this study will increase parental
      intention to vaccinate. In addition, this study intends to improve rates of recommended
      vaccination among middle school-aged children, as measured through vaccine uptake information
      required for annual entry into Pennsylvania public schools.

      The Penn State team brings a breadth of experience in pediatrics, community-engaged research,
      adolescent health, and engagement with schools.
