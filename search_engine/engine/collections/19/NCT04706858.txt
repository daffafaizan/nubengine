      will receive prebiotic supplementation, during comprehensive, longitudinal characterization
      of the microbiota and host changes with clinical markers and multiple omics assays. These
      multiomic data will then be integrated, generating unique biological signatures that define
      the role that microbial metabolites from specific bacteria play in host biological activity.
      Through this study the investigators expect to gain a detailed and clear understanding of the
      physiological changes, at the mechanistic level, that occur in the microbiome and host in
      response to dietary supplementation with prebiotic fiber.
