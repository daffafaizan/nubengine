      in Iraq or Afghanistan who are seen in the TRP at the MEDVAMC. The study consists of two
      parts: PART 1 involves a qualitative investigation of treatment-seeking barriers specific to
      persons who refuse standard treatments and PART 2 is a pilot intervention to treat panic
      symptoms in service members who have co-existing PTSD symptoms. PART 1 will include
      approximately 15 individuals who will be interviewed by a member of the study staff. Patients
      will be interviewed individually following a semi-structured questionnaire designed to help
      identify treatment-seeking barriers. PART 2 will include 8 individuals who will be enrolled
      in an open-trial of a two-day intensive cognitive-behavioral treatment for panic disorder,
      which will occur over the weekend. No participants will be assigned to a control condition.
      All activities related to this project including the interviews and intervention will be
      delivered in either the TRP at the MEDVAMC or at the Houston Center for Quality of Care and
      Utilization Studies (HCQCUS), a nearby facility.
