    
      This non-interventional and prospective study offers elderly people living at home the
      opportunity to host a social telepresence robot, for a period of three months, with the aim
      of maintaining a link with those around them and discovering activities offered by
      professionals (cooking, yoga, visiting virtual museum, etc.) via a networking platform.

      This study consists of questionnaires and score calculations, assessing their feeling of
      loneliness and how they accept the robot in their home.

      Subjects will be interviewed one week before the robot arrives at their home, at the start of
      the study (when the robot arrives).

      The follow-up is carried out by a neuropsychologist at 6, 12 and 24 weeks of presence at
      home.

      Data measuring loneliness and social isolation, memory, patient interaction with the robot,
      their quality of life as well as their emotions will be collected using questionnaires.
