    
      This is a randomized blinded clinical trial. Patients will be randomized into one of two
      groups. One group will receive a volatile anesthetic (sevoflurane)while the other group will
      receive intravenous anesthetics (propofol + remifentanil) for maintenance of General
      Anesthesia.

      The anesthesia team will know the result of randomization at induction. Postoperative data
      will be gathered by research personnel who will be blinded to the anesthetic method used.
      Patients will be blinded to the anesthetic they receive until after the 4-week outcomes are
      collected, when they will have the option to be unblinded.

      Peripheral blood samples will be taken a total of 7 times; pre-induction to anesthesia, 15
      minutes after surgical positioning, after the tumor is extracted, and at 6,12,18, and 24
      hours after emergence from anesthesia.

      Patients will be called for follow up every week for 4 weeks following discharge.
