      Nextra implant is an anatomical 2-piece designed implant with 10Â° angulation with a locking
      fusion mechanism. The self-centering, metaphysis screw design allows a stable and secure
      relationship of the proximal and middle phalanges. The compression with progressive
      tightening approximates the bone surfaces for a controlled fusion.

      Pre-clinical Data:

      The Nextra Implant has been used to create fusions between the proximal and middle phalanges
      of the 2nd, 3rd. or 4th. toe.

      Clinical Experience:

      The NextraTM Implant has been used in humans as an implant to reduce hammertoe and
      contracture deformities.

      2. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to evaluate the post-market safety and
      performance of NextraTM in the reduction of post-operative pain symptoms in hammertoes and
      demonstrate the efficacy of the implant to securely stabilize bone surfaces to be fused as to
      be compared to K-wire fixation.

      3. STUDY DESIGN: General Design: Preoperative and post-operative factors will be assessed in
      the evaluation of efficacy and safety.
