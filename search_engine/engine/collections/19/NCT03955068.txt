    
      Primary Objective is to determine the feasibility (safety and tolerability) of a strict
      classic ketogenic diet among a population of children with recurrent or progressive and
      refractory brain tumors.

      Secondary Objectives are: (1) to determine the objective response rate (complete response +
      partial response) to a strict classic ketogenic diet among children with recurrent or
      progressive and refractory brain tumor; (2) to estimate the time interval to tumor
      progression (Progression-Free Survival), time to treatment failure (Event-Free Survival), and
      time to death (Overall Survival) after initiation of a strict classic ketogenic diet among a
      group of pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive and refractory brain tumors; and
      (3) to describe and characterize tolerability and toxicities from a strict classic ketogenic
      diet among children with recurrent or progressive and refractory brain tumors.

      Exploratory Objective: Identify biomarker correlates, including MR spectroscopy and
      metabolites of tumor response to a strict classic ketogenic diet.
