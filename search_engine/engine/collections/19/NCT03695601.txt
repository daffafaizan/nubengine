      help clinicians to more comprehensively monitor heart transplant recipients for allograft
      rejection. An approach to surveillance using HeartCare provides information from two
      complementary measures; AlloMap is a gene-expression profile based measure of host immune
      activity and risk of acute rejection. AlloSure-Heart monitors graft injury. AlloMap is the
      first FDA cleared test and is the only non-invasive, blood test method recommended in the
      International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines for surveillance
      of heart transplant recipients for rejection. AlloSure-Heart measures donor-derived cell-free
      DNA (dd-cfDNA) to help discriminate acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection
      from no rejection. Patients who receive HeartCare, as part of their post-transplant
      management, will give informed consent for information on their outcomes and other relevant
      clinical information, found in their medical records, to be entered into a SHORE database for
      purposes of the study.
