    
      Sixty-two women in reproductive age, apparently healthy, non-smokers, not consuming special
      diets (vegetarian), not pregnant, not planning conception or not lactating.

      A randomized, controlled, parallel intervention trial with two active groups and one blinded
      control group was carried out for 12 weeks (March to June, 2013). The active food group (n =
      21) consumed folate-rich foods (germinated canned faba beans, cookies, orange juice,
      providing additional 250 μg/d folate); the active folic acid supplement group consumed a
      supplement (n = 19, providing 500 μg/d folic acid); and the control group (n = 22) received
      apple juice containing no folate or folic acid) in addition to the freely chosen diet.

      Fasted venous blood samples were collected at baseline, two months and three months for
      quantification of folate in plasma and erythrocytes and of homocysteine in plasma.
