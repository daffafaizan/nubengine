        -  Determine the feasibility and tolerability of external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy,
           and cisplatin in patients with para-aortic or high common iliac lymph node-positive
           carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

        -  Determine the feasibility and tolerability of this regimen with the addition of
           amifostine in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of these 2 regimens, in terms of improving pelvic and para-aortic
           tumor control and distant metastases, in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Phase I: Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and para-aortic
           region 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients also undergo either intracavitary low-dose
           rate (LDR) brachytherapy in 2 applications beginning within 2 weeks after completion of
           external beam radiotherapy at 2-3 week intervals or 6 fractions of high-dose rate
           intracavitary brachytherapy over 8 weeks beginning as early as week 2 of external beam
           radiotherapy. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour weekly for 6 weeks
           concurrently with external beam radiotherapy and once with LDR brachytherapy. Phase II
           proceeds only if toxicity in phase I is within expected parameters.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and cisplatin as
           in phase I. Patients also receive amifostine subcutaneously daily just before external
           beam radiotherapy and cisplatin. Treatment continues for up to 8 weeks in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months
      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
