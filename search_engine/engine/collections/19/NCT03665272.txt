      deepithelialized gingival grafts placed for non-root coverage gingival augmentation by laser
      Doppler flowmetry Forty patients were assigned to study groups: 1)test : tissue adhesive or
      2) control group: suture. Forty patients completed the study. Blood perfusion in the
      recipient site was measured by laser doppler flowmetry on the day of surgery and at 3 and 7
      days after surgery. Quality of life and pain at recipient sites were also investigated.
