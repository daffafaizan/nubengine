      disorder (OCD), patients will be treated with 1 of 6 conditions (3 active treatments and 3
      control treatments): sertraline alone (SER), OCD-specific Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT),
      both SER and CBT (SER plus CBT), pill placebo (PBO), pill PBO plus Educational Support (ES),
      and SER plus ES.

      One in 200 youth suffers from OCD, yet relatively few receive appropriate treatment. Both CBT
      and medication appear beneficial in controlled studies; however, the relative efficacy of CBT
      and medication, alone and in combination (COMB) is unknown. Thus, well-designed treatment
      outcome studies are necessary to improve care for youth with OCD.

      The experimental design covers 2 phases. Phase I is a 2 (site) x 2 (SER or pill PBO) x 3
      (CBT, ES or non- psychosocial treatment) x 5 (repeated measures) factorial 12-week comparison
      of SER, CBT, COMB and the control conditions. In Phase II, responders advance to a 16-week
      discontinuation study to assess treatment durability. The primary outcome measure is the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Assessments blind to treatment status take place at
      Week 0 (pretreatment); Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 (Phase I treatment); and Weeks 16, 20, 24 and 28
      (Phase II discontinuation). Besides addressing comparative efficacy and durability of the
      specified treatments, the investigators also examine time-action effects, differential
      effects on specific aspects of OCD, including functional impairment, and predictors of
      response to treatment.
