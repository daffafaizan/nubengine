      (subcutaneous heparin) with intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCs) to the use of
      IPCs alone for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after radical prostatectomy
      (RP). Currently, there is no standard practice for VTE prophylaxis after RP with the American
      Urological Association recommending "pharmacological or pneumatic mechanical prophylaxis" for
      high risk patients. Prior studies showed 30% of patients in the United States received no
      perioperative prophylaxis and less than 20% received pharmacologic agents, compared to 98% of
      patients receiving pharmacologic prophylaxis in the United Kingdom. Some urologists prescribe
      patients low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) after discharge for up to 30 days after surgery.
      Additionally, there are no established risks of pharmacologic prophylaxis for RP patients,
      but some urologists express concern about the potential impact of prophylaxis on the rate of
      postoperative lymphoceles or hematomas. At Johns Hopkins, patients do not routinely receive
      pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis in the perioperative setting for RP. Given the lack of standard
      practice and implications for patient safety, the investigators propose a prospective,
      stratified randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of perioperative pharmacologic
      prophylaxis on VTE following RP hypothesizing that it will prevent VTE events without
      significantly impacting the rate of postoperative bleeding or lymphoceles. The potential
      impact of surveillance bias with differential imaging between arms, effect of lymphadenectomy
      (yes/no and number of noted removed) or surgical approach (robotic and open), and differences
      by patients risk (comorbidity and VTE risk based on components of the Caprini score) or
      demographics will be assessed.
