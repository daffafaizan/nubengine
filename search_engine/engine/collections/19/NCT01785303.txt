      with negative cardiovascular consequences and adverse events from excessive daytime
      sleepiness. Insomnia is a frequently co-occurring sleep disorder that adds significant
      morbidity and is a potential barrier to adherence of OSA treatment. It is currently unknown
      if direct treatment of insomnia will enhance outcomes of OSA treatment. The investigators at
      the Rush Sleep Disorders Center have developed an approach that combines CBT for insomnia
      delivered by a psychologist with CPAP therapy managed by a physician. Building upon
      preliminary data collected in the clinic, the investigators seek to test the efficacy and
      mechanisms of this multidisciplinary model against the standard practice of treating OSA
      using CPAP alone.
