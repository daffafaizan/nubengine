    
      This is an open-label, Phase I study of the bioavailability and safety of Berg Pharma
      Molecule 31510 (BPM31510) in healthy subjects dosed 2 or 3 times daily for 4 days, after an
      initial cohort of 6 subjects receiving a single dose (pre-study cohort). The pre-study cohort
      subjects will receive 1600 mg as a single administration. Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will consist
      of 10 patients each. Men and women over the age of 18, and in good general health, will
      undergo Screening and baseline evaluations up to 21 days prior to dosing. The cohorts may be
      enrolled sequentially. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day 0.

      All subjects will self-administer the all Day 1 doses of study drug under supervision of the
      clinic staff. In the pre-study cohort, subjects will be administered a single dose of 1600
      mg. In Cohort 1, doses will be administered two times per day before the morning and evening
      meals with no less than 8 and no more than 10 hours between doses. Immediately after
      administration, subjects will ingest 6 ounces of tap or bottled water. Solid food and drinks,
      other than water should be restricted to 2 hours before and 1 hour after dosing. In Cohort 2
      doses will be administered three times per day before meals, with no less than 4 and no more
      than 6 hours between doses. Immediately after administration, subjects will ingest 6 ounces
      of tap or bottled water. Solid food and drinks, other than water should be restricted to 2
      hours before and 1 hour after dosing. Dosing will continue for an additional 4 days on an
      outpatient basis with the last study dose to be administered at the clinic on Day 5 (only
      morning dose is given on Day 5).

      For the pre-study cohort, subjects will be administered a single dose of 1600 mg before
      breakfast. PK and PD sampling will be performed 30 minutes prior to dosing, and 0.5, 1, 2 and
      4 hours later. Subjects will be evaluated for any untoward signs or symptoms and will be
      discharged. For cohorts 1 and 2, on Days 1, 2,and 5, pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) sampling will be performed 30 minutes prior to the first dose, and 0.5,
      1, 2, and 4 hours after the first dose at all visits for BID and TID (with an additional PK
      draw on Day 1 at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 after the second dose of TID subjects only). Urine for
      PK/PD will be collected pre-dose on Day 1, Day 2, and Day 5. At all visits (on Days 1, 2,and
      at the final dose on Day5), samples will be collected for chemistry, CBC, INR, PT, PTT,
      cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, and vitamin K level. Blood samples for PK/PD will be collected 30
      minutes prior to the last dose (AM) on Day 5 and also at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after dosing.
      Lab samples (chemistry, etc.), as above will also be drawn at the time of the first PK/PD
      draw on Day 5.

      A phone interview will be conducted no fewer than 25 days and no more than 35 days after the
      last dose on Day 5 to collect information on concomitant medications and adverse events
      (AEs).
