      Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, the WHO Director-General
      declared COVID-19 a pandemic1. The first outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China. 2,3 COVID-19
      pandemic has severely affected global health services.4 It is important not to overlook the
      value of some public health preventive interventions which cannot be postponed, such as
      vaccinations.5 As reported by WHO, the disruption of immunization services, even for brief
      periods, will result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals, raising the risks of an
      upsurge in outbreak-prone VPDs.6 The reduction of vaccination coverage could cause an
      increase in morbidity and mortality among children. Consequently, a greater burden could be
      placed on health systems. Examples from previous large epidemics (e.g. diphtheria in the
      former Soviet Union in 1990-1996 and in Venezuela in 2017-2018) show that, when vaccination
      coverage falls or vaccinations are disrupted, cases of infectious diseases that have
      disappeared can quickly re-emerge.7-8 Egypt declared a national state of emergency to control
      COVID-19 pandemic and implemented a stay-at-home order. Such strategies might result in
      decreased accessibility to routine immunization services, leaving children at risk for
      vaccine-preventable diseases and their complications.9 Great efforts are needed for rapid
      catch-up of children not up-to-date with routine vaccines. Parental concerns about
      potentially exposing their children to COVID-19 during vaccination visits might contribute to
      incompalince.10 Reminding parents of the vital need to protect their children against serious
      vaccine-preventable diseases is critical.
