    
      Primary Objective

      -To assess the changes of pulse pressure at 12 weeks

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the changes of pulse pressure at 4, 24 weeks

        -  To assess the changes of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure at each
           visit

        -  Percentage of responder rate* at each visit and time to get normalized BP from
           enrollment

        -  Responder rate at last visit

        -  To assess IIEF-5 (5-item Version of the International Index of Erectile Function) score
           at enrollment and 24 weeks (percentage of patients with ED according to IIEF-5, Changes
           of IIEF-5 domains)

        -  Percentage of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) according to IIEF-5 and changes of
           PP in subgroup (age 65, body mass index (BMI) 23, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,
           benign prostate hypertrophy)

        -  Analysis of correlation between ED and concomitant disease and concomitant medications
           in patients who received Eprosartan

        -  Score changes of Framingham 10-year Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk at 1st visit, 4th
           visit

        -  Percentages of Eprosartan monotherapy and multiple antihypertensive therapies at
           enrollment and last visit

        -  Reason for treatment discontinuation (Inadequate BP control, adverse events, others)

        -  Adverse events

             -  Responder rate: SBP <140mmHg and DBP <90mmHg (SBP <140mmHg and DBP <85mmHg for
                patients with diabetes mellitus)
