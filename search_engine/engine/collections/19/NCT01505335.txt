      is cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT). This technique carries with it some potential
      concerns, including measurements errors, inability to perform intra-operative radiographs
      substantial financial and radiation costs.

      In the present study patients will have a CBCT of the mandible taken. Sites where implants
      will be inserted will be marked on the CBCT, measurements of the distance from bone crest to
      the roof of the inferior alveolar canal (BC-IAC) will be performed.

      During implant surgery the depth of the osteotomy (OD) will be measured using a periodontal
      probe; OD and the distance from the bottom of the osteotomy to the roof of the IAC (residual
      distance - RD) will be measured using a standard JetGuideÂ® device. In addition, standard
      panoramic radiographs will be taken with a surgical gauge in the osteotomy which will enable
      us to measure the RD radiographically.

      The correlation between the radiographic and clinical BC-IAC distance will be the primary
      outcome variable. The same correlation for the RD between the Jetguide readings and the
      linear measurements on the panoramic radiographs will serve as the secondary outcome
      variable.
