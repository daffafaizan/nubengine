      will consist of men (n=20) aged 18-80 years with a BMI between 19.5 and 35 kg/m2 with low
      risk prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen [PSA] < 10ng/ml; Gleason grade 6; T category
      T1 or T2) or intermediate risk prostate cancer patients (PSA 10-20ng/ml; Gleason 7 (including
      selected 4+3 cases that will not be advised for radical prostatectomy; T category T1 or T2)
      who have visible lesions on MRI and have already decided to take up active
      surveillance/monitoring. The investigators chose these inclusion criteria because they
      reflect the population of men on active surveillance that the investigators are currently
      recruiting in the ESCAPE study (Effect of Sulforaphane on Prostate CAncer PrEvention;
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01950143) via the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.
      Volunteers recruited onto this study will be randomly allocated to one of two arms in which
      they will be required to consume one portion of broccoli soup per week, delivering different
      levels of glucoraphanin (SF precursor) in each study arm. This will be part of their normal
      diet for 6 months. The two soups will contain standard broccoli (i), or
      glucoraphanin-enriched broccoli named for the study 'Beneforte extra' (ii). The study will
      involve MRI monitoring at baseline and after 6 months. In addition the investigators will
      collect blood and urine samples at baseline and after 6 months. The volunteers' habitual diet
      and physical activity will also be assessed during the intervention period.
