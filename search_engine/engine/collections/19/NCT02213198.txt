    
      Aim 1: To compare EFC to SC with respect to linkage to TCC services. Hypothesis A: Patients
      referred to EFC will exhibit a significantly greater rate of attendance at their TCC intake
      appointment than SC patients.

      Aim 2: To compare EFC to SC with respect to patient participation in outpatient treatment.

      Hypothesis B: Patients referred to EFC will report significantly greater shared
      decision-making in their TCC prescriber appointments than SC patients.

      Hypothesis C: Patients referred to EFC will exhibit significantly greater attendance at
      post-intake scheduled TCC appointments than SC patients.

      Hypothesis D: Patients referred to EFC will exhibit a significantly greater rate of
      attendance at initial post-TCC scheduled mental health appointments than SC patients.

      Aim 3: To compare Engagement-focused Care (EFC) to Standard Care (SC) with respect to
      patients' long term quality of life.

      Hypothesis E: Patients who receive EFC will exhibit significantly greater quality of life
      than SC patients six months after TCC termination.
