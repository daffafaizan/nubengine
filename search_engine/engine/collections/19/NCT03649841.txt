      ARM I: Patients receive ADT per standard of care. Beginning 2 months after start of ADT,
      patients also receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone per standard of care for at least 6
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive ADT, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone as in Arm I. Beginning 8-10
      weeks after starting ADT and within 1 week of starting abiraterone acetate, patients also
      undergo 3-5 fractions of neutron radiation therapy for 2 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 6 months.
