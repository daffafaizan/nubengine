        1. to determine whether serotonin transporter genotypic or functional differences between
           depressive patients and normal controls were existed.

        2. to determine the relationship between serotonin transporter polymorphisms and serotonin
           transporter functional expression.

        3. to determine whether genomic or functional differences between drug responders and
           nonresponders predict the response of antidepressant
