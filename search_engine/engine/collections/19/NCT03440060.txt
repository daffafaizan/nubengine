      bacterial origin in low respiratory tract infections and sepsis.

      Procalcitonin was shown to be non-inferior to standard guidelines in guiding antibiotic
      therapy during COPD exacerbation, without worsening patients' outcomes, and with a
      significant reduction in antibiotic exposure.

      Its use to guide antibiotic treatment during COPD exacerbation may be more challenging
      because of the frequent colonization of the airways in patients with COPD, and thus it needs
      further evaluation.

      Additionally, until today, no interventional studies evaluating procalcitonin protocol have
      been conducted in ventilated COPD patients.
