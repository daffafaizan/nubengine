    
      The ZRHR-ERS-09-EXT-US study is a 26-week extension of the original study ZRHR-ERS-09-US.

      The subjects in the Full Analysis Set - As Exposed (FAS-EX) included subjects for combined
      analyses from the original six month study (ZRHR-ERS-09-US ) who did not enter the extension
      study (ZRHR-ERS-09-EXT-US).

      This study was conducted as a separate investigation, as a follow-up of the randomized
      exposure period of the original study, extending the exposure from Week 26 (Visit 10 [V10])
      to Week 52 (Visit 16 [V16]), and using the same sites.

      Subjects continued to use the product they were randomized to in the original study
      ZRHR-ERS-09-US (THS 2.2 arm or CC arm).
