      two groups: Group TAP and Group IV. General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg,
      fentanyl 1 mcgr/kg and rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg and maintained with sevoflurane 2% in 40%:60%
      oxygen/air mixture and fentanyl 0,5 mcgr/kg and rocuronium 10 mg, if necessary. Unilateral
      Transversus abdominis plane block was performed with total of 30 ml volume of local
      anesthetic solution (20ml Bupivacaine 0,125% and 10ml Lidocaine 1%) after intubation but
      before surgery to the Group TAP patients. Paracetamol 1 gr, iv was given to the Group IV 20
      minutes before the end of the surgery. Also 100mg Tramadol,iv was administered 20 minutes
      before the end of the surgery to the both groups. Morphine iv patient controlled analgesia
      was applied to both groups. Perioperative fentanyl consumption; postoperative Verbal Analog
      Scale, morphine consumption and additional analgesic drug requirement were determined. Data
      of perioperative complications and adverse effects were also collected. Chi square with Yates
      correction and Mann Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis.
