      ineffective for the majority of smokers. Thus, there is a need to develop and test novel
      medications to assist smokers to quit smoking. This pilot feasibility study examined: (1)
      tolerability and medication adherence, and (2) the effects of donepezil versus placebo on
      smoking behavior and cognitive performance in non-treatment seeking smokers. We predicted
      that 4 weeks of donepezil would improve working memory at the highest task difficulty level
      and sustained attention. Because participants in this study were not trying to quit, change
      in smoking behavior was a secondary outcome.
