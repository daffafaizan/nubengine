      it is the duty of the dentist to inform, guide and maintain patients in order to avoid
      pathological processes that may lead to the loss of the implanted component. The objective of
      the present study will be to evaluate by clinical and radiographic parameters the condition
      of oral implants placed for more than five years. The convenience sample to be included in
      this study will be composed of all individuals who had implants installed at the Dental
      Clinic of the University Santo Amaro, between 2004 and 2010. The following criteria will be
      evaluated: age; sex; presence of systemic disease; area in which the implant was installed;
      implant diameter and height; type of prosthesis installed; presence of bone resorption and
      annual maintenance. The success and survival rate of implants through the following
      parameters: pain; mobility; card index (IP); bleeding rate (IS); probing depth (PS); probing
      bleeding (SS) that will be measured on four faces by implant: mesial, buccal, distal and
      lingual / palatine. For the evaluation of bone loss, a conventional periapical radiograph
      will be performed at the moment of patient recall. Radiographs will be scanned and analyzed
      using Image Tool software to verify and determine the resulting linear distance between the
      implant shoulder and the bone crest. Factors such as smoking, annual maintenance appointments
      will be related to the presence of peri-implantitis.
