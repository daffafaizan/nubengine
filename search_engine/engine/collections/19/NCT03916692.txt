      from 27.5 to 35 kg∙m-2. Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance will be included as long
      as they are not diagnosed with diabetes and their HbA1c is less than 6.5.

      Preliminary Testing: Medical history, weight, height, body composition via dual x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement.

      Protocol: After a 10-hour overnight fast, subjects will complete 3 experimental visits in
      which they will ingest one of three beverages in a randomized order. During experimental
      visits subjects will either be given the following 3 experimental drinks:

        -  Full SP-glucose balance formula (200 kcal)

        -  Energy smart carbohydrate blend (50 g, 200 kcal)

        -  Liquid dextrose solution in the form of TRUTOL ® Glucose Tolerance Test Beverage (50 g,
           200 kcal)
