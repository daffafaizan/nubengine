      kyphosis and lateral displacement of the spine in the frontal plane. Scoliosis is often
      associated with vertebral rotation. Scoliosis is the term used by Hippocrates, which means
      "crooked". Depending on the presence of lateral displacement scoliosis is classified into
      thoracic, lumbar or thoracolumbar. Idiopathic KS in adolescents is characterized by wedging
      of vertebral bodies in X-Ray and cardio-respiratory compromise.

      Scoliosis is clinically diagnosed with 'Adam's test' by observing a posterior rib hump
      towards the convexity of scoliosis while bending forward in standing.

      The severity of scoliosis is quantified by Cobb angle, which is calculated by drawing a line
      parallel to the end plates of the vertebral bodies at the starting and end of scoliotic
      curvature. The Second line is drawn a perpendicular to the first lines, the angle made
      between the intersection second lines is known as Cobb angle.

      Clinical signs and symptoms of scoliosis become evident during the phase of rapid skeletal
      growth in children. The prevalence of scoliosis in the general population ranges from 0.3% to
      15.3%.
