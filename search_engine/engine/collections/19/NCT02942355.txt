      is planned to enroll up to 25 patients in Cohort A (upfront) and 15 patients in Cohort B
      (maintenance). Subjects will be recruited through Levine Cancer Institute locations and
      through referrals. Women of any race or ethnic origin who meet the study criteria may
      participate in this clinical trial. Males will not be eligible for this study. Breast cancer
      in men is rare and the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors in males is limited. Children are not
      included in this clinical trial because the effects of palbociclib are not known in the
      pediatric population, but may be eligible for other pediatric trials.
