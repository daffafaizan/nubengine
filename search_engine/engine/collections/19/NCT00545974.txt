      twice daily versus placebo, at a ratio of 1:1, to receive active drug or placebo. Screening
      and enrollment is planned to last approximately one year. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board,
      consisting of a clinical pharmacist and 3 neurologists will review all AE reports
      approximately every 3 months after study initiation. The DSMB will notify the principal
      investigator, the study sponsor and the CHR if significant concerns are raised by their
      review of the AE data. An interim analysis of efficacy data will be conducted after 50% of
      the targeted enrollment population has completed 26 weeks of drug treatment.

      Including screening and off-drug follow up, each subject will participate in the study for
      approximately 34 weeks.

      The entire study is anticipated to last 86 weeks if enrollment is completed within one year
      of study initiation.

      The targeted enrollment is 140.
