    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), multicenter (when more than one
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), Phase 3 trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of trabectedin as compared to standard doxorubicin in participants
      with advanced TRS. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the 2
      treatment groups, that is, trabectedin or doxorubicin plus ifosfamide group. Participants in
      trabectedin group will receive trabectedin 1.5 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) given as a
      24-hour continuous intravenous infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way
      of a needle) every 3 weeks and in doxorubicin plus ifosfamide group participants will receive
      doxorubicin 60 or 75 mg/m^2 intravenously every 3 weeks followed by ifosfamide 6 to 9 gram
      (g)/m^2 every 3 weeks. Participants in either treatment arm will continue receiving therapy
      in the absence of progressive disease (PD) or intolerable side effects, until the
      participants' consent is withdrawn or the eligibility criteria for continuing treatment are
      no longer fulfilled, or when a concurrent condition precludes continuation of treatment.
      Efficacy will be assessed primarily by evaluating progression-free survival (PFS).
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the trial.
