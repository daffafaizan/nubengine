      of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.(1) . These compounds lead to
      improvement of clinical and laboratory parameters, but their slow onset of action differ them
      from glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents.

      Among rheumatic diseases, the primary role of HCQ is in the management of articular and skin
      manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the treatment of mild to moderately
      active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      It is difficult to carefully evaluate the onslaught of information that has emerged regarding
      potential COVID-19 therapies within a few months' time in early 2020. A brief but detailed
      approach regarding how to evaluate resulting evidence of a study has been presented by F.
      Perry Wilson, MD, MSCE. By using the example of a case series of patients given
      hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, he provides clinicians with a quick review of critical
      analyses.
