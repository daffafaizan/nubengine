      detailed clinical data. All plasma samples were already analyzed by plasma-Seq, an approach,
      which measures copy number from sequence read depth, for a first evaluation of somatic copy
      number alterations (SCNAs). As this project represents a feasibility study, the investigators
      want to evaluate to what extend cis-acting alterations can be determined, i.e. establish the
      corresponding gene expression changes via nucleosome position mapping as previously published
      by our group. The results will be corroborated by analyses of the corresponding primary tumor
      by SCNA-seq and RNA-seq.

      From the 340 plasma samples the investigators selected 59 as representative for being either
      luminal (i.e. those with amplifications at 17q23, 11q13/q14, 8p12, 8q, and gains of 16p and
      1q; n=25), basal (i.e. gains of 8q, 10p, 12p and various amplifications occurring due to the
      high-genomic instability; n=25), and ERBB2/HER2 (i.e. high-level amplification on 17q,
      centered and including the HER2 gene; n=9). These samples will be sequenced with high
      coverage (70x) so that both mutations and nucleosome positions can be extracted from the
      obtained sequences.
