      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and efficacy of CT-011 (pidilizumab)
      in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid) and assess efficacy in terms of overall response
      rate in patients with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21 and pidilizumab intravenously
      (IV) over 2 hours on day 3. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
