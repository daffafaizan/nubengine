      patients with COPD. Thirty patients (70.5 - 8.5 years) with COPD (forced expiratory volume in
      the first second 48.5 - 15.4% of predicted) were randomized into either a physical training
      group involving aerobic treadmill exercise (PTG, n=12) or an exercise plus bilevel
      ventilation group (PTGNIV, n=11) with sessions three times a week for six weeks.
