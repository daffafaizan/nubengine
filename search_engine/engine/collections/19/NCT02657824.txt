      receiving echocardiagraphy by the chief physicians. Measurements were performed before
      echocardiography lab by the physician who conducted the survey in the emergency department.
      In parasternal long axis view mitral valve E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS) M-Mod
      measurements and mitral valve anterior leaflet and septal distance (P-ALSS) B-Mod
      measurements and in apical four chamber view mitral valve anterior leaflet and septal
      distance (A-ALSS) B-Mod measurements and distance between mitral valve anterior and posterior
      leaflets (MVLS) B-Mod measurements were acquired as the minimum distance in diastole. LVEF of
      patients were measured by cardiologist. Correlation of the all values between LVEF and
      sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood probabilities were calculated.
