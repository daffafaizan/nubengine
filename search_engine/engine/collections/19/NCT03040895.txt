      offered to parents and other caregivers. The programme aims to improve parenting practices
      and thereby child development and well-being. The ICDP is designed to influence and improve
      the quality of contact and relation between the caregivers, usually parents, and their
      children through the practical application of eight themes or guidelines for positive
      interaction. ICDP courses are implemented in a group format and include group discussions,
      caregiver assignments, and report back through a sequence of eight meetings. The caregiver
      groups are led by facilitators trained in the ICDP, and with the competence to lead such
      groups.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if ICDP has an effect on caregiver's positive
      involvement and sensitivity to childrens emotions, and on parental self-efficacy. The study
      will also evaluate the effect of ICDP on caregiver-child relationships, and the children's
      development and well-being.

      The study will use a stratified cluster randomized control design, and will be implemented in
      regular clinical practice in Norway.

      More knowledge within this field is important for practitioners as well as policy makers in
      planning preventive interventions for caregivers ant their children.
