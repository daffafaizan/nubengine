      mortality from liver transplant failure in patients aged 65 and over (90-day mortality and 1
      and 3-year survival) will allow better selection. candidates for this age group. In the
      current context of organ shortage, this study should make it possible to reduce the number of
      risky transplants and thus improve the allocation of grafts.Inclusion of patients who meet
      the inclusion criteria will be carried out during their hospitalization in the surgical
      department of the hepato-bilary center.

      Included patients will receive a standardized geriatric assessment in addition to the usual
      assessment for a liver transplant.

      The geriatric assessment will be carried out and conducted as follows: geriatric scores and
      quality of life questionnaires. Two geriatricians will perform the physical examination and
      blindly estimate each other's probability of survival at 90 days using a Likert scale.

      Geriatricians will be blinded to hepatic data (reasons for transplantation). The consultation
      as well as the completion of the questionnaire will be carried out during the
      pre-transplantation assessment.

      Survival and quality of life will be assessed at 3 and 12 months post-transplantaion.
