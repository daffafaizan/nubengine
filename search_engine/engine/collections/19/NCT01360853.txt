    
      This will be a Phase III study with sample size recalculation after 100 events have occurred.
      The study will be open-label, randomized, controlled, multi-center and will be conducted at
      approximately 200 to 300 study sites (60 to 80 study sites in the first portion of the
      trial).

      In the first portion of the study, a total of 150 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
      who have received no prior chemotherapy for this disease will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion
      to 1 of the 2 following treatment regimens:

        -  Arm A: Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle + ON 01910.Na 1800
           mg/m2 via 2 hr continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) infusions administered twice weekly
           for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle (approximately 100 patients)

        -  Arm B: Gemcitabine only, 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle (approximately
           50 patients).

      Patients will be stratified at entry using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
      performance status (ECOG scores of 0 1 vs. ECOG scores of 2; patients with higher scores will
      not be enrolled).

      Patients will remain on study until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever
      comes first. Moreover, after treatment discontinuation for any cause, all patients will be
      followed until death.

      After 150 patients have been enrolled, accrual will pause and patients will be followed until
      100 deaths have occurred. At that time, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will
      oversee a formal interim analysis to compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 groups and
      may recommend early stopping for futility. If the study continues after interim analysis,
      then the randomization scheme will continue up to 364 patients or the newly-calculated sample
      size. The maximum number of enrolled patients will be 650. The number of clinical sites may
      be expanded up to approximately 200 to 300 centers.

      Patients in the gemcitabine-only arm (Arm B) will not be allowed to cross over to the
      combined treatment arm (Arm A). In addition, no palliative radiotherapy will be allowed
      during the trial.

      The primary analysis will compare OS in the ON 01910.Na + gemcitabine arm (Arm A) vs.
      gemcitabine-only arm (Arm B) once an appropriate number of events has been reached. There are
      2 secondary efficacy outcomes: progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response.

      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. Grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities and > Grade 2
      non-hematologic toxicities will be monitored.
