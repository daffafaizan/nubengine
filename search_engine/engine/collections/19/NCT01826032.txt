    
      Patients: We will include consecutive patients with a diagnosis of severe OSA (AHI> 30)
      without significant comorbidities or excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth â‰¤ 12). Patients
      will be randomized to CPAP treatment or conservative treatment.

      Methodology: We will assess at baseline and after 3 months of treatment:

        1. Neuroimaging by MRI

        2. Neurocognitive function with an extensive neuropsychological battery assessing
           principally memory, attention and executive functions (Trail-making test A and B, Rey
           Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit span, Digit symbol),

        3. Biological markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.

      Patients included in the study will be monitored and followed for three months. They will be
      examined at the time of inclusion, after two and six weeks and at the end (12 weeks) for
      clinical monitoring and the evaluation of adaptation to treatment and compliance.
