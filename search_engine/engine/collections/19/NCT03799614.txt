    
      Participation will be completed in one visit at VCU Parkinson's and Movement Disorders
      Center. A baseline Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale
      (MDS-UPDRS) will be taken prior to vibration therapy. The RMBand (experimental device) will
      be placed on the arm of the participant to provide the vibration therapy. The MDS-UPDRS Part
      III will be repeated both during and after the therapy. Participants will be asked to provide
      feedback about the device, the therapy session and how they are feeling.
