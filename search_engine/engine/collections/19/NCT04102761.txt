      response of PRP and BMC for discogenic pain by direct comparison. The investigators propose
      to incorporate a crossover design that compares placebo to two treatment modalities (i.e.
      Neutrophil-Poor PRP [NP-PRP] and BMC).

      If the investigators can demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful
      improvements in study's primary and secondary outcome measures, this study will have
      identified a natural, effective and sustainable treatment for discogenic back pain that
      currently accounts for the highest level of disability in US. This will help guide physicians
      in the choice of care between surgical and conservative treatment options when treating
      patients.
