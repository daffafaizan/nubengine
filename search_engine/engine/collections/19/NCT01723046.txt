      health care and health care workers. The use of robot assisted therapy (RAT) might partly
      solve this problem. Rehabilitation progress highly depends on training intensity and training
      duration, favouring the use of RAT.

      In this pilot study, the clinical effects of using a new upper arm RAT device for upper arm
      rehabilitation in patients with stroke is investigated. Myo-electrical signals will serve as
      input for the device, assisting the user in flexion and extension of the elbow. The device is
      coupled to a virtual environments, creating a stimulating therapy environment.
