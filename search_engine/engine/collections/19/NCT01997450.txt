      seeking care in an outpatient setting for febrile acute respiratory illness. This study will
      begin in the fall of 2013 and will be completed after 4 influenza seasons (i.e.after the
      2016-2017 influenza season). No investigational product will be administered in this study. A
      nasal swab will be obtained and tested for the presence of influenza virus and other viral
      pathogens. This study will be conducted at 4 sites in the United States of America. The
      duration of study participation for each subject is one day.
