      SHC014748M Capsules administered orally at 200 mg.

      For each of 2 study periods, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit on the
      day before dosing and fast overnight (approximately 10 hours). On the morning of dosing for
      each of the 2 study periods, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 200 mg SHC014748M
      Capsules in either the fasted or fed state. Subjects will remain at the clinical research
      unit for at least 72 hours after administration of study drug for collection of serial blood
      samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and safety monitoring.
