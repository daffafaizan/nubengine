      children (Biederman et al, 1997). Although treating children and adolescents with stimulants
      does not appear to increase the risk of substance use disorders (Wilens et al, 2003), little
      is known about the abuse of prescription stimulants in adults with ADHD. A review of the
      literature on the abuse potential of methylphenidate in animals and humans found that
      methylphenidate produced reinforcing, discriminative-stimulus, and subjective effects similar
      to amphetamines or cocaine (Kollins et al, 2001). Although the abuse rates of methylphenidate
      and other stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD have not been empirically
      established, significant concern exists so that regulatory mandates are enforced to control
      distribution, and some physicians may be reluctant to use stimulants in patients with drug
      abuse histories. The introduction of a methylphenidate patch is an important advancement, as
      the patch formulation should increase compliance while minimizing abuse potential, making it
      an attractive treatment option in the large population of individuals who have a history of
      previous drug misuse. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of the
      methylphenidate patch in adult individuals with ADHD who have abused stimulants in the past.
      It is hypothesized that the methylphenidate patch will be efficacious in reducing ADHD
      symptoms in this population.
