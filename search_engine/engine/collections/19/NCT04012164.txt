      ecological pathways facilitating microbial and viral flows between people and selected wild
      and domesticated animals along a gradient of ecological change in a forest-savanna mosaic in
      the Democratic Republic of Congo, an epicenter of zoonotic disease emergence. The
      investigators analyze potential viral and bacterial overlap among humans and animals and
      explain this overlap (or not) through social sciences and ecological analyses of human and
      animal mobilities, practices and contacts. This multi-disciplinary, multi-species
      investigation in an ecotone (a transitional ecological zone linked to zoonotic disease
      emergence) offers a "pre-history" of spillover and emergence, tracing an ecological zeb of
      virome and microbial sharing among humans and animals. It will elucidate why such microbial
      and viral flows occur.

      To conduct this investigation,there are two human sub-studies: the social sciences
      participatory study; and the clinical study. The clinical study will involve 30 human
      subjects from whom blood and stool samples will be collected. The social sciences
      participatory study will involve self-collected activity and animal contact data and oral
      interviews among 60 human subjects.
