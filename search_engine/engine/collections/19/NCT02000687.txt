      sirolimus, tacrolimus, MMF and/or Myfortic®) will be discontinued and they will be monitored
      for 10 years thereafter, for the appearance of allosensitization using panel reactive
      antibody (PRA) levels and monitor the persistence of elevated PRA levels. Primary objective
      is to determine the rate of allosensitization in patients 3 years after failed islet
      transplantation (i.e. stimulated c-peptide <0.3mg/mL) and monitor the persistence of elevated
      PRA levels (≥ 20%) at year 3, 6, and 9. Timing, frequency and level of change in PRA will be
      monitored after all immunosuppression is discontinued.
