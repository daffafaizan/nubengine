      (VEGFR), and its anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The
      investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the maximum
      tolerable daily dose is 850 mg. The hypothesis of this clinical research study is to discover
      if the study drug apatinib can shrink or slow the growth of non-triple-negative breast
      cancer. The safety of apatinib will also be studied. Patients physical state, symptoms,
      changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help
      the research team decide if apatinib is safe and effective in pretreated non-triple-negative
      metastatic breast cancer patients.
