      impaired. Such a deficit in T cell immunity likely represents an important obstacle to tumor
      vaccine therapy in breast cancer patients. In an attempt to enhance T cell immune
      reconstitution, we have administered cryopreserved T cells and interleukin-2 to breast cancer
      patients post-chemotherapy. Initial data from the first 13 patients enrolled on this study
      suggests that the administration of T cells and IL-2 resulted in improved T cell
      reconstitution relative to untreated patients or patients receiving only IL-2. Importantly,
      recipients of the combination of T cells and IL-2 had an enhanced recovery of CD4+CD45RA+ T
      cells; because this T cell subset represents a naive T cell phenotype that generally
      maintains a capacity to respond to antigen, enhanced regeneration of this population may
      result in improved immune function and may allow for a more successful immune response to
      tumor vaccines. It will be important to now evaluate what effect T cell administration alone
      (without IL-2 treatment) has on immune reconstitution post-chemotherapy. Determination of the
      relative benefits of T cell and/or cytokine administration on T cell recovery
      post-chemotherapy may assist in the development of breast cancer vaccine protocols where a T
      cell-mediated immune response may be necessary for optimal response to the vaccine.
