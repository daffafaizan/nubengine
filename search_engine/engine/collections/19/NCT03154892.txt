      frustrated treatment and blindness. It has been confirmed high levels of vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) in NVG. Conbercept is an anti-VEGF agentï¼ŒIts role in regression of other
      neovascular disorders such as wet-type age-related macular degeneration and diabetic
      retinopathy has been described. The intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agent has shown its
      therapeutic potential for the early stage of NVG, but not for the late stage. Intracameral
      injection maybe used as an alternative way for administration. Investigators aim to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of intracameral and intravitreal injection of conbercept for the
      treatment of NVG.
