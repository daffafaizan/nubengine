      U.S., accounting for approximately 40% of all hospital acquired infections. Microorganisms
      can colonize the catheter extraluminally or intraluminally, and are often protected in a
      biofilm environment. Nearly all patients catherized for 30 days or longer will develop
      bacteriuria, or the presence of bacteria in normally sterile urine. Ten to twenty percent of
      these patients will develop a symptomatic CAUTI. In a further 1-4%, the infection will spread
      into the kidneys or bloodstream, leading to potentially lethal bacteremia.

      Currently, there is no bladder irrigation solution that can reduce or eliminate CAUTI. A
      bladder instillation solution that can keep the bladder and catheter substantially free of
      bacteria and biofilm is expected to provide a practical and cost-effective means of
      minimizing CAUTIs.

      NVC-422 is a topical, non-antibiotic, fast acting, broad spectrum anti-microbial, which
      exhibits potential for the rapid decolonization of a range of urologic pathogens, including
      Escherichia Coli (E. coli), Enterococcus spp., P. mirabilis and others. In vitro studies with
      NVC-422 have also shown that it is capable of penetrating a biofilm and effectively killing
      the contained microbes.
