    
      Obese female and male adult patients eligible for laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery
      according to the national Austrian guidelines will be included in this study upon request and
      after patient approval.

      Baseline data collection and quarterly follow up visits are planned to investigate the
      changes in bone mineral density and body composition measured by dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry as well as the evaluation of serum bone turnover markers of bone formation and
      resorption.

      After surgery subjects will be randomized into two groups:

      Daily oral calcium (500mg) and weekly vitamin D3 supplementation (16.000 IU calciferol)or no
      supplementation of calcium and calciferol.

      A sub-study (approximately 15% of study population) with transiliac bone biopsies will also
      be performed to investigate histomorphometric and histologic changes in bone (biopsy baseline
      and after 24 months).

      The planned duration of the study is 24 months for each subject. Serum bone turnover markers
      will be collected every 3 months, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements will be
      performed every 6 months.
