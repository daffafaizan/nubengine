      and girls in urban South Africa.

      The intervention is a refinement of an existing gender-transformative programme that includes
      community mobilisation and advocacy. Called the Sonke CHANGE intervention, it will extend
      beyond a conventional group-based workshop approach to address the multi-level nature of
      violence and create an enabling environment for men to embrace more equitable forms of
      masculinity. Given the strong associations between masculinities and men's use of partner
      violence, now is an opportune moment to test the Sonke CHANGE model to determine its impact
      on men's use of violence.

      The multi-level Sonke intervention will be evaluated using a cluster randomised controlled
      trial design. In a peri-urban setting of Diepsloot, neighbourhood "clusters" (n=18) will be
      randomly assigned to receive the intervention or a wait-list condition. Baseline, 12 month,
      and 24 month measures will assess changes in primary outcomes (men's reported use of intimate
      partner and non-partner violence) and secondary outcomes (severe violence, masculinity norms,
      harmful alcohol use, mental health). Formative qualitative research will explore the
      environmental context of Diepsloot, community views on violence, men's mobility, and their
      experiences of fathering. A longitudinal process evaluation will explore intervention
      delivery, unfolding of the advocacy element of Sonke CHANGE intervention, and potential
      mechanisms to change amongst participants.
