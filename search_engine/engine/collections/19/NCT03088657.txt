      observational prospective cohort study for early-onset mood disorders (major depressive
      disorders, bipolar disorders type 1 and 2) in South Korea. The study subjects consist of two
      populations: 1) patients with mood disorders under 25 years old and 2) patients with mood
      disorders within 2 years of treatment under 35 years old. After successful screening, the
      subjects are evaluated using baseline assessments and serial follow-up assessments at 3-month
      intervals. Between the follow-up assessments, subjects are dictated to check their own daily
      mood status before bedtime using the eMood chart application or a paper mood diary. In
      addition, wearable activity tracker(Fitbit charge series) is applied for data collection such
      as activity, sleep, and heart rate during every moments. At the regular visits every 3
      months, inter-visit assessments are evaluated based on daily mood charts and interviews with
      patients. In addition to the daily mood chart, sleep quality, inter-visit major and minor
      mood episodes, stressful life events, and medical usage pattern with medical expenses are
      also assessed. Genomic DNA from blood is obtained for genomic analyses. From the MDCRC study,
      the clinical course, prognosis, and related factors of early-onset mood disorders can be
      clarified. The MDCRC is also able to facilitate translational research for mood disorders and
      provide a resource for the convergence study of mood disorders.
