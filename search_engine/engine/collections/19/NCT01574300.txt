      efficacy, and significant side effects of chemotherapy, and the need to choose more
      efficacious treatment regimens, and patients most likely to benefit from them, there is a
      need to predict a priori whether an individual patient's tumor will respond to a particular
      therapeutic agent. However, virtually all lung cancer tumor samples available today are from
      resection specimens so direct, intra-patient molecular-clinical therapy correlations are
      impossible.

      Without the critical mass of tissue and data necessary to identify optimal molecular targets
      for lung cancer and drugs active against these targets, new discoveries that offer the only
      hope of long-term survival for many lung cancer patients remain elusive.

      This study facilitates the collection of biospecimens from advanced lung cancer patients and
      routine determination of a panel of documented clinically significant biomarkers. In
      addition, it will centrally integrate and standardize research tissue samples with
      corresponding proteomic, genomic, molecular and clinical data across a multitude of
      institutions and oncology networks
