      which the cells need the hormone estrogen to grow) improves, more treatment decisions are
      being tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup. National medical guidelines now
      include the routine use of tumor profiling tests, like the Prosigna® assay, which look at the
      gene activity of a person's cancer cells to determine the likely outcome or course of a
      disease (prognosis) and predict the benefit of chemotherapy or endocrine therapy after breast
      surgery.

      Currently, the Prosigna® assay (also called PAM-50) is FDA approved as a tool that physicians
      can use to help make decisions about a patient's treatment after their breast surgery. In
      these cases, physicians run this test using tumor tissue from a patient's breast surgery.
      However, the Prosigna® assay is not approved for use preoperatively, or before surgery.

      Previous studies showed that the Prosigna® assay was able to identify tumor types that were
      more likely to benefit from treatment before surgery (whether it's hormonal therapy or
      chemotherapy). In this study, the investigators will use tumor tissue from the participant's
      biopsy to run the Prosigna® assay. The test may give both the participant and the
      investigators more information about the best possible treatment option for the participant
      before surgery.

      This study is being done to determine how Prosigna® assay results may affect the physician's
      choice of treatment before surgery and how well patients understand the test and its
      implications.
