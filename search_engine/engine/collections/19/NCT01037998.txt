    
      Iressa is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).
      It is an orally active agent for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in those who
      have failed a previous platinum-based regimen and taxane treatment. UFUR (Tegafur/Uracil) is
      effective agent against chemo-na√Øve NSCLC. It has anti-angiogenesis effect when used as
      long-term low dose treatment.

      Present phase II randomized clinical trial is designed to answer whether or not adding an
      oral anti-angiogenesis agent (UFUR), that has low toxicity profiles when long term use, to
      EGFR-TKI (Iressa) could increase patients survival and response rate.
