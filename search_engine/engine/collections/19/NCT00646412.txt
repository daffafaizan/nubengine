    
      Primary Objective:

      • first assessment of the safety of applying A-Part® Gel as adhesion prophylaxis after major
      abdominal surgery by specific observation of two major complications of abdominal surgery
      (wound healing impairment, and/or postoperative peritonitis) in comparison to a control
      group.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To further evaluate the safety of A-Part® Gel by comparing the incidences of adverse
           events between the treatment groups (with special attention to anastomosis leakage)

        -  To explore the efficacy of A-Part® Gel in reducing post-surgical adhesions after median
           laparotomy
