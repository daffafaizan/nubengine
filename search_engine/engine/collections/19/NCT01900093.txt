    
      This is an open-label, small, proof-of-concept study examining the safety, tolerability, and
      extent of recovery of a two-week course of subcutaneous Acthar Gel therapy in patients with
      MS relapse who have failed to make a satisfactory recovery after treatment with high dose
      methylprednisolone. Eligible patients will be given 80 units of Acthar for 14 days. Patients
      will be evaluated at baseline, at 1 week of Acthar treatment, at completion of Acthar
      treatment, and 1 week after completion of treatment. For those who do not undergo
      plasmapheresis an additional evaluation will be conducted 2 weeks after completion of
      treatment. Monitoring will include blood pressure determination and blood sugar
      determination.
