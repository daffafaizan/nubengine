      epidural placement by anesthesia residents, particularly when performed in the obese
      population. To the investigators knowledge, however, no studies have evaluated this teaching
      modality for the lumber epidural technique in the lateral position. Formalizing the
      educational process for this less frequently performed, highly technical and critical skill
      may have a profound impact on trainee learning curves, and may enhance the overall success
      and efficiency of epidural placement, quality of analgesia provided, and safety of the
      procedure.
