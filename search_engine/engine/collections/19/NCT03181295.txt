      in Toronto, Canada. The clinic provides over 50,000 patient visits per year and is split into
      four sub-teams for operational purposes. These teams have unique members with no crossover of
      PCPs. Patients typically see their own PCP for planned care visit (e.g., preventative care
      and chronic disease management) but access any PCP available when more acute issues arise.

      The PA surveys are administered via Ocean by CognisantMD. Ocean connects patients, PCPs, and
      researchers using secure surveys on tablets in the FP waiting room and online patient surveys
      that integrate with WCH FP Electronic Medical Records.

      This is a pilot step wedge trial, with graduated, random intervention roll-out across the
      clinical setting in four steps over five time intervals. Eligible patients presenting to the
      clinic during the study period will be allocated to intervention or control depending on
      whether the PCP they have booked to see has had the intervention 'turned-on'. The order
      determining when each PCP and his or her team change from control to intervention is randomly
      assigned. This design was chosen to avoid the risk of intervention contamination and to
      enable logistics of implementation. The teams will receive the control and intervention
      according to the following schedule:

      Time Interval 1: Team A-D Control Time Interval 2: Team A Intervention, Team B-D Control Time
      Interval 3: Team A+B Intervention, Team C+D Control Time Interval 4: Team A-C Intervention,
      Team D Control Time Interval 5: Team A-D Intervention
