      provides a total brachial plexus motor and sensitive blockade while the suprascapular nerve
      block produces only a specific peripheral blockade.

      The interscalene nerve block is the most frequently used anesthesia technique and requires a
      longer learning curve. Complications related to this technique may be more severe and
      frequent in comparison to other regional anesthesia techniques.

      The suprascapular nerve block yields less adverse effects, discomfort and rebound effect as
      this technique does not completely block the upper limb motor function.
