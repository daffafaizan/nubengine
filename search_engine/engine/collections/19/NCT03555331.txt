    
      INSIGHT(NCT01167270) is a randomized, clinical trial evaluating a responsive parenting (RP)
      intervention designed to prevent rapid infant weight gain and childhood obesity among
      first-born infants. RP has been shown to promote a range of adaptive outcomes in children
      including secure attachment, cognitive development, and self-regulation of emotions and
      behavior with the potential for many beneficial effects including obesity prevention.
      INSIGHT's RP intervention is being compared with a home safety control intervention using a
      birth cohort of 279 infants and parents who received four home visits during the first year
      followed by annual clinic visits through age 3 years.

      The study team will now follow the INSIGHT cohort with growth measurements from ages 5-9
      years and with an in-depth assessment of parenting and child behaviors around the time of
      grade school entry at age 6. The study extension is observational and participants will not
      be given any further parenting or safety guidance as described in the initial grant.
