    
      Patients Patients with non-keratinizing NPC T1-2N1M0/T2-3N0M0 (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) are
      randomly assigned to receive CCRT or RT alone. Patients in CCRT group receive cisplatin 100
      mg/mÂ² every 3 weeks for 3 cycles, concurrently with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).
      IMRT is given as 2.0-2.30 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks to
      a total dose of 66 Gy or greater to the primary tumor. Our primary endpoint is failure-free
      survival(FFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free
      survival (LR-FFS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS) rates and toxic effects. All
      efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety
      population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
