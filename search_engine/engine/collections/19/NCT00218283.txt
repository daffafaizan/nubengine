      and cancer. Other long-term effects include tooth abrasion, gum recession, and loss of bone
      in the jaw. Many individuals who use ST recognize the health risks associated with ST, but
      either do not want to quit or feel that it is impossible to quit. For these individuals,
      tobacco reduction may be an important transitional goal, either prior to quitting or as a
      treatment endpoint. The need exists for a program specifically aimed towards reducing, rather
      than quitting, tobacco use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      nicotine gum at reducing ST use, as well as assessing the motivation to either quit or
      sustain lower levels of ST use.

      This 8-week study will enroll frequent users of ST. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive either nicotine lozenge plus behavioral counseling or behavioral counseling alone.
      All participants will be asked to alternate use of their usual ST brand with nicotine lozenge
      or placebo in order to reduce nicotine intake by 50% during the first 4 weeks and by 75% the
      following 4 weeks. Participants will be required to maintain a daily tobacco use diary. Study
      visits will occur once a week. Tobacco levels will be monitored with urine tests, and
      questionnaires will be completed to assess tobacco use. Follow-up evaluations will occur 12
      and 26 weeks following the end of treatment.
