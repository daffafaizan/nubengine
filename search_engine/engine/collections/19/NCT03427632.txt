      lymphoma. Symptoms are caused by pathologic fracture consequences secondary to vertebral
      destruction, development of spinal instability and compression of adjacent neurological
      elements. Nonoperative treatments include radiotherapy, hormone therapy, cytotoxic drugs
      which are effective to halt the osteolytic process and reverse the neurological compromise,
      however; they cannot provide stability or relieve pain or cord compression. Surgical
      management options including vertebrectomy, reconstruction with a cage or PMMA bone cement,
      and stabilization with pedicle screws can restore spinal canal support and neurological
      functions also control pain, however; usually associated with high postoperative morbidity
      and mortality. Also not advisable for multifocal spinal disease. Percutaneous vertebroplasty
      is a new technique to strengthen bone and reduce pain. It is percutaneous, minimally
      invasive, image-guided procedure that involves injection of radio-opaque bone cement into a
      partially collapsed vertebral body, in an effort to provide stability and pain relief. The
      exact mechanism of pain relief remains unclear. Proposed theories include more favourable
      biomechanics after cement strengthening, chemical toxicity and exothermic effect of cement
      polymerization on nerve endings.
