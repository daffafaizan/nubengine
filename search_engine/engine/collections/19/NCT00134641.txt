      week with no chemotherapy (1 cycle equals 21 days). Gemcitabine and vinorelbine will be
      administered on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle.

      Blood tests will be performed on each day chemotherapy is administered. A CT scan will be
      done after every 2 cycles (approximately every 6 weeks) to determine the effects of the
      chemotherapy on the sarcoma.

      A physical exam will be performed at the start of chemotherapy and at least every three weeks
      thereafter.

      Patients will remain on this study as long as the disease does not progress or there are no
      unacceptable side effects.
