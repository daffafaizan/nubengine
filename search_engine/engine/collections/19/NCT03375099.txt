      the general population and the active duty component of the United States military. The
      prototypical National Guard suicide decedent appears to be a young male firearm owner not
      currently deployed who dies using his own gun. Prior research within the military has
      revealed that soldiers are unlikely to seek out or engage in mental health services. In sum,
      current best practices in suicide risk assessment are poorly equipped to identify the
      individuals most likely to die by suicide. This study aims to examine the acceptability,
      feasibility, and utility of a single lethal means counseling session as part of a suicide
      prevention approach targeting demographic groups overrepresented in National Guard firearm
      suicides. The study will utilize a 2x2 Factorial Design: Intervention (Lethal Means
      Counseling, Health and Stress Control) X Gun-Lock (Provided, Not Provided). Participants will
      be 232 firearm owning National Guard personnel. Lethal Means Counseling comprises education
      on risk factors for suicide, information on preventative resources, and encouragement to
      store guns safely and to temporarily remove guns during high risk periods. The Health and
      Stress Program is designed to control for effects of general mental and physical health
      education in the active condition. Each condition utilizes a motivational interviewing
      framework. The overarching goal of each hypothesis is to examine the extent to which gun
      owning young male National Guard personnel at varying levels of suicide risk are willing to
      engage in safety planning and find means safety approaches acceptable
