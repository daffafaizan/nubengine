      [eGFR] < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) and hyperkalemia (two potassium measurements of 5.1 to < 6.5
      mEq/L performed on separate days) will be enrolled in this open-label, multiple-dose, Phase 2
      study. The study will include two treatment phases: Pharmacodynamic (PD; drug effect on
      potassium) / Dose Finding Phase consisting of the initial 14-day dose finding period followed
