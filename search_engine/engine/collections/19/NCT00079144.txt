      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma treated
           with a lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative preparative chemotherapy regimen followed
           by autologous lymphocyte infusion, ESO-1 peptide vaccination comprising ESO-1:157-165
           (165V) and Montanide ISA-51, and interleukin-2.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the survival of the infused lymphocytes in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the long-term immune status of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of lymphocyte infusion (ESO-1-reactive
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TIL] vs ESO-1 reactive peripheral blood lymphocytes [PBL]).

        -  Autologous lymphocyte collection and expansion: Autologous PBL or TIL are collected from
           patients during leukapheresis or biopsy. The cells are sensitized in vitro with
           ESO-1:157-165 (165V) melanoma antigen and expanded.

        -  Lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative preparative chemotherapy: Patients receive
           lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative preparative chemotherapy comprising
           cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV over 15-30 minutes
           on days -5 to -1.

        -  Autologous lymphocyte infusion: Autologous PBL or TIL are reinfused on day 0*. Patients
           also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 1 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  ESO-1 peptide vaccination: Patients receive ESO-1 peptide vaccination comprising
           ESO-1:157-165 (165V) peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 SC on days 0*-4, 11, 18, and
           25.

        -  Interleukin therapy: Patients receive interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes 3 times daily on
           days 0*-4.

      NOTE: *Day 0 is 1-4 days after the last dose of fludarabine.

      Patients achieving stable disease or partial response may receive up to 1 retreatment course.
      Patients with progressive disease after infusion of PBL may receive retreatment with TIL, if
      available.

      Patients are followed at 4-5 weeks, every 3-4 months for 2 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-74 patients (12-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 2-3 years.
