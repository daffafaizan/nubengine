    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the relative bioavailability of Quinine
      Sulfate 324 mg capsules, manufactured by the Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, to Quinine
      Sulphate 300 mg tablets, manufactured by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization, Bangkok
      Metropolis, Thailand, after single oral dose administration under fasting conditions. An
      additional purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on the Mutual
      Pharmaceutical Company product.

      Twenty-seven healthy, non-smoking, non-obese, male and female volunteers at least 18 years of
      age will be randomly assigned in crossover fashion to receive each of three dosing regimens
      in sequence with a 7 day washout period between dosing periods. In each of the three dosing
      periods, after a fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will receive one dose of one of the
      three test products (treatment A - quinine sulfate capsules 324 mg, treatment B - quinine
      sulphate tablets 300 mg, treatment C - quinine sulfate capsules 324 mg administered thirty
      minutes after the initiation of a standardized, high-fat breakfast). Subjects will fast for 4
      hours after dosing. Blood samples will be drawn from all participants before dosing and for
      48 hours post-dose at times sufficient to adequately define the pharmacokinetics of quinine
      sulfate under fed and fasting conditions and quinine sulphate under fasting conditions.
      Sitting blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained prior to dosing and at 1, 2, 4 and 12
      hours post-dose and upon completion of the study. An electrocardiogram will be recorded at
      check-in and at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours post-dose. Subjects will be monitored throughout
      their participation in the study for adverse reactions.
