      trial design is adopted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the LED light source
      system for endoscope during ureter transillumination. The trial will be carried out in 5
      centers, with the competitive grouping mode adopted. This trial will be carried out in the
      General Surgery Department and the Gynecology Department. Totally 120 subjects with rectal
      cancer, endometriosis, cervical cancer, adenomyosis and pelvic adhesion requiring operation
      (60 subjects for each of the test group and control group) are involved. The subjects, after
      signing the informed consent form approved by the Ethics Committee, will be screened by the
      investigators. Qualified subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of
      the exclusion criteria will be randomly divided into the control group or the test group. The
      subjects in the control group will accept the ureteral stent (manufacturer: Cook Ireland
      Ltd.) during operation. The subjects in the test group will undergo surgery using the LED
      light source system for endoscope and the supporting IRIS ureter kit. On the operation date,
      the investigators will score the performance using a scale to evaluate the resolution of the
      ureter in the whole process of operation. During the follow-up period, the investigators will
      evaluate the safety of the device based on the results of vital signs, physical examination,
      blood routine examination, routine urine examination, blood biochemistry, 12-lead ECG and
      B-mode ultrasonography of urinary system.
