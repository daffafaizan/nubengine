      the LMA ProSeal (high seal cuff, gastric access and bite block - to facilitate ventilation,
      airway protection and airway obstruction, respectively), the LMA Fastrach (fixed cuve tube
      and guiding handle - to facilitate insertion and fixation) and the LMA Unique (single use -
      prevention of disease transmission). The new features are that the airway tube incorporates a
      drain tube within its lumen to shorten and straighten its path, it is oval-shaped to match
      the shape of the mouth and to reduce rotation in the pharynx, the inner cuff has been
      strengthened to prevent airway obstruction from infolding and epiglottic fins have been added
      to prevent airway obstruction from epiglottic downfolding. In the following randomized,
      crossover study, we test the hypothesis that ease of insertion, oropharyngeal leak pressure,
      fiberoptic position and ease of gastric tube placement differ between the LMA ProSeal and the
      LMA Supreme in paralyzed, anesthetized patients
