      hospital overnight. However, some require admission to a specialist hospital, as their injury
      is more serious. Seizures can be harmful or even fatal, if not treated appropriately.
      Medications that reduce the risk of seizures are called antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). However,
      AEDs have side effects, which can affect patients' quality of life, memory, concentration and
      general health.

      Patients with seizures after TBI are typically prescribed an AED to prevent further seizures,
      most commonly Phenytoin or Levetiracetam. Some doctors favour a short course, whereas others
      favour a longer course. The first part of the trial aims to answer if one approach is better
      than the other (MAST-duration). The second part of the trial aims to answer if a 7-day course
      of either Phenytoin or Levetiracetam should be used for patients with a serious TBI to
      prevent seizures from happening (MAST- prophylaxis).

      All patients admitted to a neurosurgical unit (NSU) within the UK, with a serious TBI, will
      be considered for the trial. Patients who have been started on either Phenytoin or
      Levetiracteam by their clinical team due to seizures will be randomised to either up to 3
      months or at least 6 months of treatment. In an independent, parallel trial, TBI patients who
      have not had a seizure will be randomised to phenytoin, levetiracetam or no treatment. All
      patients will be managed as per usual NHS practice and followed up for 24 months.
