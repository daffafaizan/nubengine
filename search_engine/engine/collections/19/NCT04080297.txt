      medications for relief being hormonal preparations. Non-hormonal medications have
      demonstrated efficacy but at a far lower level than estrogen replacement therapy. For women
      with a history of breast cancer hormone replacement therapy is problematic especially if
      their therapeutic regime involves an aromatase inhibitor. Therefore, this study will explore
      the effect of Q-122 in a population of women with a history of breast cancer taking an
      aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen.

      The study is an open-label, two dose study (Group 1: 100 mg once daily and Group 2: 200 mg
      once daily) of Q-122, over a 4 week treatment period. As eligible subjects are enrolled, they
      will be assigned to Group 1 until Group 1 is fully enrolled. Dose escalation to the 200 mg
      level will only occur following a review of the safety experience of at least 6 subjects
      treated with 100 mg Q-122 once daily for at least 2 weeks. Once Group 1 is fully enrolled,
      eligible subjects will be enrolled into Group 2.

      A two-week screening phase will be used to establish a stable baseline of vasomotor symptoms
      and to establish study eligibility. Qualified subjects will be treated with Q-122 for four
      weeks either at 100 mg/day dose or the 200 mg/day dose, during which time they will be
      evaluated for safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Q-122 and tamoxifen levels;
      subjects will continue to record their hot flashes in identical fashion to the screening
      period. Following the 28 day treatment, period subjects who complete the study will continue
      to record their hot flashes for a two week follow up period.
