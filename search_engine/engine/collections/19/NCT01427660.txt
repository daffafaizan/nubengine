    
      The Specific Aims of this study are:

      Aim 1: To use the information in the two diabetes medications consumer CERSGs to build an
      interactive, computer tailored diabetes medication guide that will enable patients to assess
      their treatment goals, personal preferences, and side-effect concerns and generate a
      personally tailored assessment of their current diabetes treatments with, as appropriate,
      options for improving their diabetes care;

      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which this personally tailored diabetes medication guide
      compared with the print consumer guides reduces Latino and African American diabetes
      patients' decisional conflict, through improved knowledge of anti-hyperglycemic medications
      and satisfaction with information received.

      Aim 3: To examine the computer tailored program's effects on participants' changes in
      medications (medication intensification), self-reported medication adherence and beliefs and
      A1C levels between baseline and follow-up compared to participants receiving the print
      consumer guides.
