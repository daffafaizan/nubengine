      40 units per week or 80 units twice a week. Both arms will be taking the drug for 4 weeks.
      Each participant will be coming back for visits at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the
      initial baseline visit. During these visits the following information will be collected: MSUS
      of joints, DAS28, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Routine Assessment of Patient Index
      Data 3 (RAPID3) and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Participants
      will also be asked to fill out a questionnaire about their health status.

      Efficacy of Acthar to decrease evidence of MSUS synovitis and disease activity measures will
      be analyzed using the above mentioned instruments, as well as Acthar's ability to prevent the
      necessity to change patients' RA treatment regimen.
