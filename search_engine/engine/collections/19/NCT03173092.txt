      people who have MM. This study will look at the effectiveness and safety in participants who
      take ixazomib in addition to lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

      The study will enroll approximately 160 participants. Participants will initially receive:

      â€¢ Ixazomib 4 mg + lenalidomide 25 mg + dexamethasone 40 mg

      Participants include MM participants who have received 3 cycles of a bortezomib-based
      induction regimen (as defined by current National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]
      guidelines) and have no evidence of PD following initial first-line therapy. All participants
      will be asked to take ixazomib 4 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 and lenalidomide 25 mg from Day 1
      through 21 and dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in 28 day cycles until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 3 years. Dose modifications of ixazomib,
      and/or lenalidomide and/or dexamethasone are allowed at the discretion of the physician.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States. It is anticipated that the
      treatment phase of this study will last up to 78 months, including 42 months for enrollment,
      and a 36-month IRD treatment period (39 cycles) with ixazomib and/or lenalidomide and/or
      dexamethasone for the last participant enrolled.

      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic as per their standard of care, and will
      be followed for PFS. After disease progression, participants will be followed-up for overall
      survival every 6 months until death or termination of the study by the sponsor.
