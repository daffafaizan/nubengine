    
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a hypothesis-generating pilot study to assess the
      efficacy and safety of the closed loop control in kidney transplant recipients with history
      of insulin requiring diabetes mellitus in the early postoperative period.

      This study will be a prospective, single center, randomized controlled parallel group
      open-label trial. Participants with insulin requiring diabetes mellitus who have been offered
      an organ for living or deceased donor kidney transplantation will be recruited prior to
      transplantation surgery. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to AP (6 patients) and
      conventional treatment groups (3 patients). At the end of the subject's post-operative
      in-patient stay, participants will have the option of wearing a blinded CGM at home for 12
      weeks while treating themselves with multiple daily injections (MDI).
