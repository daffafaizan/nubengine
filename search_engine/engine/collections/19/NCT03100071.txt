      will be treated with standard of care blood thinning injection of low molecular weight
      heparin for 1 week and then for apixaban 5 mg twice daily for the rest of 11 weeks. Data will
      be collected to see if the central venous catheter "survived" or remained in place and did
      not have to be taken out because of the clot.
