    
      Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most serious type of stroke, accounting for 10% of
      stroke in high-income countries and up to 50% in low-to-middle income countries, especially
      in Asia where hypertension is common. ICH in the context of hypertension is often a
      manifestation of underlying cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).

      In summary, there is a considerable body of evidence supporting and association of CSVD with
      hypertension and poor outcomes, but limited evidence as to whether good BP control can modify
      the natural history of this condition.
