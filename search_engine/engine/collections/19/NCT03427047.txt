      use instruments versus Stryker Navigation surgical techniques performed with conventional
      instruments. MyKnee surgical technique patients will receive a CT scan of the surgical knee
      which enables custom manufacturing of the MyKnee cutting blocks. Stryker Navigational
      surgical technique patients will not require a CT scan. Both groups of patients will undergo
      total knee arthroplasty.
