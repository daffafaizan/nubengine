    
      This is an observational study of the effects of aggressive patient management. The records
      of 50 patients treated under the aggressive management plan will be matched with the records
      of 50 previous patients and attempts made to assess the improvement, if any, found.
      Statistical analysis will compare the outcomes of the study group and the matched control
      group for initial completion of planned therapy as per prescription, weight loss during
      therapy, intercurrent illness, and intercurrent hospitalizations. Long term analysis will
      compare the study group's outcomes (compared to expected outcomes) compared to the matched
      control group.
