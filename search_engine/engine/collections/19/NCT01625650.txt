      Simponi, Actemra, Rituxan and Orencia) have changed the treatment of RA, but the differences
      in safety and/or effectiveness of each biologic therapy are not all known. We are doing this
      study in order to try to see if one or more of these treatments are better than the others.
      The use of databases like the CORRONA Organization database gives us information that helps
      us to understand why such drugs are used, reasons for starting or stopping drugs, for whom
      they are prescribed, and to monitor changes in patients' abilities to perform daily
      activities and gather information on family or social history.
