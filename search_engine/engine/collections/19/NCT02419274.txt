      last years. Recent studies and articles highlighted the idea of asthma not beeing a single
      disease but rather a unifying term for multiple phenotypes. Phenotype in this sense is
      defined as the combination of observable properties of an organism, that are produced by the
      interactions of a genotype and the environment. In contrast, endotype describes a specific
      underlying pathophysiological pathway. Linking asthma phenotypes and endotypes in a system
      biological approach is an important research goal in order to develop targeted therapy,
      especially for severe asthma.

      The advantage the investigators' cohort provides is the collaboration with an equivalent
      pediatric cohort. In this setting questions regarding disease onset, exacerbation and
      chronicity can be posed and worked with in a comprehensive manner.
