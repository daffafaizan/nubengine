      RET-rearranged NSCLC, treated with at least one platinum based systemic chemotherapy regimen.
      Preclinical studies have shown that alectinib, a highly selective next generation ALK
      inhibitor, has potent anti-tumour activity in RET-rearranged NSCLC. Therapeutically, several
      multiple kinases inhibitors, are potentially able to inhibit RET kinase function, which has
      been tested in several unselected NCSLC trials. However, those result were negative and none
      of the tested drugs was approved for lung cancer treatment.

      The ALERT-lung trial is a single arm, phase II trial with the primary objective to assess the
      efficacy of alectinib in terms of best overall response (OR) assessed by RECIST v1.1 in
      selected NSCLC patients with RET rearrangement. The secondary objectives are to evaluate
      secondary measures of clinical efficacy including disease control, progression-free survival
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS) as well as to assess safety and tolerability of the
      treatment and to describe the association of primary and secondary outcomes with tumour
      characteristics.

      Alectinib is administered orally, 600 mg, twice per day, until progression, refusal or
      unacceptable toxicity. Trial treatment may also continue beyond progression, with physician
      and patient agreement, for as long as the patient may still derive clinical benefit. A total
      sample size of 44 patients is required.
