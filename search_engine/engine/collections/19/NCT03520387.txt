      2 factorial randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to examine the individual and combined
      effects of 1) lumbar medial branch nerve radiofrequency ablation (LRFA), a commonly used
      procedural intervention to target low back pain severity, and 2) a novel video telehealth
      tablet- and personal computer (PC)-based Activity Tracker-Informed Video-Enabled Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy program ("AcTIVE-CBT"), a behavioral intervention designed primarily to
      target functional limitations both secondary to, and independent of, improvements in pain.
      The LRFA treatment to be used in the proposed study addresses the major patient selection,
      procedural/technical, methodologic and reporting limitations of prior studies. AcTIVE-CBT
      addresses problems with Veteran access and compliance associated with conventional cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered in clinic, and uses currently available activity tracking
      technology to better promote activity and behavior change as compared to conventional CBT.
      This pilot RCT involves recruitment of up to 30 Veterans with CLBP who will be followed to
      evaluate functional recovery for up to 3 months, to reach a goal of 20 Veterans completing
      the 3-month primary outcome. The primary outcome is participant-reported back-related
      functional limitations (mobility and ADLs) at 3 months, as measured by the validated
      Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include activity tracker-assessed
      step counts, back pain intensity, reduction in opioid use, and quality of life. The
      investigators hypothesize that 1) each individual treatment will result in improvements in
      back-related functional limitations and secondary outcomes compared to control, and 2)
      combined treatment will produce greater treatment effects than each of the individual
      treatments alone. Although the proposed pilot study is unlikely to definitively address
      whether these treatments alone or in combination have significant effects on functional
      recovery, it will inform a future large-scale multicenter RCT to determine the efficacy of
      LRFA, AcTIVE-CBT, or combined LRFA + AcTIVE-CBT, for Veterans with CLBP.
