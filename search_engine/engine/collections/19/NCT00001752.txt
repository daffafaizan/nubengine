      observational studies of postmenopausal women. Although favorable effects of estrogen on
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels probably account for much of this benefit, direct vascular
      effects (vasomotor, hemostatic, anti-inflammatory) regulated by nitric oxide (NO) may also be
      of importance. We have recently shown that vasodilator effects of estrogen in the coronary
      circulation are due to enhanced bioactivity of NO released from the endothelium. Estrogen has
      been shown to stimulate synthesis and activity of the enzyme NO synthase with enhanced NO
      synthesis in endothelial cells in culture. Because L-arginine is the natural substrate for
      the enzyme NO synthase, we propose that the combination of L-arginine and estrogen might have
      additive vasomotor, hemostatic and anti-inflammatory effects in hypercholesterolemic
      postmenopausal women.
