    
      This study is an open-label, single arm, phase II study of chlorambucil in subjects with
      previously untreated CLL.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the response to chlorambucil in Japanese subjects with
      previously untreated CLL.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of chlorambucil in
      Japanese subjects.

      Chlorambucil is an effective and well-tolerated chemotherapeutic agent currently approved for
      treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the United States of America (US),
      European Union (EU) and other countries globally but not in Japan. Other more aggressive
      treatment options such as a combination of fludarabine (F) and cyclophosphamide are
      available, but are associated with significantly greater toxicities. The addition of
      ofatumumab to chlorambucil offers potentially a more effective therapy, with limited
      additional toxicity.

      Study OMB110911 has been conducted mainly in the US and EU to evaluate progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall response (OR) in subjects with previously untreated CLL with
      ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil versus (vs.) chlorambucil monotherapy.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate overall response of chlorambucil in Japanese
      subjects with previously untreated CLL.
