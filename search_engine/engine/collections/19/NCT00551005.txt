        -  To describe the toxicities of the combination of oral etoposide at 50 mg daily with
           escalating doses of celecoxib in patients with advanced malignancies.

        -  To evaluate the effects of the combination of etoposide and celecoxib on plasma levels
           of vascular endothelial growth factor.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of celecoxib.

      In course 1, patients receive oral etoposide once daily on days 1-35 and oral celecoxib twice
      daily on days 8-35. In all subsequent courses, patients receive oral etoposide once daily and
      oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, periodically during treatment, and at time of tumor
      progression. Samples are analyzed for vascular endothelial growth factor levels by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and stored for future analysis of circulating DNA of
      angiogenic biomarkers by polymerase chain reaction assays.
