      isoform 3A4 to generate the active metabolite. It inhibits adenosine-5-diphosphate
      (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation by irreversibly blocking the platelet P2Y12 receptor.
      However, response to clopidogrel shows wide individual variability, and patients with high
      on-treatment residual ADP-induced platelet reactivity are at an increased risk of adverse
      cardiovascular events. Previous study suggest co-administration of CCBs is associated with
      decreased platelet inhibition by clopidogrel, but these observational studies are confounded
      by patient's characteristics baseline difference such as proportion of hypertension and
      diabetes.

      The objective of this randomized controlled study is to compare amlodipine with placebo on
      anti-platelet effect of clopidogrel.
