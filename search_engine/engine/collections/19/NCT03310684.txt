      determine how it causes cardiac and renal disease. The primary hypothesis is than an altered
      renin-angiotensin system leads to the development of pediatric primary hypertension-related
      organ damage in the heart and kidney, specifically left ventricular hypertrophy and
      albuminuria. It is postulated that relative increase in angiotensin (Ang) ll tone compared to
      Ang-(1-7) tone in the circulation and the kidney (measured in the plasma and urine,
      respectively) leads to disease. The secondary hypotheses are that abnormalities in
      renin-angiotensin system tone are related to higher uric acid and FGF23, lower klotho, and,
      with concurrent obesity, contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The investigators
      will recruit 100 subjects aged 5-17 years who are referred for a new diagnosis of pediatric
      primary hypertension to the Pediatric Nephrology clinic at Brenner Children's Hospital, 50
      normotensive subjects with obesity recruited from the Brenner Families-in-Training program,
      and 10 healthy normotensive from a general pediatrics clinic in the Wake Forest Baptist
      Health System.
