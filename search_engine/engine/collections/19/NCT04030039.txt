      diagnosed and treated in the liver disease department of the Hepatology Center of Beijing
      Ditan Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University and those who received antiviral
      therapy (interferon and nucleoside analogues) reached HBsAg<100 IU/ml. The enrolled subjects
      were divided into the following six observation cohorts: 1) chronic Hepatitis B patients in
      the immunological control period, without any clinical treatment intervention in this cohort;
      2) After interferon therapy, HBsAg<100 IU/ml, continued interferon therapy in this cohort; 3)
      After interferon therapy, HBsAg<100 IU/ml, stopped interferon treatment in this cohort; 4)
      After interferon therapy, HBsAg<100 IU/ml, sequential nucleoside analog treatment in this
      cohort; 5) After nucleoside analogue treatment, HBsAg<100 IU/ml, sequential interferon
      treatment in this cohort; 6) After treated with nucleoside analogues, HBsAg<100 IU/ml,
      continuing the nucleoside analog treatment in this cohort. The follow-up observation period
      was 96 weeks under non-planned intervention. During the observation period, HBV DNA loads,
      HBsAg/anti-HBs, HBeAg/anti-HBe and biochemical indicators, serum AFP and liver imaging (liver
      ultrasound) were examined regularly. The main evaluation index was the incidence of HBsAg
      disappearance during the observation period. Secondary evaluation indicators: the rate of HBV
      DNA turning positive, the rate of HBeAg turning positive and hepatitis incidence. To observe
      the inactive carrier status of low HBsAg content and the incidence of HBsAg disappearance,
      clinical outcomes and influencing factors in patients with CHB under different antiviral
      interventions.
