      individuals with chronic migraine face critical access barriers to traditional, validated,
      clinic-based behavioral headache treatments (eg, availability of trained therapists, cost,
      absences from work). Internet-based and mHealth technologies show promise for the treatment
      of chronic pain conditions and are primed to address barriers to treatment, but have not yet
      been optimally translated into interventions for chronic migraine. A program of development
      is proposed to transform a validated, 8-week Internet-based pain-coping skills training
      (PCST) program (PainCOACH I; original) into a version specific for chronic migraine.

      PainCOACH I was designed to retain key therapeutic components of in-clinic protocols and
      includes 8 modules of self-directed, tailored, interactive training in cognitive behavioral
      pain coping skills. A "virtual coach" provides verbal and visual instruction, feedback, and
      encouragement guided by theoretically-based learning principles. PainCOACH I has been
      successfully tested for populations with osteoarthritis and cancer pain, and has been studied
      in the US and Australia.

      This clinical trial registration pertains only to Aim 4 of the study. In Aim 4 subjects
      (n=144) will be recruited to participate in a randomized, controlled trial of the PainCOACH
      Migraine program (versus Medical Treatment as Usual) to demonstrate its feasibility,
      acceptability and engagement, and promise.
