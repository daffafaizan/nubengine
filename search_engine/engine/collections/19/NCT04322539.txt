      trial to compare the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib in combination with BSC versus
      placebo in combination with BSC in advanced colorectal cancer patients who have progressed
      on, or were intolerant to, chemotherapy, biologics, and TAS-102 or regorafenib. Patients with
      MSI-H/MMR deficient tumors must have also received an immune checkpoint inhibitor if approved
      and available and if deemed appropriate. Subjects with BRAF-mutant tumors must have been
      treated with a BRAF inhibitor if approved and available and if deemed appropriate.

      Metastatic colorectal cancer cannot be cured by surgery. Therefore, treatment principals are
      primarily aimed at controlling disease progression and prolonging survival. Standard first-
      and second-line therapy includes cytotoxic drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and
      irinotecan; anti-VEGF therapy; and, if RAS wild type, anti-EGFR therapy. After the first two
      lines of chemotherapy, standard third-line treatment is either TAS-102 or regorafenib. There
      are currently no effective treatments for patients who have progressed on standard, approved
      therapies, and treatment options include reuse of prior therapies, clinical trials or BSC.
      Consequently, there is an unmet medical need for additional safe and effective treatment.
