      to perform a randomized controlled trial in a select patient population of breast cancer
      survivors who would not normally be eligible for breast MRI screening. This study will
      determine whether using FAST MRI in addition to mammography will reduce anxiety in patients
      compared to the current standard of care: mammography alone. If it turns out to reduce
      anxiety, the next step would be to conduct a large-scale multi-centre randomized control
      trial (RCT) to evaluate whether FAST MRI is more sensitive and whether the increased
      sensitivity leads to improved clinical outcomes.

      The purpose of our study is to determine the impact on patient anxiety of FAST Breast MRI as
      a surveillance technique in women with a personal history of breast cancer.
