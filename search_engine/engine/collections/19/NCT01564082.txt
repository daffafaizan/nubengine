    
      Patients presenting for elective surgery requiring orotracheal intubation will be randomized
      to having the Early Endotracheal Tube (ETT) inserted into the pharynx prior to GlideScope
      insertion and then having the ETT advanced under GlideScope guidance into the trachea, or,
      being intubated in the standard fashion with the GlideScope being inserted first and having
      the ETT then advanced via the pharynx into the trachea. The primary outcome is time to
      intubation.
