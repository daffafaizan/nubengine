      which are intervented by CPAP level. The static pressure volume curves of the lung and chest
      wall (Campbell diagram) were established with slow deep respiratory manoeuvre. Before using
      CPAP level, we will measure the relevant parameters of lung volume, respiratory flow,
      diaphragm electromyogram, central drive mechanical and ventilation coupling. Then incremental
      CPAP level will be applied to investigate the effects of CPAP level on the above mentioned
      respiratory mechanics parameters.
