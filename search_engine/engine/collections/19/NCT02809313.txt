      inflammation of the tissues surrounding the tooth without causing periodontal attachment
      loss. Preventive and / or therapeutic measures to facilitate or improve their control are
      therefore very important, much more if you consider that gingivitis and periodontitis are
      considered part of an ongoing inflammatory process. Treatment of gingivitis, like that of all
      periodontal diseases has been based on the implementation of control measures personal and
      professional plaque. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it has been reported that although
      mechanical therapy achieved significantly decrease the periodontopathogens, this may be only
      temporary since bacteria can recolonize the treated niches in the oral cavity. In this
      context, it has emerged as a new treatment strategy complementary use of probiotics such as
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus, which possess anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.
      Generally speaking, probiotics would promote health by competitive exclusion of some or
      positive pathogenic bacteria. Objective: To evaluate the effect of the administration of
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy in adolescent and
      young adult patients with gingivitis. Methodology: A randomized double-blind clinical trial
      to evaluate the effect of sachet probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus as an adjunct to
      conventional periodontal treatment of patients with gingivitis will be performed. Expected
      Results: Statistically significant decrease in levels of periodontopathogens (P. gingivalis,
      A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. forsythia and A. viscosus) in the experimental group compared
      with the control. Association between clinical and microbiological parameters.
