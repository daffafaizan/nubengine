      facilitate communication of medical goals set by the treating physician to the subject in
      between clinic visits, and to assess the daily medical and lifestyle change compliance of
      enrolled Stanford subjects and provide virtual health coaching, as needed, to subjects to
      achieve said goals. How patients comply with their specific medical and lifestyle goals all
      affect their cardiovascular health, yet largely go unmeasured. These can now be measured with
      a notification-based system in which subject-entered activity, medication compliance, and
      dietary reporting data will be collected, assessed, and trigger appropriate responses by the
      subject's Care Team, which includes their physician, nurse, dietitian, and assigned health
      coach. We aim to collect this subject-reported activity and cardiovascular care plan
      compliance data to provide much more quantitative data on type, duration, and intensity of
      daily activities and compliance with the medication regimens of enrolled subjects.

      The study will compare anthropometric cardiovascular risk biomarkers testing at the initial
      visit and after 3 months, in subjects utilizing the HealthPals digital platform PLUS the
      standard SSATHI clinic visits, versus subjects receiving only SSATHI clinic visits.
