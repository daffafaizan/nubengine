      techniques with three different techniques in patients undergoing tubal sterilization.

      surgical techniques used:

        1. Mini Laparotomic tubal ligation

        2. Laparoscopic tubal ligation

        3. tubal ligation by posterior colpotomy

      A total of 194 patients were included in the study. Tubal ligation was performed in 44
      patients with mini laparotomy, 46 patients with laparoscopy and 104 patients with posterior
      colpotomy technique.

      The following parameters were evaluated in the study

        1. Parity

        2. How many of their previous births are vaginal delivery, how many are cesarian section

        3. 6th hour Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) score

        4. 24th hour Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) score

        5. Preoperative - postoperative hmg differences

        6. Surgery time

        7. Length of hospital stay
