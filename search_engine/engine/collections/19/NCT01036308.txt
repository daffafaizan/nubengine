      binding the bile acids and by increasing the faecal mass. Bile acids, especially the
      secondary bile acids, are potential risk factors for colorectal cancer. A high bile
      acid-binding ability of fibre could lead to lower serum cholesterol concentrations by
      interrupting the enterohepatic circulation. There is evidence that the consumption of legume
      kernel fibre, containing both soluble and insoluble fibre fractions, may beneficially modify
      bowel health.

      Seventy-eight healthy volunteers were enrolled. Seventy-six subjects (mean age of 24 years,
      55 women and 21 men) completed the double-blind, randomized crossover trial. After two weeks
      run-in period, half of the volunteers consumed 25 g of legume fibres (Boregine, TypTop or Soy
      fibre) every day, and the other half received a reference fibre product (citrus fibre,
      Herbacel AQ Plus) for a period of two weeks. After two weeks wash-out the intervention
      changed between the groups.

      At the end of each period a quantitative stool and urine collection took place and fasting
      blood samples were drawn.
