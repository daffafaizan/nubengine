      oral misoprostol solution every two hours.However,more research is required to optimize the
      use of oral misoprostol solution for labor induction.The current study is to compare efficacy
      and safety of repetitive hourly dose of oral misoprostol solution with two hourly dose of
      oral misoprostol solution for cervical ripening and labor induction.
