      condition). Two thirds will receive SC-CBT, one-third standard CBT (determined at random
      following the initial phone screen).

      A. Phone Screen (with parent)

      B. Informed Consent and Initial Assessment

      C. Randomization to either SC-CBT or Standard CBT

      D. Treatment Phase (either 1 or 2 determined at random following 'C')

        1. SC-CBT

           Children who are randomized into SC-CBT will receive Step One:

             -  3-in-office sessions - 1 hour each (over 6 weeks)

             -  6 weekly phone calls (15 minutes or less)

             -  Post assessment (at the end of the 6 weeks)

             -  3-month follow up

           Children are "stepped up" to Step Two of SC-CBT if we determine more therapy is needed
           (following the post assessment). Step Two is a continuation of therapy and will include:

             -  9-in-office weekly sessions - 1 hour each (over 9 weeks)

             -  Post assessment (after session 9)

             -  3-month follow up

           OR

        2. Standard CBT

      Children who are randomized into the standard CBT group will receive:

        -  12-in-office weekly sessions - 1 hour each (over 12 weeks)

        -  Midpoint Assessment (after 6 weeks)

        -  Post assessment (at the end of the 12 weeks)

        -  3-month follow up
