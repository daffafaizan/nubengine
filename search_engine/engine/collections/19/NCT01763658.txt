      and plays a role in pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in both, acute and chronic ITP.

      Selenium is an essential mineral found in small amounts in the body. It works as an
      antioxidant, especially when combined with other antioxidants as vitamin E , A and C.
      Antioxidants neutralize free radicals and may reduce or even help prevent some of the damage
      they cause.

      aim of this study is to assess oxidant and antioxidant systems initially in patients with
      acute and chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and 6 months later.Another aim of the study
      is to evaluate effect of antioxidant therapy on bleeding score, platelet count and
      antioxidant status during 6 months follow-up.
