      back, or buttocks lasting at least six months. According to a WHO epidemiological study, the
      worldwide prevalence rate of CPP in childbearing age women was 2.1%-24%. At present, nearly
      55% of the patients had unclear etiology, and there is no universally accepted diagnosis,
      evaluation and treatment. CPP is often associated with gynecological and non gynecological
      diseases, including endometriosis, abdominal visceral adhesion, myofascial pain and
      dysfunction, irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. CPP
      are also accompanied by psychological and physiological dysfunction, the most common is
      depression and anxiety, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients.

      Acupuncture may have effect on non-cyclic CPP in female, however, there is a lack of evidence
      of effectiveness of acupuncture. A multi-center randomized three-armed controlled trial will
      be conducted. The aim of this study is assess the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for
      female patients with non-cyclic CPP.
