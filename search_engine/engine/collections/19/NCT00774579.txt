      disease, often show metabolic features similar to those described in the 'metabolic
      syndrome'. Growth hormone (GH) replacement has been shown to reverse many of these
      unfavorable changes, with a particular evident reduction of visceral fat. In recent years, a
      strong correlation between fat accumulation in the liver and features of the metabolic
      syndrome (particularly visceral fat) has been identified, and 'fatty liver' is now being
      referred as the hepatic feature of the 'metabolic syndrome'. The effect of GH replacement on
      liver fat, however, has never been systematically studied.

      We will assess 15 patients with GHD before and 6 months after starting GH replacement. We
      will also assess 15 control patients with GHD but who don't go on GH replacement for various
      reasons.

      Liver fat will be assessed using MR spectroscopy. Changes in liver fat will be correlated to
      changes in insulin sensitivity and changes in various inflammatory markers.
