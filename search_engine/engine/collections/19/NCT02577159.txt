      improve lipoprotein metabolism as well as hyperglycemia in Japanese patients with type II
      diabetes mellitus. Primary Objective is to examine changes of fasting lipoprotein profile by
      the administration of dapagliflozin; Concentrations of apoB-48 and RemL-C. Secondary
      Objectives are; to examine changes of fasting glucose and HbA1c (NGSP) level by the
      administration of dapagliflozin, to examine changes of fasting lipid profile by the
      administration of dapagliflozin; Concentrations of TG, TC, HDL-C and LDL-C, to examine
      changes of fractions of free fatty acids, protein mass of LPL, and lipoprotein profile
      assessed by the HPLC by the administration of dapagliflozin, to examine changes of biomarkers
      for renal and hepatic function by the administration of dapagliflozin, and to examine the
      frequency of adverse effects by the administration of dapagliflozin. This study is open-label
      study and contains patients who are diabetes mellitus of from 20 to 65 years of age and their
      Patients who have not achieve the clinical target of the glycemic control (less than 7.0% in
      HbA1c).
