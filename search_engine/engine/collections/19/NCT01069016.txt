        -  Implantation of two electrodes, one placed next to the sacral nerve, one close to the
           pudendal nerve. Electrode wires are passed through the skin just above the gluteal
           region and are marked S and P. One of the sub-investigators (not involved in the
           follow-up) replaces the S and P marks by 1 and 2 marks in absence of the operating
           surgeon. Assignment of 1 and 2 is carried out in a predefined randomized fashion
           (computerized block randomization).

      Test phase:

        -  Electrode labeled 1 is connected to a stimulator and the nerve is stimulated for one
           week, then the other electrode is stimulated for a week.

        -  Based on bowel habit diary, Wexner score (Jorge 1993) and subjective experience of the
           patient, the more successful treatment is chosen. If both electrodes were equally
           successful, the pudendal nerve electrode will be chosen for permanent stimulation.

      Secondary surgery:

        -  After unblinding, the less effective electrode is removed and the remaining electrode is
           connected to an implanted stimulator (permanent phase). In case both treatments were
           unsuccessful, both electrodes are removed.
