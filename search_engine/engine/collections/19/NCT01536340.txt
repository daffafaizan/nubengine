    
      This 24-month prospective cohort study will examine the frequency and types of adverse events
      experienced by patients 3-4 weeks after discharge from the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital
      (TMH), the timeliness of post-discharge ambulatory appointments, and identify the
      associations, if any, of readily available patient, system, and patient care factors with the
      occurrence of these post-discharge adverse events. Data collection will involve telephone
      interviews with patients, and review of inpatient and outpatient health records for services
      received, as necessary, within 3-4 weeks after discharge from the hospital. These data
      sources will allow study physicians to implicitly (with some explicit guidance) determine
      whether an adverse event has occurred, distinguish preventable from ameliorable adverse
      events, and determine the types of adverse events. In addition, the study will determine the
      timeliness of post-discharge ambulatory appointments by conducting post-discharge telephone
      interviews with patients and reviewing health records.
