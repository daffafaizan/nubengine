      cysteine (NAC) alone, or the combination of minocycline and NAC can help people with bipolar
      depression when added to lithium. The investigators also want to find out if minocycline,
      NAC, and the combination of minocycline and NAC are safe to take without causing too many
      side effects.

      While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved minocycline to treat
      infections and acne and has approved NAC as a mucolytic, the FDA has not approved
      minocycline, n-acetylcysteine, or the combination of minocycline and n-acetylcysteine to
      treat bipolar depression.

      This research study will compare minocycline, n-acetylcysteine, and the combination of
      n-acetylcysteine and minocycline to placebo. The placebo looks exactly like the other study
      drugs, but contains neither minocycline nor NAC. During this study participants may get a
      placebo instead of minocycline, n-acetylcysteine, or the combination of minocycline and
      n-acetylcysteine. Placebos are used in research studies to see if the results are due to the
      study drug or due to other reasons.
