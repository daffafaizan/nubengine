      I. To estimate the anti-tumor activity of bevacizumab by assessing frequency of objective
      response in patients with recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary who have measurable
      disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity in these patients. II. To determine the
      overall survival and progression-free survival of these patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify expression of angiogenic or lymphangiogenic markers in recurrent stromal
      tumors of the ovary to determine the frequency of alterations and potential utility of
      biologic agents directed at these proteins for inclusion in future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then periodically thereafter.
