      reducing suicide risk in patients with MDD and BPD. This study also aims to identify the
      structural and functional circuit properties that characterized the suicidal brain and the
      signatures that explain the clinical severity of suicidal risk. Moreover, this study aims to
      determine biological and dimensional predictors of anti-suicidal response to iTBS-TMS and its
      mechanism of action.
