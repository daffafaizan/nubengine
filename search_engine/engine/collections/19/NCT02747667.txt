    
      This is a retrospective cohort study. Data of all patients treated at the hospital from June
      1997 to October 2015 for a complication after IOL implantation will be obtained from an
      electronic medical record and database (FileMaker Inc., v3 - 6 and EyMed). Additional data,
      e.g. axial length (AL) or diopters of the implanted IOL, are taken from the patients' medical
      files. Collected data are age, sex, laterality of the eye, and predisposing eye conditions
      (PXF, relevant myopia defined as â‰¥ 25.5 mm axial length, uveitis, RP and ocular trauma).
      Other parameters are preoperative surgical interventions, the use of a capsular tension ring
      (CTR), perioperative complications, diopters of the IOL, pre- and postoperative corrected
      distance visual acuity (CDVA) in logMAR, and post-operative manifest refraction. Time to
      dislocation, additional interventions after cataract surgery, and symptoms due to the IOL
      complication will recorded. Type of dislocation (in-the-bag or out-of-the-bag), location
      (anterior chamber, pupillary plane or vitreous), pre- and post-operative CDVA, pre- and
      post-operative manifest refraction, type of secondary intervention, and in case secondary
      implantation was performed, type of secondary IOL are collected.

      Differences regarding prevalence for various predisposing risk factors are investigated by
      means of logistic regression methods. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are calculated
      unadjusted as well as adjusted for age, gender, and the four predisposing risk factors: PXF,
      relevant myopia, uveitis, and RP. Prevalence and incidence of in-the-bag IOL dislocations
      will be calculated from all patients that had an implantation of the ACR6D SE at the
      Department of Ophthalmology in Graz.
