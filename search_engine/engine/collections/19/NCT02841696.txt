      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is now essentially defined by the association of LV hypertrophy
      and diastolic dysfunction. Investigators believe this hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is also
      characterized by early impairment of systolic function but mainly in its longitudinal
      component (assessed by measuring the GLS) and therefore exposed to cardiovascular events.

      The work is based on an existing cohort of hypertensive patients included more than 10 years
      ago before any initiation of antihypertensive therapy in the hypertension unit of the
      Bordeaux University Hospital, France. Patients will be contacted for further consultation
      with a cardiologist to identify patients with a LV systolic dysfunction. The primary
      end-point is a decrease of the longitudinal systolic function with a GLS<-17% for men and
      <-19% for women.

      A sufficient number of patients will be contacted in order to collect data of at least 400
      patients after more than 10-year of follow-up.
