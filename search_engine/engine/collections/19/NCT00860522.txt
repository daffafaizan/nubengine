      stages to minimize the number of patients treated at doses substantially below the
      recommended phase 2 dose. In stage 1, cohorts of three will be treated at each dose level
      however doses will be doubled from level to level. Stage 2 will commence after a dose
      limiting toxicity is observed in stage 1 or after the maximum dose for stage 1 is reached.
      Stage 2 will follow a modified Fibonacci schema with 3-6 subjects at each dose level until a
      recommended phase 2 dose is determined. The cohort will then be expanded to a maximum of 12
      patients to more fully evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose. The Principal Investigator will
      assign dose level to be administered to all patients.
