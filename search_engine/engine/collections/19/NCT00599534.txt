    
      Primary Specific Aim. To conduct a randomized double blind 16-week trial comparing the effect
      on polysomnographic measures of the administration of once a day oral montelukast therapy vs.
      placebo in children with OSAS.

      Secondary Specific Aim. For all children with the original AHI at diagnosis of >2 hrTST, we
      expect improvements in the severity of sleep apnea to occur following treatment with
      montelukast. Therefore, we will examine the overall reduction in AHI and also how many of
      these children have AHI< 2 after the 16-week treatment. In other words, the percentage of
      children converting from needing T&A surgery before treatment with montelukast to not needing
      surgery after treatment will be examined.
