      underpinnings of irregular menstrual cycles among adolescents in the early post-menarchal
      period. Irregular menstruation affects > 2.5 million reproductive-age women in the US each
      year1. Most adult women with oligomenorrhea of unknown etiology reporting symptoms dating
      back to early adolescence. While a period of cycle irregularity is well-described in the
      first few years after menarche, a lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms of normal
      reproductive axis development in the post-menarchal female has hampered our ability to
      distinguish abnormal from normal developmental trajectories. Moreover, the commonly held
      belief that menstrual irregularity among teenage girls is normal has also delayed detection
      of pathology in reproductive development, precluding institution of early preventative
      strategies to curtail future reproductive morbidity.
