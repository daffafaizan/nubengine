      antiseptics and desiccants, but most importantly topical antibiotics. Guidance on the use of
      antimicrobial therapies has been published, poor prescribing practices still exist which
      facilitate the development of bacterial strains resistant to available therapy. The issue of
      antimicrobial resistance is particularly important for Gram-positive cocci such as
      Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA) has been a problem for many years in the hospital setting, more recently community
      acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has emerged posing additional challenges to physicians managing skin
      infection. The medicinal product under development, Lytixar™, is a synthetic antimicrobial
      peptidomimetic agent with a membrane lysing mode of action. Lytixar™ has demonstrated
      activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. The compound
      appears to be equally effective against antibiotic-resistant species such as methicillin
      resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VRE) and
      multi-resistant Pseudomonas isolates. The novel membrane lysing mode of action may result in
      a lower propensity to the development of resistance and to date Lytixar™ demonstrates no in
      vitro target-specific cross-resistance with other classes of antibiotics.
