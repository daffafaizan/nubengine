        -  Determine the clinical response of patients with stage IV breast cancer to bryostatin 1.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of bryostatin 1 when given as 24 hour infusion.

        -  Determine the ability of this regimen to regulate lymphocyte function in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on platelet function and protein kinase C activity
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours. Treatment continues weekly in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 4-8 weeks for tumor response.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
