      extension study (DCLP3 Extension) following completion of the primary trial. The closed-loop
      control (CLC) Intervention Group participants from the primary trial will be randomly
      assigned to continue CLC or to switch to Predictive Low-Glucose Suspend (PLGS) therapy with
      t:slim X2 with Basal-IQ and Dexcom G6 for 3 months. The Sensor-Augmented Pump (SAP) Control
      Group participants from the primary trial will be assigned to CLC using t:slim X2 with
      Control-IQ Technology and Dexcom G6 (CGM) for 3 months. Upon completion of the extension
      study, subjects will be invited to participate in continued use of the Control-IQ Technology
      until the equipment has received FDA approval for commercial use.

      This extension phase has two separate objectives:

      Objective 1: Among participants who used CLC in the primary trial: the primary efficacy
      outcome for the RCT is time in target range 70-180 mg/dL measured by CGM in CLC group vs.
      PLGS group over 3 months. Safety outcomes also will be assessed Objective 2: Among
      participants who used SAP in the primary trial: the primary outcome is to obtain additional
      safety data. Efficacy also will be assessed as a pre-post within participant analysis

      Note: Primary Trial (DCLP3) is NCT03563313
