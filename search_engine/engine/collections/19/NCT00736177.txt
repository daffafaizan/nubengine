      Patients with a history of implantation failure in fresh autologous cycles have been shown
      have reduced chance of success in subsequent fresh autologous cycles. A potentially frequent
      cause of implantation failure is reduced endometrial receptivity following ovarian
      stimulation, perhaps due to the effects of supraphysiologic hormone levels on endometrial
      development. Therefore, such patients may have a greater chance of success if all of their
      embryos are cryopreserved for use in a subsequent cycle in which endometrial development can
      be more carefully controlled, absent the effects of ovarian stimulation. Therefore this study
      compares success rates in cycles of fresh embryo transfer and cycles with transfer of
      frozen-thawed embryos.
