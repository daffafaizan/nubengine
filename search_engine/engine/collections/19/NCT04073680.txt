      enhance the efficacy of PI3K inhibition in treating solid tumors. The treatment consists of
      serabelisib, a PI3K alpha isoform (PI3Kα) inhibitor, combined with the sodium-glucose
      cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin. The study will assess the safety and
      efficacy of the combination in adult patients with advanced solid tumors harboring mutations
      that may be dependent on PI3Kα activity: PIK3CA mutations and KRAS mutations.
