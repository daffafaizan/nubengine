      varying degrees of parenchymal density patterns, a strong association was demonstrated
      between Transillumination Breast Spectroscopy (TIBS) and x-ray derived mammographic density.
      From this, we expect that TIBS should also provide a comparable odds ratio (4-6) as
      mammographic density for breast cancer risk shown in other independent epidemiological
      studies. It is possible that TIBS may provide complementary information and a higher odds
      ratio if compared to the incidence of breast cancer. In contrast to mammography derived
      parenchymal density pattern, no historical TIBS data is available for a retrospective
      analysis and hence a cross sectional study within a group of screened women is proposed. We
      hypothesize that TIBS provides physical information about the breast tissue which can be used
      to construct a breast cancer risk predictor with an odd ratio > 6.
