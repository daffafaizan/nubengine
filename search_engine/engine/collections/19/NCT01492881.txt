    
      This is a prospective, open-label single arm phase II trial of vorinostat, bortezomib and
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) followed by vorinostat/bortezomib (VB) maintenance
      therapy for patients with relapsed and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The
      primary hypothesis being evaluated is that the addition of vorinostat to the PLD and
      bortezomib backbone (VB-PLD) will improve the overall response rate (ORR) as compared to a
      historical control of PLD in combination with bortezomib.[1] We anticipate that the addition
      of maintenance therapy will not improve the ORR, but may improve the quality (depth) of
      response and progression free survival (PFS).

      Secondary endpoints include PFS, high quality response rates (very good partial responses
      (VGPR) + complete responses (CRs)), duration of remission (DOR), quality of life (QOL),
      overall survival (OS) and tolerability of the regimen in patients with relapsed and relapsed
      and refractory multiple myeloma.
