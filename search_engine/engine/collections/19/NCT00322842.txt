      cyto-reductive chemotherapy and are to be autologously transplanted will be treated with a
      combination of plerixafor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization
      regimen on the day prior to apheresis. The only change to standard of European care is the
      addition of plerixafor to a G-CSF mobilizing regimen. Participants will undergo mobilization
      with G-CSF (10 µg/kg each day) and on each day prior to apheresis will receive plerixafor
      (240 µg/kg). Participants will undergo apheresis for up to 5 consecutive days in order to
      collect the target number of (≥ 5*10^6) CD34+ stem cells/kg. Participants will be
      transplanted with cells obtained from the G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization regimen. The
      number of CD34+ cells mobilized in the peripheral blood from the time of the plerixafor dose
      to just prior to apheresis and those harvested in the apheresis product will be measured. The
      number of apheresis sessions required to obtain ≥ 5*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg will also be
      measured. Success of the transplantation(s) will be evaluated by the time to engraftment of
      poly-morphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and platelets (PLT). Participants will be followed for
      durability of their transplant for 12 months following transplantation.
