      changes can be correlated with symptoms associated with primary POI.

      PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION Is there a correlation between peri-operative microcirculatory flow
      measurements and the incidence of symptomatic primary POI?

      SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTIONS

        1. Is there a correlation between peri-operative microcirculatory flow measurements and the
           duration of symptomatic primary POI?

        2. If any correlation is observed, which anatomic location (sublingual mucosa vs bowel
           serosa) yields microcirculatory flow measurements that are more strongly associated with
           the incidence and/or duration of symptomatic primary POI?

        3. Can either intraoperative sublingual mucosa or intraoperative bowel serosa
           microcirculatory flow measurements predict symptoms of primary POI? Are these two
           anatomic locations equivalent in their ability to predict this complication?
