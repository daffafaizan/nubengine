      pulmonary vasculature, which seriously affects the quality of life and survival of patients.
      Currently, no effective drugs treatment was used in patients with pulmonary hypertension due
      to acute exacerbation of lung disease. Recombinant Human Brain Natriuretic Peptide (rhBNP)was
      approved in 2001 for use in patients with acute heart failure on the basis of studies showing
      a reduction in pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure(PCWP) and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP)
      and improvement cardiac output (CO) . Thus, the study was designed to administer rhBNP as a
      continuous infusion for 24 hours on pulmonary hypertension of acute exacerbations of chronic
      pulmonary disease monitoring by Swan- Ganz catheter. Each patient was studied on two
      occasions (6 hours apart). One occasion the subject received rhBNP 1.5ug/kg IV bolus followed
      by an infusion of 0.0075ug/kg/min for 24 hours; other occasion the subject received IV
      placebo bolus followed by a placebo infusion for 24 hours .these were administered in random
      order in double blind fashion.
