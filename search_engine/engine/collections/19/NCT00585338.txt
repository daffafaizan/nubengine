      multiple 532/1064 nm laser pulses treatment.

      The researcher will select one to four test sites spots for laser treatment. will be
      Different laser parameters can be used for each test site. The research will evaluate of the
      test sites at 6-12 weeks for bruising and blanching. Parameters of the test area with the
      greatest degree of blanching without adverse effects will be utilized for further treatment.
      If no test area is determined to have blanching without adverse effects, further test sites
      may be performed.
