    
      All active members of the Cambridge NIHR BioResource will be approached.

      They will be sent an email outlining the purpose of the study and asking that if they would
      like to take part to please complete the online questionnaire which will be linked to in the
      email.

      For those individuals who agree to participate and complete the questionnaire, the Cambridge
      NIHR BioResource will provide the genetic marker information it already holds for specific
      markers that are known to be associated with osteoarthritis.
