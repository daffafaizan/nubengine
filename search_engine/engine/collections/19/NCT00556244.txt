      photocoagulation in diabetic patients. Fibrovascular proliferation may lead to persistent or
      recurrent vitreous hemorrhage, macular traction, or traction macular detachment, and becomes
      a major indication for vitrectomy.1 During the past 25 years, anatomical and visual results
      of vitrectomy for severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy have improved as a result of
      improved understanding of the pathoanatomy and improvements in surgical instrumentation.2-5
      Although anatomical success is high after complete vitrectomy, recurrent epiretinal membrane
      may cause macular thickening, cysts formation, preventing good functional outcome.6 An
      epiretinal membrane (ERM) is a non-vascular cellular membrane that may cause symptomatic
      visual disturbances due to retinal wrinkling and distortion.7 These epiretinal membranes have
      been found to be composed of fibroblasts, glial cells, macrophages, myofiboblasts, nad
      retinal pigment epithelial cells.8-9 Studies have suggested removal of internal limiting
      membrane (ILM) may decrease the likelihood of post-operative ERM formation in cases of
      diabetic macular edema and idiopathic ERM. It is postulated that removal of the ILM removes
      the scaffold upon which myofibroblasts would proliferate.10 Efficacy of vitrectomy including
      removal of ILM was mostly described as facilitating resolution of diffuse diabetic macular
      edema11 and improvement of visual acuity or in macular hole surgery in diabetic
      patients.12However, it is unknown if removal of ILM during vitreoretinal surgery in diabetic
      patients with active fibrovascular proliferation is useful in preventing postoperative ERM
      formation. The purpose of this study is to compare the postoperative epiretinal membrane
      (ERM) formation and visual outcome in diabetic patients with active fibrovascular
      proliferation who underwent vitrectomy with or without ILM peeling.
