      elderly people have a cognitive decline and we estimated a 5% of cognitive decline in the
      intervention group. Sample size estimated was 85 participants for each arm, assuming two
      groups with an alpha of 0.05, 80% power and accounting for 10% of participants lost to
      follow-up.

      Repeated measures ANOVA, Cox regression and multiple linear regression analysis will be used
      for the statistical analysis of data.
