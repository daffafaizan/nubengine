      registry platform) with the purpose to record information on the antineoplastic treatment of
      HCC or CCC in Germany. The registry will follow patients for up to three years. It will
      identify common therapeutic sequences and changes in the treatment of the disease. At
      inclusion, data in patient characteristics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and previous
      treatments are collected. During the course of observation data on all systemic treatments,
      radiotherapies, surgeries, and outcome are documented.

      years.
