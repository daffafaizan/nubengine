    
      Crop the plasma exposure of 5-FU (5-Fluorouracile) around a predefined target area under the
      curve 30 (AUC30) in patients with head and neck cancer treated with Docetaxel, Cisplatin,
      5-Fluorouracile (=TPF) protocols and correlate adaptive Bayesian procedure to tolerability.

        -  Develop a population die from a group of 20 patients for which a pharmacokinetic study
           will be carried out

        -  Evaluate obtaining effective concentration of 5-FU in the context of a Docetaxel,
           Cisplatin, 5-Fluorouracile (=TPF) protocol adapted by the Bayesian procedure.

        -  Compare recommendations in terms of dosage adjustment of Bayesian approach with the
           recommendations of a simplified graphical approach.

        -  Test the measure of Dihydro Pyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) activity
           Dihydrouracil/Uracile (UH2 / U ratio) as a co-variable adjustment of 5-Fluorouracile
           (5-FU) regimens in Pharmacogenomics/Pharmacokinetic (PGx / PK) model.

        -  Evaluate a prototype of urinary dipsticks for the early detection of toxicity from the
           assay as a marker of Dihydro Pyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) activity.

        -  Assess the cost-benefit of dosage targeting, in terms of reduction resulting costs to
           the management of chemotherapy-induced toxicities.
