    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Participants are screened for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) with 3
      sputum acid-fast bacilli smears and mycobacterial cultures, with speciation of positive
      cultures, collected over 1 year. Demographic data, diagnostic criteria, clinical
      measurements, and other respiratory pathogen data are collected using the Cystic Fibrosis
      Foundation Patient Registry Questionnaire.

      NTM-positive patients (cases) matched with NTM-negative controls identified in screening are
      followed every 3 months for 15 months. Cases are evaluated for NTM burden during the first 3
      months.

      Appropriate therapy is offered to consistently NTM-positive cases. Lung transplant recipients
      are removed from study.
