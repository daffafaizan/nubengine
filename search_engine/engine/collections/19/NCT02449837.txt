      taken during treatment. The CTCs measurements from this study will provide essential
      information for the power and sample size considerations for future translational studies,
      particularly for those looking to identify biomarkers possibly associated with CTCs and tumor
      response activity after XRT, and to adequately power more formal statistical comparisons of
      important associations between CTCs and patient characteristics and outcomes.
