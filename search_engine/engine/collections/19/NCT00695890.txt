      devastating outcome for the patient and poorly understood by the medical community. It is
      potentially a preventable complication. Diminished blood supply to the optic nerve, affecting
      both the anterior or posterior portions of the optic nerve, is the most common cause of
      postoperative visual loss. Other, less common causes include occlusion of the retinal artery
      and vein, a retinal embolism and cortical blindness. The incidence of postoperative visual
      loss increases in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and prone spine surgery.
      Although the etiology of post-operative visual loss is unknown, it is thought to be
      multifactorial, and several potential risk factors have been identified, including degree of
      low blood pressure, preoperative hematocrit, external compression of the eye, amount of blood
      loss, prolonged duration of surgical time and increased pressure in the eye associated with
      positioning. To date studies have focused on the mechanism associated with the visual loss.
      We would like to focus on the feasibility of using a monitor which may signal loss of visual
      function intraoperatively.
