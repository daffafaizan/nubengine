      treated with divalproex versus lamotrigine in a retrospective chart review of veterans as
      measured by time to relapse into any significant mood episode (i.e. mania or depression). The
      primary hypothesis is that bipolar patients will demonstrate significantly greater time to
      relapse in those treated with divalproex compared to those treated with lamotrigine. The
      secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and relative tolerability of
      divalproex and lamotrigine in this population based on discontinuation due to side or adverse
      effect.
