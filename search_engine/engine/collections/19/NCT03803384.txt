      Hypoxemia is frequently observed in COPD and thus can negatively impact exercise tolerance.
      Supplemental oxygen or long-term oxygen therapy is recommended to ensure that the patient is
      still able to manage his daily life. Usually, oxygen supplementation is delivered using
      constant flow rates during day- and nighttime or as needed. However, studies have shown, that
      auto-regulated oxygen flow systems (FreeO2) may enhance the patients endurance, lower the
      time in severe hypoxemia and increase the time spent within the SpO2 target range.

      Aim of this study is to investigate the effects off an auto-regulated oxygen flow system in
      hypoxemic COPD patients on the patientÂ´s endurance, the oxygen saturation, the pCO2 blood
      level as well as on heart rate and breathing frequency compared to the effects off the
      prescribed constant flow (according to the British Thoracic Society Guidelines for Home
      Oxygen Use in Adults) during an endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT). Additionally, patients
      experience, e.g. comfort and Preference of the Oxygen-delivery System will be documented.

      Design:

      This study is a randomized, controlled cross-over trial. Following an initial incremental
      shuttle walk test (ISWT) in order to determine the participants individual maximal walking
      capacity, the participant will perform 2 endurance shuttle walk tests (ESWT) at 85% of the
      maximal walking rate. In randomized order, the participants will perform one ESWT with
      constant flow as prescribed and one ESWT with the auto-regulated oxygen flow system.
