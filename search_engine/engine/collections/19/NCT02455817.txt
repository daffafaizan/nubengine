      CCS class III/IV) up to one (1) year following stent implantation. The following drug eluting
      stents will be evaluated in addition to bare metal stents; Cypher, Taxus Express, Xience V,
      Resolute and Promus Element. The target vessel revascularization rate will also be compared
      for the 6 stent types within one (1) year.
