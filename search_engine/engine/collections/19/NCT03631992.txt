    
      This is a longitudinal, randomized, within- and between- subject study of children and their
      mothers to determine whether children's repeated exposure to snacks lower in sweetness and
      mothers' educational lessons about dental health and nutrition (intervention group) affects
      children's acceptance of low sugar snacks, most preferred level of sweet and salty taste, and
      dietary intake of added sugars when compared to the control group.
