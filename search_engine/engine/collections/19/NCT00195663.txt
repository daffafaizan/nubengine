      open-label extension period, for a total of up to 10 years study duration. The study was
      designed to assess the potential of adalimumab + methotrexate to improve signs and symptoms
      of disease and to inhibit radiographic progression in patients with recent onset (disease
      duration less than 3 years) rheumatoid arthritis not previously treated with methotrexate.
      Adalimumab is a human anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody.
