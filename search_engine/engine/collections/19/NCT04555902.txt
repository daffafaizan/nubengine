      complications due to breast cancer. As part of an existing outreach campaign, the health
      system mails a postcard and small gift (pink socks) to women on the month of their 50th and
      64th birthdays to promote annual mammogram screening.

      The researchers are evaluating two new versions of the mailers against a standard mailer to
      see which version leads to greater uptake in mammograms. The new mailers have content that
      applies behavioral nudge theory - specifically, loss frames and fear appeals - to encourage
      taking action. One of the two new versions does not include the small gift, to test whether
      its inclusion or exclusion has any effect on mammogram screening.
