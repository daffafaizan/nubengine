    
      1. Main eligibility criteria were histologic or cytologic proof of advanced non-small-cell
           lung cancer (NSCLC) primary treatment, normal organ function, and Eastern Cooperative
           Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2.

        2. All Patients were delivered to pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 for not less
           than 4 cycle, administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Response assessment was
           performed every 6 weeks; toxicity assessment was performed every 3 weeks.

        3. Primary end point was time to progression (TTP); secondary end points were objective
           response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.

        4. The study was designed to evaluate TS(thymidylate synthase) gene polymorphism as a
           predictor for advanced lung adenocarcinoma effect to pemetrexed combined with cisplatin
           regiment as first-line treatment.

        5. Polymorphisms of thymidylate synthase were investigated in peripheral WBC（white blood
           cell）of all patients.
