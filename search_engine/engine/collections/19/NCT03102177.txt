    
      Setting The study was conducted on the clinical research unit of an academic medical center.

      Participants Adults of any age being treated with levothyroxine for hypothyroidism were
      studied.

      Interventions A single dose of 13C- LT4 was administered to hypothyroid subjects taking
      levothyroxine replacement.

      Main Outcomes and Measures Eighteen serial plasma samples were collected. One sample was
      obtained before the 13C- LT4 dose and the remainder over the 312-hour period post-dosing.
      13C- LT4 concentration was quantified using validated liquid chromatography tandem mass
      spectrometry methods. Pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using linear log trapezoidal
      non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix 6.4.
