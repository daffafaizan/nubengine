      double-blind (study investigators and participants will not know what treatment is being
      administered), and placebo-controlled (a placebo is identical to the study agent, but
      contains no active ingredients). A total of 160 participants will receive either placebo or
      JNJ-38518168 once daily. The study duration will be approximately 32 weeks and will include a
      screening phase of approximately 4 weeks, a 24-week placebo-controlled treatment phase, and a
      4-week follow-up phase. Participant safety will be monitored throughout the entire study
      period..
