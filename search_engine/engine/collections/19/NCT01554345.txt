      Gelatinase in Neutrophil granules.It is also expressed in epithelial cells of kidney
      tubules.NGAL increases in ischemic and toxic injuries of kidney. During controlled
      hypotension in brain operations injury to the kidneys might occur . This study is designed to
      assess this possibility and evaluate the effect of VitaminE+Selenium on prevention of this
      problem
