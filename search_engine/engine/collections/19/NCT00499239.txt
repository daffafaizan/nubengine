      To assess the safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GS 9219 administered via
      IV administration once every three weeks (21 days) for six treatment cycles, i.e. for a total
      of 18 weeks, in patients with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL),
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) or Multiple Myeloma (MM).

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

      To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of GS 9219 for this regimen and patient
      population.

      To assess the antitumor activity of GS 9219 based on Response Rate and Duration of Response.
      Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival will be assessed if applicable.
