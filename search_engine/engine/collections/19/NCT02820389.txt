      with suspected colorectal cancer (See NG12), there will be an increase in demand for optical
      colonoscopy. Optical colonoscopy is technically difficult, resource intensive and associated
      with complications; therefore the increased use of CT Colonography (CTC) should be considered
      as an alternative. The diagnostic efficacy of CTC, in comparison to optical colonoscopy, is
      well established and has been shown to be accurate for identifying malignancies and medium to
      large polyps (â‰¥6mm) with a greater level of patient acceptability.

      The use of CTC as the first diagnostic imaging tool would identify those patients who would
      benefit from further investigation (colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy) to occur on the
      same day, as well as ruling out those who do not require further testing. This would then
      ensure that colonoscopy capacity can be prioritised appropriately to support the increase in
      demand due to the NICE guidance changes.
