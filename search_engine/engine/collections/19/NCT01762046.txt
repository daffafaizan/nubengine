      related glycemic traits. Study investigators hypothesize that variants in genes that are
      reproducibly associated with type 2 diabetes or related glycemic traits may impact the effect
      of anti-diabetic medications. In particular, sulfonylureas may have differential effects on
      individuals depending on the allelic variant they carry at KCNJ11 E23K; conversely, because
      TCF7L2 is postulated to influence insulin secretion by regulating the action of glucagon-like
      peptide 1 (GLP-1), and sulfonylureas act at a different step in the insulin secretion
      pathway, the effect of sulfonylureas on insulin secretion could be independent of genetic
      variation at TCF7L2. In addition, physiological responses to an insulin secretagogue or an
      insulin sensitizer may shed light on the mechanism of action of reported genetic
      associations.

      Despite the convincing associations of several genetic variants with type 2 diabetes and
      their involvement in physiological pathways involved in drug response, their impact on
      pharmacological interventions has not been systematically examined. The completion of the
      Human Genome Project and the high-density characterization of common human variation in four
      different ethnic groups highlight the promise of genomic medicine. The elucidation of the
      genetic architecture of complex phenotypes may help clinicians understand disease
      heterogeneity, uncover new pathophysiological mechanisms, open the opportunity for novel
      therapeutic interventions, provide predictive diagnostic and prognostic information, and
      allow for individually tailored therapy that takes into account both the probability of
      response and the incidence of drug-induced complications.
