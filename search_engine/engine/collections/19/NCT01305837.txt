      nervous system (CNS). It is presumably T-cell mediated and it is the most common
      non-traumatic cause of disability affecting young people. 85 % of the MS causes starts out as
      relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) and 15 % as primary progressive MS (PPMS). It has been found
      that after 10 years 40-45 % of the RRMS patients will convert to a more progressive state of
      disease, secondary progressive MS (SPMS).

      Until recently it has been believed that the progression seen in MS occurred because of
      axonal loss and neurodegeneration could occur independently of inflammation. Now
      neuropathology studies shows that there is a close association between inflammation and
      neurodegeneration in all stages of MS - also the progressive forms of MS.

      Osteopontin (OPN) is an extracellular matrix protein with chemokine, cytokine and intergrin
      properties. It has multiple immunological functions and is secreted by activated macrophages,
      leukocytes and activated T lymphocytes. It is present in extracellular fluids and is
      up-regulated at sites of inflammation. Increased levels of OPN where reported in the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with MS.

      The main aim of this study is to analyze the effect of cyclic oral methylprednisolone on the
      intrathecal inflammation in patients suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis measured
      by OPN in the CSF. Second the investigators will look at other aims of intrathecal
      inflammation, neurodegeneration, demyelination and safety.
