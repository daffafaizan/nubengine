      abdominal training in reproductive-age patients with stress urinary incontinence.

      This prospective randomized controlled design study included 64 female patients aged 18-49
      years with stress urinary incontinence. The patients were divided into 2 groups (32 PFMT
      "Pelvic Floor Muscle Training" and 32 PFMT+AT "Abdominal Training") by computer-based
      randomization. The stress urinary incontinence type was assessed by a stress test, and the
      pelvic floor muscle strength was measured with a home biofeedback device. Voiding functions
      were assessed by a 3-day voiding diary and uroflowmetric test. The UDI-6 scale was used to
      assess the urinary symptoms, and the IIQ-7 scale was used to assess the quality of life. The
      follow-up measurements of both groups were obtained in the 0th, 4th, and 8th weeks.

      Participation of 29 patients from each group in the study was determined as sufficient to
      test the two-way hypothesis, with an effect size of 0.75, with an alpha level of 0.05, and
      with a power of 80%. However, 32 patients from each group were included as a precaution
      against possible missing data.

      These women were randomly divided into the PFMT+AT (n=32) and PFMT (n=32) groups using a
      computer based randomization scheme. The data were collected from both groups at the 0th,
      4th, and 8th weeks.
