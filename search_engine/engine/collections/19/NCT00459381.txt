      I. Determine the therapeutic efficacy of pazopanib hydrochloride, as measured by 6-month
      progression-free survival (PFS), in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      II. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of this drug, as measured by radiographic response, time to
      progression, and overall survival, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 2 years.
