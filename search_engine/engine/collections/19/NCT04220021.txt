      frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Metformin, a well-tolerated diabetes drug, blocks a key
      pathway for expression of toxic proteins produced from the C9orf72 repeat expansion via
      repeat associated non-canonical start codon - in RNA (non-AUG) (RAN) translation. In mouse
      model of C9-ALS/FTD, metformin treatment decreases RAN protein levels and improves disease
      features. This current study is a small-scale clinical trial to assess the safety and
      potential efficacy of metformin for the treatment of C9-ALS/FTD.
