    
      This study consists of a 3-month period (12 weeks). You will receive study drug (SA100) for a
      2-month period (8weeks) and then will continue to receive study assessements for an
      additional 1 month (4weeks). During the period in which you receive study drug (SA100), you
      will be asked to take the study drug twice a day (once in the morning and once in the
      evening), preferably at the same time each day. You will be assigned to one of three possible
      treatment groups. The three possible treatment groups are SA100 250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg.
      The group you are assigned to at the start of the study will remain the same throughout the
      study.

      Blood samples, stool (feces), and tissue biopsies (up to 3 per region of colon) will be
      collected for testing purposes. These samples may also be kept for several years for future
      research.

      An electrocardigram (ECG, which measures the electrical activity in your heart) will be taken
      at screening and week 2; and a flexible sigmoidoscopy will be performed at screening and week
      8, (flexible tube that visualizes your intestine/colon and allows for tissue and stool to be
      obtained) to confirm your diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, to assess the severity of your
      disease, and for future testing of your tissue.
