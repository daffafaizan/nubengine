      samples from children, young adults and elderly were obtained before and one month after
      vaccination. The quantitative and qualitative response to the vaccine were measured by the
      ELISA and opsonophagocytic killing assay for eight vaccine type serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14,
      18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) and one vaccine-related serotype (6A).
