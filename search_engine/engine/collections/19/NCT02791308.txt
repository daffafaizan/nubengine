    
      Pimecrolimus cream, 1% is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant. Pimecrolimus inhibits T
      cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. Pimecrolimus cream, 1% is
      indicated as second-line therapy for the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of
      mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised adults and children 2 years of
      age and older who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments,
      or when those treatments are not advisable. This study is being conducted to evaluate the
      clinical bioequivalence of sponsor's formulation of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%, the Test product,
      and Elidel Cream, 1%, the Reference product. A vehicle control arm is included to demonstrate
      that the Test and Reference products are active and to establish that the study is
      sufficiently sensitive to detect differences between products.
