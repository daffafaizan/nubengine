      strategy incorporating whole pelvic IMRT followed by an SBRT boost to the prostate with
      neoadjuvant, concurrent, and adjuvant androgen deprivation for a total of 28 months for men
      with unfavorable intermediate or high risk localized prostate cancer.

      The secondary objective is to assess biochemical control at 24 months following the
      experimental treatment strategy by the "Phoenix definition". Patients not meeting these
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria (Phoenix Definition) for failure who undergo salvage
      therapies (such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), radical prostatectomy or
      brachytherapy, or Cryosurgery) should also be declared as failures at the time a positive
      biopsy is obtained or salvage therapy is administered, whichever comes first.

      Another secondary objective is to assess toxicity of the experimental treatment approach as
      scored by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events The third secondary objective is
      to assess prostate organ motion during hypofractionated radiotherapy. To assess motion of the
      prostate during the protracted delivery of hypofractionated radiotherapy as assessed by
      implanted electromagnetic transponder beacons.
