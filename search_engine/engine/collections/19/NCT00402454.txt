      HIV-infected patients. The patients were randomly assigned to one of three regimens, 108 to
      isoniazid for six months (6H), 103 to rifampin and isoniazid for three months (3RH), and 105
      to pyrazinamide and rifampin for two months (2RZ).

      RESULTS: The TB rates (cases per 100 persons/year) in the three treatment groups were 3.4 in
      6H, 4.5 in 3RH and 1.9 in 2RZ. The relative risk for TB with 6H as compared with 2RZ was
      1.76, and with 3RH, 2.34. Twenty-seven percent of the patients voluntarily abandoned
      chemoprophylaxis and 9.7% were withdrawn due to adverse side-effects. Seven patients were
      withdraw due to hepatotoxicity (5 in 6H, 2 in 3RH and 0 in 2RZ). No appreciable differences
      were found among the three regimens.

      CONCLUSION: In our study the 2RZ regimen was as safe as the 6H and 3RH regimens. We have nor
      observed a higher incidence of hepatotoxicity in patients who received 2RZ.
