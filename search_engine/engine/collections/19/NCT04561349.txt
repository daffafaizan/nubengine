      Cerebral Palsy children and compare its results with that of the conservative rehabilitation
      treatment. By training children to walk using task oriented training not only improves their
      walk and balance but also encourage them to actively participate in their own treatment
      process. Task oriented training approach can prove to be an effective technique for those CP
      children who can perform ambulation and have defined targets for gross motor activities
