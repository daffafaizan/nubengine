      assigned to receive either a MIS-QS TKA or a MIS TKA. Proprioception of the knee position
      sense was assessed by the knee angle reproduction test (10~20 degree, 30~40 degree, 80~90
      degree of the knee flexion) prior operation, and 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post
      operation. Paired two-tailed t tests with a level of significance of p < 0.05 were used to
      assess the effect of the different arthroplasty procedure on the postoperative knee joint
      proprioception for all subjects.
