      (unaffected) breast between the aspirin and placebo arms in patients with hormone receptor
      negative or positive breast cancer enrolled in A011502.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. To compare the 2-year mammographic breast density in the
      contralateral (unaffected) breast between the aspirin and placebo arms in patients with
      hormone receptor negative or positive breast cancer enrolled in A011502.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants provide bilateral screening mammogram taken prior to all cancer treatment and
      within 8 weeks prior to registration to A011502 and an annual bilateral mammogram as near as
      possible to 1 year post-registration to A011502 and as near as possible to 2 years
      post-registration to A011502. Participants also undergo collection of blood sample and
      menstrual cycle data within 2 weeks after registration and at 1 and 2 years after
      registration to A011502.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up annually until 10 years from
      registration to study A011502.
