    
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the ability of highly active antiretroviral therapy
      administered to children with HIV-1 infection to effect immunoreconstitution in children with
      HIV-1 infection. In addition, this study will determine the safety of combination therapy
      with ritonavir, nevirapine and stavudine (d4T) as well as the anti-HIV activity of
      combination therapy with ritonavir, nevirapine and stavudine. A total of 25 HIV-1 infected
      children will be studied, including both moderately and severely immunocompromised
      individuals. The children will be treated with ritonavir, nevirapine and stavudine or with
      predefined drug substitutions in the case of intolerance. Immunoreconstitution, defined as
      the repopulation of naive T cells, will be studied by determining the presence and extent of
      production of new naive (thymic derived) CD4+ T cells and their T cell receptor repertoire.
      Drug pharmacokinetic profiles in this regimen will be examined.
