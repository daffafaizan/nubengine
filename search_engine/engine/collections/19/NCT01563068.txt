      tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, applied
      topically to adolescent subjects with moderate plaque psoriasis (defined as a score of 3 on
      the Investigator's Static Global Assessment [ISGA]) involving a minimum of 10% body surface
      area (BSA) excluding the face and scalp, and a minimum of 20% scalp involvement. Subjects
      will be enrolled no more than 2 weeks after Screening. Approximately 30 eligible subjects,
      ages 12 to 16 years, inclusive, will be enrolled to ensure 20 completing subjects.
      Calcipotriene foam will be applied as a thin layer twice a day for 14 days and once on Day 15
      on all treatment areas. Blood samples for the evaluation of albumin adjusted calcium, intact
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH), alkaline phosphatase, magnesium, and phosphorus will be taken at
      Screening and on Day 1 (before the first dose), Day 15 (3 to 9 hours after dosing), and on
      Day 22 if the results from Day 15 show any abnormalities. Serum 25-OH vitamin D
      concentrations will be evaluated on Day 1 (before the first dose). Safety and tolerability
      will be evaluated throughout the treatment period and a 7 day follow-up period. Blood samples
      for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be collected on Days 1 and 15. Urine samples for
      evaluation of calcium/creatinine ratio will be collected before dosing on Days 1 and 15.
