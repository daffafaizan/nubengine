      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LEP-ETU and Taxol in patients with advanced cancer. Patients are
      randomized to determine which drug is administered first. A single dose of LEP-ETU or Taxol
      (Cycle A) will be administered, followed 3 weeks later by a single dose of the other drug
      (Cycle B). Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken before, during, and after the infusion
      of each drug. Following successful completion of both Cycles in this study, patients may be
      eligible for additional cycles of treatment with LEP-ETU in the LEP-ETU-102B extension study.
