        -  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant sequential chemoimmunotherapy
           comprising cetuximab, cisplatin, and docetaxel before radiotherapy and cetuximab
           followed by surgery in patients with resectable stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Chemoimmunotherapy (courses 1-3): Patients receive chemoimmunotherapy comprising
           cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15; cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and
           2; and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) on
           days 3-8 or a single dose of pegfilgrastim the day after chemotherapy. Treatment repeats
           every 3 weeks for 3 courses.

        -  Radiotherapy (course 4): Beginning on day 1 of week 10, patients undergo 3-dimensional
           conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Patients also
           receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Surgery: Beginning 21-28 days after completion of radiotherapy, patients undergo
           surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      every 6 months for 3 years.
