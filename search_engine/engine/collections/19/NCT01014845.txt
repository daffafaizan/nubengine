      the other received hepatitis B vaccine. The study was carried out with two stages. In the
      first stage (phase 3a), 2 645 subjects was enrolled and actively monitored for solicited
      adverse events for 1 month after each injection. Serum samples from all the subjects were
      collected on day 0, 7m, 13m, 19m and timely after then to evaluate the immunogenicity and
      immuno-persistency. In the second stage (phase 3b), another 109 959 subjects was enrolled and
      monitored for solicited adverse events for 1 month after each injection. Serum samples from
      9764 subjects among the phase 3b participants were collected on day 0, 7m, 19m and timely
      after then to evaluate the immunogenicity and immuno-persistency. Serious adverse events
      during the trial were followed up.

      Suspected hepatitis cases were identified through an established active hepatitis
      surveillance system. The sentinels of the system comprised all the healthcare facilities in
      the field. Suspected hepatitis was defined as when patients presented with systemic symptoms
      such as fatigue and/or loss of appetite for more than 3 days with alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT) exceeding 2.5 fold upper limit of normal range (ULN). Paired sera were obtained from
      these patients at the time of presentation and 2-6 weeks later. Sera were tested for the HEV
      antibodies and HEV-RNA.
