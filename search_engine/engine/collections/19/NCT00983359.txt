      Primary

        -  To determine the neurological death rate following the initiation of conformal
           stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with 1-3 brain metastases.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the overall survival rate at 6 months.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival rate or brain metastases recurrence rate at 6
           months.

        -  To determine the time to neurological death, time to systemic death, and Karnofsky decay
           time.

        -  To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with conformal
           stereotactic radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo conformal stereotactic radiotherapy over 5 days to an area
      including 3 mm around the metastases or the surgical cavity. Patients may receive additional
      radiotherapy if symptomatic metastases emerge at different sites.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 2 months and then
      every 3 months thereafter.
