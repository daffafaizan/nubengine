      the patient's ventilator tubing circuit. A sterile Tedlar collection bag will be used to
      connect to the sample port and collect the breath sample. The expiratory limb sample port
      will be utilized to ensure maintenance of the integrity of the ventilator circuitry. The
      breath samples will be analyzed via the ZNose breath analysis system.

      Immediately following collection of breath samples, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) will
      be collected and subjected to bacteriology testing for confirmation of VAP-positive and
      VAP-negative patients.
