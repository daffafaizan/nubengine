      intervention results in significant improvements in measures of depression, anxiety,
      resiliency, optimism, self-perception, and life-satisfaction of psychiatrically hospitalized
      youth up to three months following admission. Secondary aims are to: (1) examine
      participants' strengths profile to identify potential correlates between character strengths,
      psychiatric diagnoses and intervention effectiveness; and (2) determine whether patients who
      continue to incorporate their strengths into coping skills at follow-up assessments exhibit
      greater improvement over-time.

      Participants will be 210 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years admitted to the Child and Adolescent
      Psychiatric Inpatient Program and will be randomized into one of the three groups. All
      participants will complete the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths for Youth (VIA-Youth)
      Survey on their second hospital day and subsequently receive the signature strengths
      intervention (experimental group), coping skills with memory aids comparison exercise
      (positive control group), or coping skills without memory aids (treatment-as-usual control
      group). Outcome measures will be completed by all participants at baseline (day 1 on unit),
      post-treatment (day 4 on unit), and 1- and 3-months following admission. The proposed
      research represents a change in paradigm, as we aim to specifically examine the therapeutic
      benefit of the positive psychology element of our intervention conducted in the pilot study
      among youth with severe mental illness.
