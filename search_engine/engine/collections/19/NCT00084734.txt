      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and recommended phase II dose of this regimen in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the non-dose-limiting toxic effects associated with this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any clinical activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      8 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel, cisplatin, and capecitabine
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least
      6 patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 21 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
