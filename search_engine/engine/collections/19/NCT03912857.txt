      inhibitors in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies in the treatment of colorectal cancer, we
      intend to conduct a single-center, one-arm, open, investigator-initiated clinical study aimed
      at To clarify the efficacy and tolerability of PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 in combination with
      VEGFR2 inhibitor apatinib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer microsatellite
      stabilization, and to explore the tumor tissue and hematological immune molecular markers
      predicting the effectiveness of the protocol. Things. The results of this clinical trial will
      likely increase the objective response rate of advanced colorectal cancer after standard
      treatment, and hopefully find molecular markers that can predict the sensitivity of
      colorectal cancer PD-1 immunotherapy combined with anti-angiogenic targeted therapy.
      Therefore, it has important clinical significance.
