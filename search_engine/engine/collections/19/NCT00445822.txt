    
      Indication:

      Newly diagnosed pediatric patients with bcr-abl-positive CML.

      Design:

      Multicenter, non-randomized, open, prospective clinical trial.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      - assessment of antileukemic activity of imatinib in children and adolescents with
      Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia

      Secondary:

        -  assessment of the time-to event-efficacy variables

        -  correlation of the quality of haematological, cytogenetical and molecular remission in
           children and adolescents with CML on ongoing imatinib therapy with survival

        -  safety of imatinib

      Endpoints:

      Primary:

      - rate of haematological, cytogenetical and molecular remissions

      Secondary:

        -  time to progression

        -  duration of chronic phase

        -  time to loss of response

        -  overall survival

        -  assessment of treatment-related toxicities in children and adolescents.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Newly diagnosed Ph+ or bcr-abl-positive CML- Male and female patients aged 0 to 18 years-
      Written informed consent

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  CML without bcr-abl rearrangement detectable by PCR

        -  Pretreatment with Interferon alpha or any other cytostatic drug with the exception of
           hydroxyurea or anagrelide (Note: anagrelide is not approved in Germany for treatment of
           CML). However, these patients may be registered as observational patients.

        -  Any other severe underlying disease beside CML.

        -  Age > 18 years

        -  Pregnant or lactating women

        -  Subjects unlikely to comply with the requirements of the protocol

      Number of patients to be enrolled: 150

      Recruitment period: 5 years

      Treatment period: 2 years

      Planned start of study: 2007

      Planned end of study: 2013
