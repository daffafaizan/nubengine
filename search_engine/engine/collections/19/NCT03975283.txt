      and post-surgical recovery. Despite advances in post-operative pain management, this remains
      a challenge and opioids continue to dominate as the most widely used analgesia for
      post-surgical pain management. Opioid use especially in the opioid-naive patient carries
      significant short term and long term risks including over dependence and chronic opioid use.

      Movements towards minimizing post-operative opioid use has shown regional anesthetic
      techniques to be highly effective in the management of pain in surgical patients. More
      specifically, liposomal bupivicaine (Exparel) is a novel non-opioid local analgesia that
      takes advantage of a multi-vesicular liposomal system to provide extended analgesia release
      over 72-96 hours.

      The purpose of this study to evaluate the use of liposomal bupivicaine in the management of
      post-operative pain following bariatric surgery via a transversus abdominis plane (TAP)
      block. Patients will be randomized to receiving either liposomal bupivicaine or traditional
      0.25% bupivicaine locally infiltrated at the time of bariatric surgery. Both liposomal
      bupivicaine and traditional bupivicaine will be administered via TAP block after
      identification of planes via laparoscopy by the bariatric surgeon.

      Patients will be followed post-operatively to assess use of opioid analgesia between the two
      arms. In addition, they will be assessed with respect to pain and nausea using analog scores,
      as well as hospital length of stay.
