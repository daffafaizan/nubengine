      days. However, many patients do not improve beyond this initial period in spite of continued
      intensive physical therapy and supportive care. A prospective, randomized trial of the use of
      hyperbaric oxygen treatments in 59 such patients was published in January 2012. That study
      which used 40 hyperbaric oxygen treatments, indicated significant clinical neurological
      improvement in residual motor deficit in patients who had sustained a stroke over a year
      previously. An increase in brain activity in the region immediately surrounding their stroke
      (penumbra) was reported on the basis of SPECT studies. Regions of live cells were determined
      by CT. Because SPECT is primarily a measure of perfusion and not metabolic activity and CT is
      a poor measure of cell life, the investigators plan to assess areas of physiologic/anatomic
      mismatch in similar patients following hyperbaric oxygen treatment by the use of the more
      appropriate and precise tools, PET and MRI.
