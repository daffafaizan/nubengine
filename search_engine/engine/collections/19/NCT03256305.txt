      individualized therapy based on the 'emotional loop destabilization' mechanism of PSD .One
      hundred and twenty participants will be recruited from three centers and randomized with a
      1:1 ratio to receive "Personalized" rTMS treatment or traditional rTMS treatment in addition
      to routine antidepressant treatments.

      Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, after stroke depression (post-stroke depression,
      PSD) cases were collected and randomized into two groups: "individualized" rTMS+ drug
      treatment group and traditional rTMS plus traditional drug treatment group. The main
      indicators were the effective rate of treatment.Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      after stroke depression (post-stroke depression, PSD) cases were collected and randomized

      traditional drug treatment group. The main indicators were the effective rate of treatment.
      The primary outcome is the measurement of 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24)
      scores, the secondary outcomes include National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS),
      Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLs),self-rating anxiety scale(SAS). The record of the
      adverse reactions and sequelae during treatment and follow-up, with a view to providing a
      better clinical method for the treatment of PSD.
