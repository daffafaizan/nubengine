      and clinical characteristics were recorded. The risk factors for the above two problems were
      analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Frequency and percentage were used to indicate
      descriptive research factors. A univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to
      calculate the odds ratio (OR) and to identify preliminary risk factors. The preliminary risk
      factors were further identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
