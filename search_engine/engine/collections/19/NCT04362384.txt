      Patients were randomized into 2 groups:

        -  Experimental group: Patients will receive a treatment with vitamin E ovules, which must
           be placed inside the annus. 1 ovule must be inserted daily during 14 days.

        -  Control group: Patients will receive a treatment with prednisolone ointment, with
           endoanal application 3 times per day during 14 days.

      Bleeding, pain and stinging will be evaluated 14 days after beginning the treatment.
      Quantification of pain will be performed following a visual analogic scale ranging from 0
      (absence of symptoms) to 100 (unbearable symptoms).
