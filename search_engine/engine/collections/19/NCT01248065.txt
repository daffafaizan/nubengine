    
      This is a randomized, double-blind parallel group trial that will enroll individuals who have
      vitamin D insufficiency and asthma with persistent symptoms despite low-dose inhaled
      corticosteroid. Participants on low-dose inhaled corticosteroid will be randomized to add-on
      therapy with either placebo or high-dose vitamin D for a 28-week period. During the inhaled
      corticosteroid-stable phase, participants will remain on low-dose inhaled corticosteroid.
      During the inhaled corticosteroid-taper phase, participants will taper their inhaled
      corticosteroid by 50% at two time-points post-randomization. The investigators will determine
      if the addition of vitamin D reduces the likelihood of treatment failure when compared to
      placebo during both the inhaled corticosteroid-stable and inhaled corticosteroid-taper phases
      of the study. Given the high prevalence of both vitamin D insufficiency and asthma, this
      trial has high potential to impact daily asthma management.
