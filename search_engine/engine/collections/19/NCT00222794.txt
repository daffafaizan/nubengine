      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor on Negative Symptoms and Quality of Life and its safety
      when used in conjunction with an atypical antipsychotic agent in remitted community dwelling
      subjects with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder. Atomoxetine was recently approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children and adults.
      All subjects will receive various psychometric assessments at 2-week intervals for a period
      of 26 weeks. It is hypothesized that subjects treated with Atomoxetine in this 26 week random
      assignment, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, will have a significantly
      greater improvement in quality of life and social functioning.
