      I. To assess the efficacy (response rate & duration of stable disease) of CCI-779
      (temsirolimus) given intravenously (IV) weekly in patients with metastatic and/or locally
      advanced recurrent carcinoma of the endometrium.

      II. To assess the adverse events, time to progression and response duration of CCI-779 given
      IV weekly in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced recurrent carcinoma of the
      endometrium.

      III. To correlate objective tumor response with phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN)
      expression in the tumor tissue obtained at diagnosis (primary tumor).

      IV. To explore the relationship between objective tumor response with other molecular
      measures in diagnostic tumor tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months.
