      recruited material, we found out that the study suture material has been used in 83% of the
      recruited patients. The reasons for this have been clinical issue during the operation where
      melting suture material may not have been needed at all.

      We have decided to prolong recruiting so that we would gather the calculated sample size of
      1500 of patient with study suture material. This will take 12-18 months (probably till autumn
      2015).
