      low back pain. ROM, angular velocities and coordination of the spine will be collected in a
      laboratory with a camera-based system (VICON). Subjects will have to perform normal ROM
      assessment in the three anatomical planes, as well as different functional activities such as
      sit to stand, step and walking. The measurement session will occur on one occasion for each
      participant.
