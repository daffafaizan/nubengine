      ancestry with prostate cancer. The sampling strategy and size of the study population ensure
      that the cohorts is representative, enhancing validity of studies based on this resource. In
      addition, there are no data on the role of smoking in African American prostate cancer. The
      approach to share the resource with Florida prostate cancer researchers is innovative and
      possible because the four annual prostate cancer symposiums organized by Moffitt has unified
      many Florida prostate cancer researchers who are now well connected and actively
      collaborating, as evidenced by publications and funded projects among participants.
