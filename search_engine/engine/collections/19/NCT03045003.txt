      as well as direct feed-back of the screening results on a monitoring sheet to nurses and
      oncologists in charge of the patient. Nurses and oncologists follow three training sessions
      to be trained in a) resilience facilitation, b) interventions to adress supportive care
      needs, c) use of the monitoring sheet.

      structured nurse led consultations, two face to face (F2F), three by phone (PC) provided by
      clinical nurse specialists and based on a consultation manual.
