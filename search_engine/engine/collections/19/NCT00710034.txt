      Subjects will be randomized to the brand of smokeless tobacco that is determined to be most
      effective in Study 1 or to nicotine gum for 12 weeks to compare complete substitution for
      smoking. The secondary aims are to determine the effects of the products on biomarkers of
      exposure and toxicity. Other secondary aim includes examining the effects of the two products
      on withdrawal symptoms. Two sites will be used for these studies: University of Minnesota and
      Oregon Research Institute (ORI).
