      incision techniques require undermined skin flaps to be closed under tension. This study is
      evaluation the open incision breast reduction technique to a liposuction assisted breast
      reduction. This study will evaluate these two breast reduction techniques in terms of
      complication rates, functionality, patient satisfaction, and cosmetic outcomes. Participants
      will be asked to complete the BREAST-Q survey regarding their breast reduction
      postoperatively.
