      efficacy of beta-blocker therapy with carvedilol on RV function in stable PAH Patients with
      World Health Organization (WHO) functional class II or III symptoms and RV ejection fraction
      (EF) < 40%. Twenty-five evaluable patients will be enrolled at the University of Minnesota.

      Specific Aims:

      1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Adult males and females on a stable dose of an approved PAH
      medication will undergo cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), right heart catheterization
      (RHC), echocardiogram, 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), measurement of plasma NT-ProBNP and serum
      catecholamine, and quality of life assessment. Patients will receive carvedilol (3.25 mg/kg
      bid escalating to 25 mg/kg bid over 3 months). Testing is repeated at the end of the study
      (month 6). RVEF measured by cardiac MRI is the primary efficacy endpoint. We define a 5%
      increase in RVEF as a meaningful change.
