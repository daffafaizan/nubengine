      decompensated or advanced stage. The reported prevalence was 10-25% by ultrasound. The effect
      of PVT on the natural history of liver cirrhosis is not clear, especially the non-occlusive
      PVT. According to a recent large prospective study (n=1243), the development of PVT and the
      progression of liver disease are two separate consequences of a common mechanism. It was
      hypothesized that the activation of coagulation factors in the cirrhotic liver or the portal
      venous system is the common mechanism for the progression of liver disease, on the one hand,
      and the development of PVT on the other. A recent randomized clinical trial has shown that
      enoxaparin therapy for 48 weeks can prevent disease progression and PVT in patients with
      Child class B-C cirrhosis. Besides, emerging evidences have shown that 30-50% of patients
      with cirrhosis and partial PVT can achieve this spontaneous recanalization. So what the role
      of anticoagulation played in the management of PVT in liver cirrhosis is still contraversal.
      Anticoagulation therapy was also shown very effective with a high recanalization rate of
      42-100%. But this data was mostly derived from retrospective, non-randomized study and no
      well-designed randomized controlled trial has been conducted to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of anticoagulation for non-occlusive PVT.
