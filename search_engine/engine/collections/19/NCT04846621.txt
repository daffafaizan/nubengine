      weeks of gestation. It may or may not be preceded by preterm labor Preterm labor (PTL) is one
      of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. It is one of the major public
      health problems, especially with reference to mortality, disability and health care expenses

      The diagnosis of preterm labor based upon clinical criteria of regular painful uterine
      contractions occurs between 20 weeks and before 37 weeks gestation accompanied by cervical
      change (dilation and/or effacement). Vaginal bleeding and/or ruptured membranes in this
      setting increase diagnostic certainty , using the following specific criteria:

      Uterine contractions (≥4 every 20 minutes or ≥8 in 60 minutes) Plus one of the following:-

        -  Cervical dilation equal or more than 3 cm

        -  Cervical length less than 20 mm on transvaginal ultrasound

        -  Cervical length between 20 to less than 30 mm on transvaginal ultrasound and positive
           fetal fibronectin test . (This criterion will not be relied upon in this study because
           it is costly and widely not available in most laboratories)

      Since uterine contractions are the most frequently recognized sign of preterm labor,
      inhibition of uterine contractions with tocolytic agents to prolong pregnancy and reduce
      neonatal complications has been and continues to be the focus of treatment of preterm labor

      • Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, could be used as a first line tocolytic agent

      Owing to this side effects of Nifedipine, another novel drug (Nicorandil) is studied and
      according to literature Nicorandil is as effective as Nifedipine for tocolysis in preterm
      labour

      is an anti-angina medication that has the dual properties of a nitrate and ATP-sensitive K+
      channel activator. Nicorandil has proved to be safe as anti angina treatement in pergnency
