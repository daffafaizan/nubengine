    
      Purpose Hypercatabolism and immune suppression are frequently seen in patients with
      malignancy.Preoperative nutritional state is an important factor in determining surgical and
      postoperative complications because the preoperative nutritional status affects the
      postoperative nutritional state, immunity and inflammatory response.In these patients,
      standard parenteral nutrition may not be sufficient to maintain the immunity and provide
      positive or stabilized nitrogen balance. Preoperative and perioperative supplementation with
      immune-enhancing enteral nutrition has been reported to increase total lymphocytes and T
      lymphocytes and decrease circulating levels of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-
      alfa.There is a report which showed that glutamine dipeptide supplemented parenteral
      nutrition improved the cellular and humoral immune functions. The investigators aimed to
      evaluate the effect of postoperative glutamine-dipeptide and/or omega 3 fatty acid
      supplemented parenteral nutrition on the neutrophil functions and postoperative course of
      patients with colorectal cancer.

      Dietary Supplement: Immunonutrition Parenteral nutrition provided 25-30 kcal/kg/day energy
      and 0.15-0.20 g/kg/day nitrogen. The dose of omega 3 fatty acid supplementation was 0.1-0.2
      g/kg /day and it was 0.3-0.4 g/kg/day for glutamine dipeptide supplementation. All nutrient
      substrates were mixed in 3 litre bags and infused in 24 h through a dedicated central venous
      line
