      newborns undergoing circumcision. It is customary to perform a meatotomy in order to prevent
      bladder outlet obstruction, although bladder outlet obstruction has never been proven and
      improvement has only been proved in a single, small, retrospective study. Our intention is to
      evaluate the improvement in objective parameters (uroflow and postvoid residual urine) after
      urethral meatotomy by measuring these parameter before the procedure, one month after the
      procedure and one year after the procedure. Symptoms assessment will also be performed.
