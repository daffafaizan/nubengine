      diseases in the clinic.

      Myofascial release technique is thought to be effective in patients with chronic low back
      pain. Therefore, when the literature is examined, it has been observed that the myofascial
      release technique has studies on pain, range of motion, functionality, muscle stiffness and
      shortness.

      This study will be performed on patients with a total of 42 low back pain. The cases will be
      divided into 2 groups of 21 people by simple random sampling.

      Group 1 (control) will be used with sham diaphragm and iliopsoas muscle myofascial release
      technique and traditional physiotherapy method.

      The second group (experiment) will apply the diaphragm and the myofascial release technique
      of the iliopsoas muscle and the traditional physiotherapy method.

      Patients will be treated for 4 weeks. Traditional physiotherapy method will be applied a
      total of 20 sessions 5 days a week. A total of 12 sessions will be performed, with the
      myofascial release technique of the diaphragm and iliopsoas muscle applied 3 days a week.

      The study focuses on the analysis of the following variables:

      Pain : Numerical Pain Scale

      Joint Range of Motion: Goniometer

      Flexibility: Tape Measure

      Pulmonary Function Test: Spirometer

      Anxiety and Depression: Beck Depression inventory

      Kinesiophobia: Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale

      Disability: Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire

      The results of these pre-intervention and post-intervention variables will be compared
      between the two groups .
