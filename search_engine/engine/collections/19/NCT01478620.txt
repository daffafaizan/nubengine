    
      250 patients total 7-day treatment period with Canephron® N (2 tablets three times a day) and
      a follow-up period until Day 37. A total of three visits are planned on Day 0 (screening,
      start of study treatment), Day 7 (end of study treatment) and Day 37 (end of study visit).

      Additional visits can be performed anytime between Day 1 and Day 37 if deemed necessary by
      the investigator. In case the patients experience consistent or worsening of symptoms they
      may be offered antibiotic therapy at the discretion of the investigator at any time. In this
      case Canephron® N intake will be stopped.

      At least 50% of the patients, i.e. 125 subjects, should have received a 7-day treatment with
      Canephron® N. If less subjects are available recruitment of subjects will be continued until
      the required number of 125 subjects is reached.

      Due to withdrawal of study in Russia total study population was reduced to 125 patients.
