      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of capecitabine.

        -  Define the toxicity profile.

        -  Evaluate potential antitumor activity in terms of objective response, duration of
           response, and time to disease progression.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of capecitabine and irinotecan hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine conducted in two parts.

        -  Part I: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and oral
           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6 months
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of up to 6 patients receive escalating doses (up to 5 dosages) of capecitabine. The
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 50% of patients experience
      toxicity during the first 2 courses of therapy.

        -  Part II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and irinotecan hydrochloride IV
           over 90 minutes on day 1 and oral capecitabine on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 2
           weeks for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of up to 6 patients receive escalating doses (up to 7 dosages) of capecitabine. The
      MTD is defined as in part I.
