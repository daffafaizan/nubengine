      Christian Medical Centre and Mawenzi Saturday Teen Clinics. Participants will be assigned to
      approximately eight to ten persons per group, based on age and sex. Groups will be matched in
      pairs as closely as possible (ex. two groups of females 12-16 years of age) and assigned to
      Wave 1, 2, or 3. Randomization will occur on the individual level and will occur just before
      the start of mental health intervention for each wave. Individuals will be randomized at this
      time point to reduce potential drop out of those with delayed start (Wave 2/3). Randomization
      will occur by a coin flip for two individuals based on alphabetical order: heads will be
      intervention group (I) and tails the standard of care group (SOC).

      This feasibility study is longitudinal with up to 24 month follow-up after intervention.
      Feasibility measures from lay counselors will be monitored weekly. Outcome measures will be
      obtained by blinded interviewers using a structured survey to inquire about mental health
      symptoms, self-report adherence, obtain an ART drug concentration level from a hair sample,
      and HIV-1 viral load from a blood sample and will be collected by the same research
      assistants at five to six potential time points: 1) baseline, 2) pre-intervention, 3)
      post-intervention, 4) 6-months post-intervention, 5) 12-months post-intervention and 6)
      24-months post-intervention.
