      approximately 126 participants.

      Participants will be randomized based on their diagnosis in 2 categories; DS or LGS. The
      study will consist of 2 periods: Screening Period and Treatment Period. The overall duration
      of Treatment Period is up to 20 weeks including 8-week Dose Optimization Period and 12-week
      Maintenance Period. The overall time to participants in this study is approximately 30 weeks.
