      predisposition is poorly understood but parasympathetic dysfunction is heavily implicated.
      Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) protocols currently set for seizure management are poorly
      optimized for cardioprotection, therefore this patient population presents a unique
      opportunity to assess VNS control of cardiac function, when VNS is appropriately titrated for
      cardiac and seizure benefit.

      This study will enroll 20 patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy and previously implanted FDA
      approved VNS devices. The study will last up to 9 weeks and the patient will undergo changes
      to their VNS settings, autonomic testing, cardiopulmonary testing, and maintain a seizure
      diary.
