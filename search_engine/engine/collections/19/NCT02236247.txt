      responses to low cardiac output in patients with decompensated heart failure (DHF). However,
      elevated HR may become inappropriate in these patients, increasing myocardial oxygen demand
      and decreasing diastolic filling time and might lead to hemodynamic deterioration,
      ventricular dysfunction (tachycardiomyopathy) and clinical deterioration.

      Studies show the elevated HR is a predictor of poor prognosis in DHF. Subanalyses of large
      clinical trials using beta blockers (BBs) demonstrate the adequate control of HR correlates
      with a better outcome in patients with stable chronic heart failure (HF). However, use of BBs
      in patients with DHF is limited due to negative inotropic and hypotensive effects of these
      drugs.

      As alternative to BBs, ivabradine has shown to increase survival of patients with chronic
      stable systolic HF. Compared to BBs, ivabradine has the advantage of "pure" negative
      chronotropic effect, no effect on myocardial contractility or peripheral vascular resistance.
      Despite the inhibition of I (f) has been validated as a therapeutic option in patients with
      stable HF, there are no studies available on this strategy in patients with DHF.

      We hypothesized that HR control by ivabradine might improve clinical, hemodynamic and
      neurohormonal parameters in patients with DHF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      efficacy of HR control with ivabradine in patients with DHF.
