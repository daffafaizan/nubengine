      parallel-group, Phase 1 study in morbidly obese and non-obese men and women. A total of 25
      patients (12 morbidly obese and 13 non-obese) patients will be enrolled in the study.
      Morbidly obese and nonobese patients are matched individually 1:1 by age (Â±10 years), sex,
      and renal function (as defined by creatinine levels in the urine). There are 4 phases in the
      clinical study: the pretreatment (screening/baseline) phase of up to 21 days; the 2-day
      open-label treatment phase when each patients receives a single 2-hour intravenous (directly
      into the vein) infusion of ceftobiprole 500 mg followed by multiple (up to 15) blood and
      urine samples drawn over the 24 hours following study drug administration; and the follow-up
      phase of approximately 1 week after the last blood sample when each patient will be monitored
      by telephone for development of new adverse events and assessment of ongoing adverse events.
      Each patient receives a single 2-hour infusion (directly into the vein) of ceftobiprole 500
      mg
