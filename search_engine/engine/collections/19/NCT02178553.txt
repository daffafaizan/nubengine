      provides pain control as effectively as a continuous thoracic epidural, and will a lower
      incidence of side effects. Although the anesthesiologists involved in providing care for
      patients having thoracotomy incisions at St. Mary's Hospital are experts at placing thoracic
      epidural catheters, this study will attempt to show that a less technically challenging
      procedure done by surgeons intra-operatively can provide comparable pain relief.
