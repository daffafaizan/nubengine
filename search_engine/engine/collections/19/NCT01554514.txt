    
      This is a pilot safety/efficacy study of adjuvant low dose rituximab (100 mg/week x 4 doses)
      plus standard plasma exchange and corticosteroids for the treatment of thrombotic
      thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. Results for study subjects
      will be compared to historical controls treated initially with plasma exchange and
      corticosteroids. This study proposes to test the hypothesis that adjuvant low dose rituximab
      may decrease the incidence of a composite primary endpoint (exacerbations or refractory
      disease) in acquired TTP with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. A novel ADAMTS13 assay will be used
      to identify patients with TTP and severe ADAMTS13 deficiency for enrollment, and to assess
      the utility of ADAMST13 as a biomarker for response to therapy and prognosis.
