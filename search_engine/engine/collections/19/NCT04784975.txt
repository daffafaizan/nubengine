      glycemia/glycemic variability in those with preclinical and clinical diabetes. Our primary
      and secondary outcomes are to characterize these variables, with our long term objectives to
      better understand the natural history of bone health in T1D, help characterize the etiology
      of worse bone health in those with T1D, and try to identify potential time periods for
      intervention.
