      non-inferiority in 90-day mortality. Hospitals with a pre-intervention protocol adherence of
      >70% are excluded from the primary analysis. Primary analysis will be done with a mixed
      effects model with a random effects for clusters and time. Crude outcomes and outcomes
      adjusted for potential confounders will be reported. Primary analysis will be tested
      one-sided for a decrease in mortality. Secondary analysis to test two-sided for mortality
      will be performed.
