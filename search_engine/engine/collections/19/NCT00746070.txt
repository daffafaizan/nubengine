      claimed to lead to endothelial dysfunction, a condition related to development of
      cardiovascular disorders and to poor prognosis. However, studies of aldosterone effects on
      endothelial function led to discrepant findings, which may be related, at least in part, to
      inhomogeneity of the populations studied. Thus, studies in healthy subjects showed no
      detrimental effects of aldosterone on endothelial function and no positive effect of
      aldosterone inhibition, whereas populations with established cardiovascular diseases showed
      negative effects of aldosterone and positive effects of spironolactone therapy. Still, other
      factors may be of importance as effects of aldosterone on endothelial function are not
      homogenous even in a healthy population. Dosages of aldosterone, concomitant drug use, as
      well as the vascular bed investigated may influence the effects observed.

      Furthermore, little is known about chronic endothelial effects of aldosterone that could
      indicate a primary and direct role of aldosterone in development of cardiovascular diseases.
      In patients with hyperaldosteronism diminished flow-mediated dilation was found, indicating
      impaired endothelial function compared with hypertensive patients without elevated
      aldosterone. However, it is not known whether these results represent endothelial dysfunction
      as the result of a direct aldosterone effect on the vasculature or a secondary effect
      attributable to more substantial hypertension.
