      receiving influenza vaccine for the first time. While the scientific support for 2 doses of
      vaccine in infants and toddlers is sound, the need for 2 doses of vaccine for adequate
      immunogenicity in older children is less certain. If the immunogenicity of a one-dose vaccine
      regimen is comparable to a two-dose regimen, then one dose would be preferable for reasons of
      safety, practicality and economics, and would reduce a major barrier to vaccination in this
      injection-adverse age group. This study compared the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of one
      versus two doses of influenza vaccine in children aged 5 to 8 years old receiving influenza
      vaccine for the first time. All children enrolled in the study received two doses of vaccine,
      and the immune response after one dose of vaccine was compared to the immune response after
      two doses of vaccine.
