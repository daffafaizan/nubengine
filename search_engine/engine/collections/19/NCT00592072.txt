    
      Twelve subjects between the ages of 18 years and 55 years who have had Type 1 Diabetes
      Mellitus for more than five years and have had tight control of their diabetes as determined
      by screening blood work will be invited to participate. Each study subject will undergo two
      hypoglycemic clamp studies (a procedure where the blood sugar is closely regulated with
      intravenous insulin and glucose.) In these hypoglycemic clamp studies, cognitive testing will
      be performed during 90 minutes of normal blood glucose followed by 90 minutes of
      hypoglycemia. During the hypoglycemic period, either the MCFA or a placebo will be
      administered. Each subject will experience both conditions. The order in which the MCFA is
      given will be randomized.
