      follows: 1) Control group received 15 mg levobupivacaine intrathecally and intravenous 0.9%
      sodium chloride; 2) Intravenous group received 15 mg levobupivacaine intrathecally and
      intravenous dexmedetomidine (1mcg/kg/10min, 0.5mcg/kg/h infusion) ; 3) Intrathecal group
      received 15 mg levobupivacaine + 3 mcg dexmedetomidine intrathecally and intravenous 0.9%
      sodium chloride.

      Throughout the study period,shivering scores, tympanic temperature were recorded, heart rate
      were measured continuously using an electrocardiogram; blood pressure was determined
      oscillometrically at 5 min intervals at the ankle. In case heart rate decreased by more than
      30% of the baseline atropin received and blood pressure decreased 30% of the baseline
      effedrin received.

      Side effects (bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, nausea and vomiting etc ) were recorded
      peroperatively in the operating room and postanesthetic care unit.
