      I. To compare the effectiveness of 2 GVHD prophylaxis regimens in preventing acute grades
      II-IV GVHD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare non-relapse mortality in the 2 arms.

      II. Compare survival and progression-free survivals in the 2 arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients receive FLU intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2 followed by 2-3
      Gy TBI on day 0.

      ARM 0: Patients receive CSP orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 96 with taper to day
      150 and and sirolimus PO once daily (QD) on days -3 to 150 with taper to day 180. Arm removed
      as of 14-Sep-2011

      ARM I: Patients receive CSP orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 96 with taper to day
      150 and MMF PO three times daily (TID) on days 0-29 and then BID on days 30-150 with taper to
      day 180.

      ARM II: Patients receive CSP as in Arm I and sirolimus PO once daily (QD) on days -3 to 150
      with taper to day 180. Patients also receive MMF PO TID on days 0-29 and then BID on days
      30-40. MMF will then be discontinued without taper unless GVHD or disease relapse/progression
      occurs.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT on day 0 following the TBI.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
