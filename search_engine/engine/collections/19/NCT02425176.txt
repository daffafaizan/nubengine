      To determine the efficacy, safety, tolerability and adverse effects of three doses of
      Dysport® (50MU, 100MU and 200MU) in the treatment of sialorrhoea in Asian patients with
      neurological disorders/diseases and to determine the most efficacious dose.

      Study design:

      Dose-ranging double blind pilot study.

      Sample size:

      At least 30 adult patients with various neurological disorders complicated with sialorrhoea
      including stroke, motor neurone disease, traumatic brain injury and Parkinsonism would be
      divided into 3 dosing groups.

      Study method:

      Patients who satisfy inclusion criteria and have given informed consent would be randomized
      into 3 equal groups given different total doses-50MU, 100MU, 200MU. The total dose will be
      divided equally and give to each of 4 salivary glands viz. the submandibular and parotid
      gland bilaterally. For example, if 200MU is to be given in total, 50MU would be given to each
      gland. Injections would be given via a 25G needle to each gland with ultrasound guidance for
      better needle placement. One site will be injected per gland.

      Primary outcome measure The percentage reduction in the rate of saliva production (as
      measured by difference in mean weight of dental rolls per minute from baseline) for each of
      the groups given different doses of Dysport® at 2,6,12 and 24 weeks post injection.

      Secondary outcome measure

        1. Patient's subjective assessment of improvement in sialorrhoea using the Drooling
           Frequency and Severity Scale (Thomas-Stonell scale) at 2,6,12 and 24 weeks
           post-injection.

        2. Duration to maximum reduction in salivation (as measured by the maximum reduction in
           weight of dental rolls)
