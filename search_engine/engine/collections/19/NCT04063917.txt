    
      After indicating their consent to contact and signing an Informed Consent Form, potential
      participants will undergo a screening assessment that includes a review of their medical
      history, a focused physical exam, and a level 3 at-home sleep test (Sagatech SnoreSat Sleep
      Recorder, Philips Alice OneNight or equivalent), if not already available in the medical
      records). At the screening visit potential participants' eligibility for the study will be
      evaluated against the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Following confirmation of eligibility, up to 45 (n=45) participants will be scheduled for
      their overnight in-laboratory PSG, which must occur no more than 12 weeks after screening has
      taken place. A final determination of eligibility and "enrollment" is completed when
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified on the day of the study visit. Those who do not
      meet inclusion and exclusion criteria on the day of the study will be deemed "screening
      failures".

      Participants will wear the ZENS Device for the 8 to 12-hour overnight in-laboratory
      polysomnography assessment. Participants will be monitored for and asked about any adverse
      events and device effects that they experience during the overnight sleep study.

      Participants will be contacted by the site via telephone 24 to 96 hours after the overnight
      sleep study to determine if any adverse events and device effects were experienced late after
      the overnight polysomnography. After the telephone follow-up, participation in the study is
      complete.
