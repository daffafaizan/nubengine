      lower body weights and younger ages than white Europeans. Lower cardiorespiratory fitness and
      capacity for muscle fat oxidation contributes substantially to SAs' greater insulin
      resistance, the extent to which this can be improved by exercise training is unclear. This
      randomised controlled trial will investigate the effects of a 12-week aerobic or resistance
      exercise training intervention on insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp)
      in South Asian adults (22 control, 22 aerobic exercise group and 22 resistance exercise
      group). The study will also explore the mechanisms within skeletal muscle which mediate these
      changes by evaluating aerobic and resistance exercise-training induced changes: in basal and
      insulin-stimulated microvascular blood volume (using contrast-enhanced ultrasound); skeletal
      muscle mitochondrial function; and lipid droplet morphology and spatial interaction with
      mitochrondria, muscle fibre capillarisation, endothelial content of key enzymes controlling
      dilation/constriction and GLUT-4 translocation (using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy
      and transmission electron microscopy methods). Thus, this work will integrate physiological
      and molecular data to determine the extent to which exercise training can improve insulin
      sensitivity in SA and the mechanisms underpinning this improvement. This knowledge is
      important for optimising diabetes prevention interventions in SAs and identification of
      potential novel therapeutic targets.
