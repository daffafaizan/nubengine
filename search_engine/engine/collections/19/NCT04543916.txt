      escalation design will be followed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax has
      been determined. Once the MTD is established, a RP2D that is the same as or less than the MTD
      will be determined. If no RP2D can be determined, the study will close to accrual. The RP2D
      will be used in an expansion cohort based on a Simon's two-stage minimax design to evaluate
      efficacy.
