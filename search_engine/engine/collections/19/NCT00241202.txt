      symptoms, such as pain, diarrhea, fever, fatigue, depression, and confusion. These symptoms
      have been found to restrict a person's daily life significantly. Self-management of multiple
      HIV and medication side effects symptoms and maintaining optimal quality of life have,
      therefore, become major daily tasks for people living with HIV/AIDS.

      This study is a randomized controlled trial with a two-group repeated measures design to test
      the efficacy of the symptom management manual. Two groups (experimental and control) will be
      assessed in a repeated measures design at 3 time points: baseline (time 0), one month (time
      1), and two months (time 2). Data will be analyzed using longitudinal mixture modeling.

      Comparison(s): HIV-positive patients receiving a symptom management manual and orientation to
      the manual, compared to HIV-positive patients receiving a nutrition manual and orientation to
      the manual.
