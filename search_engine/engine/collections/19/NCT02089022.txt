      foot, ankle and calf. To assess the neuromuscular response was evaluated electromyographic
      activity of the rectus femorals, biceps femorals, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. To
      assess the effect of applications on balance, through a force platform was evaluated
      oscillation of the center of pressure as well as ground reaction forces.
