      Lecture, postulated that altered fuel metabolism during pregnancy had a long lasting
      metabolic effect on the offspring. Although in the intervening years the focus has largely
      been on maternal glucose as the principal fetal fuel, animal studies have documented that
      other nutrients such as lipids can also be transferred across the placenta. Furthermore, the
      latter part of pregnancy is associated with a significant hyperlipidemia including
      hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Although the relation of maternal lipids
      during pregnancy to birth outcomes is well documented, few studies have examined this
      relation to longer term outcomes. Such an association, if present, would lend further support
      to the presence of developmental programming in the offspring based on fuel mediated
      teratogenesis.

      Against such a background, the aim of this study was to examine the association between
      maternal lipids during pregnancy and later offspring adiposity controlled for relevant
      confounders including maternal body mass index (BMI), gestational glycemia and offspring
      birth weight.

      The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study was an international multicentre
      epidemiologic study that examined the associations of hyperglycemia during pregnancy to
      adverse maternal/fetal pregnancy outcomes. Eligible pregnant women attended the Royal
      Victoria Maternity Hospital for an oral glucose tolerance test between 24-32 weeks gestation
      to assess glucose tolerance. An additional fasting serum sample for analysis of lipids was
      taken.

      The mothers and their offspring were invited to return to the study 5-7 years later. At this
      visit, offspring weight, height and skin fold thickness measurements were taken.
