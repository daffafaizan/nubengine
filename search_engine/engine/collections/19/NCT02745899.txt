      evaluated. 50 asthmatic and 50 healthy children aged 6-18 will drink 240 ml of cow milk or
      soy milk substitute. Respiratory symptoms by questionnaire and physical examination will be
      evaluated. Airway response and inflammation will be assessed by fraction of exhaled Nitric
      Oxide (FENO) and spirometry before and after the exposure.
