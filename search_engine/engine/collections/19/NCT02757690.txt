    
      Procedures

        1. the investigators will take the patient consent for this clinical trial.

        2. The participants will be divided with two groups with block randomized method

        3. Skillful pancreatic surgeon will perform 2D or 3D laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.

        4. The participants will be monitor the intraoperative and postoperative course.

      Data collection

        1. operation video : operation time, number of errors (missed grasp, loss of material)

             1. Segmental operation time according to procedure

             2. Numbers of errors during operation

        2. clinical parameters:

             1. Blood examination : complete blood count (hemoglobin, white blood cell count),
                amylase, lipase, etc.

             2. Radiological examination: X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance
                Imaging (MRI), etc

             3. Medical records : hospital stay after operation, the time to eating, pathologic
                examination

        3. Subjective scoring in the view of operator, 1st assist.

             1. Scoring for imaging quality

             2. Scoring for harms of 3D/2D laparoscopic system

             3. Scoring for overall demand
