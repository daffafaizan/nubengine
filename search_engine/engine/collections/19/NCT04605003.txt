      after each clinical examination. The conventional autoclave is no longer used in the setting
      of an otorhinolaryngology (ORL) clinic as it is cumbersome and takes a lot of time, and also
      only cleans one endoscope at a time. There is no standardisation or device that has been
      reported, and cross contamination has been reported previously. The overturn of patients in
      the ORL clinic is high, and most practitioners chooses high level disinfectant as a method of
      sterilising the endoscopes. However, there is no proper device to place these disinfectants
      in, and results in many cases of broken scopes and cross contamination.

      This study compares the sterility of the rigid endoscopes after being sterilised by the high
      level disinfectant that is placed in a novel rig-S device with the gold standard conventional
      autoclave.

      The investigators selected all the rigid endoscopes performed in our ORL clinic and
      randomised them before subjecting them for a swab test for bacterial and fungal, and also
      used a test kit to test the presence of Hepatitis B.
