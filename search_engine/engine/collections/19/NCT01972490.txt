      colorectal adenocarcinoma with RAS mutant liver-confined metastases deemed non-resectable.
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus avastin (arm A) or
      chemotherapy alone (arm B). Treatment will continue until tumor response indicates
      suitability for surgery for liver metastases or until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxic effects. The primary endpoint is the conversion rate to radical resection for liver
      metastasesï¼Œwhich will be assessed by local multidisciplinary team (includes more than three
      liver surgeons and one radiologist) with the use of contrast-enhanced CT or MRI after 4
      cycles and then every other 4 cycles up to 12 cycles. To provide an objective assessment of
      changes in resectability, radiological images will be presented by a radiologist to more than
      3 liver surgeons, who are blinded to the clinical data. Patients will be considered
      resectable if 50% or more of surgeons vote for radical resection of LM. For patients whose
      liver-metastases are assessed resectable, resection should be scheduled to be performed
      within 2~3 weeks of the last treatment cycle. Following resection, patients will be advised
      to continue the same therapeutic regimen until the treatments reach a sum of 12 cycles.
