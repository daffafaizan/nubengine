    
      Primary Objective: Determine the maximum (no greater than 125 mg) dose of infigratinib used
      in combination with the FDA-approved dose and schedule of tamoxifen (Cohort 1) in terms of
      the number of dose-limiting toxicities observed in the first 2 cycles of therapy in subjects
      with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Estimate the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (serious and non-serious).

        -  Estimate the objective tumor response rate (ORR) in subjects with measurable disease.

        -  Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS).

        -  Estimate the durable clinical benefit rate.
