      I. To reduce acute care utilization by 2-5% for advanced cancer patients by training and
      deploying health care coaches who help patients and families discuss care goals, virtual
      modalities, engage in shared-decision-making, and participate in educational activities.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To improve patients' experience of their care. II. Improve patient understanding of
      advanced care planning. III. To improve the receipt of goal concordant care. IV. To reduce
      total healthcare costs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive usual care.

      ARM B: Patients undergo health care coach support with a baseline introduction (either
      telephonic or in-person) of the program followed by a visit (telephonic or in-person) with
      the health care coach after the first oncology appointment to discuss goals of care. The
      health care coach will contact patient based on patients' ongoing needs (weekly to monthly)
      and will conduct symptom assessments based on patients' treatment plans and symptoms.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 6 months.
