      worldwide, affecting over 30% of older adults. It represents a major global health and
      economic burden to individuals and society. The rates of KOA have more than doubled in the
      past 70 years and continue to grow sharply, given increases in life expectancy and population
      body mass index (BMI). Surgery is often employed to treat KOA, but it is associated with a
      high rate of persistent pain, and is not a permanent solution. Numerous nonsurgical therapies
      have been advocated to treat pain in patients with KOA yet are not often used in clinical
      care. The limited pain relief and functional improvement seen in a subset of knee OA
      sufferers has led to a high rate of opioid use and disability in this population. The
      overarching goal of this study is to conduct a sequential parallel group randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of conservative behavioral
      and non-opioid pharmacological treatments (Phase 1) and, among those that indicate interest
      in obtaining further treatment and those not eligible for conservative treatment, the
      benefits of procedural interventions (Phase 2). This study will also evaluate whether
      clinical and psychosocial phenotypes predict short- and longer-term treatment response. The
      results of this study will examine the effectiveness of each tested intervention and provide
      meaningful information regarding effectiveness across key subgroups of participants.
