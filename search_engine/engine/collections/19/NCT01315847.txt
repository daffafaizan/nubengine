      was started ~3 hours post telcagepant to coincide with the Tmax of the 1120 mg dose. For the
      140 mg (i.e., therapeutic) telcagepant dose, [11C]MK-4232 was administered and PET scan was
      started ~2 hours post telcagepant to correspond with the timing of clinical efficacy
      measurements of telcagepant for migraine treatment in Phase III studies.
