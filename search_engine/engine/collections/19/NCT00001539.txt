      how much has been learned about Lyme borreliosis in the past decade, there are still many
      remaining areas of uncertainty. One fundamental question is whether persistent signs and
      symptoms of disease, despite the administration of what is currently considered to be
      adequate antibiotic therapy, are due to ongoing active borrelial infection, to a
      post-infectious syndrome, to irreversible sequelae of earlier tissue injury or due to a
      condition unrelated to Lyme disease. Reliable objective markers of infection, of clinical
      status and of host responses to the organism are required to discern the scope and the
      implications of persistent borrelial infection, the effectiveness of current treatment
      options, and the development of new therapeutic approaches. The goal of this study is to
      assemble and follow a well-characterized cohort of patients with post-treatment Lyme disease
      syndrome and relevant controls that will yield a prospective database upon which stringent
      diagnostic criteria can be established and future therapeutic trials can be designed.
