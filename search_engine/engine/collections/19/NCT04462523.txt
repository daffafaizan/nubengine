      investigate the outcomes of patients undergoing vitro-retinal surgery with the treatment of a
      dexamethasone intracanalicular insert. All patients in the treatment groups will receive a
      dexamethasone intracanalicular insert. There will be three experimental groups of patients,
      varying that time of insertion. Ten patients will receive the dexamethasone intracanalicular
      insert pre-operatively (1 week to 1 days prior to vitreo-retinal surgery). Ten patients will
      receive dexamethasone intracanalicular insert on the day of surgery. Ten patients will
      receive DEXTENZA insert Day 1 post-operatively. Ten patients will be prescribed standard of
      care ophthalmic drops, Prednisolone Acetate, and no dexamethasone insert (control group). All
      patients no matter what cohort will receive Gentamicin, antibiotic ophthalmic drops.
