      consolidation therapy can decrease the number of cancer cells that may be left in the bone
      marrow or in the blood in patients who have been treated with venetoclax for at least one
      year. Consolidation therapy is given after initial cancer treatment to further reduce the
      number of cancer cells that may be left in the body. Cirmtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that
      inhibits receptor tyrosine kinase like orphan receptor (ROR1) signaling and stemness, may be
      effective in reducing the risk of disease progression in patients with detectable minimal
      residual disease (MRD) after treatment with venetoclax.
