    
      Infertile PCOS patients who remain anovulatory after CC or metformin treatment will be
      enrolled. All patients will receive gonadotropins in low-dose step-up protocol for COS, and
      randomized to receive three trials of TI (group A) or IUI (group B).

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluations.

      In all patients the COS will be obtained using highly purified urinary FSH in a low-dose
      step-up protocol, and both TI and IUI will be performed after 35 hours from ovulation
      induction with human chorionic gonadotropin.

      During the study, the clinical and reproductive outcomes, the adverse experience will be
      evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant. Continuous variables will be analyzed with the unpaired t
      test and general linear model for repeated measures analysis with Bonferroni test for the
      post-hoc analysis as required. For categorical variables, the Pearson chi-square and Fisher's
      exact tests will be used. Cumulative pregnancy rate, our primary end-point, will be
      calculated by the Kaplan-Maier method, and the differences between the two groups will be
      assessed with the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards model will be used to calculate the
      hazard ratio for new pregnancy in both groups.
