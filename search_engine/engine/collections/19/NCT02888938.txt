      simultaneously with pelvic radiographs in 173 patients. After harmonization, readers will be
      tested for inter-reader reproducibility for modified New York criteria, and scoring of each
      structural elementary lesion depicted on MRI (erosions, fat metaplasia, backfill, sclerosis
      and ankylosis) and on CT-scan (erosion, joint space narrowing, sclerosis and ankylosis). When
      acceptable inter-reader reproducibility will be obtained, exams will be blindly and
      independently scored by 2 readers (rheumatologist and/or radiologist) in the following order:
      1/ pelvic radiographs, 2/ MRI, 3/ CT-scan. In case of discordance between readers for the
      diagnosis of sacroiliitis, an adjudicator will define the final diagnosis for each imaging
      method (senior rheumatologist or radiologist). Severity of each structural lesion will be
      scored quantitatively according to structural SPARCC approach. Only lesions observed in the
      synovial part of the SIJ on 2 successive slices will be taken into account.

      Sensibility, specificity and concordance for the diagnosis of structural sacroiliitis for
      radiograph and MRI will be calculated with the CT-scan considered as the gold standard.
      Quantitative MRI and CT scores will be compared for each lesion: erosion, sclerosis and
      ankylosis. This quantitative approach will be used to explain cases of discordance or
      concordance for radiograph and MRI.
