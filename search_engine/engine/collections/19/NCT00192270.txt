    
      This was a phase II, prospective, open-label, multicenter, outpatient study designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of one or two doses of CAIV-T in
      children and adolescents between 6 and 17 years of age. Subjects were allocated to one of
      three study groups according to age at the time of enrollment: study group one consisted of
      subjects between 6 and 9 years of age, group two of subjects 10 to 12 years of age, and group
      three of subjects 13 to 17 years of age.

      Approximately 450 subjects (ie, 150 subjects per age group) participated in the study and
      were scheduled to receive two intranasal doses of CAIV-T separated by 35 Â± 7 days in an
      open-label manner.
