      Clinic, which is an inpatient program to address morbid obesity in adults. The study is a
      non-randomized clinical trial comparing the acute and long-term effects on physical and
      psychological health of the 10-14-weeks inpatient comprehensive lifestyle modification
      program for the treatment of morbidly obese patients.

      In between the inpatient stay, the patients are followed up either by telephone, occasional
      mail and/or structured / weekly email.

      In this project we prospectively follow two groups of patient included in the treatment
      programme in September 2010 and January 2011, respectively. In addition a control group with
      waiting-list patients is also included in the study, and they were recruited in
      October-November 2011
