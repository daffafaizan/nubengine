      dose of a probiotic can reduce the risk of developing beta-cell autoimmunity in children
      identified by GPPAD-02 as being genetically predisposed to developing type 1 diabetes.
      Children will be enrolled at age 7 days to 6 weeks (+14 days) and the study product (B.
      infantis EVC001 or Placebo) will be administered orally once per day from enrollment until
      age 12 months (+14 days).

      The hypotheses is that administration of B. infantis may have a positive influence on the
      intestinal flora and thus have a regulating effect on the immune system. The study is
      designed to investigate whether pathogenic immune reactions as in type 1 diabetes but also in
      other diseases, such as celiac disease, can be reduced and if the disease can be prevented.

      Children will be followed until age 3.5 - 6.5 years (2.5 - 5.5 years after end of treatment).

      Throughout the study data will be collected by regular study visits, phone calls with the
      families and electronic questionaires.

      Blood samples will be collected to investigate glucose, HbA1c, beta-cell autoantibodies,
      transglutaminase antibodies, vaccine responses, genetic susceptibility and mechanistic
      markers. Stool samples will be collected for further assessments such as
      colonization,microbiome, pH and calprotectin.

      Exploratory outcomes (allergy, vaccine responses, stool microbiome, blood metabolomics, stool
      pH and calprotectin or site specific ancillary measurements) may be assessed or in part
      assessed on a portion of the participants after unblinding the study. They may not
      necessarily be included in the primary outcome analysis and publication.
