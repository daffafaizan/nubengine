      office visits between adult patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma and their medical
      oncologists in a community practice setting. The study will focus on the negotiation of the
      illness narrative and the semiotic (primarily linguistic) tools employed. The study will
      involve patients from a large community cancer center from Northeastern Pennsylvania (this
      center sees about 3,000 new patients each year). About 85% of patients with cancer in the
      United States are treated in this type of setting (National Cancer Institute, 2007), and so
      many results from this population are applicable to most cancer patients in the United
      States. The location of this study makes it very different from the majority of medical
      anthropological studies that are usually performed in urban academic medical centers or in
      sites outside of the United States or Western Europe. Although community cancer centers are
      the location of most of the treatment of patients with cancer in the United States, there are
      few to no studies published studying this patient population.
