      brain hypoperfusion syndrome should be finished assessment in two years. The 80 patients with
      hypoperfusion syndrome were divided into as follows:1) control group, receiving siwu tang
      placebo 3 g bid continuously two weeks except ordinary treatment; 2) treatment group,
      receiving siwu tang 3 g bid continuously two weeks except ordinary treatment. The patients
      were assessed before, and 4 weeks (weeks±3 days) and 12 weeks (12 weeks±3 days) after siwu
      tang treatment, respectively. Primary outcome measure was cerebral blood flow by using single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); Second outcome measure included severity of
      dizziness by using visual analogue scale (VAS); cognitive function by using Mini-Mental
      Status (MMSE), Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), and Clinical Dementia Rating
      (CDR); quality of life by using barthel index (BI) and Functional Independent Measure (FIM).

      We predict that siwu tang can improve cerebral blood flow, and clinical manifestation
      including dizziness, and cognition function and quality of life in patients with brain
      hypoperfusion syndrome .
