      control group. In the Experimental Group (Group 1) we will enroll adult participants with TBI
      with persistent post-concussion symptoms or abnormalities on neuropsychological testing. In
      Group 2 we will enroll adult participants to serve as age and gender-matched healthy
      controls. Our goal is to recruit 100 subjects total in two groups of age and gender matched
      subjects, as follows: TBI (n = 50) and non-TBI (n = 50).

      Participants in both groups will undergo NIRS testing with hypercapnia challenge, to measure
      the increase in hemodynamic flow signal during hypercapnia challenge via 2 methods, the
      breath holding and the Douglas bag methods. We will test intersessional validity of the
      NIRS-hypercapnia challenge in the first 20 (10 TBI and 10 non-TBI) subjects who are willing
      to return for a second visit of repeat testing.

      The NIRS system is composed of 4 light sources and 10 detectors with a 16 point configuration
      system applied on the forehead of the subject. In our experiment, light intensity collected
      at each detector will be transformed into a signal related to the local concentrations of
      oxy- and de-oxyhemoglobin during the challenge. Each experiment will give a set of subject
      data, consisting of the peak amplitude and time-to-peak of the hemodynamic signals measured.
