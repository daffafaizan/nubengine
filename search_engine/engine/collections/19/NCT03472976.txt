    
      This is a Phase I randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 50 males and
      non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity,
      and immunogenicity of inactivated A/H5N1 influenza vaccine administered intradermally (ID)
      with topical Aldara or control cream as a 2-dose regimen. The vaccine will be administered
      using the MicronJet600(TM) device. Subjects will be assigned randomly to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms (25 subjects per treatment arm) to receive 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID with
      topical Aldara or control cream. Group A will receive two doses of A/H5N1 IIV (9 mcg HA/dose)
      ID with pre-application of topical Aldara on Days 1 and 22. Group B will receive two doses of
      A/H5N1 IIV (9 mcg HA/dose) ID with pre-application of topical control cream on Days 1 and 22.
      The duration of this study will be approximately 20 months with patient participation
      duration approximately 7 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the
      safety and reactogenicity after 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV vaccine containing 9 mcg HA per dose
      administered ID approximately 21 days apart with topical Aldara or control cream; 2) to
      assess the serum HAI antibody responses 21 days after receipt of the 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV
      administered ID at 9 mcg HA per dose with topical Aldara or control cream. The secondary
      objectives are: 1) to assess unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) following receipt
      of 2 doses of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID approximately 21 days apart with topical Aldara or
      control cream; 2) to assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) including new-onset
      chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs), and potentially immune mediated medical conditions
      (PIMMCs) following receipt of two doses of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID approximately 21 days
      apart with topical Aldara or control cream for six months after last vaccination; 3) to
      assess the serum neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses 21 days following receipt of the 1st
      and 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID with topical Aldara or control cream; 4) to assess
      the serum HAI antibody responses 21 days following receipt of the 1st dose of A/H5N1 IIV
      administered ID with topical Aldara or control cream; 5) to assess the serum HAI and Neut
      antibody responses 7 days following receipt of the 2nd dose of A/H5N1 IIV administered ID
      with topical Aldara or control cream.
