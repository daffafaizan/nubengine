      adjusted radiocolloid for patients undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy for
      breast cancer.

      Objectives and scientific aims:

      To compare the intensity of pain (Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale + McGill Pain
      Questionnaire) associated with WRAMC's current standard and pH-adjusted radiocolloid for
      patients undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy for breast cancer.

      To assess objectively physician appraisal of patient pain during the radiocolloid injection
      and compare physician interpreted pain score with patient reported pain score.

      Define the success rate of intra-operative SLN identification for each study group.
