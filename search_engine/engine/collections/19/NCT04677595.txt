    
      This is an open-label, multicenter two-cohort phase II study. Chinese adult participants with
      EGFR wild-type (wt) (EGFR mutations that predict sensitivity to EGFR therapy, including, but
      not limited to exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitution mutations), anaplastic
      lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement negative, advanced (stage IIIB, IIIC or IV) NSCLC disease
      harboring MET exon 14-skipping (METÎ”ex14) mutations as determined by a Novartis central
      molecular laboratory will be treated in this study. Cohort 1 will include treatment naive
      participants and Cohort 2 participants who failed one or two prior lines of therapy in the
      advanced stage (stage IIIB, IIIC or IV). Each participant will receive 400 mg capmatinib
      tablet twice daily (BID).

      The primary endpoint is the overall response rate (ORR) by cohort as per the blinded
      independent review committee (BIRC) review. ORR is defined as the proportion of participants
      with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according
      to RECIST 1.1.

      The primary analysis will be performed using full analysis set (FAS). The primary efficacy
      endpoint ORR will be estimated and the exact 95% confidence interval (CI) will be provided by
      cohort.
