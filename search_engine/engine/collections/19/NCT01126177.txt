      the Treatment Phase will be recruited. Subjects will remain in the Pre-Treatment Phase until
      they experience respiratory virus symptoms at which time they will be further screened for
      eligibility for entry into the Treatment Phase. If eligible, subjects will be randomised 1:1
      to receive SNG001 or placebo once daily for 14 days. Doses will be delivered by a CE marked
      breath actuated nebuliser (I-neb Philips Respironics). Subjects will be assessed for changes
      in changes in respiratory virus symptoms and asthma symptoms at home using a text message
      system, and via telephone questionnaire. Lung function will be measured both at home by the
      subjects (PEFR only) and in the clinic. Efficacy and safety will be monitored until at least
      30 days post treatment.
