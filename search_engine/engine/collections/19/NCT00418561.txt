      evaluated as a single dose of 25 U/kg. The three upper dose levels will be evaluated as
      repeated doses. Patients in each cohort will receive one dose of enzyme every other week for
      a period of eight weeks, a total of five doses. Dosing will be performed as follows: Cohort
      1: 25 U/kg as a single dose - hereafter 50 U/kg; Cohort 2: 100 U/kg; Cohort 3: 200 U/kg.
      Patients receiving the lowest dose as a single dose will receive the next dose level as a
      repeated dose. After twenty six weeks the subjects will continue treatment every other week
      until safety data is available. Safety (AE/SAE) will be monitored at every visit during this
      period. The dose will be adjusted monthly to account for changes in body weight. The infusion
      length will be dependent on the dose. Doses of 25 U/kg, 50 U/kg and 100 U/kg will be diluted
      in 50 ml isotonic sodium chloride and infused over 30 minutes. Infusion of 200 U/kg will be
      administered in the same manner except for an infusion time of 60 minutes.

      Duration of treatment: Half a year (26 weeks)
