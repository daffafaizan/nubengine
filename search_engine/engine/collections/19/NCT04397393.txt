      time, and correlated to camel milk consumption versus never consumed camel milk, as well as
      age, BMI (body mass index), number of follicles at the time of OPU, number of previous OPUs
      in other clinics, previous vaginal delivery, past medical history positive for chemo therapy,
      alcohol consumption, use of prescribed or illicit drugs, or chronic pain medication.

      The main objective is to analyse if the consumption of camel milk, the frequency, or lack
      thereof correlates with the amount of the sedative drug Midazolam needed to achieve an
      acceptable level of sedation in order to estimate the dosage needed in both patient groups
      more adequately, reducing either discomfort felt at a too low an initial dosage, as well as
      avoiding a deeper level of sedation than needed with subsequent prolonged stay in recovery
      and unpleasant feelings of dizziness and drowsiness, potentially requiring antagonizing
      Midazolam by the use of Flumazenil, and reducing overall costs and length of stay in recovery
      and bed occupancy and enhancing patient experience and satisfaction.

      Would this study enable the Investigators to determine further effect of camel milk on other
      drugs used for various other purposes, and lead to a change in dose regimen?
