    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine how the increase of tamoxifen citrate dose influences the level of its
           major metabolites in patients with hormone-sensitive breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the population pharmacokinetic profile

        -  To investigate the role of the other CYPs

        -  To assess the relation between clinical symptoms and CYP2D6 genotypes and/or active
           metabolites levels

        -  To explore the correlation between genotypes/metabolites levels and clinical outcomes in
           terms of tumor relapse.

        -  To assess the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of concentration-guided adjustment of
           tamoxifen citrate dosage.

        -  To conduct other exploratory analysis based on the eventual new data coming up in the
           future.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate (at a dose of 40 mg/day) daily for 4 months
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected for PK, genotyping, phenotyping, and further analysis.
