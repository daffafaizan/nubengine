      Primary

        -  To demonstrate the feasibility and safety of sorafenib tosylate when given prior to
           nephrectomy or metastasectomy.

        -  To evaluate the ability of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) to
           detect early and ongoing microstructural changes in primary and metastatic renal cell
           carcinoma lesions during neoadjuvant therapy with sorafenib tosylate.

        -  To correlate early and ongoing microstructural changes in primary and metastatic renal
           cell carcinoma lesions with pathologic and clinical findings at the time of nephrectomy
           or metastasectomy.

        -  To evaluate the ability of changes in DW-MRI to predict subsequent favorable response to
           treatment (complete or partial response or stable disease) after 4 weeks of therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Patients then
      undergo a nephrectomy or metastasectomy in week 5. Patients with residual metastatic disease
      may continue sorafenib tosylate twice daily and undergo a diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI)
      every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo a DW-MRI of the abdomen and pelvis at baseline and prior to week 5 to
      evaluate microstructure tumor changes and to allow for prediction of sorafenib tosylate
      benefit. DW-MRI results are correlated with surgical and pathologic findings obtained at week
      5.

      Resected tumor tissue are analyzed for vascular density and to distinguish apoptotic cell
      death from necrotic cell death via immunohistochemistry and to measure apoptotic cell death
      via TUNEL assay.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
