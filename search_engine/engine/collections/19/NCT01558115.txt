      is catabolic for bone at the cortical skeleton. Recently, evidence for a direct role of PTH
      on RANKL expression and osteoclastogenesis in vivo was obtained using mice lacking a distant
      transcriptional enhancer of the RANKL gene that confers responsiveness to PTH. These
      observations, supported by additional cross-sectional studies in human subjects make a
      compelling argument that the catabolic actions of PTH are mediated by RANKL-mediated bone
      resorption.

      The investigators now propose a proof of concept study to test the hypothesis that in PHPT,
      inhibition of the RANK-L pathway will unmask the anabolic potential of PTH. A therapeutic
      agent that redirects the actions of PTH in PHPT from one that is primarily catabolic to an
      anabolic one would fulfill this proof of concept. The investigators hypothesize that
      Denosumab, a human IgG antibody that binds to and inactivates RANKL, will convert skeletal
      actions of PTH from catabolic to anabolic in primary hyperparathyroidism.
