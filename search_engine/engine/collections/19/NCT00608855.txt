        -  To confirm the safety of percutaneous cryoablation in the palliative treatment of
           patients with painful bone metastases.

        -  To determine the benefits of cryoablation of painful bone metastases by assessing pain
           intensity using a standardized Cleeland Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and quality of life
           using a standardized SF-8 both before and after treatment.

        -  To determine the secondary benefits of cryoablation of painful bone metastases by
           assessing change in analgesic use following therapy.

        -  To determine the level of anesthesia required for cryoablation with a baseline level of
           conscious sedation planned for each treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo percutaneous cryoablation to one or two sites of metastatic disease using
      the Endocare Cryocare system. Patients with a good initial response to treatment (≥ 2
      decrease in pain intensity rating on the Brief Pain Inventory) who develop recurrent pain at
      the same site or a new painful site ≥ 1 month after initial treatment may undergo one
      additional cryoablation treatment.

      Patients complete pain and quality of life questionnaires periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.
