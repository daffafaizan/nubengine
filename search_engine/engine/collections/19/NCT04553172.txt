      family of four patients suffering from unexplained excessive bleeding. It allowed the
      identification of a variant which segregated to family members with bleeding diathesis.
      Firstly, in vitro, functional analyses were performed in primary human endothelial cells.
      Then, in-vivo analysis have to be performed on affected patients.

      The four related patients suffering from excessive bleeding have been followed clinically in
      France for many years. During the follow-up of three of these affected patients, biological
      studies are planned.

      Biological assays include:

        -  Conventional assessment of primary haemostasis: platelet count, platelet aggregation,
           functional and antigen measurement of von Willebrand factor.

        -  Specific testing: Von Willebrand factor multimeric profile, immunolabeling of platelets.

      Conventional assessment is part of the conventional follow-up of patients with inherited
      bleeding disorder. It will not require any additional blood sample. For specific testing and
      after informed consent, fresh blood samples of patients will be collected in 1/10 volume of
      acid-citrate-dextrose and centrifuged for 10 min at 200 g to obtain Platelet-rich plasma
      (PRP) for functional analysis of platelets and Platelet-poor plasma for the multimerization
      state of von Willebrand factor. Then, the results will be compared to the in-vitro findings.
