      mortality. In contrast, physical inactivity and consequent overweight or obese status is
      associated with a cadre of health consequences. Frequently, comorbidities of obesity are
      mechanistically linked via chronic low grade inflammation stemming from increases in
      adiposity. Although exercise is known to combat obesity and obesity related disease states,
      the mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Therefore, the investigators propose the
      following study in an attempt to elucidate anti- and pro-inflammatory endocrine responses to
      exercise. Initial studies in animal models have provided evidence that exercise induces
      long-term anti-inflammatory effects, potentially via myokine signaling following skeletal
      muscle activation. Humans are an ideal study population as the investigators can prescribe
      multiple exercise protocols that mimic human behavior, and control exercise intensity to meet
      recommendations. Also, humans allow the investigators to collect larger plasma samples and
      therefore measure more circulating proteins of interest over multiple time-points. Finally,
      the investigators can select individuals that exercise at different frequencies, allowing the
      investigators to analyze the differences in endocrine responses to exercise over differing
      levels of fitness. In summary, a human model will allow for a much better understanding of
      the human condition.
