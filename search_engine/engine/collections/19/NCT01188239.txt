      for the purpose of nicotine delivery to the respiratory system where nor tobacco nor
      combustion are necessary for its operation. For these reasons, it is possible that this
      product may be safer than cigarettes. Marketing claims also include that they can be useful
      smoking cessation aids. Although E-Cigarette may produce lung delivery of nicotine similar to
      that of tobacco cigarettes and reproduces the gesture component associated with tobacco
      smoking, very little is known about the effect of E-Cigarette on the smoking habits of
      regular tobacco smokers. Therefore, we designed a prospective observational study consisting
      of 8 office-based visits (a baseline visit and a 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12-weeks and a final
      visit at 24-weeks) to monitor possible modifications in the smoking habits of a group of well
      characterized regular smokers experimenting the e-cigarette focusing on long-term smoking
      reduction/abstinence, changes in withdrawal symptoms/cravings and adverse events.
      Specifically, 100 smokers will be given "Categoria" electronic cigarette initially loaded
      with "ORIGINAL" 7.4 mg nicotine cartridges for 6 weeks followed by "CATEGORIA" 5.2 mg
      nicotine cartridges for a further 6 weeks. A final follow up visit will be carried out at 24
      weeks.
