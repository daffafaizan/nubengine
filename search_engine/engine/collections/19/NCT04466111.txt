      upper limb pain relief with the DTMâ„¢ SCS programming approach.

      Data at follow-up visits will be compared to baseline assessments collected at the beginning
      of the study.

      The expected total duration of this study is approximately 18 months. Enrollment of
      participants is expected to last 10 months. Participants that have received the permanent
      implant will be followed up for 3 months after their device has been activated. A participant
      will likely be committed to the study for about 5 months. This consists of Baseline
      assessments, up to 10 days of trial stimulation, and 3 months of treatment following
      implantation and activation of the device. All subjects who plan on remaining implanted
      through the 3-month visit or who have completed their 3-month visit will be offered to return
      for an additional 6-month visit. This would increase their commitment to the study to 8
      months.
