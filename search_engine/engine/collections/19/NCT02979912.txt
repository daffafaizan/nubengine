      epithelial ulcers (PED) who are unresponsive to conventional therapy to promote the healing
      of PED. PL will be dispensed into sterile eye droppers, and these eye droppers will be stored
      ideally at -20C and thaw once for use, then will be kept in the refrigerator at +4C, to be
      taken in multiple doses.
