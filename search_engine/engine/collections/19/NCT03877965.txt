      funded this protocol titled "Pharmacokinetics and Safety Profile of Digoxin in Infants with
      Single Ventricle Congenital Heart Disease", protocol number NICHD-2018-DGX01. The
      Investigational New Drug (IND) Sponsor and Principal Investigator for this protocol is
      Christopher P. Hornik, MD, MPH. The Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) to
      represent the Government for this task order is Perdita Taylor-Zapata. The Duke IRB number
      for this study is Pro00102130. This study employs a central IRB, the WIRB-Copernicus Group
      (WCG). The c-IRB (WCG) study number is 20190888 / NICHD-2018-DGX01.

      This is a prospective, multicenter Phase 1 study with a primary objective to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of enteral digoxin in infants with single ventricle congenital heart
      disease. The secondary objective is to determine the safety profile of enteral digoxin in
      infants with single ventricle congenital heart disease. Digoxin is used for the treatment of
      heart failure in pediatric patients and acts by controlling numerous functions of the
      cardiovascular system. Digoxin use in single ventricle congenital heart disease may decrease
      interstage mortality.

      The study will be conducted in approximately 48 subjects at approximately 13 investigational
      centers. The proposed duration of the study is approximately 196 (Â±) days.
