      and 8th decades of life. In contrast, this neurologic disease can present within the first 5
      decades of life. This early onset presentation is more likely to have a direct genetic cause
      relative to the etiology of the degenerative form of the disease. Our understanding of the
      genetic causes of early onset Parkinson's Disease (EOPD) may help us find therapies for both
      the genetic and degenerative illnesses. Data from our laboratory and others show that genetic
      mutations associated with EOPD, disrupt cellular stress-response programs. These
      perturbations, in turn, impair cell-repair process, which is hypothesized to increase
      susceptibility to dopaminergic neuron degeneration linked to EOPD and degenerative PD. At the
      same time, patients with EOPD have a variable age of onset (spanning from 8 years to 41 years
      in the subjects in our cohort) and disease penetrance (severity of symptoms). The hypothesis
      we propose to test is whether the number and allele distributions of EOPD susceptibility gene
      mutations account for the variable age of onset and disease penetrance. This hypothesis will
      be tested in this natural history protocol by genotyping subjects with EOPD to define their
      genetic defects and to explore the cellular reparative function in these individuals using
      peripheral blood cells, skin biopsy derived fibroblasts and induced pluripotential stems
      cells derived from these subjects. In parallel, the phenotype of these subjects will be
      evaluated by the NINDS Parkinson's Clinic. Together, these data should advance our insight
      into the genotype-phenotype in EOPD pathophysiology.
