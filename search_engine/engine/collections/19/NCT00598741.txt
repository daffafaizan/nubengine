      treatment, continue treatment and undergo a third MRI within 25 days prior to surgery. All
      patients with OS or Ewing sarcoma who will undergo pre-operative chemotherapy are eligible
      for study. Anti-neoplastic therapy will be determined by the primary physician and will not
      be impacted upon by this study, although the data will be made available to the physicians
      involved in the patient's care. The goals of this study are: 1) To determine if pre-operative
      dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can reliably predict percent
      necrosis at definitive surgery in bone tumors after induction chemotherapy. 2) Evaluate the
      hypothesis that in patients with Ewing or osteogenic sarcoma (OS), the a priori or early
      (18-24 days into treatment) DCE-MRI study predicts pathological percent necrosis measured at
      surgery, and disease free survival. 3) Determine if the DCE-MRI results are independent
      markers of tumor response compared to current clinical markers (LDH, alkaline phosphatase
      (osteogenic sarcoma only), primary disease site, primary disease size (length and volume),
      stage). 4) Compare the DCE-MRI results with several key molecular parameters including p53
      mutations and CDKN2A deletion in Ewing's sarcoma and RB alterations, CDKN2A deletion, and
      expression of HER-2, platelet derived growth factor, reduced folate carrier, and
      pglycoprotein in osteogenic sarcoma. Ewing's sarcoma and osteogenic sarcoma samples will also
      be submitted for Affymetrix expression microarray analysis. Summary: This project will
      determine the potential of DCE-MRI to predict tumor necrosis and as an a priori or early
      marker of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy
