      tendinopathy will be recruited.This single-blind (assessor), parallel-group RCT will include
      three evaluation sessions over 6 weeks (baseline, week 2, week 6) and one meeting with the
      treating physiotherapist (right after the baseline evaluation). All participants will take
      part in the baseline evaluation. They will first complete a questionnaire on
      sociodemographic, symptomatology and comorbidity, as well as self-administered questionnaires
      that evaluate symptoms and functional limitations (DASH, WORC and BPI). Then,
      ultrasonographic (US) measurements of AHD and of the supraspinatus tendon and subacromial
      bursal thickness will be conducted. Thereafter, pain inhibitory control will be assessed
      using conditioned pain modulation. Finally, the corticospinal excitability of the
      infraspinatus muscle will be evaluated. Thereafter, participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of two intervention groups, and then take part in their assigned home program. At week 2
      and 6, the self-administered questionnaires will be re-administered (by phone for the week 6
      evaluation). A global rating of change question (with % of change since baseline) will also
      be completed at week 2 and 6. US measurements, conditioned pain modulation and corticospinal
      excitability will only be revaluated at week 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of blinding,
      the assessor will complete a question related to his/her opinion of the allocation at week 2.
      The study will be carried out at the Centre interdisciplinaire de recherche en réadaptation
      et en intégration sociale (CIRRIS) by two different physiotherapists and in two different
      laboratories. Ethics approval will be obtained from Institutional Review Board of IRDPQ.
