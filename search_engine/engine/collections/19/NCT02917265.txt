      this prospective randomized double blind trial of active or sham transcutaneous electrical
      vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS). Active tNVS is performed by the use of a transcutaneous
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device with electrodes attached to an area of the
      external ear innervated by the auricular branch of the vagus nerve. The same protocol is
      followed in the sham tVNS arm, but the pads are placed on an area of the external ear that is
      devoid of vagus innervation.TENS is applied for 60 to 120 minutes daily as tolerated and
      participants keep a detailed log of their daily TENS sessions. Patients return to clinic at
      weeks 4, 8 and 12 for study related assessments.
