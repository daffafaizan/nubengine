      breast cancer and are associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with TNBCs derive no benefit
      from targeted therapies. Excluding those patients who demonstrate a pathologic complete
      response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is a minor fraction (i.e. 15%), overall
      survival is only 45% at 7 years.

      Following standard of care, there are windows of opportunity to further and safely treat
      patients to prevent recurrence. Stimulating the immune system to produce T cells immunity
      specific for tumor antigens may significantly delay recurrence and cure patients.

      The proposed vaccine is intended to induce T cells to survey for the reemergence of TNBCs and
      to prevent recurrence in the adjuvant setting. The vaccine strategy is antigen-specific and
      targets the Folate Receptor Alpha (FRα). FRα is an ideal target because of its limited
      expression in the healthy tissues and it high expression in 86% of TNBCs. Studies have shown
      that it is a biologically important marker that is associated with poorer clinical outcome
      and is retained in metastatic lesions.

      The FRα vaccine include a pool of 5 peptides that are immunogenic epitopes and safely
      generate tissue-surveying CD4 T cell immune responses in patients tested in a recently
      completed phase I clinical trial.
