    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the rate of neutrophil engraftment and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host
           disease (GVHD) following a T cell depleted (TCD) umbilical cord blood (UCB)
           transplantation without post-transplant immunosuppression followed by administration of
           interleukin-2 (IL-2, aldesleukin) (every other day) days +3 to +13 to expand NK cells in
           vivo.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety of this regimen as assessed by monitoring the rates of graft
           failure, acute GVHD, and transplant-related mortality (TRM).

        -  To perform quantitative, phenotypic, and functional assessments of the in vivo expanded
           UCB-derived NK cells on (day +72).

        -  To assess clinical disease response (leukemia clearance and complete remission) and
           survival duration in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the tolerability of aldesleukin in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the tolerance of IL-2

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative regimen: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1
           hour on days -7 to -5 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6. Patients undergo
           total-body irradiation twice daily on days -5 to -2.

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo T-cell depleted umbilical cord blood (UCB)
           transplantation on day 0.

        -  IL-2 (Aldesleukin) therapy: Patients receive aldesleukin subcutaneously on days +3 6
           doses every other day) and +60 (6 doses every other day).

      Patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years after transplant.
