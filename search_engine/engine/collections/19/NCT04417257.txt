    
      RESOLUTION is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of
      LAU-7b for the treatment of COVID-19 Disease in patients at a higher risk than the general
      COVID-19 Disease population to develop complications while hospitalized.

      The goal of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of LAU-7b therapy + standard-of-care
      relative to placebo + standard-of-care in patients with COVID-19 Disease with confirmed
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The purpose of the treatment with LAU-7b is to prevent the worsening of the health of
      hospitalized patients including aggravation such as recourse to mechanical ventilation and
      death.

      The means are the direct effects of LAU-7b on the resolution of inflammation, interference
      with viral proliferation and protection from excessive pro-inflammatory response.
