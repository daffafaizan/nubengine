      cultures of breast and prostate origin, partially by down-regulation of cyclin B1 and
      induction of cell cycle arrest. In this study the investigators intend to take biopsies from
      benign colonic polyps and cancer tissue, culture intestinal explants and generate
      immortalized primary cells as a platform to assess the effect of this plant hormone on cell
      viability, cell mobility, apoptosis and cytoskeleton modifications.
