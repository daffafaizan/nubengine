    
      This is a pilot clinical trial of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with
      the diagnosis of a genetic disease of blood cells that do not have an HLA-matched sibling
      donor. The stem cells will be derived from a 1) matched unrelated donor (MUD) or 2) unrelated
      umbilical cord blood (UCB). Patients will receive a novel conditioning regimen with Busulfan,
      Cytoxan and Fludarabine (Bu/Cy/Flu) and either Alemtuzumab (Campath 1H) for recipients of a
      MUD or rabbit Antithymocyte Globulin (rATG) for recipients of unrelated UCB prior to
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

      It is hypothesized that reduced dosages of Cytoxan will decrease the acute toxicities
      associated with the standard chemotherapies of Busulfan and Cytoxan (i.e. sinusoidal
      obstructive syndrome (SOS), hemorrhagic cystitis and mucositis). And the addition of
      fludarabine to a conditioning regimen with myeloablative doses of Busulfan and reduced
      dosages of Cytoxan prior to HSCT will overcome the engraftment barrier posed by an intact
      immune system, which is seen in patients with a genetic disease.
