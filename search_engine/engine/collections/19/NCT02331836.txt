      Administration, which was also authorized by the European Agency for the Evaluation of
      Medicinal Products. The aim of the cuff is to optimize the view of the colonic mucosa. There
      is also a transparent cap on the market, which is used in colonoscopy for a better evaluation
      of the mucosa and polyp detection. The goal of this project is to conduct a prospective
      randomized trial for clarification of the hypotheses, whether the usage of the Endocuff
      increases the detection rate of adenomas compared to the transparent cap or compared to
      standard colonoscopy.
