    
      Open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study for anemic patients with hemoglobin <or=11
      g/dl. The dose of epoetin alfa is the routine dosage regimen and is in accordance of the
      approved SmPC. That's why the study had in general two phases - first period: subcutaneous
      administration and second period:intravenous administration. The evaluation is made in 4
      visits:baseline, 2 month (Visit 1), 4 month (Visit 2), 6 month (Visit 3), 9 month (Visit 4).
      Echographic evaluation - on baseline visit, Visit 3 and Visit 4.Baseline visit - weight,
      arterial pressure, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Erythrocytes, Middle Cells Volume, Middle Cells
      Hemoglobin, Middle Cells Hemoglobin Concentration, Transferrin, Creatinine, Clerans, Visit1,
      Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4 - Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Erythrocytes, Middle Cells Volume, Middle
      Cells Hemoglobin, Middle Cells Hemoglobin Concentration. The dosage is in routine dosing
      regimen, the starting dose of epoetin alfa is 50 Units/kg body weight. The maintaining dose
      depends on hematological results. Administration - subcutaneous (during the first period),
      intravenous (second period). Duration of the study - 9 months.
