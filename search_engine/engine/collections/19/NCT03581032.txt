    
      The present study is designed to determine if a simplified technique for cardiac device( CRT)
      reprogramming using pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) via implanted CardioMEMS device data in
      the acute setting holds promise to improve subjective assessments of patient quality of life
      (QOL), objective measurements of functional capacity, and specific systolic and diastolic
      echocardiographic indices. The protocol requires prospective collection and analysis of
      echocardiographic data, subjective symptoms (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
      Questionnaires), and 6-minute walk distance measurements in patients with implanted
      biventricular pacemakers / defibrillators who are predominantly ventricularly paced, in
      normal sinus rhythm, have documented NYHA class 3 Heart Failure, and have implanted pulmonary
      artery pressure monitors (CardioMEMS, St. Jude Medical CRMD, St. Paul, MN). Data collection
      will occur at presentation (rest and with ambulation), one month post-reprogramming, and two
      months after evaluation and / or reprogramming.
