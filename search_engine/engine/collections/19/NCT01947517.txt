      measure is length of time punctual plugs are retained, measured in months. This will be
      measured at monthly assessments for 6 months. Secondary outcome measures include patient
      satisfaction, and improvement in subjective and objective dry eye scores, as well as
      complications related to punctual plugs including spontaneous plug loss, and intolerance. We
      will evaluate these measures by repeating the Canadian Dry Eye Assessment, Schirmer 1, tear
      meniscus height, fluorescein corneal staining (NEI scale), and lissamine green conjunctival
      staining (NEI scale) at month 1, month 3, and month 6 visits.
