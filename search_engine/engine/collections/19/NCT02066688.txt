      survival rate of 62% . Considerable interest has recently been focused on the relationship
      between the chemoprevention of colorectal polyps/CRA and CRC. Therefore, the use of
      nutritional compounds which are usually less afflicted with the risk of severe side effects
      for colorectal adenoma (CRA) prevention and health maintenance is an emerging field.
