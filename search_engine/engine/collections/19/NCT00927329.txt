      technique for nasal allergen challenges. The new technique consists of having patients
      maximally inhale to total lung capacity. A nasal metered dose pump will be used to deliver
      the Dermatophagoides farinae allergen to the nasal mucosa. The patient will not sniff after
      allergen delivery as in the previous study but instead exhale through the mouth. The
      investigators propose that this technique will inhibit large amounts of allergen reaching
      airway mucosa beyond the nasal site of introduction thus limiting serious adverse events.
