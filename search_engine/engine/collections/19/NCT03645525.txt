      morbidity of BPD is increasing in CHINA. The preventive and therapy methods of BPD are still
      lacking.

      Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal stem cell has been proven effective in the experimental
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). A multi-center study was designed to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the cellular therapy in extremely preterm infants at high risk for BPD.
