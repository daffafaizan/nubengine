      urine on contaminated soil. It is an important remerging infectious disease because of its
      increasing incidence. Leptospirosis is most common in tropical and rural settings but its
      incidence has been constantly increasing for the past ten years in Metropolitan France. Most
      of the cases are asymptomatic or sparsely symptomatic, but some patients develop severe
      leptospirosis (6% to 59%), requiring hospitalisation in intensive care units. The mortality
      of the disease is between 3,6% to 13%, and up to 48% for the severe leptospirosis.

      Only few studies exist on severe leptospirosis and none major multicentre on leptospirosis in
      intensive care units in Europe. Therefore, the investigators have decided to carry out this
      studies. The investigators conduct a retrospective multi centric study in metropolitan France
      in order to identify the characteristic, the treatments and the prognostic factors associated
      with mortality of sever leptospirosis.
