      Unit (BPRU). All participants will be healthy adult volunteers who are regular
      nicotine/tobacco users, and have prior experience with cannabis use. Participants will
      complete seven outpatient experimental test sessions (completed in a randomized order), under
      double-blind conditions in which participants will first self-administer smoked cannabis
      (either active or placebo), followed by nicotine (via a tobacco cigarette or an e-cigarette);
      there will also be one condition in which participants smoke active cannabis alone (without
      subsequent nicotine use). Nicotine self-administration will occur in an ad libitum fashion
      for 5 hours. Nicotine products will be the individual participant's preferred brand of
      cigarettes or the commercial pod-style e-cigarette the JUUL (pods will contain either 3% or
      5% nicotine pods). Active cannabis will contain 10 mg tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) while
      placebo will contain 0 mg THC. During the ad libitum nicotine/tobacco-use period, various
      puffing behaviors (e.g., puff volume, puff duration, puff number, inter-puff-interval) will
      be measured using specialized equipment. Acute subjective effects of cannabis/nicotine,
      cannabis/nicotine withdrawal symptoms, craving, vital signs, and cognitive/psychomotor
      performance will also be assessed throughout the experimental sessions.
