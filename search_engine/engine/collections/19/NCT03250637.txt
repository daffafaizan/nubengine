      cancer (CRC), respectively. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate intestinal immune response in
      a complex interplay between the mucosal epithelium and the microbiota and may therefore be
      important modulators of diet-induced CRC and interact with other inflammatory mediators.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the association with functional TLR polymorphisms in
      relation to risk of CRC and their interaction with dietary factors. Additionally,
      interactions with previously studied polymorphisms in IL10, IL1B, PTGS2 and NFKB1 will be
      assessed in order to examine possible biological pathways in meat-induced CRC.

      Data are retrieved from the Danish prospective "Diet, Cancer and Health" study encompassing
      57,053 persons which were recruited between 1993 to 1997. Between 1994 and 31th December
      2009, 1038 CRC cases has been diagnosed. A sub-cohort of 1857 persons has been randomly
      selected within the full cohort at time of entry into the cohort. The study design is a
      nested case-cohort study.
