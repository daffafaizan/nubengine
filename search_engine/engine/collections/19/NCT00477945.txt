      clofarabine will be escalated in successive cohorts of patients. Using a standard dose
      escalation design, successive cohorts of 3 patients will be treated with escalating doses of
      clofarabine (see Section 5.5 below). At the MTD (or highest dose-level if the MTD is not
      reached), the cohort will be expanded to 10 patients to better investigate correlative
      studies and give some preliminary idea of efficacy.
