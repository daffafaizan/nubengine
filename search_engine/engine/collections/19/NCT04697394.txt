      cancer treatment in response to direct questioning in outpatient clinics. It's recognised
      that patient-reported symptoms often differ from doctor-documented symptoms. Over time, this
      leads to inaccuracies in doctors' descriptions of the effects of cancer or its treatment to
      patients. Patients told us accurate description of expected symptoms is important when they
      are choosing which treatment to have.

      This study will use an electronic database to allow colorectal cancer patients to view their
      treatment records and to document their symptoms. Patients will answer questions at study
      entry and at set intervals during treatment and follow-up. The questions are related to
      health and well-being. The questionnaires are patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) which
      have been used in paper format in trials with many patients internationally.

      The information the patients give us will help doctors describe treatment effects more
      accurately to future patients and to identify patients who may need extra support during or
      after their treatment. Electronic data collection allows patterns to be identified that may
      not be seen by doctors until a later stage. The symptoms identified in this study will be
      used to develop treatments that may benefit future patients. The electronic database will be
      used identify the need for intervention then to deliver the recommended treatments to
      patients automatically when they are identified. For example, if questionnaire responses show
      a patient has an unplanned loss of 3% of their body weight an information sheet on increasing
      calorie intake and eating well with a small appetite would be emailed to them and a dietician
      alerted so a follow up call could be made two weeks later.
