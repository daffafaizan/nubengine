      I. To determine the feasibility of monitoring cancer patients using wrist-worn activity
      monitors and movement trackers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association between activity and patient reported fatigue. II. To evaluate
      the association between movement and incidents of health care interventions
      (hospitalizations, physical visits, intravenous hydration, etc.)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare physician and patient assessed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and
      Karnofsky performance status scores with the data obtained from movement trackers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients perform 2 physical activities in an exam room that are recorded using a Microsoft
      Kinect 2 stationary movement tracking device on days 1 and 21. The first activity is rising
      from a chair, walking 10 feet, and returning to the chair. The second activity is moving from
      the chair to the step-up examination table. Patients also wear a movement tracking wristband,
      Microsoft Band 2, around their wrist, complete a smartphone application based patient
      reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire, and weigh themselves daily for 60 days.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 90 days.
