      Seventy-two male and female smokers will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment
      conditions: GAL (8 or 16 mg/day) or placebo. The dose of GAL will be gradually increased to
      the target doses over a 2-week period (Table 2). During Week 3, following overnight
      abstinence from smoking, participants will present for a laboratory Test Session in which
      they will have the option of cigarette self-administration. After this Test Session is
      completed, smokers will be maintained on their randomized medication condition for an
      additional 4-week period. Smokers will establish a quit date at the beginning of this
      Treatment Phase, and will receive brief weekly behavioral treatment for the 4 weeks of this
      phase. Additionally, at the beginning of Week 3, participants will be given a PDA that will
      administer EMA assessments. The study medication will be tapered after the end of Week 4 of
      the Treatment Phase. Participants will be contacted by phone at one week, and one month,
      after treatment termination to inquire about any adverse events and about their recent
      smoking status.
