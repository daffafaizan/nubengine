      relapsed metastatic Ewing sarcoma continue to have poor outcomes with current chemotherapy
      options. A large body of preclinical data supports a role for IGF-1R inhibition in the
      treatment of Ewing sarcoma.

      More recently, clinical trials of IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated single-
      agent activity in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma. Ganitumab (AMG 479) is a fully human
      monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R. We are proposing this single-agent expanded
      access IND to provide our patient the opportunity to benefit from this treatment after having
      developed progressive disease after multiple lines of prior therapy.
