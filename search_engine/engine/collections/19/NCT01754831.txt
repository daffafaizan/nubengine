      decay (cavities) in preschool children in the United States. Fluoride varnish is not FDA
      approved specifically for prevention of cavities, but dentists may legally use it for this
      purpose. We want to study how much fluoride appears in the urine after the painting procedure
      to improve our knowledge of how the varnish works and its safety. The fluoride varnish is
      being used for research purposes for this study by permission of FDA (IND #110869).

      Premier Dental Product Company's Enamel Pro Varnish will be used. Up to six children aged
      12-15 months will be enrolled in this study. We measured urinary fluoride for 5 hours after
      application of fluoride varnish to teeth. Baseline levels were measured on a separate day.
