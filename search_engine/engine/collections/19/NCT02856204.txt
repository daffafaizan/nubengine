      I. To test the hypothesis that shotgun metagenomics is not inferior to standard of care
      diagnostics in the detection of pathogens in patients with febrile neutropenia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a microbiological diagnosis with known or unknown pathogens in patients in
      whom standard care failed to yield a pathogenic diagnosis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples before and during the episode of febrile
      neutropenia for up to 6 weeks.
