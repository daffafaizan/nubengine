      annual incidence between 5 and 10% and is responsible for the death of one third of IPF
      patients. When AE-IPF occurs, it is associated with poor survival with an overall mortality
      at 3 months upper of 50%. To date, no treatment has been proved to be effective in AE-IPF but
      the efficacy of CYC on survival has been suggested, mainly by retrospective series and needs
      to be confirmed. This confirmation is mandatory to improve prognosis of AE-IPF but also to
      avoid unsuspected deleterious effect as it as been shown with immunosuppressor in stable IPF.
