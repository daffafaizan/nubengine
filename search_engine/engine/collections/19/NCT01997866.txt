    
      Patients with Congestive Heart Failure on non-Intensive Care Unit Medical Services and/or
      visiting our outpatient Congestive Heart Failure clinic will be screened using the STOP-BANG
      Scoring Model. Patients with high risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea will be referred to the
      Sleep Center physicians for evaluation and treatment. Patients will be followed for one year
      to determine if the treatment for Sleep Apnea improves their Quality of Life and decreases
      Hospital and Emergency Department utilization.
