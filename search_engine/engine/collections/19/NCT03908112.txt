    
      Objectives:

      A group of 264 diverse children, ages 11 to 17 years, with post-concussion syndrome (4-12
      weeks post-concussion injury) and symptomatic CI will be enrolled from 6 sites from across
      the United States, will be randomized to 12 weeks of: 1) standard care (SC), 2) SC plus
      simple convergence exercises (SC+), and 3) SC plus office-based vergence/ accommodative
      therapy (SC+OBVAT).

      Primary Objective: To compare the effectiveness of SC, SC+, SC plus office-based
      vergence/accommodative therapy for improving a composite outcome measure of clinical findings
      (near point of convergence and positive fusional vergence at near) in children 11-17 years of
      age with concussion-related CI after 12 weeks of treatment.

        -  Secondary outcome measures

        -  Objective measures of disparity vergence, accommodation, saccades, and smooth pursuit

        -  Quality of life measures

        -  Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey Concussion Version (CISS-CON)

        -  PedsQL Version 4 For participants in any treatment group who not "successful" based on
           the composite score described above, additional/different treatment will be offered as
           an option after the primary outcome examination
