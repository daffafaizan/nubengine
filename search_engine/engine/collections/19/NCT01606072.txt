      mortality is related to the capacity of tumor cells to invade and produce metastases. It is
      postulated that tumor manipulation during surgery results in the release of tumor cells into
      circulation or the lymphatic system, and that these released cells survive due to aggregation
      among them or with platelets through the formation of a fibrin layer on the embolus. Tumor
      cells surviving transportation through circulation will join blood vessels and invade
      vascular walls, forming metastases. The interruption of this process might reduce survival of
      tumor cells and thus the formation of metastases from breast cancer cells in the lungs or
      other tissues.
