      mitochondrial Beta-oxidation to phenylacetate. Preclinical studies have shown that continuous
      exposure to phenylacetate or phenylbutyrate can induce tumor cytostasis and differentiation
      in a wide variety of cell lines including malignant gliomas and neuroblastomas. However,
      phenylbutyrate has been shown to be a more potent differentiating agent than phenylacetate in
      a variety of tumor cell lines. In addition, phenylbutyrate appears to have molecular
      activities that are distinct from phenylacetate and may induce apoptosis. Phase I trials in
      adults and children have established the feasibility of administering phenylbutyrate on a
      prolonged schedule. A phase II trial of phenylbutyrate administered as a continuous
      intravenous infusion will be performed in children with recurrent or progressive brain
      tumors.
