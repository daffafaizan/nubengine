      pancreatic stump after distal pancreatectomy to that of SEAMGUARD reinforced stapler closure.

      Distal pancreatectomy is performed for a broad variety of indications including benign and
      malignant conditions. Specifically, distal pancreatectomy refers to resection of the portion
      of pancreas to the left of the superior mesenteric vein/portal vein trunk, excluding the
      duodenum and distal bile duct. Pancreatic duct leak at the resection margin is one of the
      most common complications of distal pancreatectomy. This complication prolongs in-patient and
      outpatient care and resulting in significant detriments to the patient's operative experience
      and increases in the financial burden of pancreatic surgery.
