      associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality. Part of this
      risk can be attributed to the fact that patients with ESkD adopt sedentary behavior.

      Objectives: To investigate the effects of Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) performed during
      hemodialysis (HD) procedures in patients with ESkD.

      Methodology: Randomized double-blind clinical trial, controlled by sham. Location: Nephrology
      Sector, Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) Participants: three groups of 12 patients
      with ESRD on HD randomized to three IMT intensities.

      Intervention: Thirty-six IMT sessions, performed three times a week, at an intensity of 50%,
      30% and 10% (sham) of the maximum inspiratory pressure (Pimax).

      Main outcomes: Functional capacity, diaphragm hypertrophy, respiratory muscle strength, lung
      volume, blood pressure and quality of life.

      Statistical Analysis: Presentation of data in absolute and relative numbers, and through
      means and standard deviations. To compare the groups, ANOVA will be used, with significance
      less than 0.05.
