      paramount as the N stage largely determines treatment strategy, prognosis and outcome.
      Surgical staging such as mediastinoscopy is considered the gold standard. A less invasive
      alternative is transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA). This technique is limited however by
      moderate and operator dependent accuracy. Recently less invasive strategies such as
      esophageal ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and endobronchial ultrasound
      guided TBNA (EBUS-TBNA) were introduced. These strategies have largely complemented TBNA and
      surgical staging, with high accuracy and low morbidity. Disadvantages compared to TBNA
      however are required specific expertise, higher equipment and maintenance costs, the need for
      more assisting personnel and the need for sedation. Advances in computer generated image
      processing based on available CT and PET images enable (quasi) real-time virtual bronchoscopy
      that can assist minimal invasive surgical performance including bronchoscopy. Optimizing the
      traditional TBNA procedure with these modern imaging techniques might be equally accurate and
      more cost effective.
