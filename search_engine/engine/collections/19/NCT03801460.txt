      dietary intervention program on the quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes in frail
      adults undergoing Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. Patients will be
      randomly (1:1) assigned to the standard of care (SOC group) where patients will receive all
      medical care as decided by their treating physicians or assigned to a home based program
      known as remotely administered physiological reconditioning (RPR) program which will include
      receiving personalized instructions for a progressive exercise program and dietary changes.
      Patients will be contacted for regular phone and in-person follow up for monitoring their
      progress. The primary endpoint will be quality of life as assessed by KCCQE questionnaires at
      one-year post TAVR. The secondary endpoints include length of stay post TAVR, all-cause
      mortality, repeat hospitalization and a composite of all-cause mortality and repeat
      hospitalization at one year.
