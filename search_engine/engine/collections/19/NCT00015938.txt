        -  Determine the 1-year survival of women with HER-2-negative stage IV breast cancer
           treated with docetaxel, vinorelbine, and filgrastim (G-CSF).

        -  Determine the response rate (both complete and partial response) and time to progression
           in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days
      8 and 15, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 2-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5 months.
