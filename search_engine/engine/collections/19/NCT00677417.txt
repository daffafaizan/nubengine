      laparoscopic or conventional appendicectomy between January, 2004 and December, 2007 in a
      surgical department of an academic teaching hospital. A retrospective multiple chart review
      of the medical records including laboratory values (bilirubin, CRP, white blood count) and
      histological results was conducted.
