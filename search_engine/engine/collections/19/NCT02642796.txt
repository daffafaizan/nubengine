      with respect to the mode of postoperative analgesia applied: Group I (control): PCA only;
      group II: PCA plus lumbar plexus & sciatic nerve TENS (LS-TENS); group III: PCA plus surgical
      wound TENS (SW-TENS). TENS will be applied every 2 hours for 30-40 minutes during 48 hours
      postoperatively. Visual analogue score (VAS), Ramsey sedation scores, frequencies of PCA
      demand and counts of PCA delivery, as well as total analgesic consumption will be noted and
      compared between groups at various time intervals.

      Visual analog scale (VAS) will be applied at 2 months postoperatively VAS and Mcgill pain
      questionnaire will be applied at the 6th and 24th months of the surgery to assess acute and
      chronic pain in the study population and the differences among groups.
