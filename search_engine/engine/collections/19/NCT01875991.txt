      care and the caring physician's intent are to initiate treatment with etanercept.
      Participants must be naïve to etanercept and naïve to other autoinjector pens or prefilled
      syringes and be able to self-inject. The study will consist of a 30 day screening period, and
      2 treatment periods of 4 weeks duration each (one treatment period using Autoinjector A and
      the other using Autoinjector B). At the end of the study, participants may continue treatment
      with commercially available etanercept at the physician's discretion.
