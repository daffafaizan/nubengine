      cyclophosphamide after a "blood" stem cell transplant is an effective treatment for patients
      with blood cancers who require transplant for long-term survival but are without an available
      matched-sibling donor. Historically, survival rates for patients undergoing partially matched
      related or unrelated donor transplants (henceforth to be called alternative donor
      transplants) have been much lower than those observed after matched sibling stem cell
      transplants. Survival post alternative donor stem cell transplant has also been affected by
      the requirement to remove or reduce the numbers of donor T cells resulting in higher rates of
      infection, graft rejection, and relapse. One significant limitation to conventional donor
      transplants with HLA matched siblings has been that over 50% of patients do not have HLA
      matched siblings so that increasing the safety of alternative donor transplants could have a
      significant influence on the number of patients who could safely receive transplants. Because
      of the historically low overall survival (OS) after alternative donor transplants, it has
      become a procedure of "last resort" in many centers unwilling to consider it unless all other
      options are exhausted. There fore several centers including ours have sought to overcome
      problems using various strategies. The strategy the investigators have proposed for this
      study (which has been used similarly by other centers) has been to administer
      cyclophosphamide post the stem cell infusion (traditionally it is given before the stem cell
      infusion) thereby hopefully destroying the activated T-cells causing graft-versus host
      disease (GVHD) and allow T cell tolerization and engraftment; but, not the inactivated T
      cells thereby hopefully preserving the anti-tumor effects of the donor immune system. Thus,
      the major aim of this study will be to measure the engraftment with this regimen and
      secondarily to measure incidence of GVHD and day 100 mortality. The goal is to see if in the
      first 3 months the use of cyclophosphamide post stem cell infusion with alternative donors is
      as safe and as effective as traditional matched transplants.
