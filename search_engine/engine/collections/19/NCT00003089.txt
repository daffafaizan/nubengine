      carboplatin in patients with unresectable, intrathoracic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      II. Integrate concurrent thoracic radiation therapy and weekly low dose paclitaxel into
      treatment of this patient population. III. Investigate a primary chemoradiotherapy treatment
      approach in a population of patients selected on the basis of performance status regardless
      of degree of weight loss. IV. Determine the effect of amifostine on the incidence of
      treatment nonhematologic toxic effects, specifically esophagitis, pneumonitis, and radiation
      dermatitis, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive induction therapy comprising
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 21. Patients
      then undergo radiotherapy beginning on day 42 (or no later than day 63) daily 5 days a week
      for 7 weeks. Patients also receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes followed by paclitaxel IV
      over 3 hours weekly (day 1 each week) concurrently for the duration of radiotherapy. On 2
      other days of the week, patients receive amifostine alone preceding thoracic radiotherapy.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months until disease
      progression or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
