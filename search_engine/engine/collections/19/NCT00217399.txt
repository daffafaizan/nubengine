      I. Determine the clinical benefit rate of sorafenib in combination with anastrazole in women
      with estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.

      II. Determine the recommended phase II dose of sorafenib when administered with anastrozole
      in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the changes
      in Raf-MAPK and VEGF-signaling pathways in tumor tissue and stroma before and after treatment
      with this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of sorafenib.

      PHASE I: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily and oral anastrozole once daily on days
      1-28.

      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A minimum of 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PHASE II: Patients receive sorafenib at the MTD and anastrozole as in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 4-8 weeks.
