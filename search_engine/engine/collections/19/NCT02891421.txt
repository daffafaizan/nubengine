      (PTSD) and/or Traumatic Brain Injury make effective interventions urgent, to reduce symptoms
      and increase veterans' coping. PTSD includes anxiety, flashbacks, and emotional numbing.
      Symptoms expand health care costs for stress-related illnesses making veterans' civilian life
      difficult.

      The proposed study used a randomized experimental design with repeated measures and waitlist
      control group testing the efficacy of a 6-week human-horse interaction and systematic
      therapeutic horseback riding program in: decreasing PTSD symptoms, increasing coping self
      efficacy, emotion regulation, and social engagement. The Riding Group spent one hour weekly
      interacting with and riding the same horse at one of two PATH-accredited riding centers in
      Mid-Missouri supervised by an Occupational Therapist, Profession Association of Therapeutic
      Horsemanship (PATH) International-certified instructor, leader and side walkers as needed.
      Riding was directed by a systematic lesson plan. Data collection occured at baseline, 3
      weeks, and 6 weeks. The Control Group was assessed at the same intervals and again 3 weeks
      and 6 weeks after joining the Riding Group.
