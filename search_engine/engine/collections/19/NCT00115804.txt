      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) as widespread pain of at least 3 months duration in
      combination with tenderness at 11 or more of 18 specific tender point sites on the body. The
      prevalence of JPFS in children and adolescents in the general population of the United States
      is unknown. Studies from Israel, Mexico, and Italy have estimated that the prevalence rate of
      JPFS in school children ranges from 1.24% to 6.20%, with girls making up the majority of
      cases. Information from a national registry in the United States indicates that JPFS accounts
      for about 7.7% of new patient diagnoses in a pediatric rheumatology setting. The mean age of
      onset of pediatric JPFS is 12 years. As in adults, JPFS has been diagnosed in children and
      adolescents using the ACR criteria. JPFS often leads to substantial morbidity and disability.
      For example, adolescents with JPFS reported significantly greater functional disability and
      greater number of school absences than those with other rheumatic diseases such as juvenile
      RA or lupus. The presence of high levels of pain and disability at this critical
      developmental stage place adolescents with JPFS at greater risk for long term social and
      occupational difficulties. Early diagnosis and effective intervention are therefore of
      critical importance.
