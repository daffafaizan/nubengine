      Period B - Treatment Withdrawal Phase: Responders were withdrawn from active treatment and
      monitored for loss of disease control for up to 36 weeks.

      Period C - Re-Treatment Phase: Participants who had experienced loss of disease control in
      Period B were re-treated with adalimumab for 16 weeks.

      Period D - Long-Term Follow-Up Phase: Participants received adalimumab or were observed
      off-treatment (if disease remained under control) for 52 weeks.
