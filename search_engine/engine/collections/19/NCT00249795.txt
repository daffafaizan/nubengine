    
      ACTIVE I was one of the 3 separate but related trials of the ACTIVE program conducted in AF
      patients at risk of vascular events.

      Patients were enrolled first into one of the 2 parallel trials of the ACTIVE program
      evaluating Clopidogrel:

        -  ACTIVE A comparing clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and ASA alone

        -  ACTIVE W comparing clopidogrel + ASA and oral anticoagulant (OAC).

      Then those satisfying additional criteria related to blood pressure and angiotensin receptor
      blocking agents were re-randomized in the two ACTIVE I arms according to a separate
      randomization list.
