      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of individualizing pazopanib (pazopanib
      hydrochloride) monotherapy based upon attained pazopanib plasma concentrations so as to
      achieve desired target pazopanib plasma concentration in the highest possible fraction of
      treated patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether patient cytochrome P450 (CYP) or other polymorphisms may correlate with
      attained pazopanib levels in response to standard pazopanib dosing.

      II. To assess whether patient trough pazopanib levels attained 24 hours after initiation of
      800 mg daily fasting may predict steady state trough pazopanib levels after 14 days of
      pazopanib administration.

      III. To assess whether patient trough pazopanib levels may correlate with observed pazopanib
      toxicities.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Course
      length can be extended to 56 days at the discretion of the treating physician after 12
      courses (1 year) of treatment on study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
