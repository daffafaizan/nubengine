      12) of Part A, participants will continue the study in Part B, which will last for an
      additional 18 months (30 months from Day 1), during which all participants will continue to
      receive oral treatment with ALXN2060. Following completion of Month 30 assessments in Part B,
      participants will be offered the opportunity to continue to receive ALXN2060 in the Extension
      Period, which will last until ALXN2060 is approved in Japan or for up to 24 additional
      months, whichever occurs first.
