      Porto Alegre (HCPA). Each patient will be treated with laser and microneedle at the same
      time, being applied a therapeutic procedure in each part of the abdomen (divided lengthwise
      and in equal parts). Each part of the abdomen will be randomized for the treatment of laser
      or microneedling with the help of the Excel 2013 program. The investigator responsible for
      procedures and patients are the only ones with unblinded assessment in relation to the side
      of each treatment. There will be 5 sessions with monthly intervals of the proposed
      treatments. The ND-yap 1340-nm laser will be used, and in the other segment of the abdomen,
      the dermaroller 2.5 mm was applied. Photographic records of patients will be performed at
      pre-treatment and 1 month after the third and fifth sessions. The questionnaires will be
      applied to assess the quality of life in dermatology DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index).
      Two independent and blind evaluators for the type of treatment will apply in the Global
      Aesthetic Scale (GAIS) in the evaluation of photographic records. Cutaneous biopsies for
      histopathological evaluation will be performed with a punch 3 mm of each part of the abdomen
      at pretreatment. Two experienced pathologists will evaluate the measurements of the epidermis
      and the collagen and elastic fibers of the skin.
