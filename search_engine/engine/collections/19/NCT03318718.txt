      duration non-depolarizing NMBA, rocuronium (0.3 mg/kg) until TOF 0 at the hand is achieved.
      TOF measurements will be performed at baseline 5 minutes after induction. Moreover, TOF
      measurements will be performed 5 minutes after each rocuronium bolus. When TOF 0 at the hand
      is achieved the MEPs of the paraspinal musculature will be measured. When there is remaining
      muscle tonus of the paraspinal musculature another bolus of rocuronium is administered until
      no MEPs can be measured for the paraspinal musculature.
