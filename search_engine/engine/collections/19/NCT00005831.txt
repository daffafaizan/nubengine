      I. To assess the toxicity of the combination of Herceptin, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
      gemcitabine in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent urothelial cancers who
      overexpress HER2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The complete and partial response rates. II. The median and overall survival. III. To
      prospectively evaluate the percentage of patients with metastatic/recurrent bladder cancer
      who overexpress HER2 histologically (by immunohistochemistry and FISH) and serologically.

      IV. To generate preliminary data on response to other therapy and survival for Her2 negative
      patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15;
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 15 minutes on day 1; and gemcitabine IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 3 weeks. Patients achieving a complete
      response (CR) receive 3 courses past CR. Patients achieving a partial response or stable
      disease continue on therapy until CR or disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for disease progression and survival. Patients with HER2-negative
      disease are not eligible for treatment but are followed every 6 months for response and
      survival.
