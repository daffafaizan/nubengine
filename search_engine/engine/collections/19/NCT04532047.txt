      mortality, particularly in the setting of Non-Immune Hydrops Fetalis (NIHF), the
      administration of the approved enzyme therapy in utero has the potential to significantly
      improve outcomes for affected fetuses. The perinatal death rate associated with NIHF ranges
      from 30 to 75%, so development of an in utero approach to treatment could be of significant
      benefit. The in utero period has been shown to be a time of relative fetal tolerance to
      immune stimuli, and this tolerance may lead to improved response to ERT in situations where
      postnatal initiation instead leads to antibody development and impaired response to
      treatment. It is also probable that in some cases, initiation of ERT in utero leads to
      improved neurodevelopmental outcomes if the replaced enzyme impacts the neurologic system
      during critical periods of development.

      This is a phase 1 clinical trial to determine the safety and feasibility of fetal enzyme
      replacement therapy in fetuses with LSD
