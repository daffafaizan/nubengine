      whether patients under hyposalivation present damaged mastication and speech. Forty subjects
      composed 2 groups: Control (C) and hyposalivation (H). Masticatory performance (MP) was
      carried out using artificial material and a 10-sieve method. Mandibular movements during
      speech were obtained using a 3D jaw-tracking device. Neither mastication nor speech have been
      impaired by low salivary flow rate.
