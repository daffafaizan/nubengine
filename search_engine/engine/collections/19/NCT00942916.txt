      environment including soil and water. Therefore, NTM pulmonary infection is not diagnosed
      only by microbiology of respiratory specimen but also clinical and radiographical
      findings.(1) Due to airway NTM colonization is not uncommon in sputum, diagnosis of pulmonary
      NTM infection is a big challenge in clinical practice. Especially NTM burden is increasing in
      recent literature.(2,3) Besides, the short-term mortality is reported higher in patients with
      NTM infection in medical ICU by Shu et al.(4) Early diagnosis and then treatment of NTM
      infection become important though NTM infection is considered as indolent process before.(1)
      Inflammatory marker in the patients with NTM being isolated from respiratory specimens is an
      indicator for differentiating true infection from colonization.(5,6) Those inflammatory
      factors might include blood white count, C-reactive protein, cytokines, procalcitonin ,
      trigger receptor expressed on myeloid cell-1 (TREM-1) and Toll-like receptor-2. We therefore
      conduct this prospective study for analyzing
