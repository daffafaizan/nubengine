    
      The mechanism of action of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) relies on their ability to modulate
      pathogenic immune responses and provide neuroprotection through the release of
      anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and trophic factors as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo
      preclinical studies.

      Patients will be randomized to receive immediate vs. delayed treatment with either a dose
      equal to 1-2 millions/kg of body weight of autologous MSC, or equivalent volume of suspension
      media at baseline. At 6 months treatments will be reversed.

      The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate

        -  treatment's safety within one year from MSC administration by measuring the the number,
           time-frame and severity of adverse event and

        -  treatment's activity in terms of reduction in the total number of contrast-gadolinium
           enhancing lesions (GEL) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

      Secondary outcomes are to gain preliminary information on the efficacy of the experimental
      treatment in terms of combined MRI activity and clinical efficacy (incidence of relapses and
      disability progression).
