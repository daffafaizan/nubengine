      increase in the prefrontal cortex hypothesized to simulate the synaptic dysregulation that
      occurs endogenously in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The purpose of this is: 1) to
      determine whether the low dose (40 mg BID) utilized in recent (failed) clinical trials is
      sufficient to engage the primary target and 2) whether a higher (160 mg BID) dose,
      representing the maximum tolerated dose of POMA, engages the target to a greater degree. This
      study will further validate pharmacoBOLD as biomarker of mGluR2/3 target engagement,
      permitting its future use in other glutamatergic drug development.
