    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of gemcitabine in combination with elimusertib (BAY
      1895344), as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0. (Dose
      Escalation and Expansion Cohort) II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      gemcitabine in combination with BAY 1895344. (Dose Escalation Cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Analyze the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of
      the gemcitabine and BAY 1895344 combination.

      III. Assessing whether immunohistochemical markers of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage,
      gamma-H2AX and pNBS1, increase in on-treatment biopsies compared to the levels seen in
      pre-treatment biopsies.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore biomarkers that predict response to this combination. II. Evaluate mechanisms of
      acquired resistance to this combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine followed by a dose expansion study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and BAY
      1895344 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3 and 8-10. Cycles repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
