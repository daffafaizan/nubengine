      routine breast MRI examination using a software package from General Electric Medical Systems
      Milwaukee, WI). This will add time to the routine examination but will not involve additional
      injections of contrast. We will analyze the spectroscopic data to determine if benign lesions
      can be reliably differentiated from malignant ones.
