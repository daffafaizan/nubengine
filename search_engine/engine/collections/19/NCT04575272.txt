      to manage and causes significant morbidity due to the severe pain implied.

      Patients can present with respiratory compromise as their capacity to expand the thorax is
      limited by pain. As a result, they are at high risk to develop atelectasis and pneumonia.

      the key goal of management is adequate analgesia and pulmonary volume expansion Various
      strategies to treat such pain have been utilized, including regional analgesia (intrapleural,
      intercostal paravertebral nerve blockade), and neuraxial analgesia (thoracic epidural
      analgesia (TEA), intrathecal opioids).

      The use of neuraxial analgesia in polytrauma is frequently limited by the need for aggressive
      venous thromboembolic (VTE) prophylaxis, and positioning of the patient for a neuraxial
      approach may be impossible.

      There is a growing interest in exploring treatments that are less invasive than EA and can be
      performed on patients who have contraindications to neuraxial analgesia. Ultrasound-guided
      Serratus Anterior Plane (SAP) block is a recent technique, first described by Blanco et al.
      in 2013, that provides analgesia for the thoracic wall by blocking the lateral branches of
      the intercostal nerves from T2 to L2. It is a safe, simple to perform block with no
      significant contraindications or side effects. he described 2 potential spaces, one
      superficial and another deep to serratus. The SAPB has been used effectively for the
      management of pain in the context of rib fractures, thoracoscopic surgery, thoracotomy,
      breast surgery, and post-mastectomy pain syndrome, few studies compared the two approaches,
      and the difference between them has not yet been studied in patients with multiple rib
      fractures.
