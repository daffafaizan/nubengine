    
      The Global FKRP Registry (https://www.fkrp-registry.org/) is an international registry for
      patients with an FKRP-related condition; no experimental intervention is involved. Patients
      will receive information on the most up to date standards of care relating to their disease
      and may be invited to participate in relevant clinical trials. Their data will be updated
      annually and stored indefinitely, or until they request their data to be removed.

      The data will be collected via an online form and will be stored on a secure server based in
      the United Kingdom and looked after by the registry staff at Newcastle University. Data
      collected from patients will include demographic information, diagnosis, current condition,
      age of onset, medication, contractures, family history and results of genetic testing, if
      available. Other optional questionnaires will focus on patients' pain and quality of life.
      Further information collected from patients' doctors will include, heart and lung function,
      muscle strength, muscle and brain MRI findings and genetics.

      The FKRP registry is funded by LGMD2i Research Fund and CureLGMD2I.

      The primary objectives of the Global FKRP Registry are to:

        -  Accelerate and facilitate clinical trials by locating potential research subjects
           quickly and efficiently

        -  Facilitate in the planning of clinical trials

        -  Assist the neuromuscular community with the development of recommendations and standards
           of care

        -  Characterise and describe the FKRP population as a whole, enhancing the understanding of
           the prevalence throughout the world.
