      characterized by pain around the lateral epicondyle during resistant wrist extension. This
      condition has been reported to occur as a result of degenerative angiofibroblastic
      hyperplasia of the wrist extensor tendons due to repetitive microtrauma. Although
      conservative treatments are usually used in lateral epicondylitis, many of them do not have
      sufficient evidence. In some cases, the healing phase lasts for months, which may be long
      enough to affect quality of life and sport performance.

      Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is used in musculoskeletal problems with a possible
      mechanism of action, including hyperstimulation analgesia, neovascularization, and induction
      of the healing process. However, this method is a painful method due to the shock wave
      applied and may cause temporary redness in the area of application. This may cause the
      subcutaneous fascia of the affected area to be affected by the application pressure.
      Kinesiotaping (KT) is widely used in the treatment of various musculoskeletal problems. The
      band, invented by the Japanese chiropractor Kenzo Kase in the 1970s, is a heat-sensitive
      acrylic adhesive and an elastic woven cotton stripe with a maximum tensile strength of up to
      about 40-60% of its total length. Many effects of KT have been hypothesised, including
      improvement of feedback and correction of the articular alignment disorder. KT has an effect
      on the skin and fascia. recovery will be provided faster.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of ESWT application with ESWT + KT
      application. In this study, our hypothesis is that ESWT + KT application will have more
      effect on pain and muscle strength in LE patients than ESWT alone.
