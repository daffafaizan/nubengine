      King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Thailand. The protocol was approved by the
      Institutional Review Board of Chulalongkorn University, and the study was performed in
      accordance with Declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonization Good
      Clinical Practice, the European Directive 2001/20/EC, and written informed consent was
      obtained from parents or a legally acceptable representative before enrolment.

      Vaccines: JE-CV was manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur Biologics Co., USA., and reconstituted
      using 0.4% sodium chloride diluent for injection; each dose 0.5 ml contained 4.0-5.8 log10
      plaque forming units of virus Serology: JE neutralizing antibody levels were assessed using a
      PRNT50 assay. The final end point neutralization titer is the inverse of the highest serial
      dilution of serum that can neutralize â‰¥ 50% of JE challenge virus. Testing was performed at
      Focus Diagnostics Inc. using JE-CV as a challenge virus.

      Statistical methods: sample size was calculated based on historical data from JE15 study, at
      month 24 after first dose of JE-CV, the GMT of JE neutralizing antibody was 39.4 (95% CI 33.7
      to 46.0) and increase to 2242 (95% CI 1913, 2628) at day 28 post JE-CV booster dose. On the
      assumption that children who received SA14-14-2 vaccine and subsequently get one booster dose
      of JE-CV at 12-24 months later will have GMT of at least 1040, with 80% power and alpha 0.05,
      data at least 43 children need to be collected. When accounted for 15% of children who might
      loss to follow-up or cannot get adequate blood sample, 50 children should be enrolled.

      The per-protocol population will be used for the main immunogenicity analyses. For the main
      parameters, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of point estimates will be calculated using the
      normal approximation for quantitative data and the exact binomial distribution for
      proportions. The point estimates and their 95% CI of the following will be presented for each
      group of the Geometric Mean (GM) of neutralizing antibody on D0 and D28 and the percentage of
      subjects with neutralizing antibody >=10 at D0 and D28
