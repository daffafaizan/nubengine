      To show that ILC2 levels differ between asthma patients with a "TH2" (helper T cell type 2)
      profile and asthma patients with a "non-TH2" profile. A TH2 profile is defined as (for a
      given patient):

        -  circulating eosinophils > 500 mm^3 at least once during the year AND

        -  positive allergy skin or specific IgE (Immunoglobulin E) test AND

        -  induced sputum eosinophil level >3% of leukocytes AND

        -  exhaled nitric oxide > 25 ppb.

      To study the variation in ILC2 levels over time among asthma patients who obtained a good
      level of control compared to other patients. A good level of control is defined as:

        -  no exacerbations during 6 months of followup (an exacerbation is defined as the
           un-planned need for care that modifies the patient's prescription for >48h)

        -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) value current / FEV1 best value > 0.8

        -  symptom levels correspond to an ACQ (Asthma Control Questionnaire) questionnaire score
           of < 0.75 over the last 7 days
