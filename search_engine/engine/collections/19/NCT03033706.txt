      and prolonged operative time. The role of fluid therapy in these patients is very critical,
      hypovolemia might lead to brain hypoperfusion and over-transfusion might lead increased
      intracranial tension. All these factors make fluid management in these procedures complex and
      challenging. Evidence on the optimum protocol for intraoperative fluid management in
      neurosurgical patients is still lacking.

      Goal-directed therapy (GDT) in the operating room is a term used to describe the use of
      cardiac output or similar parameters to guide intravenous fluid and inotropic therapy.

      Although GDT was well reported in many procedures, its benefit in neurosurgical operations is
      not well studied.

      Pulse pressure variation (PPV) is a famous dynamic method of fluid responsiveness. PPV is
      simply calculated by dividing the largest pulse pressure (PPmax - PPmin) by the average pulse
      pressure (PPmax + PPmin /2) and expressed as percentage. PPV was previously used in GDT in
      major abdominal surgery with good performance.

      The aim of this study is to compare the restricted fluid approach (1 ml/Kg/hr) guided by PPV
      to standard fluid management (4ml/Kg/hr) in patients undergoing supratentorial mass excision.
      The investigators hypothesize that in these procedures GDT might improve brain relaxation,
      and patient hemodynamics intra and postoperatively.
