    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine the efficacy of Sunitinib on the progression-free survival at 12 months in
      subjects with progressive malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treated with sunitinib
      at a starting dose of 37.5 mg daily (continuous dosing).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine overall survival and progression free survival.

        -  To determine time to progression.

        -  To determine objective response rate at one year.

        -  To determine time to and duration of tumor response.

        -  To assess safety profile including a dedicated cardiovascular management (home-blood
           pressure monitoring, ECG and echocardiography).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      -Identification of predictors of response as well as surrogate markers of overall survival is
      anticipated
