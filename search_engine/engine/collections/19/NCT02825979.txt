      management of Atrial Fibrillation.

      All patients will undergo a loop recorder implantation (REVEAL LINQ, Medtronic), also called
      an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM), at the time of study enrolment using standard clinical
      implant procedures.

      The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of an early invasive
      approach. Specifically, the investigators are aiming to evaluate if PVI performed with the
      Arctic Front cryoballoon is superior to AAD as first-line therapy in preventing atrial
      arrhythmia recurrences (arrhythmia related symptoms, hospitalisations, and health care
      utilization).

      The secondary goal of the program is to evaluate the health related quality of life (HRQOL)
      impact associated with early invasive intervention, in comparison to primary AAD therapy.
      This analysis will be centered on an evaluation of generic and disease-specific HRQOL
      instruments in order to determine the impact of an early invasive approach. A secondary
      benefit is the derivation of a Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) score, which can be used
      as a summary measure of health outcome and to inform subsequent healthcare resource
      allocation decisions.
