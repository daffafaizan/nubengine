      effects from 15% with photon therapy to 7.5% by the use of protons. With an alpha of 0.05 and
      80% power it is therefore necessary to treat 131 patients with protons to detect such
      difference. With an estimated drop-out rate of 10% 146 patients have to be recruited to the
      proton arm. As randomization to photon or proton therapy is not possible in a multicenter
      setting with only few proton facilities available patients treated with photons will be
      prospectively matched to their proton counterparts. Stratification criteria will include:
      Age, high dose volume, androgen deprivation, history of surgery, obstructive disease,
      increased risk for rectal bleeding, socio-economic criteria and use of rectal balloon during
      radiotherapy. Comparison of the primary endpoint will be restricted to patients without
      irradiation of lymphatic drainage.
