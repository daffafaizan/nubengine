      patients with delirium. For the first time, this longitudinal study will rely on repeated and
      concomitant: i) SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies detection and associated serology testing profiles
      description (peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid - CSF), ii) systemic and central immune
      response characterization, associated to the assessment of CNS damage biomarkers (peripheral
      blood and CSF), iii) in vivo brain PET-TSPO acquisitions (Positon Emission Tomography using a
      radioligand that targets the Translocator Protein, which is upregulated in activated
      microglia), iv) structural/functional brain MRI assessment (PWI/DWI mismatch imaging,
      quantification of gray and white matter microstructural integrity, DTI, functional
      connectivity), v) multi-domains neurocognitive assessment. This dataset will be made FAIR to
      allow open data use and to prepare future studies.
