      accepted conventional treatment is surgery intended to treat the tracts using different
      technical options. This surgery usually has a highly bothersome postoperative period and may
      involve two major complications: anal incontinence and recurrence. The biological properties
      of stem cells derived from adult tissues make them adequate candidates for the treatment of
      diseases in which tissues are damaged or the healing process is altered. This study will
      compare the efficacy of ASCs versus ASCs plus Fibrin adhesive versus Fibrin adhesive alone
      for closure of complex perianal fistulas not associated to Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
      Fistula closure is defined as absence of suppuration and re-epithelization of the external
      opening in the clinical evaluation and absence of collections >2 cm directly related to the
      fistula tract treated, as measured by MRI
