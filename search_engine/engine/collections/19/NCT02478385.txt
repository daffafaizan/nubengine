      environment on midwifery practice and the women's birth experiences. Results from these
      studies show that a home-like birth environment has positive effects on both midwifery
      practice and the birth experience. The hormone oxytocin that causes contractions during
      labour may play an important role in this context. The hormone is released when being in a
      safe, secure and confident environment. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the
      birth environment also has an impact on birth outcomes.

      To investigate this assumption one traditional labour room was transformed to an experimental
      labour room. The design of the room is inspired by knowledge from evidence-based healthcare
      design, which describes bringing nature into the room. Furthermore, it is possible for the
      parents to design their own birth setting by choosing atmosphere through sound, light and
      nature scenes.
