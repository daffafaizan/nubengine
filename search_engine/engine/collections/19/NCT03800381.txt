      TB with and without HIV coinfection. The new HRZ FDC dispersible tablet was designed to be
      child-friendly and to achieve recommended dosages for each weight-band. The formulation has
      been rolled out in Africa without PK studies in the target population to verify that the
      tablets achieves adequate drug concentrations. The current study will evaluate the adequacy
      of the formulation by examining the PK of the component drugs as well as the effect of HIV
      coinfection. The direct PK data will be used in a population PK model and stimulations to
      define optimal weight-band dosages and proportions of the components of the pediatric FDC
      tablets.
