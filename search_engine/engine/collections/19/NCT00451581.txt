      endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) for endoscopic treatment of common bile duct (CBD) stones.
      EPBD is as effective as EST in stone clearance with a lower risk of hemorrhage, and may
      preserve the function of sphincter of Oddi. However, it has been reported that about 20% of
      patients undergoing EPBD need EST as a rescue procedure for lithotripsy. A longer dilation
      duraton of 5 mintues as opposed to 1 minute has been proposed to decrease oozing after
      dilation and facilitate lithotripsy, and it is hypothesized that it will reduce the need of
      switching to EST.
