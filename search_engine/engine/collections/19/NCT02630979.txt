      satisfaction of medical oncologists with the results of some expensive cytotoxic agents. The
      study also measures the physician knowledge with the toxicity profile of the tested drugs,
      pharmaceutical perspectives, methods of administration, adherence to guidelines and the
      degree of bias of the physicians when prescribing this drugs.

      The tested drugs are trastuzumab, lapatinib, sunitinib, m tor inhibitors, sorafenib,
      cetuximab, panitumumab, bevacizumab, erlotinib, rituximab, imatinib mesylate, gefitinib,
      abiraterone acetate, cabazitaxel, pertuzumab, fulvestrant, pemetrexate and crizotinib.

      The evaluation will be through a predesigned questionnaire ( 30 questions ). The questions
      are divided into four categories measuring four items, the degree of physician satisfaction
      with the drugs results and toxicity profile, orientation with pharmaceutical perspectives of
      the drugs, adherence to guidelines and degree of bias with pharmaceutical companies
      complements. A predesigned questionnaire based scoring system will categorise the processed
      data to low, intermediate and high score for each of the four measured topics. The data will
      be processed and the degree of satisfaction, orientation with pharmaceutical perspectives,
      adherence to guidelines and degree of bias will be grade to low, moderate or high. Subsequent
      recommendations for cost effective analysis, physician education and strict auditing measures
      for drug prescription will be elaborated for the drugs.

      NB: The study will be on two waves. The first wave will evaluate 9 drugs and the second wave
      will evaluate 8 drugs.
