      efficacy in controlled settings with specialist therapists and expert supervision, but much
      less in known about the effectiveness of BED interventions and whether the transition of
      evidence-based treatments to the community results in poorer outcomes. UNITE activates a key
      resource by incorporating an important part of the patient's social environment (the partner)
      into treatment. The investigators hypothesize that UNITE will show preliminary evidence of
      being superior to CBT-E in achieving binge abstinence via engaging ED-related relationship
      targets, including improved (a) communication around the disorder, (b) disorder-specific
      interpersonal problem-solving/ behavioral change skills, and (c) partner-assisted emotion
      regulation. The investigators will assess targeted relationship domains with observational
      and speech prosody measures during clinic interactions and self-reports reflecting
      experiences outside the clinic. Because the couple is learning how to work together to
      address BED, the investigators hypothesize that maintenance of gains will show evidence
      consistent with superiority in UNITE.
