      effectiveness of two parenting programs, the Triple P and Circle of Security Parenting
      (COSP), in the province of Ontario, on parenting practices and functioning, and child
      emotional behaviour problems outcomes, and secondary outcomes including selected child
      maltreatment-related outcomes. These objectives will be achieved in two phases. The
      investigators will conduct a multi-site, three-arm randomized controlled trial of 600
      participating caregivers and their children to compare Triple P (level 4 group) and COSP to
      treatment as usual (TAU) with respect to improving positive practices and child outcomes.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three conditions using stratified (by
      site) block randomization. All participants will undergo screening and a baseline assessment
      before randomization. Once randomized, the Triple P and COSP caregivers will receive 8-week
      session. The TAU group will receive a different program, or short therapy sessions depending
      on the organization. Caregivers will complete follow-up assessments at post-treatment, 6- and
      12-months.
