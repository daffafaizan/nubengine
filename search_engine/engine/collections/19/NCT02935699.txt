    
      This was a multi-center, parallel group, randomized, double-blind, active controlled, Phase
      III clinical trial of cetirizine injection 10 mg/mL versus diphenhydramine injection 50 mg/mL
      (Benadryl or generic equivalent) in approximately 256 subjects who either presented to
      Emergency Departments, hospitals, allergy clinics or Urgent Care Centers with acute
      urticaria, or developed acute urticaria following allergen challenge at an Allergy Clinic.

      Patients signed an informed consent and were evaluated for eligibility for inclusion to
      treat. Eligible subjects were assessed for baseline characteristics, medical and surgical
      histories, concomitant medications and given a brief physical exam.

      Subjects were then randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to blindly receive either cetirizine 10 mg/mL
      injection or diphenhydramine 50 mg/mL injection.

      Efficacy assessments included patient-rated severity of pruritus, physician assessments of
      extent of urticaria/erythema, and sedation score. Subjects remained in the treatment center
      for at least after the 1 hr assessment, after which they may have been discharged at the
      physician's discretion.

      Safety was monitored through the reporting of adverse events for up to 28 days following
      treatments and by monitoring vital signs at planned intervals from admission into the
      treating facility until readiness for discharge. After 24 and 48 hrs after discharge,
      subjects were contacted by phone for follow-up questions regarding recurrence of symptoms,
      new symptoms, additional medication taken, side effects from medication taken after
      discharge, relapse requiring a return to treatment center, and return to normal activities.
