      against fasting that normal cells do. Because of this, researchers would like to study how
      fasting may help chemotherapy target cancer cells instead of normal cells. Initial studies
      suggest that fasting may decrease the side effects of chemotherapy and increase the chances
      of your cancer responding to the chemotherapy. Patient populations will have non-small cell
      lung cancer in which chemo-immunotherapy with carboplatin/pemetrexed and pembrolizumab have
      been recommended to treat the cancer as part of standard care.

      Primary Objective 1. To determine the feasibility and compliance of administering a
      fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving maintenance therapy

      Secondary Objectives

      1. To assess a patient's willingness to fast for second cycle

      Correlative Objectives

        1. To assess DNA damage via measurement of γ-Η2ΑΧ foci in PBMCs at baseline and following
           one cycle of FMD (day 21 or day 28)

        2. To assess spheroid formation from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from patients
           post FMD as compared to baseline (prior to fasting)

        3. To measure the changes in immune markers prior to and after administering the FMD
