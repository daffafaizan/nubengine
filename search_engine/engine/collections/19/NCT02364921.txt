      healing of venous leg ulcers measured by the Resvech 2.0 scale and evaluates improvement in
      quality of life, measured by the Charing Cross Venous Ulcer Questionnaire (CCVUQ-e) and
      analyze the sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment factors associated with complete
      healing of venous ulcers.

      Design: Multicentre, controlled, parallel group, randomized clinical trial, with blind
      evaluation of the response variable.

      Setting: Primary Care Health Centres (Madrid). Subjects: Patients with venous leg ulcers,
      treated by nurses at the participating centres.

      Intervention: Experimental group: multilayer compression bandage (two layers). Control group:
      crepe bandage.

      Sample size: 216 patients (108 in each group) Variables:Main: Complete healing after 12 weeks
      follow-up. Secondary: Degree of healing (Resvech 2.0). Quality of life (CCVUQ-e). Adverse
      reactions. Related to the healing process: comorbidities, topical and systematic treatments,
      exercise, BMI. Prognostic factors: location, number and duration of ulcer. Sociodemographic
      factors Data analysis: By intention to treat. Comparative analysis of the two groups
      (chi-squared or t-test). Effectiveness analysis sing Kaplan-Meier, log rank test and cox
