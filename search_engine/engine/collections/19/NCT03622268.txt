      calorimetry and identify the appropriate energy expenditure requirement of liver
      transplant(LT) recipients in South Korea.

      Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in a surgical ICU in an academic
      tertiary hospital over three months. Thirty mechanically ventilated patients who had received
      liver transplants and were expected to stay in the ICU more than 2 days were studied. Resting
      energy expenditure(REE) was measured 48 hours after ICU admission using open-circuit indirect
      calorimetry. Theoretical REE was estimated using three predictive equations: Harris-Benedict
      methods, lreton-Jones ventilated, and Penn state 1988. The REEs derived from each predictive
      equation were compared with the measured REE using an intraclass correlation coefficient
      (ICC) and a Bland-Altman plot.
