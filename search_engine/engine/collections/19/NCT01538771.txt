    
      [Eligibility Criteria]

      1. Patients, regardless of gender, at the age from 18 to 80 years were eligible if they had
      within 12 hours of onset of ST-segment myocardial infarction that was decided to treat with
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention.

      [Exclusion criteria]

        1. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure (Killip classes II and III, or cardiogenic shock)

        2. History of malignancy

        3. Serious hematological disease

        4. Current infectious disease requiring antibiotic therapy

        5. Baseline creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dL or dependence on dialysis

        6. Known hypersensitivity to or contraindication for heparin, aspirin, clopidogrel,
           sirolimus, everolimus, contrast medium and darbepoetin-Î±

      [Primary endpoint] Myocardial infarct size, estimated by measurement of peak levels of
      cardiac biomarker (CK-MB and troponin-I of the patients was followed for 48 hours at every 6
      hours)

      [Secondary end points]

        1. The infarct size, measured as the area of delayed enhancement seen with cardiac magnetic
           resonance (CMR) imaging on average four days after ST-segment elevation myocardial
           infarction (baseline)

        2. The proportion of area at risk (AAR) and salvaged myocardium, calculated by formula;
           [AAR - Infarct size] / AAR X 100 (%)

        3. The change of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV end-diastolic volume
           (LVEDV), and LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) assessed by CMR between four days and four
           months

        4. LV remodeling index [(LVEDV at four months - baseline LVEDV) / baseline LVEDV X 100%]
           and the incidence of pathologic LV remodeling (LV remodeling index > 20%);

      [Safety endpoints] The incidence of composites of the cardiovascular endpoints (cardiac
      death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, hospital
      readmission with heart failure or ischemic symptoms, bleeding and urgent target lesion
      revascularization) assessed at four months.
