      resulting from fluid accumulation may cause anorexia, sleep disturbance, pain, dyspnoea,
      abdominal distension, fatigue, nausea vomiting and reduced mobility. The main complaints of
      pleural effusion are dyspnoea and cough. Paracentesis and thoracentesis provide relief for a
      very limited period.

      Studies have shown high concentrations of VEGF in malignant ascites and pleural effusion.
      Beneficial effects of treatment with an intravenous or intraperitoneal antibody against VEGF
      on malignant ascites have been reported. In the recent past we have treated two patients with
      symptomatic malignant ascites (colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively) in a phase
      I study with cediranib. Shortly after start of cediranib, within a couple of days, the
      ascites disappeared. However, after stopping cediranib for progressive disease on other sites
      the ascites reappeared within days. Therefore, one of those patients was treated with
      cediranib as palliative treatment until two days before his death, which was beneficial for
      this patient.

      In this phase II study we would like to investigate the effects of treatment with cediranib
      as palliative treatment on malignant ascites or pleural effusion.
