      standard procedure usually applied and showed high success rates. This should allow us to
      assess whether the chosen grafting material would have a positive influence on the study
      outcomes as compared to it.

      Intraoral and extraoral autologous bone grafts could be considered as the "Gold standard"
      pre-prosthetic dentoalveolar reconstruction of atrophic jaws with cortico-cancellous bone
      grafts from intraoral and/or extraoral donor sites as a predictable technique for the
      facilitation of dental rehabilitation of atrophic ridges, associated with high bone survival
      rate and long term implant success. Autogenous bone corresponds to bone graft obtained from
      the same individual. It is considered the gold standard for filling of bone defects since it
      allows (I) osseointegration: direct contact with bone tissue without fibrous tissue ; (II)
      osteoconduction: support to bone growth (III) osteoinduction: differentiation of mesenchymal
      cells of surrounding tissue (receptor site) into osteoblastic cells ; and (IV) osteogenesis:
      bone neoformation by osteoblastic cells present in the graft material. Although few mature
      osteoblasts survive to grafting, precursor cells are responsible for the osteogenic potential
