    
      The proposed clinical trial is a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel, multicenter study with three treatment groups.

      The total number of 75 subjects should be enrolled to provide for a 20% dropout rate.

      Subjects will be randomized into one of the following 3 groups:

        -  milk without sterols and hawthorn powder

        -  milk with 1.2g/d sterols and 8g/d hawthorn powder

        -  milk with 1.8g/d sterols and 8g/d hawthorn powder

      The trial population will consist of female or male volunteers aged 18 - 65 years of age with
      primary mild to moderate hyperlipidemia documented by a serum cholesterol of 5.18-6.21mmol/L
      AND serum Triglycerides (TG): 1.7-5.65mmol/L , for at least 1 time tested by central
      laboratory in the past 2 weeks prior to recruitment.
