      Proton Pump Inhibitor and H2 receptor antagonist for the prevention of recurrent peptic
      ulcers in thienopyridine users. We plan to enroll 334 thienopyridine (clopidogrel or
      ticlopidine) users without baseline gastroduodenal ulcer at initial endoscopy. The patients
      will be randomly assigned to receive either (1) pantoprazole (40 mg qd) or (2) famotidine (40
      mg qd) for 6 months.The ulcer recurrence rate between the treatment groups will be compared.
