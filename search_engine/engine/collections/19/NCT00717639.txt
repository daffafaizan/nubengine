      agents, computed tomography angiography, ultrasound or i.a. DSA have been performed
      beforehand and if the patient has been scheduled for an i.a. DSA to be performed. Vasovist速
      enhanced MRA imaging will be performed using a state-of-the-art 1.5T MR system. Recruitment,
      baseline examinations, Vasovist速-enhanced MRA of the vessel segments of interest and
      follow-up examinations will be performed in up to 8 radiological clinics in Europe. The
      safety follow-up period will be at least 12 hours but not more than 24 hours post injection
      of Vasovist速 and includes the assessment of physical examinations and vital signs as well as
      the assessment of AEs. DSA must be carried out at least 12 hours after Vasovist速
      administration and only after the last follow-up visit has been performed.
