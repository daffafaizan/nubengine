      valuable and helpful for others. With advantage of MR-PET in better soft tissue
      delineation/functional information and less radiation dose than PET-CT, the ultimate goal in
      both research and clinical application is to establish new diagnostic standard and management
      guideline by MR-PET, which can further improve clinical outcome and disease prognosis in
      patients colorectal cancer.
