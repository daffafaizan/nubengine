    
      This is an observational study . Each addictovigilance centre will contact Pain Clinics in
      order to enroll patients meeting the inclusion criteria. The questionnaires will be prepared
      and sent to the participating centres by the coordinating centre (Clermont-Ferrand).
      Participation in the study will be systematically proposed by the physician during the study
      inclusion period (3 months). Patients meeting all inclusion criteria will be enrolled after
      receiving oral information about the study.

      This questionnaire can be semi-directed (doctor / nurse / CRA) and will be carried out during
      a consultation as part of their usual care. Answering the questionnaire should take no more
      than 10 minutes. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures will be applied to
      patients.
