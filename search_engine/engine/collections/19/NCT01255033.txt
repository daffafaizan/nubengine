        -  during one-lung ventilation which leads to changes about ratio in ventilated and
           perfused lung areas. This blood flow redistribution promotes shunt with a decreased
           arterial oxygenation and possible hypoxemia.

        -  during the postoperative period.

      Common measure of arterial saturation through SpO2 may miss a great number of hypoxic events
      with regional impact because a significant decrease in SpO2 occurs for an arterial pressure
      in oxygen below 60 mmHg. Currently, cerebral and somatic saturation can be monitored
      non-invasively and continuously via optical sensors applied to the right and left forehead
      and to the thenar eminence. These devices may help clinicians in the detection of such
      hypoxemic events.
