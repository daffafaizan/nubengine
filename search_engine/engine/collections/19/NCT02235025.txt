      related medication such as short and long acting bronchodilators 72 hours prior to the visit.
      Subjects are asked to arrive early in the morning. After informed consent and appropriate
      screening of medical history, all subjects complete the mMRC scale. A complete medical
      history is collected. Subjects thereafter complete pulmonary function testing pre- and 30-min
      post-bronchodilator. Subjects are given a normal mixed meal and are asked not to drink
      alcohol or coffee.

      A symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise test is performed on the same day, at least 6
      hours after the bronchodilator test and at least 4 hours after the meal. After a steady-state
      resting period, a 3-min warm-up is conducted at about 20% of individually estimated maximal
      work load (Wmax), and the load is increased every minute in such a way that the test duration
      is >8 and <12 min. The following data are obtained breath by breath and expressed as 30-s
      averages: V'O2 and carbon dioxide production (V'CO2); minute ventilation (V'E); tidal volume
      (VT); respiratory rate; and ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide. Blood
      pressure is measured every minute by a sphygmomanometer. Blood samples are withdrawn from the
      arterialized earlobe at rest and at near-maximal exercise. Tests are terminated at the point
      of symptom limitation (peak exercise). Upon exercise cessation, subjects are asked to
      verbalize their main reason for stopping exercise (breathing discomfort, leg discomfort or
      both).
