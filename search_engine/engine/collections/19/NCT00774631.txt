      This study evaluates the impact of mild induced hypothermia (32-34°C) during 48 hours
      followed by passive rewarming according to recommendations described in appendix. All
      treatment will be according to local recommendations and guidelines of medical societies and
      literature. Physicians are advised to use these recommendations; however, the best treatment
      option for the individual patient should be used.

      Mild Induced hypothermia:

      Investigators are advised to use the cooling techniques as used in patients with cardiac
      arrest. Thus, the choice of cooling method will be left to investigators. Hypothermia will be
      induced by cold saline infusion as described in appendix 5 [6, 48]. Core temperature will be
      monitored by oesophageal probe and maintained between 32°C and 34°C during 48 hours and
      followed by strictly passive rewarming. During this phase of treatment, patients will receive
      deep sedation associated with neuromuscular blockers. Centers participating to the trial will
      have expertise in cooling methods.

      Controls:

      Controls will receive standard care and will be also be deeply sedated for 48 hours.
