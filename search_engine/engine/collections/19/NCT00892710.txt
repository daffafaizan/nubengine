    
      This randomized, Phase II trial will evaluate three treatment regimens in patients with
      previously untreated stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and a performance
      status (PS) of 2. Patients will be randomized to either pemetrexed alone, pemetrexed and
      bevacizumab, or pemetrexed, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in a 1:1:1 fashion. All 3 regimens
      should be tolerable in poor performance status patients with advanced NSCLC. The 3-drug
      regimen (pemetrexed/carboplatin/bevacizumab) has been modified by lowering the dose of
      carboplatin, in order to minimize myelosuppression. This trial will be conducted at multiple
      study sites.
