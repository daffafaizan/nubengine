      addition to their own symptoms or Amsler grid use and aid in their prompt referral to eye
      care professional examination so clinical diagnosis can be made. As such the goal of the
      clinical plan is to demonstrate that patients who have CNV do demonstrate visual field
      abnormalities when tested with the HMP
