    
      This Phase II trial will evaluate at least 100 patients for the rate of complete or major
      cytogenetic response of STI571 as demonstrated by a decrease in the percentage of Ph
      chromosome positive cells in the bone marrow in patients with CML who are refractory to or
      intolerant of interferon-alpha. Statistical considerations are based on the refractory
      patient population only. Intolerant patients are included as long as recruitment of the
      refractory patients is ongoing, up to a maximum of 100 intolerant patients, whichever comes
      first.
