      analyze the medical record data, including standard of care vulvar photographs, of the vulvar
      LS population at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) and the outpatient clinics of
      Northwestern Medicine (NM). These photographs will be used to develop a vulvar scarring
      grading scale for LS. The objective measurement of scarring severity in LS deidentified
      standard-of-care patient photographs will be correlated with clinical examination findings to
      assess validity of the grading scale. The development of an objective and standardized
      grading scale will assist with the longitudinal evaluation of individual disease, assessment
      of impact of therapy on scarring, and inform treatment modifications. Further, objective
      grading of scarring would also provide the opportunity to search for potential correlation
      between QoL scores and severity of clinical states in scarring dermatoses.
