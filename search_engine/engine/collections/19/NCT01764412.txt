      hepatocytes, it interacts with the cellular iron exporter ferroportin, causing its
      internalization and preventing the release of iron from enterocytes and macrophages.

      In a normal organism decrease iron stock causes a decrease in hepcidin synthesis thus
      promoting intestinal absorption of iron.

      Since valid methods for the determination of hepcidin serum rate are available, this dosage
      is increasingly used to diagnosis iron metabolism pathologies, in particular iron overload.
      The interpretation of hepcidin dosage results requires to know physiological variations of
      this hormone.

      Several works have shown that hepcidin varies according to a circadian cycle, that its values
      differ by sex and, in women, by age. As far as the investigators know, no study has focused
      on possible variations in serum hepcidin rates values during menstrual cycle in women. Yet
      this question seems relevant since it has been shown that during the menstrual cycle blood
      loss can cause significant iron and hemoglobin variations, which can significantly modulate
      the synthesis of hepcidin.

      This study investigate whether there are significant variations in the values of serum
      hepcidin rates during the menstrual cycle in order to make recommendations on the practical
      dosage determination of hepcidin in premenopausal women.
