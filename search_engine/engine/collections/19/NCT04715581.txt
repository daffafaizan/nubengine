      results in decreased homeostatic capacity and increased vulnerability to any stress from
      minor to major. Approximately 10% to 20% of adults aged 65 years and older present with
      frailty, and the incidence doubles among those of 85 years and older. Among elderly cancer
      patients especially those with digestive cancer, the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty
      can be as high as 50%. Malnutrition often coexists with frailty, and indeed contribute to the
      development of frailty. As a matter of fact, the proportion of malnutrition also increases
      with age even in high-income countries.

      Frailty is strongly associated with worsening outcomes in surgical patients, including higher
      delirium, high non-delirium complications, high perioperative mortality, as well as decreased
      activity of daily life, cognitive dysfunction and work disability in long-term survivors.
      Furthermore, malnutrition as a prominent factor in the development of frailty also has
      adverse impacts on the duration of hospitalization, complications, and survival after
      surgery. Therefore, it is urgently needed to understand how to enhance the recovery of these
      patients following surgery.

      Exercises and rehabilitation, in combination with nutritional supplement, may reverse or
      mitigate frailty, promote postoperative recovery, and improve clinical outcomes. However, the
      reported effectiveness varies with interventions and are not sufficiently robust to guide
      good clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of multimodal
      prehabilitation on early and long-term outcomes in elderly patients with frailty.
