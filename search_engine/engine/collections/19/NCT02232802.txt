    
      This is an open-label, randomised, single-dose, 2-way crossover study to determine the
      comparative bioavailability of enoxaparin sodium from the Chemi Enoxaparin s.c. (80 mg/0.8mL)
      with that from the reference IMP, ClexaneÂ® s.c. (80 mg/0.8mL), following single dose
      administration in healthy male and female subjects.

      Each subject received each treatment over two separate treatment periods under fasting
      conditions. Each dosing day for male subjects will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 7 days. The study comprised a pre-study screen (within 14 days of the first dose),
      followed by 2 Treatment Periods (1 and 2). During each treatment period, subjects will reside
      at Simbec from the evening before dosing (Day 1), until at least 36 h post dose (evening of
      Day 2). On admission (Day -1), subjects will provide a urine sample for a drugs of abuse
      screen; this sample will also be tested to confirm a negative pregnancy result in female
      volunteers.

      A single dose of the randomised treatment will be given on the morning of Day 1 following an
      overnight fast and blood PK/PD samples collected from pre-dose up to 36 h post dose (14
      samples). Safety will also be evaluated at specified times throughout the study.

      The post study visit will be conducted on Day 2 (36 h post-dose) of Treatment Period 2.
