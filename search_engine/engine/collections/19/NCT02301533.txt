      has only recently become an important focus of national HIV/AIDS programs in sub-Saharan
      Africa. While it is clear that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce AIDS-related morbidity
      and mortality and prevent sexual transmission from HIV-infected MSM, this group faces
      significant stigma that can impede engagement in care. Based on qualitative research
      conducted in 2013-2014 in coastal Kenya, we have developed an intervention called "Shikamana"
      (a Kiswahili word meaning "to form a bond or stick together") to improve HIV treatment
      engagement, ART adherence, and clinical outcomes in this group. We now propose a 2-year study
      to pilot test and conduct an initial evaluation of this intervention. Our specific aims are
      to: 1) pilot test our evidence-based intervention for MSM and ensure that the intervention is
      feasible and acceptable to patient, peer, and provider participants; and 2) implement a small
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the resulting multi-component intervention versus
      standard care with 60 MSM patient participants. Ten patient participants will be followed in
      the pilot test for 3 months each, with monthly measurement of ART adherence, baseline and
      month 3 measurement of adherence correlates, and feedback from participants and staff on the
      intervention procedures. After fine-tuning of the intervention based on the pilot test, we
      will follow 60 MSM patient participants for 6 months each, with monthly measurement of ART
      adherence, baseline and quarterly measurement of adherence correlates, viral load testing at
      month 3 and month 6 as a biomarker of treatment success, and feedback from participants and
      staff on the intervention procedures. Findings from this formative 2-year study will provide
      qualitative data on the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, safety, and quantitative
      data on preliminary effect sizes to test this intervention and its components in a fully
      powered RCT including a larger, more diverse sample of MSM from multiple sites in sub-Saharan
      Africa.
