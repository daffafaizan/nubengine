      health care and health care workers. The use of robot assisted therapy (RAT) might partly
      solve this problem. Rehabilitation progress highly depends on training intensity and training
      duration, favouring the use of RAT.

      In this pilot study, the usability of a new upper arm RAT device for upper arm rehabilitation
      in stroke patients is investigated. Myo-electrical signals will serve as input for the
      device, assisting the user in flexion and extension of the elbow, which is combined with a
      stabilizing shoulder brace and a bionic glove.
