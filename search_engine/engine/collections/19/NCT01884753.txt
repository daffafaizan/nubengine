      bladder syndrome and voiding dysfunction. There are a lot of bladder studies, such as
      researches of bladder wall thickness and bladder volume. However, there were few studies of
      urethra for female patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), especially for storage
      disorder. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to get the urethra and pelvic sonographic
      imaging by 4D ultrasound examinations, and to correlate the sonographic findings with
      urodynamic variables, pad weights and LUTS. The investigators hope to identify important LUTS
      sonographic biomarkers that can be used by primary physicians as a tool for assess female
      LUTS, and thus decreasing the need of further invasive urodynamic studies.

      Besides, the associations of the blood flow of vagina/urethra and sexual dysfunction
      (assessed by female sexual function index) can be explored.

      In addition, women who receive antimuscarinics treatment will receive follow-up 4D imaging
      and request to complete questionnaire 12 weeks later.
