    
      Primary Aim:

      To compare the change from baseline in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes
      (UUIE) over 6 the six month follow-up period in women randomized to sacral neuromodulation
      (InterStim®) therapy, versus those randomized to intra-detrusor injection with 200 units of
      botulinum toxin A (Botox A®).

      Secondary Aims:

        -  Long Term Efficacy: To compare the long-term (12 and 24 month) efficacy outcomes in
           women randomized to sacral neuromodulation(InterStim®) therapy, versus those randomized
           to intra-detrusor injection with 200 units of botulinum toxin A (Botox A®). Secondary
           efficacy outcomes, collected at 12 and 24 months as well as 6 months,include adequate
           control of their urge urinary incontinence, change in bothersome symptoms of urinary
           urge incontinence (UUI), severity of urge incontinence, urinary frequency, nocturia,
           subject satisfaction with therapy, quality of life measures and bowel and sexual
           function.

        -  Cost Effectiveness: To compare utilization of medical resources for cost effectiveness
           analysis and cost-utility between treatment groups.

        -  Treatment Safety and Burden: To assess safety profile and treatment burden of both
           interventions by comparing adverse event incidence between treatment arms, and also by
           obtaining estimates of incidence of treatment-specific safety and burden outcomes.
           Safety and burden outcomes for Botox A® injections include receipt of additional
           injections and intermittent catheterization due to voiding dysfunction/partial urinary
           retention. Safety and burden outcomes for InterStim® device include infection, pain,
           lead migration, reprogramming (and reasons for) and surgical revision (and reasons for).
