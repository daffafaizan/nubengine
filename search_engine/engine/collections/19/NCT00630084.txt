      with malignancy other than hepatocellular carcinoma and other sex- and age-matched 80 chronic
      hepatitis C patients without malignancy will be conducted. The 40 chronic hepatitis C
      patients concomitant with malignancy other than hepatocellular carcinoma will receive
      pegylated interferon-alpha 2a plus ribavirin combination therapy at remission phase after
      oncological treatments and/or interventions. The other 80 chronic hepatitis C patients
      without malignancy receiving the same antiviral therapy will serve as controls. The primary
      outcome measurement is sustained virological response and safety, whilst the secondary
      measurement is rapid virological and early virological response.
