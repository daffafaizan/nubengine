      Circadin™ 2 mg in subjects with non-24 hour sleep-wake disorder. Subjects were initially
      treated with placebo for 2 weeks and then were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      Circadin™ 2 mg or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout period. The primary
      objective was to assess the effect of Circadin 2 mg given once daily for 6 weeks on total
      night sleep duration. Secondary objectives were other sleep variables recorded by the diary
      like sleep latency, daytime naps and sleep offset time. Other endpoints were CGIC score for
      Severity of Illness and Global Improvement and WHO (Five) Well-Being Index score.
