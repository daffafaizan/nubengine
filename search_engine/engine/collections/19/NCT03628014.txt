      after a hip surgery. More than 95% of hip fractures are caused by falling and the risk of a
      new fall after a hip surgery may be up to 50%. Both postoperative delirium and fall are
      associated with increased length of stay and high perioperative mortality.

      The Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) is a comprehensive inpatient-care program that ensures
      optimal care for older adults in the hospital. The primary goals of the HELP program are:

      Maintaining cognitive and physical functioning of high risk older adults throughout
      hospitalization, maximizing independence at discharge, assisting with the transition from
      hospital to home, and preventing unplanned hospital readmissions. These goals have been
      accomplished using a multicomponent intervention strategy. In addition to targeted
      interdisciplinary geriatric assessment, the program uses an innovative volunteer model to
      provide personal, supportive attention to vulnerable older inpatients.
