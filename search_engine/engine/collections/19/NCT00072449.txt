      Primary

        -  Determine the radiographic response proportion in patients with refractory or recurrent
           primary CNS lymphoma treated with rituximab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive
      additional courses of rituximab off study at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9
      months.
