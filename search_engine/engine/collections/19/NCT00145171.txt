      effects of apomorphine during controlled in-patient dose introduction in apomorphine-na√Øve
      late stage Parkinson's disease patients. Although safety observations represented the primary
      objective of the study, a control group was considered essential to properly interpret
      adverse events that occurred during dose titration. Additional data comparing the efficacy
      and safety of subcutaneous apomorphine, placebo and standard antiparkinson (anti-PD) therapy
      was derived from this experience.

      This was a two-phase study that involved a controlled in-office dose titration phase followed
      by a 6-month outpatient open-label treatment phase. During the in-patient dose titration
      phase, subjects were evaluated on separate days for the response to single doses of
      medication administered during an observed "Off" event (defined as first "Off" event that
      occurs at least one hour after administration of the normal morning dose of oral
      antiparkinson medication). Evaluation of the acute response to oral anti-PD medication
      (Baseline) and to apomorphine dose escalation between 2 and 10 mg (Titration Visits) was
      conducted under unblinded conditions. At the 0.4-mL titration level, placebo was randomly
      introduced under double-blind crossover conditions.
