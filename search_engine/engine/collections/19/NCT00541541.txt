    
      Patients who need temporary pacing following open heart surgery and who are willing to
      participate receive a phrenic nerve electrode during the operation. Heart function is
      postoperatively assessed by acoustic cardiography (Audicor, Inovise Medical Inc., Portland,
      USA) during different forms of pacing (right ventricle, left ventricle, biventricular; AAI,
      DDD) and with or without phrenic nerve stimulation. Acoustic cardiography simultaneously
      integrates heart sounds and single-channel electrocardiography input to generate multiple
      parameters that correlate to established hemodynamic measures. Effects of phrenic nerve
      stimulation on heart function will be analyzed.
