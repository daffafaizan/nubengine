    
      Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) is reported to properly reflect nociception-antinociception
      balance in patients undergoing surgical procedures, where a value of 100 corresponds to a
      high stress level and a value of 0 to a low stress level; values near 50 or increase in value
      > delta 10 correspond to the stress level which is known to reflect requirement for rescue
      analgesia.

      The applicability of SPI- guided deep sedation regimen in colonoscopic procedures has not
      been previously studied. Additionally, depth of sedation markedly influences the
      nociception-antinociception balance so its monitoring also proved useful in procedures
      performed under deep sedation.

      Therefore, we aim to investigate if both SPI-guided fentanyl administration alongside with
      State Entropy guided propofol aministration (Adequacy of Anaesthesia monitoring) versus State
      Entropy guided propofol aministration alongside with fentanyl titration based on haemodynamic
      parametres versus fentanyl titration based on haemodynamic parametres only influence both
      patients' or operator's satisfaction from anaesthetic management.
