      bone marrow transplant at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The goal of this study is to
      look at the usefulness of bright light therapy in the prevention of delirium in a population
      at high risk for developing this condition.

      Delirium can develop in up to half of the people that undergo bone marrow transplant.
      Symptoms include changes in level of alertness, confusion, and temporary problems with memory
      and attention. In severe cases, it can be accompanied by agitation, paranoia(overly
      suspicious), and hallucinations(seeing or hearing things that are not really there).

      Bright light uses no medication and is often used to treat seasonal affective depression and
      multiple sleep disorders. The light boxes are portable and are placed in front of individuals
      for about 30 minutes every day.
