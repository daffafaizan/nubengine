      (intervention group, IG) compared to an equally extensive information-only control group
      (CG). The interventions contain 6 weekly group sessions and 2 parent meetings according to
      the cognitive-behavioral, manualized program "Stop the pain with Happy Pingu". Follow up per
      patient: 3- and 12 months. Children aged 7-12 years suffering functional abdominal pain
      (according to Rome III criteria H2a, H2b, H2d, H2d1) are eligible. Our primary hypothesis is
      that for patients in the IG the frequency and intensity of pain will be reduced more
      successfully and more sustainable than for children in the CG. Secondary hypotheses state
      that the IG will experience a higher increase in quality of life and psychosocial well-being
      compared to the active CG.
