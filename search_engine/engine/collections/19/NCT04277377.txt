      magnetic nanoparticles to remove donor-specific antibodies (DSA) from the patients' blood ex
      vivo, while trying to keep the blood unaffected after exposure to the particles.

      Nanoparticles will be engineered and tested ex vivo. While nanoparticles were successfully
      coated with macromolecules such as antibodies in the past, this is a new approach, which will
      be performed by the research group.

      The goal of this project is to capture DSA in patient blood ex vivo and to remove them by
      magnetic separation. Efficacy and safety of this procedure will be assessed, especially the
      interaction of these novel particles with other blood components such as coagulation factors
      or effector cells, which could produce inflammatory mediators. According analyses are
      initiated and carried out.
