    
      The UTMDACC family history database will be queried for the presence of cases meeting the
      above criteria (attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), classical AFP [i.e.
      identifiable APC mutation], and/or a compatible family history or personal adenoma burden of
      > 50 adenomas).

      The data related to the patients with attenuated FAP and classical AFP who underwent
      endoscopic surveillance or surgery will be collected through chart review and all data is
      retrospective as of February 15, 2016.

      The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) medical record number for these
      cases will be used to identify the patient in ClinicStation: 1) records of endoscopy
      procedures, 2) operative reports, and 3) associated clinic notes will be reviewed for: a)
      whether the above evaluation criteria have been met, b) age, c) gender, d) age at initial
      colonoscopy, e) total number of colonoscopies, f) number of adenomas identified, g) cancer
      diagnoses, h) chemopreventive medications, i) type of surgery, j) number of hospitalizations,
      k) length of hospital stay, l) identification of an underlying APC mutation, and ll) family
      history information. The UT MDACC family history database will also be reviewed for updated
      family history information including ampullary adenomas and outcomes of genetic testing for
      identified cases.
