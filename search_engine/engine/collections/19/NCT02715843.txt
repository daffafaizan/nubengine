      followed by at least 9 days of observation but longer intervals between dosing cycles will be
      allowed at the investigator's discretion (e.g., 6 doses of MT-3724 over 12 days followed by
      16 days observation). Subjects in this extension study may continue to receive up to 6
      additional cycles in the absence of clear disease progression or toxicity. If a subject
      achieves complete remission, two additional cycles will be attempted, after which dosing may
      be suspended prior to completion of the maximum 6 cycles.
