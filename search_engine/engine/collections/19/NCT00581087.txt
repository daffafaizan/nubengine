    
      • Principal Objective : Efficacy of DHEA on exercise capacity (six-minute walk test)

        -  Secondary Objective :

             -  Efficacy of DHEA on pulmonary arterial pressures (mean, systolic and diastolic), on
                systemic arterial pressures, pulmonary vascular resistances

             -  Safety of DHEA treatment

             -  Observance of treatment by DHEA

        -  Study design :

      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study. Patients will be randomized
      into two parallel groups to receive either 200 mg oral DHEA or placebo over a one-year
      treatment. This is a multicentric study in the departments of respiratory medicine of
      Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Limoges and Toulouse (France).

      • Inclusion criteria :

        -  Age ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 75 years old (*)

        -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with VEMS/CV < 70% ( **)

        -  Respiratory pulmonary hypertension with mean pulmonary arterial pressure ≥ 25 mmHg (**)
           related to normal pulmonary capillary pressure assessed by catheterization of the right
           side of the heart (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤12mmHg)

        -  PO2 ≤ 60 mmHg assessed by arterial gazometry at ease (**) or PO2 > 60 mmHg, but related
           with high hypoxemia after exercise (six-minute walk test )

        -  Oxygenotherapy more than 6 months before pre-screening

        -  Written informed consent

      (*) Inclusion of young adults concerns COPD related to asthma or cystic fibrosis (**)
      Criteria assessed from last health check or the last exams for COPD diagnosis

        -  Exclusion criteria :

             -  Clinical instability and/or respiratory exacerbation within the previous three
                months

             -  Clinical instability and/or respiratory exacerbation dangerous for catheterization

             -  Pregnancy (ßHCG > 20 UI /l) or breastfeeding on going

             -  General corticotherapy > 0,5 mg/kg/j prédnisolone equivalent

             -  Hepatic insufficiency (TP < 50%) or renal insufficiency (creatininemia > 130
                µmol/l) or diabetes mellitus type I or II (treated by oral antidiabetic oral or
                insulin)

             -  Left-heart failure (coronary heart disease and/or left valvulopathy)

             -  High level of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) (> 2,5ng/ml)

             -  Previous cancer or treatment on going

        -  Study plan:

      After the screening evaluation and written consent document, patients will be randomized into
      two groups placebo or DHEA, over a one year treatment.

      • Number of subjects : 60 patients based on the increase of 30 % of the primary end-point,
      (six-minute walk test), i.e., 30 patients will be included in each group.
