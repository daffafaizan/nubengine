      recommendations, in terms of patient outcomes and healthcare quality. Desing:
      Quasi-experimental, multicentre, before-and-after. Methods Primary-care and hospital-care
      units and associated socio-healthcare structures, and the patients attended at both.
      Intervention: Implementation of evidence-based recommendations by application of the Getting
      Research into Practice model (process of improvement by reference to a prior baseline
      clinical audit). Variables: Process and outcome criteria with respect to pain, urinary
      incontinence and fall prevention. Data will be collected at baseline and, during the first
      year of follow up, at months (3, 6, 9,12), with data on patients and indicators being drawn
      from clinical histories and records. Descriptive analysis, and comparison of the
      effectiveness of the intervention by means of inferential analysis and analysis of trends
      across follow-up. 95% confidence level. This project is funded by Spanish Strategic Health
      Action November 2014. Project duration 2015-2017.
