      Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy), 9 anorexic cancer patients, 4
      non-anorexic cancer patients and 2 healthy individuals will be studied. The sample size is
      based on studies of neuroimaging already published and available on international journals.

      Patients with confirmed cancer diagnosis will be enrolled before the initiation of any
      anti-cancer treatments. The presence/absence of anorexia will be investigated using a
      specific questionnaire (Cangiano et al., 1990) and a visual analogue scale (VAS). After an
      overnight fasting, blood samples will be collected from cancer patients and control subjects
      and interleukin(IL)-1, IL-6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) levels will be measured by a
      commercially available ELISA kit.

      On the same day, hypothalamic activation pattern(s) will be evaluated in patients and in
      control subjects by fMRI. After basal evaluation, all the groups will receive a standard oral
      meal, i.e., a 200 mL hypercaloric oral nutritional supplement providing 300 Kcal, and then a
      second fMRI scan will be performed. Using a computerized software, the average value of the
      grey for the hypothalamus will be calculated, and normalized for the one obtained in the
      basal condition, to obtain the percentage (%) of activation (or inhibition) of the
      hypothalamus.

      Data obtained will be statistically analyzed using the t-Student and Bonferroni tests.
