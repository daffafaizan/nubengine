      3-dimensional cross-sectional imaging while the patient is positioned on a linear accelerator
      couch. Cone beam CT also provides 3D soft tissue volumetric data and therefore important
      information on daily interfraction movement and deformation of normal critical structures
      within the pelvis. Visualization of the tumor using this technology may also be enhanced by
      the additional placement of fiducial markers around the tumor bed to ensure even more
      accurate targeting. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of daily cone beam CT
      for image guidance in patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) for bladder cancer as well
      document changes in size and location of the bladder and rectum during an entire course of
      RT. This will enable us to explore techniques for radiation therapy based on normal tissue
      avoidance models to reduce treatment toxicity and potentially dose escalation in the future.
