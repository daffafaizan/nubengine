    
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess whether an mHealth platform increases
      maternal health knowledge in the areas of birth preparedness, pregnancy, and birth
      complications as measured by the pre- and post-surveys in comparison to routine antenatal
      care.

      The secondary objectives of this trial are;

        1. To provide knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment, in a
           time of social distancing and learning.

        2. To improve access and linkages to maternal health services and information as well as
           provide appropriate referrals for pregnant females.

        3. Inform the adoption of mHealth into future health delivery plans.
