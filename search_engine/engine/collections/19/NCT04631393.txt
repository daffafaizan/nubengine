      alfentanil during SVP implantation.

      Participants included in the study are able to administer a combination of propofol and
      alfentanil using a patient-controlled sedation pump. This allows the patient to self-control
      their sedation/analgesia during SVP implantation. The pump enables the patient via a
      hand-held button to trigger the release of a single bolus. A bolus of 0.5ml programmed into
      the pump contains a combination of 4.5mg propofol and 25Âµg alfentanil and is administered
      under a 7 second period resulting in a maximal amount of 8 bolus doses per minute.

      Each SVP implantation procedure is separated into four time points at which sedation scores
      are recorded. Patients are monitored by anaesthesia staff and SVP implantation is performed
      by an anaesthesiologist according to hospital protocol.

      Participants are asked to fill in a written questionnaire to indicate pain score and
      satisfaction with the procedure when ready for discharge.

      Adverse events, time consumption and operators satisfaction with implantation conditions are
      recorded periprocedural.

      The result of this trial will provide guidance for a larger randomized trial (PACSPI-2)
      comparing several clinically relevant aspects of the use of PCS and local anesthesia (LA)
      versus LA alone during SVP implantation.
