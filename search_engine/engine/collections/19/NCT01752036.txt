      post-operative stereotactic radiosurgery boost in patients with metastatic solid malignancies
      with spine metastases status post resection. Patients will be treated with 600 cGy x 5
      fractions to the tumor bed and then followed both clinically and radiographically to
      determine if local recurrence following this treatment is better than might be expected for
      conventional radiation therapy.
