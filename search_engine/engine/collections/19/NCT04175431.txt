    
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I (observation with fluciclovine PET/CT): Patients who do not have any abnormalities
      outside the prostatic fossa by fluciclovine PET/CT imaging undergo prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) rechecks every 3 months once PSA is > 2 ng/ml. If still no abnormalities are found,
      patients continue to undergo PSA rechecks every 3 months once PSA is > 5 ng/ml. Patients are
      off study once PSA reaches 10 ng/ml.

      GROUP II (ADT/abiraterone/prednisone +/- surgery +/- RT): Patients who have =< 3 regions of
      metastatic disease outside the prostatic fossa may undergo lymphadenectomy and/or radiation
      therapy, depending on the location of metastases. Patients with surgically treatable disease
      receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) comprising any luteinizing hormone-releasing
      hormone (LHRH) agent, abiraterone acetate 1000 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD), and prednisone
      PO QD 6 weeks after surgery. Patients with radiation treatable disease receive 2 cycles of
      ADT, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone followed by radiation therapy. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP III (ADT/abiraterone/prednisone): Patients who have > 3 regions of metastatic disease
      receive ADT, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone as in Group II.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.
