      MRFIT was initiated in 1972 as a randomized, multicenter primary prevention trial designed to
      determine whether a special intervention consisting of smoking cessation, cholesterol
      reduction and control of high blood pressure, would result in a significant reduction in
      coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality, compared to usual care. Follow-up and analysis has
      continued on the 361,662 men screened and the 12,866 men randomized.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The National Death Index (NDI) will be used for continued follow-up of the MRFIT cohorts. An
      additional assay to establish IGF-1 and IGF binding protein will be added to the data set as
      a potential prognostic factor. The effort will focus on three primary aims related to
      long-term mortality. Aim 1 will relate nutritional-dietary data to twenty-five year mortality
      from coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, cardiovascular disease (CVD), colon cancer,
      prostate cancer, and all causes for the 12,866 men randomized. Aim 2 will relate age,
      ethnicity, socioeconomic position, geographic location, major risk factors, low risk status,
      prior diabetes, and prior myocardial infarction to twenty-five year mortality for the 361,662
      men screened. Aim 3 will relate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein,
      and fasting and one-hour glucose measurements from frozen baseline sera to mortality for the
      12,866 men randomized.
