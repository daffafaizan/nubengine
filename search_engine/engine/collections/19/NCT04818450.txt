      cause delirium and lead to prolonged ICU length of stay and mechanical ventilator days.
      However, pharmacologic interventions to improve sleep quality and prevent sleep deprivation
      are poorly tested for efficacy and safety in ICU patients. There were reports of gabapentin
      increasing slow-wave sleep in healthy populations and insomnia patients with insignificant
      adverse events. Therefore, gabapentin might increase slow-wave sleep resulting in improving
      clinical outcomes in adult critically ill patients. The objectives of the study were to
      evaluate the efficacy, especially on slow-wave sleep, and safety of gabapentin in adult
      critically ill patients admitted to ICUs at Ramathibodi Hospital, a university hospital,
      Thailand.
