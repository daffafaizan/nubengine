      to severe abdominal pain in the emergency department who do not meet any exclusion criteria
      and who willingly agree to participate by signing the written consent form. Investigators
      will assess the patient's opioid tolerance by asking if they have use an opioid medication in
      the last week, prescription opioid use at home, and/or recreational opioid use. Patients in
      both groups will fill out the pre-treatment questionnaire, which will include demographic
      questions (age, sex, race, height, weight, etc.), a 10cm (100mm) VAS for pain, a 10cm (100mm)
      VAS to measure patient satisfaction, and a Likert Scale to measure patient satisfaction.
      Post-treatment survey will be given at 30 minutes after administration of medication. The
      physician will record whether the patient required additional pain medication after the 30
      minutes, final emergency department diagnosis, and final emergency department disposition.
