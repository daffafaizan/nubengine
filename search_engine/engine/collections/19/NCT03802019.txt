      nicotine content (LNC) cigarette packaging on smoking behaviors, harm exposure, risk
      perceptions, and subjective ratings of cigarettes. The investigators will aim to recruit and
      randomize 500 daily smokers (~250 male, ~250 female) in a 35-day protocol. After completing a
      5-day baseline period of smoking their own brand, participants will be randomized to a 30-day
      experimental period when they will receive either their own preferred brand (control), or LNC
      cigarettes in one of four types of packaging: standard investigational (gray packaging); red,
      or blue (tobacco industry strategy); or plain packaging (tobacco control strategy).
      Participants will be asked to attend in-person sessions at the Center for Interdisciplinary
      Research on Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA) every 4-6 days, for a total of 8 in-person sessions
      across 35 days.
