      from elsewhere in the body to go around blockages or narrowings in the heart arteries. Before
      the surgery, the surgeon needs to choose which vessel will be used for the bypass, including
      potentially the radial artery in the wrist. Before using this artery, it is important to
      ensure that there is enough blood flow to the hand to prevent complications. The best way to
      do this involves the use of ultrasound, but this takes a long time and its availability can
      be limited. Therefore, the assessment is usually done at the bedside by examining the hand,
      which relies on the doctor watching the flushing of the hand during compression and release
      of the artery. Currently, smartphones with cameras are able to assess blood flow by passing
      light through the skin and observing differences in brightness. This has been shown in a
      previous study to be a better way to assess the arteries in the hand than the traditional
      examination, as it is less subjective than simply watching the flushing of the hand. In this
      study, the investigators will assess the utility of a smartphone application in determining
      whether there is enough blood flow in the hand prior to using the radial artery for CABG
      surgery.
