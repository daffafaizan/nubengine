    
      This study is a 12-week double-blind, vehicle-controlled treatment study in which subjects
      will be randomized to receive tapinarof cream, 1% or vehicle cream once daily for 12 weeks.
      At the end of the 12-week study treatment, qualified subjects completing the study will have
      the option to enter a separate open-label, long-term safety and efficacy study for an
      additional 40 weeks of treatment with tapinarof cream, 1%. Subjects who do not enroll in the
      open-label long-term study will complete a follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after end of
      treatment in this study (at Week 16).
