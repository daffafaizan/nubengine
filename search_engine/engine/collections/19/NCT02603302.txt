      Rectal cancer is a highly prevalent disease all over the world. In Brazil, it is the second
      most common cancer among women (after breast tumors), with an estimated incidence of 17.2
      cases per 100,000 inhabitants and is the third most common cancer in men (after prostate and
      lung cancers), with an estimated incidence of 15.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.

      Goals:

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) of patients with
      locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT)
      employing anticancer drugs at standard dose and interval extended to surgery with or without
      adjuvant neoplastic therapy.

      Procedures:

      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with radiation dose escalation associated with radiosensitizing
      therapy and surgery with a total mesorectal excision (TME), 8 weeks after completing
      neoadjuvant treatment.
