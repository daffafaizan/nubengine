      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with progressive androgen-independent
           prostate cancer with bone metastases treated with tandutinib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline rate by 50% (PSA response), using
           the PSA Working Group Criteria, in patients treated with this regimen .

        -  Evaluate modulation of bone pain and bone markers in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the objective tumor response by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
           Tumors) criteria in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral tandutinib twice daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Bone pain is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of course 3, and at disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
