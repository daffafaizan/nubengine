      biochemical parameters and oxidative stress. By naturally containing carbohydrates grape
      juice can help acutely minimize fatigue during exercise as well as long-term oxidative stress
      parameters in athletes. This project aims to evaluate if after 14 days of grape juice
      ingestion there is improvement of the parameters of strength, fatigue and oxidative stress in
      judo fighters. The study will be a randomized, blind, crossover clinical trial of 20 Judo
      athletes. Judo wrestling simulations will be performed on 3 different days. Each exercise
      session will consist of four 7-minute bouts, with 14-minute rest between them. The athletes
      will perform a first fight simulation without ingestion of any beverage (control group 1),
      and then will be randomized to determine the order of participation in the groups:
      maltodextrin (group 2 placebo) and grape juice (intervention group 3). Analyzes of oxidative
      stress; Muscle strength and fatigue; Perceived effort rate; Lactate; Heart rate; Analysis of
      food consumption and body composition.Two-way ANOVA will be used to evaluate the relation of
      the intervention and physical exercise, besides parameters of strength and fatigue. The level
      of significance adopted will be 5% and for the analysis, the SPSS summer 23 statistical
      program will be used.
