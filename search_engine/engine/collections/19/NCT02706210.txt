      between the two groups.

      All the participants received a battery of neuropsychological tests to assess general mental
      status and other cognitive domains, including visual-spatial ability, executive function,
      language, memory, attention, and general intellectual ability. These tests included the CDR
      scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA),
      clock drawing test (CDT), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), activities of daily living
      scale(ADL) and Hamilton Depression Scale and HIS. All these evaluations were performed by two
      attending neurologists.

      All participants were scanned on a 3.0 T Siemens scanner within a single session.

      Each participant received a magnetization prepared rapidly acquired gradient echo (MPRAGE)
      T1-weighted scan (repetition time [TR], 1900 ms; echo time [TE], 2.2 ms; inversion time, 900
      ms; matrix, 256×256; number of excitations, 1; thickness, 1 mm; 176 slices) Resting state
      functional images were collected using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the
      following parameters: repetition time (TR)= 2000 ms; echo time (TE)=40 ms; flip angle=90°;
      number of slices=28; slice thickness=4 mm; gap=1 mm; voxel size=4×4×4 mm3; and matrix=64×64.
      Participants were asked to lie quietly in the scanner with their eyes closed during the data
      acquisition. This scan lasted for 478 s. For each subject, the first five volumes were
      discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects and the adaptation of the subjects to the
      circumstances, leaving 234 images for further analysis.

      The diffusion weighted imaging scans were acquired on a 3.0T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scanner.
      Three diffusion echo-planar imaging sequence with one zero-weighted image (b =0 s/mm2) and
      thirty diffusion sensitizing orientations (b =1000 s/mm2) was used with the following
      specifications: slice thickness=2 mm; 90 slices; repetition time = 11000 ms; echo time = 98
      ms; voxel size = 2 mm isotropic; flip angle=90°; acquisition matrix = 128 mm×116 mm .
