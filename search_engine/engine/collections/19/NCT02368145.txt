      recovery, increase stroke recurrence, and influence mortality from stroke. Based on
      literature reviewed below, the investigators propose the novel over-arching hypothesis: that
      post-stroke depression (PSD) occurs in patients who show elevated production of
      proinflammatory immune cytokines during and/or after stroke, and at the same time present
      with reduced sensitivity to the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids, which otherwise
      would be expected to have down-regulated cytokine production.
