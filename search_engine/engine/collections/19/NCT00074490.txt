    
      Background

      In protocol 99-C-0143, we evaluated a new approach to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) that involved intensive host T cell ablation and graft augmentation with in
      vitro generated donor T helper 2 (Th2) cells. Rapid full donor engraftment occurred with this
      regimen; however, grade II to IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was not significantly
      reduced in Th2 cell recipients. In an attempt to improve clinical results using Th2 cell
      graft engineering, this second-generation Th2 cell clinical trial was developed that
      incorporates the following interventions: (1) In an attempt to reduce transplant-related
      toxicity, this protocol now uses a very low-intensity host preparative chemotherapy; (2) In
      an attempt to reduce GVHD, this study will utilize Th2 cells expanded in the presence of the
      immune modulation agent, rapamycin (sirolimus), as murine Th2 cells grown in rapamycin reduce
      GVHD more effectively than control Th2 cells; (3) To further reduce GVHD, subjects will
      receive a short-course of sirolimus therapy in addition to standard cyclosporine GVHD
      prophylaxis; and (4) Using this novel low-intensity transplant platform, compare in a
      preliminary manner the post-transplant outcome of patients receiving pre-emptive donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) using either Th2 cells or unmanipulated donor T cells.

      Objectives

      In the setting of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT using GVHD
      prophylaxis of cyclosporine and short-course sirolimus, compare in a preliminary manner the
      safety, feasibility, alloengraftment, clinical anti-tumor effects, and GVHD rate of
      low-intensity Preparative Chemotherapy with pre-emptive DLI using either Th2 cells or
      unmanipulated T cells at day 14 post-HSCT.

      Eligibility

      Subjects that are 16 to 75 years of age that have a suitable 6/6 HLA-matched sibling donor
      are potentially eligible. Subjects with a diagnosis of acute or chronic leukemia,
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, or myelodysplastic syndrome are
      potentially eligible. Adequate kidney, cardiac, and pulmonary function are required.

      Design

        -  Patients age 18 or older with lymphoma (all types) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia will
           be randomized just prior to the transplant regimen to receive DLI with either donor Th2
           cells (cohort 1) or unmanipulated T cells (cohort 2); n=10 patients will be accrued to
           each arm provided that stopping rules pertaining to excessive GVHD or graft rejection
           are not met. For these randomized patients, the preparative regimen will consist of
           low-intensity fludarabine (120 mg/m(2)) plus cyclophosphamide (1200 mg/m(2)) and GVHD
           prophylaxis will consist of short-course, high-dose sirolimus followed by maintenance
           cyclosporine. Cohorts 1 and 2 will be compared in a preliminary manner with respect to
           their post-transplant outcome, in particular: (a) conversion of mixed chimerism to
           predominant donor chimerism; (b) rate and severity of classical acute and late acute
           GVHD at the day 100 and day 180 post-transplant time points; and (c) time to induction
           of leukemia/lymphoma remission (if entering transplant with disease) or time to relapse
           (if entering transplant in remission).

        -  Patients with non-lymphoma diagnoses, patients with lymphoma that are under the age of
           18 and lymphoma patients that are projected to be unable to complete the
           protocol-defined therapy through day 180 post-transplant will not be randomized but will
           be treated on cohort 3 (n=40), which will evaluate transplantation without the Flu/Cy
           preparative regimen and with pre-emptive Th2 cell DLI. The primary objective of cohort 3
           is to evaluate whether transplantation without a preparative regimen will reduce the
           rate of acute GVHD associated with Th2 cell DLI from 41% (the rate observed with the
           fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (Flu/Cy) preparative regimen) to a rate of 15% (6 cases out
           of 40).
