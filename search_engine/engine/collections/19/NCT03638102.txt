      non-diabetic women with a prior history of GDM and habitual short sleep duration on the
      outcomes of glucose metabolism. The participants will be randomized to a 6-week sleep
      extension intervention group, using technology-assisted sleep intervention, or a healthy
      living information control group. Glucose metabolism parameters will be assessed by an oral
      glucose tolerant test.
