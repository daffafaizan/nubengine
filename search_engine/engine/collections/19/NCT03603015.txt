      measurement and reduce variability with pves.isv, therefore giving a more reproducible test.
      By improving the penile cuff test, the investigators can then go on to assess how our
      non-invasive measurements correlate with urodynamically derived indices of contractility, and
      use data from this pilot to help construct methodology of future cuff research. The current
      hypotheses are that; 1) accuracy of the cuff interruption pressure (pcuff.int) can be
      improved by modification of penile cuff test factors, 2) the number of valid inflations
      obtained per patient will increase with the modifications, and 3) that this non-invasive
      measure of contractility will correlate with pre-existing invasive indices.

      The research protocol also gives the opportunity to explore correlation between commonly used
      symptom scores, and accuracy in the assessment of ultrasound residual urine volume
      measurement.

      The primary objectives are therefore:

        -  To modify procedural steps of the penile cuff test that may reduce the previously
           observed variability and perform a pilot study to assess a reduction in variance

        -  To identify behaviour of the urethra during penile cuff inflation, by performing x-ray
           screening during the penile cuff test, and assess whether this is another source of
           inaccuracy

        -  To test the basic assumption of the penile cuff test that the bladder neck remains open
           during flow interruption

      Secondary objectives of the study include the following:

        -  To compare non-invasive measurements from the penile cuff test against invasive indices
           of contractility

        -  To compare 2 different symptom scores for men with voiding lower urinary tract symptoms
           (LUTS)

        -  To assess accuracy and inter-observer variability of ultrasound residual measurement
           against a known volume.
