    
      Participants were interviewed at baseline (T0) 8 months before the COVID-19 pandemic. An
      online survey will be applied in two follow-up moments during the pandemic:

        1. At 9 months (also 1 month after lockdown measures imposed) (T1)

        2. At 18 months (also 10 months after lockdown measures imposed) (T2)
