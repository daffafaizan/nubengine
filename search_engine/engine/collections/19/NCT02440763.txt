      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. To this end, a newly developed and validated ataxia scale (Scale
      for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, SARA) will be used. EUROSCA-NHS has a number of
      secondary aims including determination of the order and occurrence of non-ataxia symptoms,
      assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL), and identification
      of predictors of disease progression and survival. Substudies will deal with the development
      of brain atrophy, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), progression of peripheral
      neuropathy, as assessed by nerve conduction studies, and specific clinical aspects of SCA.
