      specimens, malignancy can be detected rarely. Minimally invasive techniques have been widely
      used routinely and reliably in the treatment of pilonidal sinus. In some of these methods,
      the cavity of sinus remains in the patient; this condition caused us to question the
      necessity of pathological examination. The investigators aimed to discuss the pathological
      findings of patients who were operated for pilonidal sinus in our clinic in light of the
      literature. The fact that the rate of malignancy in the literature does not show parallelism
      with minimally invasive procedures that pathology samples are not taken and whose
      applications are increasing supports this prediction. Except for prolonged duration of
      disease, elderly age, macroscopic suspicion, and recurrence; the investigators think that
      routine pathological examination of the pilonidal sinus is unnecessary.
