      Consenting, PCR-positive patients not in need of hospitalization per investigator assessment
      and who meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment and
      provided with medication and home monitoring devices, and instructed in drug administration
      and use of the devices. They will take medication daily for two weeks, complete a
      smartphone-based questionnaire, provide additional monitoring information via devices
      provided periodically over an 8-week period. Patients will be seen at home by a study nurse
      after 2, 4 and 8 weeks on study; additional televisits will also be conducted. At the home
      visits nasal swab specimens for COVID-19 PCR and blood specimens for safety labs and disease
      markers will be collected.

      In part A of the study, patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of two doses of upamostat or
      placebo. Based on safety results of part A, a dose for part B will be selected, and patients
      will be randomized 3:2 to active vs placebo.
