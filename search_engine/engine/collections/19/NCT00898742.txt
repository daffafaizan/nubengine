        -  To identify 100 patients from the Head and Neck Tumor Tissue Repository and Clinical
           Database treated with cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab-containing combination therapy
           as a standard of care for recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell
           carcinoma at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

        -  To assay the diversity of gene and protein expression patterns seen in these patients.

        -  To identify predictive patterns associated with treatment response and survival of these
           patients by correlating the laboratory data with clinical data.

      OUTLINE: Tumor tissue specimens and clinical data are obtained from the Head and Neck Tumor
      Tissue Repository and Clinical Database protocol VU-VICC-HN-0356. Specimens are analyzed for
      patterns of gene and protein expression predictive of cetuximab treatment response and
      survival by DNA microarray, tissue microarray, reverse transcriptase-PCR, and mass
      spectroscopy.
