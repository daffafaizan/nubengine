    
      Frailty, "a syndrome of decreased resiliency and reserves", is defined by five
      characteristics: 1)"shrinking" (definition: unintentional weight loss of > 10 lbs in prior
      year, or > 5% loss of body weight in prior year at follow-up), 2) weakness (definition: grip
      strength in lowest 20% at baseline, adjusted for gender and BMI), 3) poor endurance/energy
      (definition: self-report of exhaustion on 2 items on the CES-D), 4) slowness (definition:
      slowest 20% on timed 4 meter or 15 foot walk, adjusted for gender and standing height), and
      5) low physical activity (definition: weighted score of kilocalories expended per week as
      calculated from the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity questionnaire). Frailty is associated
      with poor prognosis including hospitalization, falls, worsening disability and mobility, and
      death.

      Data from the Cardiovascular Health Study document the rate of comorbid depressive symptoms
      in frail older adults (16.2% of older adults with at least 1 frailty characteristic had a
      CES-D > 10, including 31% of older adults with 3 or more frailty characteristics, compared to
      2.6% of nonfrail older adults) despite study exclusion of individuals who were taking an
      antidepressant (this is in part why we chose to include patients with a CES-D of > 10, rather
      than requiring a diagnosis of a depressive disorder such as major depression or dysthymia for
      this study). The relationship between frailty and depression however goes beyond this
      association; the five defining characteristics of frailty (exhaustion, decreased energy,
      weight loss, decreased grip strength, and slow/unsteady gait) overlap significantly with
      symptoms of geriatric depression (decreased energy and motivation, psychomotor slowing,
      weight loss, decreased participation in leisure activities).

      The proposed study is innovative in that it is focuses on a group of older adults who have
      been unrepresented (via exclusion criteria) in previous clinical studies (frail older adults
      with comorbid depressive symptoms), and it treats the comorbid depressive symptoms and
      targets characteristics of the frailty syndrome in the hopes of altering the prognostic
      trajectory of this clinical sample. This protocol serves two purposes: 1. It tests the
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining frail older adults with depressive symptoms in a
      treatment trial, and 2. It provides pilot data for the effectiveness of an antidepressant
      medication on treating the characteristics of frailty and the comorbid depressive symptoms.
