    
      This was an open-label Phase III, multicenter, multinational, randomized, 3-arm study
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with either
      intermittent fluorouracil/leucovorin with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4) or capecitabine plus
      oxaliplatin (XELOX) versus FOLFOX4 regimen alone, as adjuvant chemotherapy in colon
      carcinoma.

      The treatment phase consisted of two parts of 24 weeks for a total of 48 weeks. The first
      part (weeks 1 to 24) consisted of treatment with either FOLFOX4, FOLFOX4 in combination with
      bevacizumab, or XELOX in combination with bevacizumab. The second part (weeks 25 to 48)
      consisted of single-agent bevacizumab for patients randomized to either
      bevacizumab-containing arm, but was only an observation period for patients assigned to the
      FOLFOX4-alone arm.

      Patients were to be followed for recurrence/new occurrence of colorectal cancer and survival.
      Patients who experienced a confirmed recurrence, occurrence of a new colorectal cancer during
      therapy, or experienced unacceptable toxicity were to be taken off study treatment but remain
      in study follow-up. Patients that came off therapy due to a confirmed recurrence/appearance
      of new colorectal cancer, were to be followed for survival until the end of the study
      follow-up period. The primary analysis was performed 36 months after the last patient has
      been randomized. After the primary analysis, patients continue to be followed for survival
      for at least a further 2 years ie, until all patients have been followed-up for at least 5
      years following randomization.
