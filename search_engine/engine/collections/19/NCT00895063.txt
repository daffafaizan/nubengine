      occurs in two common forms: adductor and abductor (Aronson, 1968, Brin et al., 1992,
      Schweinfurth et al., 2002). Adductor is the more common form (Aronson, 1985, Blitzer et al.
      1998). With adductor SD, patients have been described as "trying to talk whilst being choked"
      (Critchley, 1939). The spasmodic hyperadduction of the vocal folds is associated with
      strained-strangled, rough voice quality and sudden intermittent voice arrests (Aminoff, Dedo,
      & Izdebski, 1978, Blitzer & Brin, 1992, Hillel, 2001, Izdebski 1992, Ludlow, Nauton, &
      Bassich, 1984, Woodson, Zwirner, Murry, & Swenson, 1991). On the other hand, the intermittent
      or continuous abduction of the vocal folds linked with abductor SD results in breathy or
      whispered voice quality with sudden intermittent voice arrests (Aronson, 1985, Hillel, 2001,
      and Zwitman, 1979).

      Local injection of botulinum toxin is an effective treatment for spasmodic dysphonia and The
      National Academies of Otolaryngology and Neurology has endorsed the toxin as the treatment of
      choice for adductor spasmodic dysphonia. Consequently, this treatment is widely used. The
      clinical benefit of the botulinum toxin is related to muscle weakness in the vocal folds and
      the benefit lasts from 6 weeks to 6 months.

      Studies have suggested that voluntary muscle exercise in the hand and face after botulinum
      toxin injection may enhance the clinical effects of the toxin (Chen, Scott, & Smith, 2002;
      Chen et al., 1999; Kim et. al 2003;. Exercise may speed up the absorption of the toxin by the
      nerves and enhance the clinical response. You are invited to take part in a research study to
      learn more about the effect of exercise on botulinum toxin injections for spasmodic
      dysphonic. This project will examine whether or not exercise performed immediately following
      botulinum toxin injection affects the clinical benefit received from the injection.
