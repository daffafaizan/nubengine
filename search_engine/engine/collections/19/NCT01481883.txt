      hydrochloride, there is the potential to harness the positive estrogenic effect on central
      nervous system (CNS) neurotransmitter systems. While the CNS effects of raloxifene have not
      been fully studied, its actions are mediated through binding to estrogen receptors and can
      thereby regulate gene expression that is ligand, tissue or gene specific. By inference then,
      raloxifene would be expected to impact on dopamine and serotonin pathways in a similar
      fashion to unconjugated estrogen.

      This study aims to examine the impact of adjunctive SERM (120mg oral Raloxifene daily)
      treatment on the psychopathology and cognition of men with schizophrenia and related
      disorders
