    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability of ME-143, find the maximum
      tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicities, and the safety profile in patients with refractory
      solid tumors. In addition, the study is planned to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile
      of ME-143 and describe any clinical anti-tumor activity observed in patients.
