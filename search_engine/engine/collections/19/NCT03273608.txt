    
      The purpose of this multicenter registry is to gather the safety, efficacy and survival data
      in intermediate and advanced HCC patients treated drug-eluting microsphere in Taiwan in order
      to provide clinical evidence on deTACE in HCC management to physicians in the region, and to
      support the application of in treating advanced HCC patients.

        1. Primary Objective:

           To collect 1-year overall survival of chemoembolization with drug-eluting microsphere in
           intermediate and advanced HCC patients in Taiwan.

        2. Secondary Objectives:

             1. To evaluate the overall tumor response of chemoembolization with drug-eluting
                microsphere in intermediate and advanced HCC patients. The tumor response is
                according to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)
                criteria.

             2. To evaluate the local tumor response (in the tumor(s) treated with drug-eluting
                microsphere) by chemoembolization with drug-eluting microsphere in intermediate and
                advanced HCC patients.

             3. To evaluate the safety profile of chemoembolization with drug-eluting microsphere
                in intermediate and advanced HCC patients.

        3. Exploratory Objectives:

             1. To evaluate the downstaging and downsizing potential of chemoembolization with
                drug-eluting microsphere in intermediate and advanced HCC patients to within Milan
                Criteria and to within Resection margin.

             2. To collect time-to-progression (TTP) and progress-free-survival (PFS) data of
                chemoembolization with drug-eluting microsphere in intermediate and advanced HCC
                patients.
