           female adults over the age of 65 years using the DAAO technique (by measuring the
           oxidation of L-[1-13 C] phenylalanine to 13 CO 2 [F 13 CO 2] ) in response to graded
           intakes of phenylalanine.

        2. To compare the requirement so derived to that of young healthy adult previously
           determined in our lab.
