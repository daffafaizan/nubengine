      infection has been explored using risk stratification schema based on clinical parameters.
      First, patients will be stratified based on a clinical risk stratification schema. Patients
      stratified to the low risk group will be randomized between treatment using standard
      inpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy or outpatient antibiotic therapy using primarily an
      oral regimen. Second, an evaluation of proteins important to the innate immune system will be
      performed to provide a molecular characterization of episodes based on etiology. Third,
      single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes important for innate immunity will be evaluated to
      determine effect of each on infection risk during treatment induced neutropenia. Finally, we
      will develop a bank of both plasma and DNA specimens correlated with clinical outcomes for
      future use.
