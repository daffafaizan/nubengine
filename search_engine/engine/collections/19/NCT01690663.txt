      is that the effect is not dose related, while only 4mg and 8mg doses were studied. Our
      hypothesis is that the dose differences at 1mg, 2mg, or 4mg, does not have significant effect
      on the duration of analgesia. Therefore, we are not considering any patients to receive
      suboptimal dosing of preservative free dexamethasone in this study.
