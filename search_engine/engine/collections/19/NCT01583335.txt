      greater Copenhagen area was obtained from the Danish national birth register at the National
      Board of Health. This register contains information on all births, whether at hospital or
      home, on factors such as birth weight and length, height and pre-pregnant weight of the
      mother, parity, and Central Personal Registry number (CPR-number). Data on socioeconomic
      status was obtained from the administrative birth forms. This was done manually using the
      CPR-numbers obtained from the birth register.

      After selection of the children eligible for participation, the children were allocated to
      three groups, (intervention group, control group, shadow group) using computer based
      randomization. All siblings were allocated to the same group. After the random allocation,
      children from the intervention group and the control group were sent a letter with an
      invitation to participate in the project. Children from the shadow group were also
      identified, and their general practitioners were contacted and asked for information on each
      child's height and weight.
