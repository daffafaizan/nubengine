      meet criteria for CMI, and the other half will be Veterans from other periods of service who
      also meet criteria for CMI. Each participant will be randomized to either participate in MBSR
      or aCDSMP (stratified by Gulf War deployment status so there are ~7-8 Gulf War Veterans in
      each group for every cohort). Measures to collect primary outcome data (pain, fatigue,
      cognitive failures, patient satisfaction), secondary outcomes, and potential mediators will
      be administered at four assessments: (1) Baseline; (2) Post-Intervention; (3) at 3-months
      after the group ended; and (4) at 6-months after the group ended. Sample demographic data
      (age, gender, race, income, education, etc.) will be collected at baseline only. All study
      procedures will take place at VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle, WA.
