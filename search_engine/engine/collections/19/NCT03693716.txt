    
      Patients with a history of traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations with documented
      imagological Bankart and HillSachs lesions who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled
      in the study and undergo an arthroscopic dynamic anterior capsular stabilization technique
      with trans subscapular long head of the biceps tenodesis. All patients will be clinically and
      radiologically/imagiologically assessed preoperatively and at the 6-months, 12-months and
      2-years postoperative evaluations. The range of motion (ROM), shoulder abduction strength,
      Constant, ROWE and WOSI scores will be compared from preoperative to 6 months postoperative;
      from 6 months postoperative to 12 months postoperative; and from 12 months to 2 years
      postoperative (paired-samples t-test, two-tailed). All continuous variables will be compared
      between the group of patients with failures (a failure is defined as a patient who suffers an
      objective re-dislocation episode during the 2-year follow-up) and the group without failures
      (Mann-Whitney U test). All categorical variables and outcome results will be compared between
      the two groups (Fisher's exact test). A significant difference will be defined as P<0.05.
