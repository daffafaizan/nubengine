      34% SDD formulation with that of a reference 25% SDD powder for suspension used in previous
      clinical trials. Another objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of food on
      bioavailability of the DSM265-TPGS 34% SDD formulation.

      The current 25% SDD powder for suspension clinical formulation is a suspension which requires
      reconstitution/administration in 240 mL sucralose based vehicle (for a 400 mg adult dose).
      This volume is too large for paediatric patients with malaria (e.g., translates into a 30 mL
      volume for 0.5-2 yr old patients); also, the dosing vehicle is not commercially viable. The
      new formulation dissolves in a smaller volume of a more common vehicle, water (40 mL for 400
      mg adult dose).
