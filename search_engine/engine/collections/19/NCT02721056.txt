    
      PHASE I PART: Dose escalation and Recommended Dose (Volume) The purpose of the Phase I part
      of the study is to determine the Recommended Dose (volume), the safety profile and the
      feasibility of the treatment of NBTXR3 administered either by intrahepatic lesion injection
      or super selective transcatheter arterial injection and activated by stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT), in patients with liver cancers. Primary objective

      - To determine the Recommended Dose(s) (volume(s)) and the early Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
      of NBTXR3 administered either by intralesional injection or by super selective transcatheter
      arterial injection and activated by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients
      with liver cancers

      PHASE II PART: Safety and Efficacy evaluation Primary objectives

      The primary objectives of the Phase II part are:

        -  To assess and characterize the safety profile, including liver function evaluation using
           MELD/MELD-Na and Child-Pugh scores, of NBTXR3 activated by SBRT, at the Recommended
           Dose(s)(Volume(s)) as determined previously in the Phase I part, in patients with liver
           cancers Clinical Investigation Plan - NBTXR3/103

        -  To evaluate the antitumor activity in terms of Complete Response Rate (CRR) of target
           lesions, as per mRECIST for HCC and RECIST version 1.1 for liver metastases at 12 weeks'
           post radiotherapy, of NBTXR3 activated by SBRT, at the Recommended Dose(s) (Volume(s))
           as determined previously in the Phase I part, in patients with liver cancer.
