      duration of the local anaesthetic used include placement of indwelling perineural catheters
      to allow prolonged infusion or the co-administration of adjuvants such as epinephrine, alpha
      2 agonists (as clonidine and dexmedetomidine), midazolam, or the corticosteroid dexamethasone
      .

      Dexamethasone improves the quality and duration of peripheral nerve block over local
      anaesthetic alone. This is thought to be mediated by attenuating the release of inflammatory
      mediators, reducing ectopic neuronal discharge, and inhibiting potassium channel-mediated
      discharge of nociceptive C-fibres .

      Tramadol is a unique opioid with two modes of action for inhibition of pain, an opioid action
      mediated by the μ receptor and a non-opioid action mediated by α-2-adrenergic and
      serotoninergic activity .The monoaminergic activity of tramadol inhibits the descending pain
      pathways, resulting in suppression of nociceptive transmission at the spinal level . Tramadol
      also exhibits local anaesthetic properties by blocking K+ channels .Many studies have
      characterized the effects of tramadol as an adjuvant to local anaesthetic in brachial plexus
      block .
