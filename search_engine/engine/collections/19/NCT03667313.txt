      drug-eluting balloon catheters (DEB). In clinical practice, paclitaxel is used as an
      effective antiproliferative agent loaded into DEB (paclitaxel-eluting balloon catheters;
      PEB).

      In contrast to paclitaxel, sirolimus is difficult to deliver on the balloon surface, due to
      insufficient tissue uptake and shorter tissue retention of limus drugs. It was found that
      phospholipid-encapsulated sirolimus nanoparticles could be used for coating balloon catheters
      to provide efficient drug transfer to vessel wall with high tissue concentration.

      This prospective randomized non-inferiority study compares the efficacy of new
      sirolimus-eluting balloon catheters (SEB) and iopromide-coated paclutaxel-eluting balloon
      catheters (PEB) in the treatment of bare metal (BMS) - or drug-eluting stents restenosis
      (DES-ISR).

      The primary end-point is in-segment late lumen loss (LLL) at 12 months as measured by
      quantitative coronary angiography (QCA).

      Secondary end-points are the incidence of binary ISR (Ëƒ50% DS) and the overall incidence of
      12-month major adverse cardiac events (MACE; cardiovascular death, non-fatal acute myocardial
      infarction [AIM], or target vessel revascularization [TVR]).
