      Efforts to cure high-risk breast cancer have increasingly focused on the application of dose
      intensive chemotherapy. To date, the use of dose intensive and high-dose chemotherapy has not
      significantly changed the survival for the majority of high risk and metastatic patients. The
      optimal schedule and combination of agents to improve the results of high-dose chemotherapy
      is not known. This study will pilot a combination of chemotherapy agents for the treatment of
      Inflammatory Breast Cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To define, in a statistically relevant manner, the clinical efficacy of this chemotherapy
      regimen combination in the treatment of Inflammatory Breast Cancer (stage IIIB inflammatory).

      To examine the effects of this high-dose chemotherapy on T-cells (T-cell number, phenotype,
      cytokine profiles) and study the process of post-chemotherapy T-cell regeneration.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Newly diagnosed patient with non metastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer (stage III B).

      The patients treated in this study will also be eligible for entrance into other protocols of
      the experimental Transplantation & Immunology Branch that are examining strategies of
      manipulating T-cell regeneration in adults after intensive chemotherapy.

      DESIGN:

      Patients will receive multiple cycles of a dose intensive combination of Paclitaxel and
      Cyclophosphamide both for the mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells and with
      therapeutic intent. A second induction regimen will consist of four cycles of the combination
      of Doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide. Patients will subsequently receive high-dose Melphalan and
      Etoposide followed by the infusion of peripheral blood progenitor cells and granulocytes
      colony-stimulating-factor (G-CSF).
