      complications like bleeding and perforation are still not uncommon in clinical practice.
      According to the literature in average, 2-14% of peptic ulcers result in perforation, most
      215 commonly occurring in females over the age of 60 and chronic NSAID, alcohol or tobacco
      users.

      Management of perforated peptic ulcer entails resuscitation, pharmacotherapy and surgery.

      Traditionally, suture with or without omental patch has been considered the 'gold standard'
      and still is. It is associated with shorter length of stay, lower transfusion needs and has
      lower morbidity as compared to gastrectomy. In 1992, it has been proposed that laparoscopy
      should be routinely considered in the management of perforated duodenal ulcer. Nowadays due
      to the advances in laparoscopic technique, many publications suggest that laparoscopic repair
      of perforated peptic ulcers could be a superior choice to open repair. These is linked with
      the advantages of laparoscopic surgery over open surgery such as reduced postoperative pain,
      lower wound infection rate, decreased length of hospital stay, and earlier functional
      recovery
