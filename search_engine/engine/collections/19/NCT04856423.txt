      majority of colorectal cancer is thought to arise from precancerous lesions through the
      adenoma-carcinoma pathway. Detecting and removing of colorectal advanced adenomas can reduce
      incidence of colorectal cancer. Although colonoscopy is currently considered the most
      effective method for detecting advanced adenomas, individuals may be reluctant to undergo
      colonoscopy due to the uncomfortable feeling and the relatively high cost. Conversely, stool
      tests are relatively cheap and more readily accepted. Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is
      economic and easy to use in colorectal cancer screening. However, the common used qFIT is
      insufficiently sensitive to the minor hemorrhage of advanced adenomas, and the sensitivity is
      about only 27% to 47%. To improve the detection rate of colorectal advanced adenoma,
      Ultra-sensitivity quantitative fecal immunochemical test (us-qFIT) improves technology and
      can detect fecal hemoglobin in extremely low concentration quantificationally. The
      investigators design this research to prove the diagnostic accuracy of us-qFIT in detecting
      colorectal advanced adenoma.
