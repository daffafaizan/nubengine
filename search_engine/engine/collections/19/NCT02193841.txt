      and only one to date has addressed the problem of simple bone cysts (SBCs). Also known as
      unicameral bone cysts, they are the commonest bone lesion in children. Despite general
      opinion, these cysts do not resolve at skeletal maturity.

      Many forms of treatment have been recommended but none, including the popular methods of
      corticosteroid or bone marrow injections, have reliably eradicated SBC. Although the lesions
      are considered benign (non-cancerous), they cause pain, frequently interfere with function,
      dramatically restrict play activity, may re-fracture leading to growth arrest and/or
      deformity, and cause enormous anxiety for children and their families.

      With a well-developed network of surgeons and researchers, we will provide evidence comparing
      the effectiveness of two treatment interventions for SBC. More specifically, our goals for
      this study are:

        1. to compare the rate of radiographic healing between two standard treatments including
           curettage with puncture alone, and curettage with puncture followed by injection with
           Vitoss morsels;

        2. to identify prognostic radiographic factors associated with simple bone cyst healing and
           fracture;

        3. to determine the impact of simple bone cyst on children/family functioning.
