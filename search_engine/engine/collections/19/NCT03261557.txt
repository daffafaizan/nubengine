      worse clinical and psychosocial evolution than in the adult form of the illness. In the case
      of patients with EOP, international and national clinical guidelines recommend the
      combination of pharmacological treatment with CBT. However there are not any previous
      controlled study that has analyzed the efficacy of this type of psychological intervention.

      A controlled randomized study will be carry out of CBT + SST intervention compared to a
      control intervention of the same duration, format and contact with a therapist. The sample
      will be 30 participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, Schizoaffective disorder or
      psychotic disorder not otherwise specified diagnosed between 9 and 18 years. Patiens have to
      be in the early phase of the disease (first 5 years after the onset) and in non-acute
      treatment. All participants will be evaluated before and after the intervention with clinical
      scales, neuropsychological battery and blood test(...). 20 healthy subjects paired by age,
      puberal stage and sex will be also recruited and evaluated only at baseline point. The
      evaluations will be carried out by blind evaluators. Intention-to-treat analysis will be
      carry out using the statistical package SPSS v 20.
