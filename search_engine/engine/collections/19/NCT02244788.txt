    
      The purpose of this IRB approved study is to allow patients to undergo surgery with the SR™
      PIP (Proximal Interphalangeal) Implants. This is NOT a research study, but rather, a
      requirement by the FDA for humanitarian use of device. Use of the SR™ PIP is approved for
      humanitarian use by the FDA when either the patient is in need of a revision of failed PIP
      prothesis(es) or the patient expects to place his/her hand under loading situation which
      preclude the use of an alternative implant in the painful osteo-arthritic and post traumatic
      arthritic PIP joint.
