      intervention specifically tailored to older African American or 2) a successful aging group.
      The 12-week physical activity intervention will consist of group based exercise sessions at a
      community facility and the successful aging groups will occur at Pennington Biomedical.
      Cognitive functioning and blood markers of circulating neurotrophic factors will be assessed
      to determine the brain effects of physical activity in this understudied population.

      Specific Aim 1: To tailor a physical activity promotion intervention to community-dwelling
      African American elderly adults. Investigators will use focus groups to gather information
      needed to tailor a physical activity program to elderly African Americans.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if a physical activity promotion intervention in African
      American adults is effective in modifying physical activity and biological markers.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine if a physical activity promotion intervention in African
      American adults benefits cognition and brain health. Change over the course of the
      intervention will be assessed in key AD related cognitive domains (memory, executive
      function, and processing speed).

      Collecting this data sets the stage for the definitive study of exercise benefits on measures
      of amyloid, tau, inflammation, brain metabolism, and other AD-relevant pathways in elderly
      African Americans, which could in turn increase understanding of neurobiological mechanisms
      and optimal physical activity recommendations for elderly African Americans.
