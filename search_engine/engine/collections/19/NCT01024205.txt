      Primary

        -  Determine if neoadjuvant sunitinib malate can achieve a clinical benefit of 70% or more
           to the primary renal tumor prior to surgery and adjuvant sunitinib malate in patients
           with metastatic renal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to radiological progression in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients suitable for nephrectomy after neoadjuvant
           sunitinib malate.

        -  Determine the translational endpoints.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for 3 courses. Approximately 2 weeks later, patients undergo a standard radical
      nephrectomy with lymph node dissection. Beginning at least 2 weeks after surgery, patients
      receive oral sunitinib malate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples may be collected periodically for laboratory studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.
