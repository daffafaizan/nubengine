      surgeries is increasing. These populations of patients are at increased risk of perioperative
      morbidity and mortality. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) evaluation in cardiac surgery
      has been shown to impact on the perioperative management of patients and to improve outcomes.
      Near infrared-reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technique that has been employed since the
      mid-1970's and that can be used as a non-invasive and continuous monitor of the balance
      between cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption. Two recent randomized trials have shown an
      association between correction of cerebral desaturation and shorter recovery room and
      hospital stay in non-cardiac surgery, and with a decrease in major organ dysfunction and in
      intensive care length of stay after coronary artery bypass. By combining NIRS and TEE in
      high-risk patients, optimal tissue perfusion could be achieved and perioperative morbidity
      and mortality could be reduced.
