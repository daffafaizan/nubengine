      and motor function in subjects who experience musculoskeletal pain. The improvement in motor
      function may be a direct effect of the treatment or secondary to a hypoalgesic effect. This
      study aims to demonstrate whether it is possible to alter motor function following joint
      mobilization, in situations where motor performance is not impaired by pain.
