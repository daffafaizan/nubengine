      an individual psychotherapy based on interpersonal and social rhythm principles in bipolar I
      patients maintained on lithium carbonate (lithium). An adaptation of maintenance
      interpersonal psychotherapy, this intervention takes into account the specific
      vulnerabilities, symptoms, and interpersonal problem areas associated with bipolar disorder.

      Acutely ill patients in a manic or depressed episode are randomly assigned to either
      individual psychotherapy or medication clinic visits in addition to appropriate
      pharmacotherapy (lithium carbonate). Patients who stabilize (HRSD and Bech-Rafaelsen < 7 for
      four weeks) are then randomly assigned to preventative treatment with either individual
      psychotherapy or medication clinic visits in addition to pharmacotherapy. Thus, patients in
      this study receive one of four possible treatment strategies: 1) preliminary phase
      psychotherapy followed by preventative phase psychotherapy; 2) preliminary phase medication
      clinic visits followed by preventative phase psychotherapy; 3) preliminary phase
      psychotherapy followed by preventative phase medication clinic visits in addition to
      psychotherapy; or 4) preliminary phase medication clinic visits followed by preventative
      phase medication clinic visits in addition to psychotherapy. Those patients who experience a
      relapse (during the initial twelve weeks of the preventative phase) or a recurrence (after
      week 12 of the preventative phase) are treated with appropriate pharmacotherapy and continued
      in psychotherapy or medication clinic visits as dictated by their original randomization
      assignment. These patients are then followed for the remainder of what would have been their
      time in the protocol had they remained well.
