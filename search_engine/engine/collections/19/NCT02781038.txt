      receive the intervention or not. Either way, all will receive a baseline attitude survey. The
      patient will be given a series of questions that target the areas of interest noted in the
      model. At some point in their hospitalization, preferably at least one day later and no
      greater than one week later, the patients will be given the teaching intervention (or not),
      and receive another attitude survey. After discharge, the patients will be expected in
      orthopaedic follow up clinic. At that time they will receive another attitude survey. If
      unable to deliver at that time, they will be contacted by phone or sought at their second
      clinic follow up.
