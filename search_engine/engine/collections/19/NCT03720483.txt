      (NAC) in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. The study will also create a bank of data, blood,
      and sputum from IPF patients for future research.

      NAC is a medication used to loosen thick mucus. NAC was initially licensed for use in 1968.
      It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and
      safe medicines needed in a health system, and it is available as a generic medication and is
      not very expensive. Inhaled NAC has been used as a mucus-dissolving therapy in respiratory
      conditions with excessive and/or thick mucus production.
