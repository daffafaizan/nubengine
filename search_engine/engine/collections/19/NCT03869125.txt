    
      Rationale:

      Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by repetitive closure of upper airways leading to
      apnoea (complete airflow cessation) or hypopnoea (airflow limitation > 50%+ blood oxygen
      desaturation > 4%). It is considered to be an important risk factor for arterial
      hypertension. In these patients is highly prevalent nocturnal hypertension (NH) and also
      masked hypertension (MH). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered to be a
      gold standard for the diagnosis of NH and MH. Results of ABPM are compared with office blood
      pressure measurement which could be falsely elevated in some patients (white coat effect).
      For this reason, automatic office blood pressure measurement was developed. Nowadays some
      devices like BpTRU were developed. This was validated on some patient groups but robust data
      for patients with obstructive sleep apnoea are missing.

      Process:

      Patient with ronchopathy and suspected obstructive sleep apnoea undergo automated office
      blood pressure monitoring followed by office blood pressure monitoring at the Department of
      Exercise Medicine and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation. After education, ambulatory blood
      pressure monitor will be provided to patients for the following 24 hours. In the same night,
      respiratory polygraphy will be performed in the Sleep Laboratory, Department of Respiratory
      Medicine, University Hospital Olomouc. All data will be statistically evaluated after
      completion of the target number of subjects. Patients without obstructive sleep apnoea
      (apnoea-hypopnoea index < 5) will not be included in statistical evaluations.
