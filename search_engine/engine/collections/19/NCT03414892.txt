      step in glucose metabolism. In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, glucokinase is
      expressed in pancreatic islet beta cells where it acts as a "glucose sensor" for insulin
      release. Activation of glucokinase increases the glucose sensitivity of insulin secretion,
      effectively lowering the glucose threshold for insulin secretion. Because of its potential to
      enhance insulin secretion and affect hepatic glucose metabolism, is being investigated for
      use as a treatment for hyperglycaemia, Globalagliatin( the active ingredient in SY-004
      capsule) is being investigated for use as a treatment for T2DM patients. This is a phase I
      placebo-controlled study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of Globalagliatin Hydrochloride (SY-004) after Multiple Ascending Doses in
      patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
