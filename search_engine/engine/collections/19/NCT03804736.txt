      transplant by oral capsules (FMT-c ) versus FMT-c enriched with Lactobacillus for treatment
      of C. difficile recurrent infection.

      From each patient, a fecal sample was obtained at days 0, 3, and 7 after treatment. Fecal
      samples are analyzed by 16 subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA) metagenomic
      sequencing.
