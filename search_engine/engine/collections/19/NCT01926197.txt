    
      A Pancreatic Cancer Radiotherapy Study Group (PanCRS) Trial

      Primary Objective:

      To determine progression free survival for mFFX +/- SBRT.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine metastasis free survival following mFFX chemotherapy alone or with SBRT.

        -  To determine the overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients treated with
           chemotherapy +/- SBRT.

        -  To determine local progression-free survival in pancreatic cancer patients after
           chemotherapy +/- SBRT.

        -  To evaluate acute (within 3 months of treatment) grade 2 or greater gastritis, fistula,
           enteritis, or ulcer and any other grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity within 3 months of
           treatment.

        -  To evaluate the utility of FDG-PET for treatment planning and estimation of progression
           free survival.

        -  To identify new biomarkers in pancreatic cancer.

        -  To evaluate the quality of life of patients before and after either chemotherapy or
           chemotherapy and SBRT.
