      inoperable disease and an effective, novel combination treatment is urgently needed for these
      patients population. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that chemotherapy improves survival
      for patients with advanced gastric cancer compared with best supportive care alone [hazard
      ratio (HR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.52] and that combination chemotherapy is
      superior to monotherapy (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93) (Wagner et al., 2006). For advanced
      gastric cancer, 5-FU in combination with cisplatin (FP regimen) is commonly used reference
      regimen, which are successfully replaced by capecitabine and oxaliplatin in recent phase III
      trial (Cunningham et al., 2008; Okines et al., 2009). In phase II trial, CAPEOX (capecitabine
      combined with oxaliplatin) regimen also showed promising activity for the metastatic gastric
      cancer (Park et al., 2006; Park et al., 2008). In order to improve survival of metastatic
      gastric cancer patients, various clinical trials incorporated novel molecularly targeted
      agent in combination with the reference arm.
