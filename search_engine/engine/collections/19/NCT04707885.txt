      that only five percent of adult candidates undergo CI. A major barrier is the loss of
      residual hearing associated with surgery, meaning most patients lose any or all residual
      hearing as a result of the CI surgery, especially since the majority of today's candidates do
      not suffer from complete deafness. Hence, many candidates are faced with the decision to
      relinquish their remaining acoustic hearing in exchange for electric hearing via the CI, as
      CI surgery often results in complete loss of any residual hearing. However, recent
      developments in hearing monitoring systems during CI surgery have shown promise for providing
      the surgeon with live feedback of how the cochlear implant insertion process is proceeding,
      allowing the surgeon to make intraoperative adjustments during the insertion, potentially
      minimizing any trauma caused by the insertion of the implant, ultimately helping preserve
      residual hearing. This ultimately could lead to improvements in the rates of hearing
      preservation. Therefore, the current study seeks to investigate: 1) the advantage of using a
      hearing monitoring system (electrocochleography) monitoring guided CI surgery on hearing
      preservation rates, 2) determine the benefit that hearing aid/cochlear implant combined
      hearing provides participants over non-hearing preservation CI (electric-only stimulation
      from the CI) on measures of speech perception and quality of life.
