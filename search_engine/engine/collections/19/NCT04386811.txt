    
      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether acute calcitriol (vitaminD)
      administration (compared to placebo) enhances the neurocognitive effects of of current
      stimulant medications as measured by tasks of vigilance/attention, spatial working memory,
      and reversal learning in individuals with (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      using a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject, two-day study design.

      Primary Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that calcitriol (versus placebo) administration will
      enhance positive neurocognitive effects of current stimulant medications in individuals with
      ADHD.

      Seconday (Exploratory) Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that calcitriol (versus placebo)
      administration alone will also enhance neurocognitive performance on tasks of
      attention/vigilance and/or spatial working memory.
