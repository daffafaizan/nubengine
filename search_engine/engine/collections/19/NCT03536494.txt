    
      A quasi-experimental design with before/after measurement and a control group was used.

      The objective was to identify the effectiveness of a training activity on the review of
      treatments. In addition, it was proposed to establish the duration of medication in real
      clinical practice, and its prevalence of use before and after the intervention.

      Control group: Usual care

      Intervention:

        -  Initiatives for healthcare professionals: information and training with written
           material, in an diagram format, distributed to all general practitioners.

        -  Initiatives for specialized hospital care: information regarding the intervention for
           urologists and gynaecologists.

        -  Management support with the definition of a structured strategy for all the addresses of
           the PHC and GPs.

        -  Monthly monitoring of the intervention (feed-back to all GPs).

      The intervention consisted of: a) meetings with all the directors of the PHC; b) informative
      meetings and sessions in the PHC; c) distribution of the diagram to all the GPs; d) lists of
      patients with treatment provided periodically from the medication area; and e) review of the
      treatments by the GPs.

      If considered appropriate, and with the consent of the patient, the medication was withdrawn.

      A pharmacist and a clinical pharmacologist acted as consultants in case of any doubts
      regarding specific patients.
