    
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, rater blind trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of Fascial Manipulation as a therapy for CTS. Fascial Manipulation is an
      intense friction performed by the elbows or the distal extremities of the interphalangeal
      articulation of the index finger for some minutes as to promote hyperemia to restore the
      collagen fibers ability to slide against each other. The friction lasts from 2 to 4 minutes.

      In this trial, 14 patients were randomized in two groups: The intervention group received
      fascial manipulation for CTS and the other group, received fascial manipulation on spots not
      related to CTS. This last group was the placebo control group.

      The treatment was performed once a week for 5 weeks consecutively and the follow up visits
      for the assessments were performed 10 days and 3 months after the end of the treatment.
