      important mechanism to subvert estrogen dependence in hormone responsive breast cancer
      resulting in reduced therapy response or tumor resistance to hormonal therapy; thus, it is
      hypothesized that the combination of an anti-VEGF agent (Avastin, an anti-VEGF monoclonal
      antibody) and hormonal therapy should be more effective than hormonal therapy alone for the
      treatment of breast cancer.
