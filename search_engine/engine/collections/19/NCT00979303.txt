      the heart. Non fluoroscopic imaging tools have been utilized for adult atrial fibrillation
      procedures. These tools utilize magnetic fields to visualize the heart without using
      radiation. The purpose of this study was to determine if these 3D mapping tools could reduce
      radiation exposure during SVT ablation procedures could be performed using these 3D tools.
