      bolus doses or via continuous infusion during general anesthesia. Due to the specificity of
      the knee-chest position in a lumbar discectomy, many complications during anesthesia and
      surgery are possible. Therefore an effective and balanced intraoperative neuromuscular block
      is needed.

      Studies so far have not included a comparison on muscle strength and quality of patient
      recovery of the effect of continuous infusion and bolus doses of rocuronium during anesthesia
      for lumbar discectomy.

      The hypothesis of this research was that the continuous infusion of rocuronium during general
      anesthesia for a lumbar discectomy enables better muscle strength recovery, and a better
      quality of patient recovery as measured by questionnaire.

      The aim was to compare the influence of the continuous infusion and bolus doses of rocuronium
      on patient recovery. Therefore the investigators assessed how continuous infusion and bolus
      doses of rocuronium affect the recovery of muscle strength as measured by a hand-grip
      dynamometer. The quality of patient recovery was assessed by standardised questionnaire
      (Qor-40 - Quality of recovery questionnaire).

      The aim was also to evaluate the applicability of the Croatian version of Qor-40
      questionnaire in clinical practice.
