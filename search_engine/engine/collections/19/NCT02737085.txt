      exhibited good clinical outcomes. The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown excellent therapeutic
      efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, patients
      treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 mutation. Therefore we attempt to
      treat Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL) patients by sequential therapy of the 2 targets
      and hope to combine their advantages.
