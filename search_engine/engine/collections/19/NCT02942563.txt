    
      This is a multicenter, phase II trial to assess the efficacy/safety of triplet regimen
      (FOLFOXIRI) for patients with LARC. After 4 cycles of FOLFOXIRI and 2 weeks later, the
      patients will be evaluated by senior radiologist, oncologist and surgeon through pelvic MRI,
      CT and Positron Emission Computed Tomography (PET-CT). The patients will go to surgery (TME)
      if the tumor response is good enough to have complete resection under the decision of
      MDT,otherwise, the patients will receive pelvic radiotherapy(45Grey/25Fraction and
      5.4Grey/3Fraction boost to the tumor bed) combined with capecitabine(625mg/M^2, bid po, d1-5,
      qw), and additional four cycles of modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) or Oxaliplatin 135mg/m²plus
      Capecitabine 1.0/m² bid po(XELOX) of each 3 weeks cycle for 2 cycles chemotherapy before TME.
      All patients will receive 6-8 cycles of mFOLFOX6 or 4-5 cycles XELOX as adjuvant chemotherapy
      after TME.
