    
      This study is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, global investigation to determine if
      left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN FLX Device is a reasonable alternative to
      oral anticoagulation in patients after AF ablation.

      A subject who signs informed consent is considered enrolled in the study. Subjects will be
      randomized to OAC or WATCHMAN FLX in equal fashion. Randomization will be stratified by
      sequential vs. concomitant planned ablation +/- WATCHMAN implantation, to help ensure balance
      of treatment assignments within the sequential and concomitant groups.
