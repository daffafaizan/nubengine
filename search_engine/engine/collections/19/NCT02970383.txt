      hydrocodone/325 mg acetaminophen following minor hand surgery. Patients are allowed to
      request additional medication as needed. Patients are contacted by phone 10-14 days after
      their surgery to answer a questionnaire regarding number of pills taken, number of refills
      requested, number of remaining pills, their satisfaction with their pain control and their
      surgery, and their opinion regarding the appropriateness of the prescription size.
