      drug telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) among patients with a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with
      history of carcinoid syndrome. We want to know if taking Xermelo affects patients' lean body
      mass, quality of life, dietary intake, and physical and cognitive functioning during
      treatment. A better understanding of the mechanisms of weight gain from Xermelo may allow us
      to determine whether this drug may be beneficial for treating carcinoid syndrome, cachexia,
      or weight loss seen in other diseases.
