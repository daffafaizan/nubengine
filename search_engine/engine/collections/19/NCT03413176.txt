      increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and used in combination. However, AEs
      can occur. Here the investigators use VigiBase (http://www.vigiaccess.org/), the World Health
      Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify cases of
      cardiovascular adverse drug reaction following treatment with AAs.
