      bodyweight strength exercises), the electromyographic (EMG) sensors and kinematic markers
      will be attached to the participant, who will then perform the maximal voluntary contractions
      for the purpose of EMG normalization. Then the participant will perform new hip adductor
      exercises using the novelty device, which enables hip adduction eccentric contractions in
      different hip and knee positions. The latter is important when trying to target specific hip
      adductor muscle, since different hip and/or knee angles differently affect individual muscle
      activity and joint torques. Exercises will be performed in randomized order, while the EMG
      and kinematic signals will be synchronously captured. EMG muscle activity and joint torques,
      produced during the exercises, will be analysed. Descriptive statistics will be calculated
      and reported as mean Â± standard deviation. Shapiro-Wilk test will be used for testing of
      normality and Levene's test for equality of variances. Differences among corresponding
      variables will be obtained from different exercises and tested with the analysis of the
      variance for repeated measurements. For pair-wise comparisons, paired 2-tailed post-hoc
      t-tests with Bonferroni's correction will be used. The level of statistical significance will
      be set at p < 0.05.
