      metabolism. The investigators propose to conduct a double-blind, randomized, placebo
      controlled, cross-over study in which blood levels of metabolites and hormones will be
      measured in healthy volunteers following a mixed meal test without or with PA.

      Study design:

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over study. Twenty volunteers
      who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized into two groups, provided with a
      mixed meal without or with calcium proprionate (also known as E282). A week later,
      participants will be provided with a mixed meal again, following cross-over of the groups.
      Blood will be collected at baseline, and every 30 minutes for 4 hours.

      Study Subjects:

      20 healthy male and female volunteers (ages 18 to 65 years) with a body mass index (BMI) of
      20 to <30 Kg/m2.
