      Primary

        -  Identify and validate serum biomarkers that can distinguish malignant from benign and
           normal breast conditions in women at high risk or average risk for breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Standardize procedures for recruitment, characterization, and follow-up of participants
           and collection, processing, storage, and analysis of specimens.

        -  Assess marker variability over time in healthy controls.

        -  Develop a shared specimen resource to support ongoing early detection research.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected every 6 months and assayed for the presence of
      biomarkers.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 625 participants will be accrued for this study.
