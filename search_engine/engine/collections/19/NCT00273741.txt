      depression, pain, drowsiness, alterations of cognition, anorexia and other symptoms due to
      the progressive disease. The objective of the medical team of support and palliative care is
      to control these effects to maintain a quality of life. Particularly, the cancer patient in
      an advanced phase of the disease presents with important asthenia. In some patients, this
      asthenia is characterized by drowsiness or apathy. It always leads to ill-being and a
      sensation of bad adaptation. When an etiologic treatment is possible (correction of the
      anaemia, of the metabolic disorders, of the undernutrition, of the anorexia, of the insomnia,
      of the stubborn pain, of the psychological suffering), the asthenia can be fought. But, when
      it appears in patients not really in the end of life (life expectancy more than 1 month) and
      when no etiologic treatments are possible, other solutions must be considered, and all the
      more when the complaint is important with repeated requests for relief.

      Methylphenidate is an amphetamine first indicated for deficient attention disorders with
      hyperactivity in children more than 6 years old. Several studies have been realized to
      evaluate its effect in cancer patients in palliative care. Some studies showed, in
      particular, its effectiveness on asthenia because of a stimulant and an antidepressant
      action. The methylphenidate could have an anti-analgesic effect or co-analgesic effect. All
      these studies are observational and not randomized. So they have a small level of proof and
      they have not been realized in a population of asthenic patients in palliative care. So a
      randomized controlled clinical trial in this specific population needs to be experimented.
