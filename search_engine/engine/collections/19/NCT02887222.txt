      analgesic regimen that delivered an amount of local anesthetic that was below the patient's
      requirement per hour, as the studies were done in the context of an association with patient
      controlled epidural anesthesia (PCEA) as a rescue technique. As a result, PCEA requests were
      frequent and therefore these studies have not been able to truly understand the pharmacology
      of the bolus technique in the PIEB regimen, as the PCEA utilized by patients added an extra
      component to the regimen.

      At Mount Sinai Hospital, PIEB devices have been recently introduced. Currently our standard
      epidural mixture is bupivacaine 0.0625% with fentanyl 2mcg/ml. Based on previous research
      done by the investigators, the current epidural regimen consists of 10 ml PIEB at 40 minute
      intervals, with PCEA boluses of 5 ml and a lock out interval of 10 minutes, for a maximum of
      20 ml of the epidural mixture per hour.

      In this study, the investigators will vary the volume of the bolus (7-12 mL) of bupivacaine
      0.0625% with fentanyl 2mcg/ml. PCEA bolus of 5mL of the same solution will also be available.
      The goal is to establish the ideal PIEB volume that will be effective for our patient
      population.
