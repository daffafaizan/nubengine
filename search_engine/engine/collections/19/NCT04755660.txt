      are not exercising regularly are recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Metabolism
      Department of a medical center in the north to participate in the study. Blocks 6, and 12
      (Block) are randomly assigned. The research subjects were assigned to the behavior change and
      resistance exercise group, and home-based resistance exercise( with elastic band), and the
      control group. The behavior changes and resistance exercise group received motivational
      interviews and self-efficacy theory-based exercise behavior changes and resistance exercise
      guidance intervention, home resistance exercise. the group received home elastic band
      resistance exercise training, and the control group received regular exercise guidance. The
      three groups received data collection of physical activity, muscle strength, body
      composition, physical activity function, and exercise self-efficacy in the pre-test, the
      sixth week, and the twelfth week. During the study period, the exercise log was used to
      collect the mediating variable about exercise compliance (Time Ã— frequency) data collection.
      This study compares the effectiveness of motivational interviews and self-efficacy
      theory-based exercise behavior intervention and home resistance exercise training programs.
      The result will show an empirical evidence for type 2 diabetic patients to increase physical
      activity and muscle strength in the future, and will also apply to training of muscle
      strengthening in diabetes and other chronic disease.
