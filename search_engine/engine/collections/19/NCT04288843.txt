      time for embryo transfer, two to four separate analyses, including imaging, and the current
      standard method of endometrial dating (ultrasound, histological and blood tests) will be
      performed as well as participant's testimony. Dating by hormonal profile (blood tests) will
      be contingent on availability of the tests for each subject. So shall be the ultrasound test.
      During the analysis data will be acquired for subsequent correlation analysis. In addition, a
      parallel in-vivo analysis, similar in methodology to the ex-vivo analysis, may be performed
      via imaging by hysteroscopy.
