      of AD in persons with PTSD. Likewise, studies of alcohol/drug abuse treatment seekers have
      documented high rates of trauma exposure and PTSD. The high prevalence of PTSD/AD comorbidity
      is the cause of enormous human suffering, most of which either goes untreated or is resistant
      to treatment efforts. Both theory and research concerning the interface between these two
      disorders suggests that PTSD is associated with the initiation of excessive alcohol use
      and/or the development of AD by way of an escape/avoidance behavioral mechanism wherein
      escalating alcohol use is reinforced by its ability to dampen the negative emotions and
      arousal associated with PTSD. If PTSD is often a primary cause of the initiation and
      maintenance of AD, then clinical interventions that primarily impact PTSD should lead to
      significant improvements in craving for, and use of, alcohol. The findings of two recent
      treatment studies offer especially compelling support for this expectation. Drawing on both
      basic neuroscience research and a developing body of suggestive clinical/applied research, we
      were led to consider if the putative memory modulating properties of the adrenergic
      antagonist propranolol might have therapeutic benefits for PTSD/AD comorbid individuals.
      Thus, the proposed study will test the hypothesis that the strategic administration of
      propranolol coupled with the elicitation/retrieval of trauma-related memories will dampen
      emotional distress, alcohol craving and cue reactivity during subsequent exposure to trauma-
      and alcohol-related cues. A two-week follow-up laboratory session and clinical assessment
      will permit us to evaluate whether treatment benefits are maintained over time and if there
      are any changes in alcohol use and PTSD symptomatology.
