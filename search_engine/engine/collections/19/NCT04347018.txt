      in the BRIUS group when compared to the full fixed appliance group.

      The secondary aim of the study is to identify any difference in discomfort experienced by the
      patients when undergoing treatment using the two appliances

      The investigators also aim to quantify the extent of tooth movement that is achieved through
      each appliance within a given time frame
