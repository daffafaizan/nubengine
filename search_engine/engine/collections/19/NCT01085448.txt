      program of stabilization exercises has been a struggle for the physical therapy profession.
      While changes in trunk muscle recruitment and motor control have been linked to patients with
      chronic low back pain and hypothesized to be adaptations for spinal instability, this has not
      been systematically established. However, a connection between spinal instability, poor trunk
      motor control, and low back pain is plausible. The real problem lies with the clinical
      identification of the subgroup of patients in either the acute or chronic phases of low back
      dysfunction who would most benefit from this approach to intervention.

      In creating their preliminary clinical prediction rule, Hicks et al (2005), looked at many
      variables including patient demographics and characteristics, hip and trunk motion, special
      tests for instability, and functional measures of muscle performance. However, measures of
      the performance of core stabilizing muscles and assessment of trunk dynamic control/
      coordination were not included as potential variables. The aim of this study is to determine
      if assessment of additional measures of trunk neuromuscular control will improve the ability
      to identify patients with low back pain who successfully respond to trunk stabilization
      exercises.
