      1. To investigate whether in PDD and DLB th specific disturbances in the basal ganglia
      thalamocortical network, measured through the Electroencephalography (EEG) frequency
      analysis, are ameliorated by armodafinil.

      Our main hypothesis is that armodafinil can restore the attention and improve cognitive
      disturbances in PDD and DLB, through a specific effect on striatal-thalamo-cortical activity.
