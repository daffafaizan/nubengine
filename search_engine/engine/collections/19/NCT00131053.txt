      that for pediatric ALL. It is regarded that the prognostic diversity is attributable to
      several differences between adults and children with respect to biological characteristics of
      leukemic cells, tolerance to anticancer drugs, treatment itself, and so on. It has been
      reported that adolescent ALL patients who were treated according to the pediatric protocol
      had a significantly better survival than those who were treated according to the adult
      protocol, indicating that the difference of treatment may be of considerable importance. To
      test the hypothesis, the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) has planned a phase 2 study
      to treat younger ALL patients who are negative for BCR-ABL with the pediatric regimen which
      was used by the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study. Those who are positive for
      BCR-ABL can participate in a separate protocol. The regimen is especially characterized by
      dose-intensified L-asparaginase, high-dose methotrexate, and intensified maintenance therapy.
