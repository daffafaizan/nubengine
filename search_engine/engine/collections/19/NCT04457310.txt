    
      This study proposes to examine the effects of PF-06412562, a dopamine-1 receptor partial
      agonist, on the neural signal of brain regions involved in cognition in patients with
      schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The primary objective of this study is to
      understand the neural circuit targets of this compound as it relates to improving cognition
      in schizophrenia, using a spatial working memory task (sWM). The secondary objective will
      quantify dose-related drug effects on sWM precision based on behavioral data collected during
      scanning and examine effects on functional connectivity.

      All patients will be psychiatrically stable with early course (psychotic symptom onset within
      the past 5 years) schizophrenia spectrum disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder, or schizophreniform disorder) and will have working memory deficits (defined as
      below average performance on the letter n-back task of the PennCNB battery). As part of the
      study, they will receive oral administration of specified doses of PF-06412562, in a random
      order with repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing during those
      visits. The most common side effects of this compound are nausea and headache. This is a
      multi-site study that requires the efforts of 4 study sites in total (Columbia, State
      University of New York Stony Brook, UPenn, and Yale).
