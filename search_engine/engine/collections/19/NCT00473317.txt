      to measure your blood levels of Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Each subject will wear a
      swimming suit and be exposed to sunlight for 30 minutes total (15 minutes lying on back, 15
      minutes lying on stomach).We will draw blood for Vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D on days
      1,2,3,5, and 7 after sunlight exposure. There will be six blood draws for a total of 102 cc
      of blood drawn (about 3 Â½ teaspoons drawn each time).
