      in the prophylactic treatment. However, lithium's side effects are considerable. Thus the
      interest in developing alternatives to lithium has increased, and various antiepileptic drugs
      have been studied. Among these, lamotrigine, which generally is well tolerated, has been
      evaluated in industry generated trials. However, for various reasons, the generalisability of
      the results from these studies is limited. Also the follow-up time is limited. This study is
      a pragmatic effectiveness study, overcoming some of these limitations, and comparing
      lamotrigine with that of lithium in terms of their potentials for preventing new episodes in
      patients with bipolar disorder.
