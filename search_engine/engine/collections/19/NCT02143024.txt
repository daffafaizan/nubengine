      depressed older men-family member dyads (18 intervention and 6 controls). The purpose of the
      RCT is to test the acceptability of the intervention, as well as the feasibility of the study
      methods. Patients from the RCT will be identified from a family practice clinic based on
      their scores on the PHQ-9 as well as additional inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once they
      and their family member have agreed to participate, patients will be randomized either to the
      family based intervention or a usual care control condition augmented by family
      psychoeducation. The investigators will recruit English and Spanish speaking age 60 and above
      older men from SJGH who have 1) significant depressive symptoms (i.e. PHQ > 15, 2) have at
      least one criteria A symptom (depressed mood or anhedonia), 3) depression-related functional
      impairment) and 4) an adult family member willing to participate in the study. We have chosen
      a higher cut-off to minimize false positives. We will exclude psychotic, demented or
      institutionalized men. After enrollment, 24 dyads (i.e. older man and family member) will be
      randomized one of two groups: intervention or usual care augmented by written
      psychoeducational materials on depression. Dyads will be randomized to achieve a 2:1 ratio of
      intervention versus usual care dyads (i.e. 18 intervention and 6 control dyads). To ensure
      adequate numbers of ethnic minority patients in each arm of the trial, we will conduct a
      stratified randomization such that each arm of the RCT is 50% English language preferring and
      50% Spanish language preferring (i.e. 3 in control and 9 in intervention arm). The research
      assistant will conduct subject assessment at baseline, 1-month, 3-months and 6 months.
