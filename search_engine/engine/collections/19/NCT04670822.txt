      relapse by breastfeeding promotion from late pregnancy to 6 months postpartum. The
      investigators will enroll 60 pregnant women who successfully quit smoking within 3 months
      before or during this pregnancy (<28 weeks). All participants will receive breastfeeding
      education during late pregnancy. Right after delivery, participants who are still smoking
      abstinent will be randomized into either the breastfeeding intervention group (N=30) or the
      attention placebo control group (N=30). The intervention group will receive multicomponent
      interventions consisting of postnatal lactation counseling, family/peer/employer support,
      contingent financial incentives, and early limited formula milk via syringe (optional for
      at-risk infants). The control group will receive counseling and support focusing on general
      infant care with attention and compensation similar to the intervention group. The primary
      outcomes are rates of postpartum smoking relapse verified by urine cotinine test.

      Specific Aim 1 is to examine the efficacy of breastfeeding promotion intervention on
      postpartum smoking relapse. Specific Aim 2 is to collect preliminary data regarding potential
      mediating mechanisms: increases in lactation hormones (plasma oxytocin and prolactin),
      reductions in stress and negative affect, and enhancing mother-infant bonding and maternal
      motivation to protect the infant from secondhand smoke exposure. This innovative and feasible
      pilot study can yield promising preliminary data to strongly support our future application
      of a NIH R01 grant proposal that has the potential to reduce smoking-related harms to both
      the mother and the infant, and maximize the protective effects of breastfeeding on infant
      health and development.
