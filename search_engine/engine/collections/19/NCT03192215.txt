    
      ARCADIA is a multicenter, biomarker-driven, randomized, double-blind, active-control, phase 3
      clinical trial of apixaban versus aspirin in patients who have evidence of atrial cardiopathy
      and a recent stroke of unknown cause. Eleven hundred subjects will be recruited over 2.5
      years at 120 sites in the NINDS StrokeNet consortium. Subjects will be followed for a minimum
      of 1.5 years and a maximum of 7 years for the primary efficacy outcome of recurrent stroke
      and the primary safety outcomes of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and major hemorrhage
      other than intracranial hemorrhage.
