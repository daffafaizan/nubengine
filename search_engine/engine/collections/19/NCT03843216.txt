      Scoliosis has never been checked, the investigators studied a prospectively collected
      multicenter cohort with the aim to verify in the different clinical situations 1) the
      existence, characteristics and determinants of EBPCA; 2) the obtained results and their
      determinant; 3) the rate of over- and under-treatment and their determinants. These results
      are expected to check the actual evidence in everyday clinic, to provide a benchmark for
      future studies, and to inform guidelines producers and consequently health policy in high
      income countries, but also and particularly in low-middle income countries where surgery is
      difficult due to the high costs, and missing competences and structures.
