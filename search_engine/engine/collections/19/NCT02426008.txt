      suppose that adding growth factors ( Insulin-like growth factor I, Insulin-like growth factor
      II, transforming growth factor-beta and epidermal growth factor ) as a promoting growth
      factors to Lifeglobal culture media might improve embryo development in vitro so we decide to
      design a trial to compare the embryogenesis by sibling Oocytes of the same patient between to
      arm of the same culture media and the same culture condition but with one arm with growth
      factors and the other is traditional one and closely monitor the outcome within the 2 arms
      and record the results.
