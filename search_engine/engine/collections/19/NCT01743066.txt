      accumulation of arsenic within the cell. We usually give emphasis on the skin manifestations
      (melanosis and keratosis) of arsenicosis that is diagnosed first. Other manifestations remain
      un-diagnosed or diagnosed later. The severe form is the development of cancer in different
      organs mainly skin, lungs and urinary bladder. To understand the pathophysiology of the
      development of clinical manifestations appearing in the skin first, we need to understand
      interior of cells other than skin. One of the dietary supplements, vitamin E is found to be
      effective in improving the clinical signs/symptoms of melanosis and keratosis. Buccal cells
      are also exposed to arsenic and easy to collect. To understand the pathogenesis, we need to
      know the levels of vitamin E in patients of arsenicosis and if changes, what happens when
      supplemented with vitamin E. The buccal cells and serum of 20 patients will be collected for
      the estimation of vitamin E both before and after supplementation with vitamin E (200 IU,
      caplet) daily orally for 20 weeks. Similar samples will be collected from 20 arsenic exposed
      controls and 20 healthy volunteers for comparison.
