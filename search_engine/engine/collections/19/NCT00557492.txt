      gemcitabine (1500 mg/m2 at 10 mg/kg/min) in combination with sequential rapid fractionation
      radiotherapy (30 Gy total) in the preoperative treatment of potentially-resectable subjects
      with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of
      margin negative surgical resection (R0 resection rate) and the rate of complete pathological
      response in patients with resected pancreas cancer. The overall goal of this study is to
      determine the merit of this novel regimen for further study in a Phase III trial examining
      time to progression and overall survival. Based on the need for 48 evaluable subjects to
      evaluate the primary endpoints, the study will be opened with a target accrual of 60 subjects
      given an expected 20% rate of attrition observed in prior studies of subjects with pancreas
      cancer at UPCI.
