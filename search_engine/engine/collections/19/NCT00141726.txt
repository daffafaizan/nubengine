      transplant. In some cases, these breathing problems develop without any signs of germs or
      infection in the lungs. The name for this type of breathing problem is called "Sub-Acute Lung
      Injury". Sub-acute lung injury often develops many months, even years following a bone marrow
      transplant. It is often characterized by shortness of breath, cough, wheezing and fatigue.

      Sub-acute lung injury can either lead to the formation of scar tissue in the lungs (making it
      difficult to take deep breaths), or it can cause the lungs to get weak (making people feel
      out of breath easily). Approximately 25 - 50% of patients with sub-acute lung injury may
      eventually die from the damage in their lungs. Typically, such patients die from infections
      that develop inside the damaged lungs.

      In this study, treatment with an experimental drug called Etanercept will be used. (Enbrel).
      The physicians feel there is the possibility that Etanercept may help improve breathing.
      Breathing ability will be assessed prior to treatment as well as during and after treatment
      so that comparisons can be made.
