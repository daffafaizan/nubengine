    
      To characterise the safety and tolerability of enadenotucirev administered in combination
      with nivolumab in subjects with metastatic or advanced epithelial tumours.

      A dose escalation phase is conducted in subjects with solid tumors of epithelial origin not
      responding to standard therapy to establish the MTD/MFD and optimum dosing schedule of the
      enadenotucirev and nivolumab combination treatment.

      A dose expansion phase will further outline the dose level and schedule of enadenotucirev and
      nivolumab combination treatment and investigate signals of efficacy in three cohorts of
      subjects with specific epithelial tumour types.
