      development of type 2 diabetes. The molecular connections are unresolved but high levels of
      free fatty acids and triglyceride is probably involved. Diabetic subjects and to a lesser
      extent obese subjects have increased triglyceride levels, this could be due to an abnormal
      turnover of VLDL-TG. It is not yet investigated whether VLDL-TG kinetics changes during
      pharmacological antilipolysis. Using the aseptic ex-vivo labeling technique (developed in our
      laboratories) we will investigate this issue in sedentary healthy men. After a 3 hour basal
      period subjects will exercise on a bike for 60 minutes at 60% of VO2max. In both basal and
      exercise period one muscle and one fat biopsy will be obtained, further blood samples will be
      drawn to examine FFA and VLDL-TG metabolism etc..

      This new knowledge will contribute to the understanding of metabolic disorders like type 2
      diabetes and obesity.
