    
      Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to AMD is the leading cause of irreversible, severe
      vision loss in people 55 years and older in the developed world. TG100801 is a potent
      inhibitor of vascular growth endothelial factor (VEGF) and other kinases that contribute to
      CNV and macular edema. Animal models have demonstrated the ability of TG100801 to inhibit
      angiogenesis, vascular leak, and inflammation. TG100801 is being developed as a topical (eye
      drop) therapy for treatment of CNV due to AMD.

      The primary objective of this multicenter, open-label, randomized, pilot study is to evaluate
      the effects of 30 days of dosing with two dose levels of TG100801 on central retinal/lesion
      thickness, as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). The safety of TG100801 in
      patients with AMD also will be evaluated.
