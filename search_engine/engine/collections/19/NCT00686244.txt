      with metabolic syndrome with a new combination of personal and IT-based training specially
      designed f√ºr obese people with risk factors. Procedures that are similar for all participants
      are summarized in a training program whereas individual aspects of physical activity like
      initial education and exercise tests are still performed by doctors and trainers. Before and
      after three months of training anthropometric parameters, laboratory and exercise capacity
      are examined and analyzed. The intervention group is characterized by a predetermined
      exercise program whereas the control group is allowed to practise without detailed
      instructions. The practicability and the effect on health status of the combined personal and
      IT-based training in the intervention group is compared with the independent training of the
      control group. After 6 months and again after 12 months the measurements are repeated to
      evaluate a lasting effect of the program.
