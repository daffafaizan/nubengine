      surgical site complications in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The past
      forty years of research in the UCSF Wound Healing Laboratory have solidified the following
      observations:

        1. without adequate oxygen delivery, many processes of wound healing cannot proceed
           normally, particularly resistance to infection, collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and
           inflammation; and

        2. hypoxic conditions, unfortunately, are common in chronic and acute wounds, and often
           result from subcutaneous vasoconstriction.

      Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activators and other vasoconstrictors have been shown to
      produce wound hypoxia. Activation of the SNS by any means, including pain and anxiety, causes
      vasoconstriction and impairs oxygen delivery. Simple means that limit SNS activity have been
      shown to increase perfusion and oxygen tension, and thereby facilitate wound healing. Many
      preliminary studies have shown that acupuncture decreases SNS activation, pain, and anxiety.
      In addition, there is evidence that acupuncture enhances circulation of blood. We therefore
      hypothesize that acupuncture will facilitate wound healing. We aim to quantify changes in
      anxiety, pain, stress hormones, and perfusion and oxygenation induced by these interventions,
      as well as wound healing outcomes, including infection and other wound complications.
