      require ICU care for a certain period. For those patients, the side effects of ICU care such
      as intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW), critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) are
      well known. Therefore, we access the safety and efficacy of early rehabilitation program
      (ERP) in liver transplant recipients.

      Patients were retrospectively selected for the Pre-ERP group (2014.05-2014.10) and for the
      Post-ERP group (2015.10-2016.03). During the period of 6 months, 136 patients and 100
      patients underwent LT, and 65, 62 patients were enrolled after exclusion. Forty patients from
      the each group were compared after propensity score matching (PSM).
