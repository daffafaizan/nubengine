    
      A prospective cohort study, conducted in Canada, to prospectively evaluate whether the
      combination of clinicopathological criteria and the Oncotype DX DCIS score can identify a
      group of women at very low risk of local recurrence following breast conserving surgery who
      do not require breast radiation therapy. We plan to screen 809 consenting women who will have
      their tumour tissue specimen sent to Exact Sciences to assess their DCIS score. We anticipate
      that 526 women will have an Oncotype DX DCIS score <39 and a predicted 10-year risk of local
      recurrence <10%, these patients will be enrolled and followed as part of the study.

      At each centre, all patients with DCIS referred to radiation oncology will be documented.
      When a physician identifies an eligible patient, the patient will be approached by the
      referring physician or delegate to voluntarily provide informed consent to participate in
      this study. Consenting patients will be registered through the Ontario Clinical Oncology
      Group's (OCOG) web-based registration system. A two-step registration/enrollment process will
      be implemented.

      Data related to the patient demographics, surgery details, tumour characteristics and ECOG
      performance will be collected. The patient's tumour specimen will be sent for analysis to
      Exact Sciences. The DCIS score results will be sent to the referring physician. OCOG will
      also receive the DCIS score results. Patients will be followed every 6 months for the first 2
      years and then yearly up to 10 years. Bilateral mammograms will be performed 6 months after
      BCS and then annually. The study data will be verified by source documentation.
