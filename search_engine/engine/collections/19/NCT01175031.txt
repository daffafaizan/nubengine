    
      Study Objectives: To compare a positive airway pressure (PAP) device's detection of
      respiratory events and airway status during device detected apneas with events scored on
      simultaneous polysomnography (PSG).

      Design: Prospective PSGs of patients with sleep apnea using a new-generation PAP device.

      Settings: Four clinical and academic sleep centers.

      Patients: Forty-five patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and complex sleep apnea
      (Comp SA) performed a PSG on PAP levels adjusted to induce respiratory events.

      Interventions: None.
