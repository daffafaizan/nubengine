      cancer-related death, in the United States. Unfortunately, patients often present late in the
      course of the disease. Accordingly, the 1- year survival rate is approximately 20%, and the
      5-year survival rate is less than 4%. Even in patients with local disease who are surgical
      candidates, survival at five years remains only 10-25%. Staging for pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      typically utilizes the TNM classification, where "T" represents tumor size, "N" represents
      regional lymph node metastasis, and "M" represents distant metastasis. This type of staging
      can usually only be done after operative resection. Unfortunately, up to 25% of patients are
      found to be unresectable at the time of surgical exploration. This is most often due to local
      invasion or metastatic disease. Local microscopic invasion is associated with recurrence of
      pancreatic cancer after pancreatic resection. Comprehensive data on the patterns of local
      invasion by pancreatic cancer have not been published. The investigators believe that it
      would be beneficial to investigate the frequency of the various methods of local invasion of
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A clearer understanding of the natural history of local invasion
      could potentially lead to a better determination of what constitutes unresectability.
