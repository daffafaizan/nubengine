      therapy and/or close observation alone in patients who present with ADH on core needle biopsy
      of the breast. An alternate (non-inferior) strategy for management may be possible, and may
      be associated with improved quality of life and fewer complications, and lower overall costs.
      Although several researchers have suggested a clinical trial to investigate this idea this
      would be the first time it has been done, and could therefore be practice changing.
