      was shown. Several patients of the university hospital TÃ¼bingen with Bardet-Biedl-Syndrome
      and Metformin therapy due to their adipositas reported a subjective improvement of the visual
      acuity which was confirmed by opthalmologic tests.

      This will be checked in a prospective pilot study without control group including children
      and young adults (10-25 years old) diagnosed with Bardet-Biedl syndrome and treated with
      Metformin for their adipositas. Therefore a possible additional effect of Metformin on visual
      acuity will be evaluated under controlled conditions.
