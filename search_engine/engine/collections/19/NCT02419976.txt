      assess for fasting and non-fasting states in individuals scheduled for routine endoscopy. In
      non-fasting individuals, the risk of a sedation related complication such as aspiration
      increases and often the procedure must be aborted and repeated on another day following more
      prolonged fasting and medication administration. This adds to increased cost and delay to
      patient care.
