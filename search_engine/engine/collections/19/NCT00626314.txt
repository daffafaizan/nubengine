      there is a need for alternative therapies. Autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation has
      been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies to be a safe and effective treatment of heart
      failure. Initial clinical studies have shown that autologous myoblasts can be delivered into
      infracted myocardium by both direct epicardial and endomyocardial injection. However,
      autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation via percutaneous endomyocardial injection has
      the potential to play a significant role in such congestive heart failure patients without
      the need for surgical risk and general anesthesia. Thus, a Phase 2 clinical trial is proposed
      in order to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous myoblast delivered by endomyocardial
      injection for the treatment congestive heart failure.
