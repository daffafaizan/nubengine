      bevacizumab with chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic and recurrent non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer. We try to evaluate the safety of bevacizumab in real life
      population with lung cancer. For patients with performance status 0-1 platinum based
      chemotherapy was recommended and acceptable doses of bevacizumab was either 7.5 or 15 mg/kgr.
      Safety profile was evaluated with Common Toxicity criteria v 3.0. Especially for bevacizumab
      we evaluate specific situations as thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, hypertension,
      albuminuria, and gastrointestinal disorders.
