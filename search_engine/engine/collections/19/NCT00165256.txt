           and radiation therapy or breast-conserving surgery alone. The purpose of this study is
           to evaluate whether localized low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, diagnosed with modern
           mammography and careful pathologic evaluation, could be treated with wide excision alone
           (omission of radiation therapy) and result in acceptably low local recurrence rates.

        -  Follow-up consists of physical examinations at least every 6 months by the surgeon or
           radiation oncologist. Mammograms of the affected breast will be obtained every 6 months
           for 5 years and then annually. Mammograms of the unaffected breast will be performed
           annually.
