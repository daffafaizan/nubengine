      Informed consent will be obtained from the patient. The participant (anesthesiologist,
      resident, nurse, or RT) will mark the center of the cricoid cartilage with the patient in the
      sniffing position, using fluorescent "invisible" ink. Another anesthesiologist who is expert
      in using ultrasound will find the proximal and distal margins of the cricoid cartilage an
      will draw a line at the middle of the 2 margins. Evaluation of the participant's assessment
      will be considered accurate if it falls within 5 mm from the ultrasound's measured line .The
      assessor will also be asked to score the ease of cricoid cartilage palpation between 1 to 10
      using a visual analog scoring (VAS) scale. Total time taken for palpation will also be
      measured.
