      effect of one daily meal of trout fed with a vegetable based feed are compared with that of
      trout fed with marine feed (estimated intake of n-3 LCPUFA 2.6 g/day) and a standard Danish
      diet with poultry. Men are randomised to one of the three groups. Red blood cell fatty acid
      composition, classical cardiovascular disease (CVD)-risk markers (blood pressure and plasma
      lipid profile), newer CVD-markers (arterial compliance and plasma markers of endothelial
      function and inflammation) and plasma proteome analysis are measured at the beginning and end
      of the intervention period.
