      SARS-CoV-2 who have recovered from acute illness. The overall objective of the study is to
      investigate the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include the
      pre-existence and development of medical conditions, measures of immune activation and
      inflammation, changes in immunologic function, and variability in host responses. There will
      be a specific focus on demographic differences including age, gender, and race.

      Enrolled volunteers are seen at San Francisco General Hospital at baseline, monthly for 3
      months and then every 3 months for up to 2 years. Visits include a detailed interview, saliva
      collection, and a blood draw. Baseline visits take approximately 90 minutes, and follow up
      visits take approximately 20-40 minutes. No personal identifiers are used for specimen bank
      samples.
