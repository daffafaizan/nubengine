      I. To utilize a standardized battery of age-appropriate neuropsychological and behavioral
      tests in conjunction with Children's Oncology Group (COG) Phase II and III clinical trials to
      evaluate cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral functioning over time.

      II. To institute procedures to ensure a consistent, streamlined, and efficient administration
      of the neuropsychological/behavioral tests in a cooperative group setting in order to
      maximize compliance with a standardized assessment battery conducted at 3 standardized time
      points.

      OUTLINE:

      Parent and child participants complete the COG Standard Neuropsychological and Behavioral
      Battery at approximately 9, 30, and 60 months post-diagnosis in a 1-2 hour testing session
      conducted by a neuropsychologist or psychologist. The Battery consists of measures of
      intelligence, processing speed, attention, memory, language preference,
      behavioral/social/emotional function, executive function, adaptive function, and quality of
      life.
