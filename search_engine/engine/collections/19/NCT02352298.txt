      using Dario single use lancet. Additional fingerstick with dedicated disposable lancets will
      be used to collect sufficient capillary fresh blood to be analyzed by the YSI 2300 STAT Plus
      analyzer. Additional fingersticks may be necessary if volume of blood from first fingerstick
      is insufficient.
