      (Photofrin) and controlled uniform laser light in patients with carcinoma in situ in
      Barrett's esophagus or severe dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus. II. Evaluate the safety of
      the treatment on this patient.

      OUTLINE: This is a noncomparative study. PDT consists of IV porfimer sodium followed 40-50
      hours later by laser red light delivered by optic fibers passed through the biopsy channel of
      an endoscope. Retreatment, if necessary, consists of up to 3 injections at least 30 days
      apart and up to 6 laser light treatments, with a maximum of 2 following each injection.
      Patients are followed monthly for 4 months, and then periodically for at least 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
