      pharmacokinetics and efficacy, of TAK-228 in combination with TAK-117 when administered to
      adult participants with advanced nonhematologic malignancies.

      The study enrolled 101 patients. The study consisted of 2 phases: an escalation stage
      followed by an expansion stage. Participants in escalation stage were assigned to the
      following treatment arms:

        -  Dose escalation treatment arm A: TAK-228 2 or 4 mg capsule

        -  Dose escalation treatment arm B: TAK-228 3, 4, 6 or 8 mg capsule

        -  Dose escalation treatment arm C: TAK-228 3 mg capsule

      Upon completion of the escalation stage, 1 combination treatment regimen was selected for
      further safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and mutual drug-drug interaction
      characterization in the expansion stage. During treatment, participants in both stages
      received TAK-228 and TAK-117 capsules at prespecified doses in repeated 28-day cycles.

      This multi-center trial conducted in the United States, United Kingdom and Spain. The overall
      time to participate in this study was approximately 68 weeks. Participants made multiple
      visits to the clinic, and a final visit after 30 days after last dose of study drug.
