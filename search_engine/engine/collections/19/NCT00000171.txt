      occurring in 45 percent of patients. These nocturnal awakenings and agitation lead to
      considerable burden for caregivers and frequently lead families to the decision of nursing
      home placement. The proposed study is a randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo
      controlled, clinical trial. Placebo will be compared with two doses of melatonin: a 2.5 mg,
      slow- release preparation and a 10 mg immediate release preparation. One hundred and fifty
      community-residing AD patients with disrupted sleep will be recruited. Included subjects will
      meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD. Prior to study entry, disrupted sleep will be
      documented by clinical history and by 1 to 2 weeks of recording using wrist activity
      monitors. The treatment period will last 8 weeks. Rest/activity patterns will be recorded by
      wrist activity monitors. The primary outcome measure will be the change in nocturnal sleep
      time from baseline to the end of the treatment phase.

      Other outcomes also will be examined, including the time awake after sleep onset, sleep
      latency, sleep efficiency, daytime agitation, and changes in cognition. The relative
      effectiveness of high and low dose melatonin will be assessed. Adverse events and side
      effects will be compared by treatment. This study should provide the data necessary to
      determine whether melatonin is a safe and effective treatment for disrupted sleep associated
      with AD.
