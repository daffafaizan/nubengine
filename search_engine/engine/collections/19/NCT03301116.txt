      availability and the evidence for physical activity programs that are safe and appropriate
      for home-bound older adults at risk for nursing home admission are limited. The current
      project aims to examine the effectiveness of a safe physical activity program, led by home
      care aides who regularly help hard-to-reach older home care clients with housekeeping and
      routine personal care services in the home. The primary aim is to test whether the safe
      physical activity program with a built-in motivational enhancement component, performed in a
      seated position, preserves the function and well-being of home care clients. The secondary
      aim is to understand for whom the program is efficacious, the extent to which the program can
      reach the target population, the extent to which participants drop out of the program, the
      extent to which program participants maintain the behavioral change introduced by the
      intervention, and what the program's cost-effectiveness is. Building on a pilot project that
      demonstrated the program's feasibility in a large home care program funded by the state and
      Medicaid, this randomized controlled trial will inform future expansion of the physical
      activity program into real-world home care settings.
