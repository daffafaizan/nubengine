    
      PeproStat is a new class of topical haemostatic agent composed of recombinant human albumin
      (rHA) conjugated with fibrinogen-binding peptides. The conjugate polymerises fibrinogen into
      a fibrin-like clot without the need for thrombin.

      PeproStat is formulated in a liquid, and is soaked into a haemostatic gelatin sponge in the
      operating theatre, and applied directly to the site of bleeding. The gelatin sponge
      (Spongostan ) is an approved "passive" haemostat i.e., PeproStat is an adjunct to a passive
      haemostat.

      The study is designed in a 2:1 randomization (verum:placebo) to investigate the efficacy in
      terms of Time to hemostasis, mean (mTTH) at the primary target bleed site (TBS), measured in
      minutes (min) from the start of treatment application (TxStart) at the TBS to the achievement
      of hemostasis at that site or to the end of the 10-minute assessment period if hemostasis has
      not yet been achieved.
