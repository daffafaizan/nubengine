      proteins induce a protective immune response in mice and allow high survival rates following
      challenge with highly virulent doses of either Candida or S. aureus. Als3 (the antigen in the
      NDV-3 investigational vaccine) is the most effective member of the Als protein family in
      protecting mice from challenge with either Candida or S. aureus. The first Phase 1 study
      enrolled 40 healthy subjects that received placebo (N=10), 1 dose (N=30) or 2 doses (N=19) of
      the NDV-3 vaccine administered intramuscularly (IM). The vaccine was well tolerated and
      highly immunogenic. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      one dose of NDV-3 vaccine formulated with and without alum given IM and also a lower dose
      without alum given intradermally (ID). Subjects will have follow-up visits to assess the
      safety tolerability and immune responses at selected time points up to 90 days
      post-vaccination.
