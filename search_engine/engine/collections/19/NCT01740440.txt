    
      Evaluate the efficacy of the BMR Face device in relation to facial appearance at 12 weeks
      compared to baseline. Efficacy will be assessed by overall facial improvement assessed live
      by the Investigator and a subject assessment of facial appearance including the Global
      Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS).

      The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale is a five-grade subjective test. The physician and
      patient independently describe the degree of improvement in facial appearance. Possible
      responses were (1) Significantly marked improvement, (2) marked improvement, (3) moderate
      improvement, (4) slight improvement, (5) no improvement

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate safety and further evaluate the subject's and
      investigator's satisfaction (both a live and blinded assessor) with the BMR Face treatment.
