    
      A phase III, Randomized, control study to compare the immunogenicity and safety of MRVAC
      vaccine produced by POLYVAC with MR vaccine licensed in Vietnam produced by Serum Institute,
      India.

        1. Evaluate the safety of MRVAC produced by POLYVAC on Healthy Vietnamese volunteers from 1
           - 45 years old.

           Evaluate the safety by the ratio of participants having following symptom/signs:

             -  The ratio of immediate adverse events (local adverse events and systemic adverse
                events), within 30 minutes after vaccination.

             -  The ratio of participants having local and systemic adverse events (including
                unexpected adverse events) occur within 28 days after vaccination.

             -  The ratio of serious adverse events (SAEs) occur from day 0 to day 28 after
                vaccination. (SAEs).

        2. Evaluate the immunogenicity of MRVAC produced by POLYVAC on the healthy volunteers from
           1 - 45 years.

             -  The rate of sero-conversion;

             -  GMT (Geomatric mean Antibody titer) after vaccination.

        3. Comparison the safety and immunogenicity between MRVAC and control vaccine.
