      liver, but humans need to receive choline through the diet or by supplementation for proper
      health. Pregnancy and lactation are times when demand for choline is especially high. Infant
      formula not made from cow's milk is therefore supplemented with choline. Choline is therefore
      widely used. It is normally added to food products as a salt. However, if choline is present
      in a natural form, bound to phospholipids, it may be more efficiently absorbed.
      Docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) are also bound to these phospholipids.

      The primary objective is determine choline uptake and bioavailability after consumption of a
      test shake with phospholipid-bound choline (and DHA), and to compare this to a control shake
      with choline added as a salt (and DHA added as an oil). Secondary objective is to compare the
      uptake and bioavailability of DHA after the two shakes.

      The study is a cross-over, double blind, controlled trial in which study participants will
      visit the research facility on two occasions under fasting conditions. Subjects will receive
      two different choline products in randomized order with a washout period of one week. Blood
      will be collected via a catheter before and up-to 6 hours after choline consumption.
