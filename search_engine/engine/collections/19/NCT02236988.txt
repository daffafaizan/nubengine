    
      This will be a single-center, open-label, crossover, single modified-release-dose, study in
      male subjects to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of prototype modified-release formulations
      compared to the reference immediate-release apremilast formulation. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to a treatment sequence. A total of up to 8 test MR formulations may be evaluated.

      Group 1: 4-sequence, 4-period to compare three modified-release prototypes with the reference
      immediate-release formulation. A total of 16 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12
      subjects who complete all 4 periods.

      One of two scenarios will be conducted in the second group depending on the availability of
      the modified-release formulations.

      Group 2/Scenario 1: This is a 4-sequence, 4-period design identical to Group 1. This will
      occur if all three modified-release formulations planned for Group 2 are available. A total
      of 16 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 4 periods.

      Group 2/Scenario 2: This is a 6-sequence, 3-period design. This will occur if only two
      modified-release formulations are tested in Group 2. A total of 18 subjects will be enrolled
      to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 3 periods.

      A third group may be enrolled to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of one or two additional
      prototype formulations (after the initial six) compared to the immediate-release formulation.
      One of two scenarios will be conducted in the third group depending on the availability of
      the prototype formulations.

      Group 3/Scenario 1: This is a 2-sequence, 2-period design that will be used if one test
      formulation is available. A total of 14 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 12
      subjects who complete both periods.

      Group 3/Scenario 2: This is a 6-sequence, 3-period design identical to Group 2/Scenario 2
      above. This will occur if two test formulations are available. A total of 18 subjects will be
      enrolled to obtain at least 12 subjects who complete all 3 periods.

      A fourth group may be enrolled to evaluate the PK of four additional prototype formulations
      compared to the IR formulation.

      Group 4: This is a 10-sequence, 5-period William Square design to compare four MR prototypes
      with the reference IR formulation. A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least
      20 subjects who complete all 5 periods.
