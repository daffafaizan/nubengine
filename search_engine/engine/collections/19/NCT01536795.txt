    
      Forty-eight patients (48) with Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis will be randomly allocated
      to WR279396 treatment once a day for 20 days with an optimized polyurethane dressing
      (occlusion) (24 patients), or without occlusion (24 patients). All patients will be rescued
      with the standard of care accepted in Tunisia, if the patient is not cured. The active
      ingredients of WR279396 are two aminoglycosides - paromomycin sulphate (15%) and gentamicin
      sulphate (0.5%) - in a base (AQIC).

      Each subject will be followed for clinical cure for 90 days after the initiation of
      treatment. Cure is defined as 100% reepithelialization without relapse by 3 months.

      Tolerance will be evaluated by local adverse reactions and by laboratory signs of systemic
      events.

      In addition to the clinical evaluation of the CL lesions, the following parameters/clinical
      healing surrogates will be investigated:

        1. parasite load will be determined in superficial and deep lesional dermis samples at D0
           and D10. The mean parasite reduction ratio (parasite load at D10/parasite load at D0) in
           each group will be compared;

        2. aminoglycoside concentrations in superficial and deep infiltrated dermis in each group
           will be compared.
