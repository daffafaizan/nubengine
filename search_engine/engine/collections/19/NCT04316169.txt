    
      Part 1: 3+3 dose escalation of HCQ combined with abemaciclib in advanced solid tumors.

      Part 2: HCQ at top-dose level from part one is combined with abemaciclib and endocrine
      therapy in HR+/Her 2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) and divided into two cohorts based on
      prior exposure to endocrine therapy.

      Primary Objective

        1. Dose-escalation cohort: To determine safety and tolerability of HCQ combined with
           abemaciclib.

        2. Dose-expansion cohort: To determine safety and tolerability of HCQ combined with
           abemaciclib and endocrine therapy in HR+/Her2- ABC.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with abemaciclib and hormone
           blockade in the dose- expansion cohort of advanced ER- positive breast cancer
           participants.

        2. To assess the clinical efficacy of HCQ in combination with abemaciclib in the dose-
           escalation cohort
