      as endoscopy with or without pinch biopsy, may cause mucosal trauma and thus alter colonic
      permeability. Additionally, the application of topical HIV microbicides (to prevent HIV
      transmission) and shearing forces associated with rectal intercourse might also adversely
      affect the epithelial layer, and thus alter colonic permeability. In order to appropriately
      interpret testing of the effects of topical HIV microbicides on the mucosal lining of the
      distal colon, it is essential to understand whether these procedures themselves, adversely
      affect the epithelial layer. If changes in permeability can be detected, this method may be
      developed to help determine microbicide distribution/toxicity in early phase studies, thus
      improving the selection of candidate microbicides for study in larger scale clinical trials.
