        -  To propose a diagnostic marker of bacteraemia based on the detection of anti-S. aureus
           by xMAP technology

        -  To evaluate the kinetics of the humoral immune response to S. aureus in patients with
           bacteraemia

        -  To evaluate the virulence of S. aureus isolated from chronic, infected wounds

        -  To enrich the NÃ®mes University Hospital biobank

        -  To evaluate the prevalence of different antibodies within each group
