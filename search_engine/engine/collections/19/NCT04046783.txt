      consecutively recruited at University Hospital of Salerno. Taking into account the number of
      C-section the study population was divided into two groups: Group A included subjects without
      a prior history of C-section, group B subjects who had already undergone previous C-section.
      At baseline after stitches removal, scars assessment was made using digital photographs and
      the validate Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). After 4 weeks, during the
      outpatient visit, women from both group A and B were asked whether had applied some natural
      products on the scars or not. In this occasion, the C-section of the women who had applied a
      patch containing allium cepa and allantoin as well as those of women who had not used any
      products (who represented the control group) were re-evaluated as at baseline. The Observers
      were blinded. One of them performed the scars assessment at baseline, the other one after 4
      weeks. During the outpatient visit an informed consent for participation was obtained by all
      the subjects costituing the study population. The participation to the study was voluntary
