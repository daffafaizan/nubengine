      I. To correlate treatment-induced changes in quantitative MRI-based biomarkers-specifically,
      those sensitive to tumor protein content (amide proton transfer asymmetry [APTasym] from
      chemical exchange saturation transfer [CEST]), cellularity (apparent diffusion coefficient
      [ADC] from diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]), and blood flow (volume transfer constant
      [K^trans] from dynamic contrast-enhanced [DCE]; cerebral blood flow [CBF] from dynamic
      susceptibility contrast [DSC])-with treatment-induced changes in tumor size, measured via
      standard anatomic MRI.

      II. To correlate treatment-induced changes in the above quantitative MRI endpoints with
      patient progression-free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo measurement of tumor protein content using CEST-MRI, cellularity using
      DWI-MRI, and blood flow using DCE-MRI and DSC-MRI within 2 weeks of treatment and at 2 and 4
      weeks after initiation of treatment.
