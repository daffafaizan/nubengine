      tracheal tube, with an ArndtÂ® blocker, in the morbidly obese patient who requires one-lung
      ventilation during surgery. The objects is to determine which device is best for intubation
      and is most effective in terms of optimal positioning of the device, of lung collapse, and
      quality of lung isolation.
