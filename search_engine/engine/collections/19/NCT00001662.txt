      of memory. It is unknown whether stimulation of these receptors in patients with Alzheimer's
      disease and dementing disorders will improve cognitive function. To determine whether
      positive modulation of AMPA receptors, active in animal models of dementia, can improve
      cognitive function in demented patients, CX516, at a dose of 900mg TID, will be administered
      orally for 12 weeks in patients with dementia. In this randomized, controlled
      proof-of-principle study, drug-induced alterations in intellectual function will be measured
      by standardized neuropsychological tests. Safety will be monitored by frequent clinical
      assessments and laboratory tests.
