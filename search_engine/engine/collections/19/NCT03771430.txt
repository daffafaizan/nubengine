    
      The study is a multidisciplinary trial testing an intervention delivered by physiotherapists.
      Up to 20% of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients continue to experience moderate/severe
      pain 12 months after TKA. While physical therapy (PT) and cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT)
      have shown promise for improving outcomes, they have not been evaluated in combination or in
      patients at risk for chronic pain after TKA. This trial will evaluate PT+CBT combined, either
      as a substitute for or as a supplement to TKA for patients at risk for chronic pain after
      TKA.

      Pilot/Feasibility study:

      The study will include a feasibility/pilot study with 15 patients to be performed from
      November 2018. The intervention and study procedures may be modified based on results from
      the feasibility/pilot study.

      Full scale Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):

      The full-scale RCT will include 282 patients scheduled for TKA. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to one of three groups: 1) non-surgical intervention (i.e., PT+CBT), 2) a
      combination of TKA with pre- and postoperative PT+CBT, or 3) A control group receiving TKA
      and usual care follow-up. Primary outcome: The Pain subscale from the KOOS. The intervention
      has the potential to improve outcomes for patients who currently obtain little benefit from
      standard TKA.
