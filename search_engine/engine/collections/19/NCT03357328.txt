      and increased daytime sleep. Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) (e.g.
      agitation, depression) are also common. Noticeably, both sleep problems and BPSD are related
      to a disturbed circadian rhythm. Light is the most important input to the circadian system,
      and exposure to sufficient daylight is important for entrainment of the circadian rhythm to
      the surroundings. Dementia patients living in nursing homes (NH) are less exposed to daylight
      than dementia patients living at home. Bright light therapy is a promising treatment in these
      patients as it may improve sleep, BPSD, and independent functioning. However, traditional
      bright light treatment has not been routinely employed in NH patients or patients with
      dementia. This may be related to difficulties in achieving adherence to the traditional
      treatment and thus the benefit of bright light therapy for people with dementia still remains
      unclear.

      DEM.LIGHT uses modern LED (light-emitting diodes) technology that enables light therapy with
      the least possible interference of the day-to-day life in NHs, as the treatment is not
      confined to a light source presupposing behavioural compliance. Ceiling-mounted LED-sources
      can be programmed in terms of timing, light intensity and colour temperature. DEM.LIGHT uses
      this to provide therapy light rooms with a dynamic light condition that better emulates
      natural light throughout the day. The study is a cluster-randomized trial evaluating the
      effect of therapy light rooms on various measures of physical and mental health in NH
      patients with dementia. Data will be collected at baseline, after 8 and 16 weeks of
      treatment, and at the end of the intervention period (24 weeks).
