      potential eligibility of subjects. Following the initial screening visit, all potential
      subjects underwent a washout period from their usual arthritis medication and returned to the
      study center for a baseline visit to verify their eligibility.

      At the completion of the baseline visit, all eligible subjects were randomly assigned to a
      treatment group and instructed on the dosing regimen for their assigned study medication.

      Subjects returned to the study center for follow-up visits after Week 1 and Week 2 of
      treatment and a final visit after Week 4 of treatment or upon discontinuation from the study.
