    
      This is a 2-part study of the safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) of single and
      repeated doses of REGN4461 in healthy participants. In Part A, healthy lean or overweight
      participants will be enrolled to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of single
      ascending intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) doses. Interim PK and safety information
      from Part A will be used to select the dose level, frequency, and mode of administration (IV
      or SC) for repeat dosing in Part B. In Part B, overweight/obese participants with body mass
      index (BMI) 25-40 kg/m2 will be enrolled to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of
      repeated doses of REGN4461 in 4 distinct cohorts defined by baseline leptin levels.
