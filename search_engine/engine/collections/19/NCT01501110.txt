      high normal levels of rT3, low or normal levels of T4 and inappropriately normal or low
      levels of TSH. These changes affect up to 75% of patients and have prognostic implications.

      Interleukin-6 (IL6) seems to have a causative role in the pathogenesis of nonthyroidal
      illness. There is evidence that the reduction in serum T3 was inversely associated with serum
      IL-6, while the rT3 have a positive association. The mechanism of action of cytokines on the
      metabolism of thyroid hormones has not been determined and the potential role of cytokines on
      the deiodases has been the focus of research.

      In a cell culture model study, IL-6 was able to suppress the conversion of T4 to T3 by
      deiodases type 1 and 2 and stimulate the inactivation of T3 by deiodase type 3, a situation
      similar to nonthyroidal illness. The use of N-acetylcysteine prevented this alterations, been
      consistent with the hypothesis that IL6 inhibits the function of the deiodases by increasing
      the oxygen reactive species and by consuming gluthathione or some gluthathione dependent
      cofactor.

      Considering the absence of human studies evaluating the use of N-acetylcysteine in
      nonthyroidal illness, the aim of this study is to investigate whether NAC has in vivo effect
      on changes of thyroid hormones.
