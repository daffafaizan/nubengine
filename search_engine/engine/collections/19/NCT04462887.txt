      would improve physical functioning and enhance psychological adjustment after receiving a
      first time ICD. The central aim of this study was to determine if individuals participating
      in a telephone nursing intervention compared to usual care demonstrated (1) improved physical
      functioning, (2) improved psychological adjustment, 3) improved knowledge related to sudden
      cardiac arrest (SCA) and the ICD, and (4) lower levels of health care use over a 3-month
      period post-ICD.
