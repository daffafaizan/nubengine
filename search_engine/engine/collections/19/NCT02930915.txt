      patients who have head-and-neck cancer are 'made to measure' and the methods currently
      employed to make them are invasive and in some cases patients' have found this to be
      particularly unpleasant. Their experience motivates research into less invasive and
      potentially more accurate techniques for their manufacture.

      To effectively develop an automatic manufacturing pipeline, and to assess the accuracy of the
      approach we need access to CT data from a cohort of patients for which we also have an
      accurate (ground truth) 3D facial model. Such a model can be acquired in a few minutes using
      a hand-held laser scanner.
