    
      Objective: The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of pre-operative
      administration of diclofenac potassium on the efficacy of inferior alveolar nerve block on
      using 2% mepivacaine anaesthetic agent in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.

      Design: Randomized double-blind controlled trial.

      Setting and conduct:

        -  Patients source: Out patients of the clinic of Endodontics at the Faculty of Oral and
           Dental Medicine, Cairo University.

        -  Patients will be clinically and radiographically examined and their eligibility will be
           assessed and preoperative pain will be measured. Eligible patients will be treated in
           one visit.

        -  Patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: experimental group (taking a 50
           mg diclofenac potassium packet) and the control group (taking a placebo packet). Each
           packet will be taken 30 minutes before starting treatment. The patient's pain will be
           assessed before local anesthetic administration using Heft- Parker Visual Analog Scale
           (HP- VAS). . After 15 minutes of the initial inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) of 1.8
           ml of 2% mepivacaine hydrochloride with 1:100000 epinephrine, the teeth will be examined
           using a cold pulp sensitivity test; in case of lip numbness together with no or mild
           pain on cold, the treatment will be initiated.

        -  During root canal treatment, no to mild pain response on HP- VAS will be considered
           success. In case of failure, supplemental anesthesia will be administered.

        -  Main outcome measures: Anesthetic success during root canal treatment using HP VAS.
