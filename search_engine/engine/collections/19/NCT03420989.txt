      syndrome, who will consume snack (enriched in seaweeds and carob) (50 g / day) vs.
      conventional snack for 8 weeks.

      All the next parameters will be measured/calculated at basal time and after 8 weeks of
      intervention. The next biochemical parameters will be measured: Total cholesterol, LDL
      cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides will be analyzed using an enzyme-colorimetric method (Roche
      Diagnostics , Mannheim, Germany). Glucose will be determined by the method of glucose oxidase
      (Glucose analyzer 2, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, California), insulin will be determined
      by Elisa (ELISA Diagnostic Corporation, Los Angeles, CA) and HOMA will be calculated by the
      formula Matthew et al. , 1985 (HOMA = (glucose * insulin) / 22.5). Body weight and fat mass
      by bioimpedance will be measured, too. Blood pressure (Systolic and diastolic blood pressure)
      will be measured, too. A diet records for 3 days and a satiety scale will be performed at the
      beginning and end of the intervention period.
