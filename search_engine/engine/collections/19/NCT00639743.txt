    
      A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre,
      parallel-group comparison trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of single i.v. bolus
      tenecteplase plus standard anticoagulation as compared with standard anticoagulation in
      normotensive patients with acute pulmonary embolism and with echocardiographic and laboratory
      evidence of right ventricular dysfunction.Patients suffering from acute pulmonary embolism
      (first symptoms occurring within 15 days) confirmed by lung scanning or a positive spiral
      computed tomogram, or a positive pulmonary angiogram, presenting with right ventricular
      dysfunction on echocardiography and tested troponin I or T positive will be included in the
      study if they have no exclusion criteria.Patients in the investigational group will receive:
      Ø Tenecteplase as a single body-weight (known or estimated) adjusted IV bolus administered
      over 5 - 10 seconds not later than 30 minutes after randomization, and not later than 2 hours
      after the diagnosis of RV dysfunction Weight (kg) Dose in mg Dose in units Dose in ml<60 30
      mg 6000 U 6 ml>60 to <70 35 mg 7000 U 7 ml>70 to <80 40 mg 8000 U 8 ml>80 to <90 45 mg 9000 U
      9 ml>90 50 mg 10000 U 10 mlØ and: concomitant therapy-Unfractionated heparin at a dose of 80
      IUxKg-1 as an intravenous bolus, followed by an infusion of 18 IUxKg-1xh-1, to be
      administered immediately after randomization in all patients for at least 48 hours following
      randomization. Beyond this period, intravenous UFH may be substituted with subcutaneous
      heparin (LMWH) treatment. The bolus will be omitted when heparin was started before
      randomisation.Patients in the control group will receive Ø placebo as a single body-weight
      (known or estimated) adjusted IV bolus administered over 5 - 10 seconds not later than 30
      minutes after randomization, and not later than 2 hours after the diagnosis of RV
      dysfunction. Weight (kg) Dose in ml<60 6 ml>60 to <70 7 ml>70 to <80 8 ml>80 to <90 9 ml>90
      10 mlØ and concomitant therapy with Unfractionated heparin
