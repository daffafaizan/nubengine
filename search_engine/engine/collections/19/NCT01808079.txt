      I. To use a genome-wide association analysis to identify novel genetic variants that confer
      susceptibility to Wilms tumor.

      II. To improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and etiology of Wilms tumor.

      III. To facilitate the identification of genetic markers that are associated with an
      increased risk of developing of Wilms tumor and/or those at risk of aggressive disease,
      relapse, additional tumors and/or cancer in their offspring.

      OUTLINE:

      Samples are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) profiling using real-time
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).
