    
      Methodology:

      This study will evaluate ASN-002 (in the dose range 0.5 to 1.5x10(11) vp/mL) with the Hh
      inhibitor vismodegib (ErivedgeÂ®). The study will initially evaluate two Arms receiving 1.0 x
      10(11) vp/injection, and following a safety review, may implement further arms in an adaptive
      study design.

      Following screening and baseline biopsies for target and non-target tumours, eligible
      subjects will be enrolled in the study.

      Cycle 1: Treatment with vismodegib (daily dose of 150 mg) for 4 weeks and ASN-002 for 3 weeks
      (i.e., three ASN-002 injections in total):

        -  Day 1 to Day 14 - vismodegib alone

        -  Day 15 - vismodegib and ASN-002

        -  Day 16 to Day 21 - vismodegib alone

        -  Day 22 - vismodegib and ASN-002

        -  Day 23 to Day 28 - vismodegib alone

        -  Day 29 - ASN-002 alone

      Clinical response will be assessed at Week 17, following which, the investigator may where
      clinically indicated, initiate Cycle 2.

      Cycle 2: Treatment with vismodegib (daily dose of 150 mg) for 4 weeks, and one further
      injection with ASN-002:

        -  Day 1 to Day 7 - vismodegib alone

        -  Day 8 - vismodegib and ASN-002

        -  Day 9 to Day 28 - vismodegib alone

      Surgical excision for all patients will occur between Week 25 and Week 33 at the
      investigators discretion, and dependent on when patient completed study treatment (1 or 2
      treatment cycles). Up to 10 BCCs to be excised including 3 target tumours. Excisions can be
      conducted over 2 visits as per Investigator's discretion.

      The Investigator may enrol eligible patients parallel into either Arm 1 or Arm 2, based on
      the number of tumours present. Up to 10 study BCC tumours (up to 3 target and up to 7
      non-target) will be selected per patient.

      Following review of at least Week 5 data for N=6 patients in Arm 1 and Arm 2, further Arms
      with varying doses of ASN-002 (in the dose range 0.5x10(11) vp or 1.5x10(11) vp) may be
      explored at the discretion of the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Vismodegib or ASN-002 may be
      evaluated as monotherapies to provide control groups to allow comparison of treatment Arms.

      Safety and clinical assessments will be performed at Weeks 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 17, 25 to 33.

      Histological response will be evaluated in all study tumours via excision between Week 25 and
      Week 33 (as per investigator's discretion).

      Six patients will be recruited to each Arm of the study, each Arm may be expanded to 12
      patients at the discretion of the SRC.
