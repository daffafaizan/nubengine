      emergency departments (EDs), neurology clinics, primary care clinics (including geriatric
      clinics), and other service providers from networks maintained by the Area Agencies on Aging
      that serve seniors in southeastern Arizona. Data will be collected in the form of bi-annual
      surveys,administrative data (from Medicare), in-depth interviews, and focus groups. Medicare
      data will be used to describe and evaluate the likelihood of being hospitalized or admitted
      to a long-term facility within two years of being diagnosed, medication adherence and
      persistence, and comparing the cost of care between the newly-diagnosed seniors with epilepsy
      and comparable seniors who do not have epilepsy. The feasibility and validity of using the
      Medicare claims data to estimate newly diagnosed epilepsy will also be assessed. Finally, the
      impact of epilepsy on health related quality of life, mental health, perceived stigma, and
      family and caregivers will also be evaluated through surveys and qualitative data collection
      methods, and ethnic differences will also be described.
