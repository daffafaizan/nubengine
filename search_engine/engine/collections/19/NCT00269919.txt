      prospective study (study following participants forward in time) of risperidone microspheres
      in participants with schizophrenia. Participants will be treated with intramuscular (into a
      muscle) injections of either 25 milligram (mg) or 37.5 mg or 50 mg of risperidone twice
      weekly, every 2 weeks for 2 years. The total duration of study will be 2 years. The efficacy
      of participants will primarily be evaluated by total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) score. Participants' quality of life and safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
