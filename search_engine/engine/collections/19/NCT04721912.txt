      the feasibility of a larger RCT in our setting that would examine prenatal probiotic use in
      Group B Strep (GBS) positive pregnant women at term. We hope to address the question of
      whether prenatal oral probiotic use, taken by healthy low risk GBS positive women from
      approximately 37 weeks gestation until the time of birth, will reduce the number of women who
      test positive for GBS at the time of admission to Labor and Delivery (L&D). In this study we
      aim to determine whether such a study is acceptable in our population, whether any adverse
      events are identified, and what barriers or confounding variables might exist to probiotic
      use at term. We will also look at whether probiotic use had any reported effect on maternal
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.
