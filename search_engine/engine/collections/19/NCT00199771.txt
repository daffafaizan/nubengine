      capillary leak has negative effect on haemodynamics and respiration. Inflammation cascades
      are activated by surgery and the use of cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB). We want to test
      whether a small infusion of 7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran solution before and after CPB reduces
      inflammatory activation by measuring the levels of interleukins 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8). We also
      measure extravascular lung water, fluid balance and weight during the first 24 hours post
      CPB.
