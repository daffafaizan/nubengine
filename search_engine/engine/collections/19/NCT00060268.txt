        -  Determine, preliminarily, the safety of HPPH in patients with obstructive esophageal
           tumors undergoing photodynamic therapy.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the length of time for cutaneous photosensitivity at the various drug doses in
           these patients.

        -  Determine plasma clearance rates for this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients then undergo laser
           light therapy on day 2.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of HPPH and a single light dose until the
      optimal dose is determined. The optimal dose is defined as the minimum dose producing
      efficacy without unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the optimal dose. Patients are
           followed monthly for 6-24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-14 patients will be accrued for this study.
