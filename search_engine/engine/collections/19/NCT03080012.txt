    
      TDM (Therapeutic Drug Monitoring) with blood samples is already part of the treatment of some
      tuberculosis (TB) patients to reduce development of drug resistance and toxic drug
      concentrations. Performing TDM with saliva instead of plasma or serum could reduce the burden
      of blood sampling. This study examines if this non-invasive sampling of saliva could be used
      for TDM of several anti-TB drugs.

      The study is an observational cohort study with adult tuberculosis patients as subjects. The
      drugs that are studied are isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin,
      amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, ethionamide, prothionamide, cycloserine, terizidone,
      linezolid, clofazimine, bedaquiline, delamanid, p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS),
      imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, ertapenem, amoxicillin-clavulanate and thioacetazone.

      Saliva samples will be taken simultaneously with blood samples for standard TDM. Serum/plasma
      and saliva drug concentrations will be determined with a validated LC-MS/MS (liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) method. The correlation and linearity between saliva
      and plasma/serum concentrations will be tested. The saliva-plasma or serum ratio based on
      area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) is calculated for the investigated anti-TB
      drugs. Also pharmacokinetic parameters in serum/plasma and saliva will be calculated and
      compared to provide a complete image of pharmacokinetics of the anti-TB drugs in saliva.
