      approached for screening if they are at least 18 years old, participate in the PHPT cohort
      study, have evidence of control of HIV replication and have a CD4 cell count ≥200 cells/mm3
      if currently receiving antiretroviral HIV treatment (on the same anti-HIV regimen for at
      least 12 weeks); or HIV RNA load ≤5000 copies/ml CD4 cells ≥500 cells/mm3if not receiving
      antiretroviral treatment.

      Inclusion Criteria

        -  Evidence of chronic HCV infection for at least 6 months before study entry (at least one
           detectable HCV viral load, i.e. ≥17 IU/mL, with an antibody test positive at least 6
           months before the HCV RNA load result)

        -  Fibrosis Stage F2-3-4 determined by transient elastography (Fibroscan or other similar
           equipment). During the first part of the study, priority will be given to patients with
           Fibrosis Stage F2-3.

        -  Negative pregnancy test (on the day of inclusion). Main exclusion criteria

        -  Anemia and thrombocytopenia

        -  Severe liver damage, advanced stage cirrhosis or cancer

        -  Uncontrolled diabetes, Uncontrolled thyroid dysfunction

        -  Retinopathy

        -  Creatinine clearance <50 mL/min (Cockcroft)

        -  Disease associated with the immune system

        -  Significant heart problems

        -  Severe neuropsychiatric conditions

        -  Contra-indication to study treatment (including pregnancy or lack of effective
           contraception in the participant or female partner)

        -  Other exclusion criteria related to the use of ribavirin and peg-interferon

        -  Any conditions that, in the investigator's judgment, may compromise the follow up.

      Follow up After HCV treatment initiation, patients will be monitored for safety and antiviral
      efficacy at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44 and 48 weeks (end of treatment) and 6
      months after treatment discontinuation.

      Treatment will be discontinued earlier in patients who do not achieve early viral response,
      i.e. a decrease of at least 2 log10 HCV RNA IU/mL after the first 12 weeks of HCV therapy.
