    
      This is a controlled trial randomizing lumbar puncture patients to groups utilizing
      ultrasound to preview the bony structures of the spine versus using standard palpation
      technique. The goal is to determine the helpfulness of ultrasound in performing lumbar
      punctures (to reduce difficult and traumatic lumbar punctures) among patients whose spines
      cannot be easily visualized.
