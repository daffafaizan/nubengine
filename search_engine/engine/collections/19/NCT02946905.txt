      study for adults 18 and older who have been diagnosed with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Many
      adult patients with SCD suffer from cognitive impairment (CI), a serious complication
      responsible for severe functional limitations, and whose pathogenesis, risk factors, and
      natural history are unknown. This research project will look at cognitive performance and 7
      Tesla brain MRI findings along with markers of inflammation and oxidation to better
      understand the mechanism and risk factors. The investigators will complete a baseline
      assessment. SCD participants will be seen for follow-up at 3 and 5 years. Non-SCD
      participants will be seen for follow-up at 3 years. All assessments are completed at no cost
      and there is compensation for participation.
