      Amendments (CLIA) certified genetic testing for Parkinson's Disease (PD) genes to people with
      Parkinson's Disease impacts clinical care and potential enrollment in clinical trials. This
      multi-center study will assess the impact and satisfaction of the mode of genetic counseling
      by comparing counseling conducted by a clinician versus centralized genetic counseling
      conducted through Indiana University. The study will also assess knowledge gained by
      administering a knowledge survey pre- and post-genetic testing. All genetic test results will
      be returned to participants through a genetic counseling visit.
