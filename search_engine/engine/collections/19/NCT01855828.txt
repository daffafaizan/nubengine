      pertuzumab before surgery. Subsequently, subjects will undergo surgery to remove any cancer
      from the breast and axillary lymph nodes that may have survived the chemotherapy. It is
      expected that the majority of women will have no viable cancer left in the breast or lymph
      nodes by the time all chemotherapy is completed.
