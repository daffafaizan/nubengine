      investigate 1).abnormalities of hippocampal neurogenesis in patients with schizophrenia
      compared to healthy controls by using 1H-MRS technique 2a).potential modulation effects of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS) on hippocampal neurogenesis and
      cortical-hippocampal function of patients with schizophrenia 2b).the optimal rTMS therapy
      pattern on promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and improving cortico-hippocampal function by
      comparing the outcome of stimulating two regions(right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or left
      parietal cortex) respectively 3).the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS on cognitive impairments
      and other psychotic symptoms of patients with schizophrenia by adopting cognitive function
      and psychotic symptoms evaluation,as well as to explore the optimal rTMS treatment pattern on
      cognitive function by comparing the outcome of stimulating two regions(DLPFC or LPC)
      respectively 4)association between therapeutic efficacy of rTMS on cognitive deficits and
      rTMS modulation on hippocampal neurogenesis and its network function,in order to elucidate
      the underlying mechanism of therapeutic effects of rTMS on cognitive dysfunction in
      schizophrenia.
