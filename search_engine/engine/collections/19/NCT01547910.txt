      NAFLD is set by increased alanine transaminase and features of liver steatosis on ultrasound.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either fish oil (EPA/DHA, 400-1200mg) or placebo
      (sunflower oil) for 6 months. All children will be advised to reduce weight (dietetic
      intervention + increased physical activity). Laboratory tests, liver ultrasound,
      anthropometric analysis will be performed at the start, after 3 months and 6 months.
