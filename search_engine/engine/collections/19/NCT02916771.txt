    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of an
      investigational drug(s). The investigational drugs used in this research study are Ixazomib,
      Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone.

      "Investigational" means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved
      the combination of Ixazomib, Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone as a treatment regimen for
      Smoldering Multiple Myeloma. The purpose of this research study is to learn whether the
      combination of Ixazomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone works in treating Smoldering
      Multiple Myeloma.

      Ixazomib is a drug that may kill or stop cancer cells from growing by blocking the proteasome
      within the cell, which is responsible for degrading or breaking down a variety of proteins.
      This type of drug is called a proteasome inhibitor. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug,
      meaning it modifies the participant immune system to help fight the participant disease.
      Dexamethasone is a steroid, which is usually combined with other drugs to enhance their
      effects to fight the participant disease.

      Ixazomib is approved by the FDA in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the
      treatment of Multiple Myeloma and is currently being evaluated for use in the treatment of
      several types of cancers. Both Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone have been previously approved
      by the FDA for the treatment of Multiple Myeloma, as well as several other cancers.
