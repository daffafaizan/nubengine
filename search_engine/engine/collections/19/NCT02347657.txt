      study in people with CF who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. This study is
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-661 in combination with Ivacaftor (IVA,
      VX-770). The active treatment regimen comprised of a morning dose of a fixed-dose combination
      (FDC) tablet of 100 milligram (mg) VX-661/150 mg IVA once daily (qd) and an evening dose of
      IVA 150 mg to be taken approximately 12 hours after the morning dose. The placebo regimen was
      visually matched tablets to be taken with the same schedule as the active treatment.
