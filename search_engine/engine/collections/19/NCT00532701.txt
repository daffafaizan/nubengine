      mg) for 24 to 48 weeks has achieved 70-93% sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in
      patients with genotype 2 or 3 chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Recently, a large randomized study
      has shown that patients with genotype 2 or 3 CHC have comparable SVR rates for those who
      received peginterferon for 24 or 48 weeks, and who received daily low dose (800 mg) or
      standard dose (1000-1200 mg) ribavirin. Therefore, the currently recommended treatment for
      these patients is 24 weeks of peginterferon plus low dose ribavirin. Because of the high
      response rates, several studies have shown that when these patients had rapid virologic
      response (RVR), defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels, at week 4 of
      peginterferon plus weight-based ribavirin, 12-16 weeks of treatment could have 82-94% SVR
      rates. However, treatment with peginterferon plus low dose ribavirin for 24 weeks showed
      significantly higher SVR rates than that for 16 weeks (85% vs. 79%) in these patients who
      achieved RVR. While studies showed concordant results in SVR rates for patients with genotype
      3 CHC who received peginterferon plus low dose or weight-based ribavirin for 16 or 24 weeks,
      the SVR rates stratified by RVR showed great differences in patients with genotype 2 CHC who
      received such treatment. Currently, there are no studies on the direct comparison of low dose
      versus weight-based ribavirin, and of 16 to 24 weeks of treatment stratified by RVR for
      patients with genotype 2 CHC. We aimed to conduct a randomized trial to determine the optimal
      ribavirin dose and treatment duration of peginterferon plus ribavirin for patients with
      genotype 2 CHC based on RVR studies.
