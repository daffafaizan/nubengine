      fluorouracil in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma. II. Determine the toxicity and
      safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess, in a preliminary manner, the antitumor
      activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of raltitrexed. Patients receive raltitrexed IV over
      15 minutes followed 24 hours later by fluorouracil IV. Treatment continues every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of raltitrexed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose immediately preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6-10 patients are treated at the MTD. Patients are
      followed for 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-20
      months.
