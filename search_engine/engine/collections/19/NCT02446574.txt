      for patients with resectable esophageal cancer, the considerable number of esophageal cancer
      patients received operation as the first treatment modality. Accordingly, postoperative
      treatments have been playing an important role because of the poor survival rates of the
      patients with pathologically positive lymph nodes who have been treated with resection alone.
      The investigators have proved the value of prophylactic radiation therapy after radical
      esophagectomy for esophageal carcinoma with positive lymph node metastases under the
      conventional 2-dimensional radiotherapy methods in subset analysis of prospective randomized
      clinical trial. For patients with positive lymph nodes, 5 year survival after surgery alone
      was 28.4%, median overall survival was 24 months, recurrence occurred 34.6% in mediastinal
      lymph nodes，13.3% in supraclavicular lymph nodes，10% in abdominal lymph nodes. Distant
      metastases occurred in 21% patients. Adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduced the
      recurrence in mediastinal lymph nodes(13.4%), supraclavicular lymph nodes (6.1%). However
      distant metastases rate increased to 30.7%. Chemotherapy may be vital for these patients.
      Chen reported that the 5 year overall survival rates for the chemoradiotherapy group and
      radiotherapy group were 47.4% and 38.6% (P=0.03). Based on the investigators' studies,
      treatment failure occurred in 8% patients because of celiac metastases. Small radiation field
      by omitting celiac axis lymph node basin may ensure 5-6 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy for
      lower toxicity.
