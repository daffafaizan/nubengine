      information about whom the intervention is most effective for. Specifically, at T1,
      participants will be randomly assigned to the MTB condition, a motivational interviewing
      intervention designed to increase participants' bystander intervention behaviors, or an
      assessment only control condition. All participants will complete a battery of self-report
      measures, including our three proposed moderators (gender, alcohol use, and rape myth
      acceptance). Participants assigned to the MTB condition will also engage in a motivational
      interviewing intervention designed to build each participant's unique motivation for engaging
      in bystander intervention behaviors. Approximately two months later, at T2, participants will
      complete a battery of self-report measures assessing their bystander behaviors and attitudes
      over the past two months. Then, all participants will complete the B-SAVE, where they provide
      open ended verbal responses to a series of sexually risky and non-risky interactive scenes
      they witness in the virtual environment.
