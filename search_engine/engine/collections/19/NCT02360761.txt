      sublobar resection and lobectomy for elderly patients, in order to address these open
      questions:In patients aged 70 years or older and with clinical stage T1N0M0 NSCLC, (1)
      whether sublobar resection can achieve similar disease-free survival compared to lobectomy,
      (2) whether sublobar resection can reduce the postoperative mortality and morbidity,(3)
      whether sublobar resection can reserve better pulmonary function and quality of life for
      elderly patients of NSCLC?
