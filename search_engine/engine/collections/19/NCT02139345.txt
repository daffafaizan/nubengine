      common cause of knee arthritis. Pain, dyskinesia and disability induced by osteoarthritis
      impact severely on the subject's health and quality of life. Knee osteoarthritis is very
      common in the elderly population. As life expectancy has increased, the incidence of
      osteoarthritis rose significantly during the 20th century. For people over 60 years of age,
      approximately 50% show signs of osteoarthritis on x-rays, among which 35% -50% show clinical
      signs. For people over the age of 75, 80% had osteoarthritis symptoms.

      There has been an increase in imported knee prostheses during the past decade, so that
      surgeons now have more choices of implants. However, the high cost of imported prostheses has
      become a barrier to the development of TKA in China and caused many OA subjects requiring
      immediate TKA to have to delay or miss their surgery. The development and promotion of
      high-quality domestic joint implants and surgical instruments is the key to the development
      of TKA technique in China.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of subjects implanted
      with the TC-A PS total knee system compared to a randomized concurrent control group of
      subjects implanted with the TC-PLUS Solution PS total knee system in terms of Knee Society
      Clinical Score (KSCS) at 1 year.
