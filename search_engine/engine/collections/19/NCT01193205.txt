      evaluate the effectiveness of DBT skills group offered as an adjunct to treatment as usual
      compared to a wait list control plus treatment as usual. The continuation of treatment as
      usual in both arms is permitted for two reasons. First, it would be unethical to assign
      suicidal patients to a wait list condition that prohibited involvement in ongoing treatment.
      Second, the proposed design enables us to address the question of the additive effect of the
      DBT skills group intervention. Subjects will be randomized to receive 20 weeks of DBT group
      skills training plus treatment as usual, or to a wait list control plus treatment as usual.
      Clinical effectiveness outcomes will be assessed at baseline, at 10 weeks, at 20 weeks and at
      8 months follow-up. DBT skills training is a manualized intervention developed by Linehan
      (1993). Key skills from the modules described in Miller, Rathus, and Linehan (2006) will
      serve as the basis of the DBT skills group, delivered in a psychoeducational format over the
      course of weekly two-hour sessions. The skills group covers five modules: mindfulness,
      emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and dialectics.
