      planned to enrol a total of 20 patients with bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary emphysema. All
      patients will undergo treatment at one study centre in Heidelberg. Patients will be
      considered for both unilateral and bilateral treatment with intrabronchial valves (IBV) on
      the basis of their emphysema distribution. Patients will be randomised to two treatment arms.
      10 patients receive unilateral or bilateral treatment in each case.
