      of general anaesthesia (GA) in this group of patients with significant co-morbidities, and
      beneficial vasodilatation, which may prevent early fistula thrombosis. Hence, RA is
      preferable to GA for this surgery.

      Brachial plexus blocks (BPB) are the most commonly employed RA technique to anaesthetise the
      upper limb for this surgery. According to the results of a recent 2-year retrospective audit
      in our centre, ultrasound-guided supraclavicular BPB are the most popular RA technique for
      this surgery. Anatomically, the T1 and T2 dermatomes are often missed by the supraclavicular
      BPB. This means that the upper medial arm and axilla (sites involved in brachiobasilic and
      brachioaxillary arteriovenous grafting) may not be adequately anaesthetised, mandating
      intraoperative local anaesthetic supplementation by the surgeon. This may affect patients'
      and surgeons' acceptance of, and satisfaction with the RA technique. The ultrasound-guided
      Pecs II block, described by Blanco et al, seems to address this problem, as the intercostal
      T1-6, intercostobrachialis, long thoracic nerves and nerve to serratus anterior are targeted
      by this block.
