      fear and anxiety caused by patients worrying about the uncertainty about surgery, and finally
      affecting the patient's surgical efficacy and recovery. This is the main reason in terms of
      surgical nurse workload is much more than those internal medicine nurse.

      As a major part of nursing work, health education has especially important to patients. The
      quality and efficiency of health education directly affects the rehabilitation of patients.
      It can help patients correctly understand the relevant knowledge of disease and master the
      skills of recovery.

      At present, the health education in surgery department is mainly carried out by oral
      face-to-face communication and guidance from admission nurses. This kind of education method
      showed time-consuming and laborious.In addition, oral guidance is more reliable on nurse
      ability of expression and acknowledgement. Multimedia-based health education is an update
      mode combined with audio-visual stimulation and patients' own participation. Mobile terminal
      makes patient more acceptable, flexible, standardized in receiving the health education
      during hospitalization. This prospective study is aimed to assess whether multimedia-video
      education could reduce nurse workload and do not decrease the satisfaction of surgical
      patients.
