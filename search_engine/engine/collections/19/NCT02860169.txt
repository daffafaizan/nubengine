      salient images (cold & flu related) to be used in the motivation task under investigation in
      Parts B and C. Part B is a pilot investigation of a novel measure of motivation, using a grip
      force cognitive task (PST, previously used in obesity literature) in a small group of
      participants with cold and flu compared to a group without. The result of this pilot study
      will inform task content and sample size for Part C. The final part will investigate the
      effects of cold and flu on motivation (using the PST), cognitive performance (using the
      Cambridge Cognition Cognitive Assessments [CANTAB] testing battery) and subjective mood and
      motivation in participants suffering from C&F and healthy participants.
