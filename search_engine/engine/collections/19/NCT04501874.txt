    
      This study is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, study
      to compare the safety and efficacy of EMB-001 with a placebo control in approximately 80
      subjects with moderate-to-severe CUD. Subjects will receive investigational medicinal product
      (IMP) during a 12-week, double-blind Treatment Period (Week 2 through Week 13) and a 1-week,
      double-blind Taper Period (Week 14).

      After undergoing study procedures during the Screening and Baseline Periods, subjects who
      meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (n=40/arm) to
      one of the following for the Treatment Period (weeks 2 - 13) on Study Day 8:

        -  EMB-001 720 mg metyrapone/24 mg oxazepam mg BID, for a total daily dose of 1440 mg
           metyrapone and 48 mg oxazepam (Active Group)

        -  Placebo BID, (Placebo Group)

      During the Taper Period (week 14), subjects in the Active Group will receive EMB-001 240/8 mg
      BID; and the Placebo Group will continue to receive placebo. Both groups will change from
      taking three capsules BID (twice daily) to one capsule BID (twice daily).

      There will be a follow-up visit for safety assessments at Week 18.
