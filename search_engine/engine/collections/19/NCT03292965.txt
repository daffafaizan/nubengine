      monitoring value (TOF). After the administration of reversal, the anesthesiologist who are
      going to manage the participant should not check the quantitative neuromuscular monitoring
      and determine the timing of extubation only with his (or her) judgement. After entering
      post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) measure the TOF value and check the incidence of TOF ratio
      > 0.9 between the neostigmine group and sugammadex group.
