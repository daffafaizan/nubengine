    
      Parastomal bulging (PB) in patients with ileostomy and colostomy in the Capital Region of
      Denmark up to one year after surgery is the primary outcome in this study. The investigators
      will use a register-based study design to evaluate routinely-collected health data from the
      Danish Stoma Database Capital Region (DSDCR). Incidence of PB one year post surgery and at
      different points of follow-up during the first year will be investigated using survival
      analysis. Potential risk factors will be investigated controlling for potential confounders.
      In order to include relevant variables on lifestyle, comorbidity, and physical status, data
      from the DSDCR will be linked to data from the Danish Anaesthesia Database.
