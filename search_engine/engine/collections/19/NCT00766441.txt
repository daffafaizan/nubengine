        1. Primary end point: Occurrence of hypoglycemia. The patients will record hypoglycaemic
           episodes in a self-monitoring diary together with blood glucose values.

        2. Secondary endpoints: Body weight, fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycosylated haemoglobin
           (HbA1c)/Fructosamine, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density
           lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C).

        3. A subgroup will undergo CGMS assessment to define glycaemic excursions during and after
           fasting.
