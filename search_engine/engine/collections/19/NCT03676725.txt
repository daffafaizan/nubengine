      study will assess the frequency of ineffectiveness in the target population. This study will
      be compared with a similar assessment among the ADHD population (NCT03563573). The controlled
      trial will assess the ability of lidocaine oral gel to block taste (e.g., sweet) in 100 teens
      and adults, none with a history of ADHD.
