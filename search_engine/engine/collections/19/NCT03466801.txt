      syndrome. Prednisolone and methylprednisolone are essential drugs for IMN. However, there are
      no recommendations for the treatment of IMN in China. KDIGO guidelines recommend combination
      therapy with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy of IMN, but there
      is a large side effect of cyclophosphamide.There were retrospective study showed that the use
      of glucocorticoid hormones (including prednisone and methylprednisolone) alone may be
      effective in patients with membranous nephropathy in Asia, but there is no high quality
      evidence of evidence-based medicine.The study is a randomized prospective controlled
      multi-centered trial,to compare the efficacy of prednisone alone and combination therapy with
      methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide in the treatment of membranous nephropathy in stage
      I.
