      measurements more than 60 minutes after last dose of sedative and measurements to occur when
      no major interventions are planned or medications are scheduled. Then patients will undergo
      the following ventilator settings (all of which are within ranges ordinarily employed) in
      random order for 3 minutes of each setting (pressures measured midway i.e. 1.5 minutes - at
      each interval to ensure safety; stopped if static airway pressure>30 cmH2O):

        1. Assist control

             1. Tidal volumes of 6 ml/kg, 8 ml/kg and 10 ml/kg

             2. Flow regimes: constant (CF) and decelerating (dec) at 40, 60 and 80 L/min;

        2. Pressure support (PS) 0, 10 and 20 cmH2O with PEEP=5 cmH2O

      Patients will be randomized to receive the following in either forward or reverse order:
      CF60L/min in 6 then 8 then 10 ml/kg; then at 8 ml/kg CF40, Dec40, Dec60, CF60, CF80, Dec80;
      then PS=0, 10, 20 cmH2O.

      In the last 30 second of each setting, patients will be asked to indicate their level of
      comfort (1-10 in increasing comfort) using a visual analog Borg Score (when they can
      see/write) or to indicate on their fingers when they cannot write.
