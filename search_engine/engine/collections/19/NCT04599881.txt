    
      Protocol PTR-01-002 is a 3-part Phase 2, open-label study of PTR-01. While new patients will
      be enrolled, priority will be given to patients that satisfactorily completed study
      PTR-01-001.

      In Part 1, patients will receive a dose of 3.0 mg/kg every week for a total of 4 doses. This
      will be followed by Part 2 in which patients will receive a dose of 3.0 mg/kg every other
      week for a total of 7 doses. In Part 3, patients will be followed for 12 weeks. No
      investigational therapy will be administered during this time. At the end of each dosing
      period, an efficacy assessment will be performed. Safety will be assessed continuously
      throughout the study.

      Following the end of Part 3, patients may be eligible for a potential long-term extension to
      further refine the dosing regimen, depending upon study drug availability.
