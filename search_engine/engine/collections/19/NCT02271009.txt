    
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the dose-response trend of three doses of adjuvanted AllerT
      and of placebo in reducing symptoms of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis in subjects exposed to
      birch tree pollen in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate three dose regimens of AllerT , versus a placebo in reducing symptoms of
           allergic rhino-conjunctivitis in subjects exposed to birch tree pollen in an EEC.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of a two month treatment with three dose regiments
           of AllerT (10 µg, 25 µg and 50 µg with Al(OH)3).

        -  To explore the immunological response to AllerT.
