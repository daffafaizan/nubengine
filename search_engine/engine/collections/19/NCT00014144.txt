        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate of patients with advanced
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with ZD 1839.

        -  Determine the overall survival and response (confirmed complete and partial response) in
           these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the changes in growth factor protein kinase expression before and after
           treatment and at the time of disease progression in these patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral ZD 1839 once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-55 patients will be accrued for this study.
