      muscles between strength and endurance has more deficiency in difficult to wean patients. In
      a second time, the results of this study will help to choose the best IMT program to assess
      his impact on the weaning time.

      We are going to conduct an interventional trial because of Peak Pressure measure, which is
      not measure in care practice. Following 18h of invasive mechanical ventilation in a
      controlled mode, the failure of the first single breathe trial of 2 hours and the presence of
      sevrability criterias defined by the European consensus conference in 2007, 80 participants
      will be included in the medical intensive care unit of Bordeaux's hospital. We'll perform
      measurements of the Maximal Inspiratory Pressure and Peak Pressure from the inclusion to the
      extubation.
