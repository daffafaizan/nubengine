    
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of [Lu-177]-PNT2002
      ([Lu-177]-PSMA-I&T) versus abiraterone or enzalutamide in delaying radiographic progression
      in patients with mCRPC.

      The study consists of 3 phases: Dosimetry, Randomized Treatment, and Long term Follow up.

      The study will commence with a 25-patient safety and dosimetry lead-in (Part 1) and proceed
      to a randomization treatment phase in approximately 390 patients (Part 2). Patients in Part 2
      will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either [Lu-177]-PNT2002 (Arm A), or enzalutamide
      or abiraterone (Arm B). Patients in Arm B who experience radiographic progression per central
      review and meet protocol defined eligibility, may crossover to receive [Lu-177]-PNT2002. All
      patients will be followed in long-term follow-up for at least 5 years from the first
      therapeutic dose, death, or loss to follow up (Part 3).

      Only patients that meet PSMA PET avidity criteria per central review will be eligible for
      this study.
