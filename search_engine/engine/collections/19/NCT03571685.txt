      disability in the world. Recognizing the need for improved early treatment for participants
      diagnosed with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder, a model was created for a
      "sustainable early episode clinic, SEEC." The goal of the SEEC model is to provide early
      intense intervention in 3 phases, with an ongoing maintenance phase, enabled by technology,
      resulting in improved participant outcomes and reduced long-term economic and social burden
      of schizophrenia. This study will last for up to a 36-month period.
