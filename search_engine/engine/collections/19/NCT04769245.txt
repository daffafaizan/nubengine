      application time and most importantly the amount of antibody that is administered. Single
      donor plasma has some drawbacks; such as the insufficient levels of neutralizing antibody
      activities, the requirements of blood group compatibility, and the risk of infection
      transmission. In this study, the efficacy and safety of pathogen inactivated,
      isohemagglutinin-depleted (concentrated) and pooled convalescent plasma was investigated.
