    
      This is a multicenter, Phase 1b/2a, First-In-Human study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of EO2401 in patients with unequivocal evidence of
      progressive or first recurrent glioblastoma.

      EO2401 is an innovative cancer peptide therapeutic vaccine based on the homologies between
      Tumor Associated Antigens and microbiome-derived peptides that will be administered alone and
      in combination with nivolumab, and nivolumab/bevacizumab to generate preliminary safety and
      efficacy data in patients with progressive glioblastoma.
