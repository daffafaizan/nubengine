      frequent with age. Among techniques have been used to diagnose and classify the severity of
      knee OA, the imaging techniques, such as ultrasonography (US), provide physical quantitative
      informations for better understanding and assessing of the pathology of the knee joint.

      The present study aim to investigate the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography for
      femoral condyle cartilage evaluation using MRI and histology analysis as reference tools. To
      validate this approach, evaluations are conducted to determine, whether the UltraSound Speed
      Of Sound (US-SOS) propagation is associated with the variation of the arthrosis stage, in
      order to improve the diagnosis of the surgeon. For this purpose, measurements are conducted
      using selected human cartilage samples with different stage of OA (early stage and advanced
      stage).

      This research is the first "preclinical" study of a new unlabelled medical device developed
      by Cartimage Medical SAS. Cartilage is a prospective, monocentric, unrandomized and
      uncontrolled study. This study doesn't modify the medical care of the patient.
