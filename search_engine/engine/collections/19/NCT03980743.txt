      of chronic psychiatric illness, but there are few treatments that work. Behavioral
      interventions face challenges with long-term effectiveness, implementation and
      sustainability. Medications have modest effectiveness at best, and/or pose serious side
      effect risks. This study focuses on prevention of chronic obesity by adapting and pilot
      testing a prevention-focused, interactive obesity treatment approach (iOTA) for use in
      persons with early-phase SMI (eSMI) experiencing initial weight gain, overweight or
      early-stage obesity. The intervention will be adapted from the most studied, effective iOTA,
      derived from the Diabetes Prevention Program. The parent iOTA uses health coaches who extend
      their sustainable reach with scalable, inexpensive, semi-automated text messaging. Using a
      formal evaluation process and a specific implementation science framework, planned
      adaptations for this application will address mechanisms to improve health-related awareness,
      insight and self-efficacy skills.

      Aim 1: Evaluate barriers and facilitators for intervention engagement, effectiveness and
      implementation, and identify needed adaptations of the prior iOTA for use in obesity
      attenuation in eSMI.

      Aim 2: Adapt the prior iOTA for use in obesity attenuation in eSMI, aiming to maximize
      acceptability, engagement, sustainable reach and target engagement for eSMI.

      Aim 3: Conduct a randomized pilot and feasibility study of iOTA-eSMI in a diverse sample of
      adults aged 18-45 with eSMI and initial weight gain, overweight or early class I obesity,
      comparing iOTA-eSMI to a health education condition.
