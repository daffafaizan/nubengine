      randomized controlled design. Half participated in a 4 hour seminar series integrated into
      their ambulatory curriculum. Each month a total of 8 residents participated. Following the
      intervention there were 3 levels of assessment: (1) All participants, intervention and
      control, participated in a brief exercise interviewing 4 standardized patients (SPs). Note
      that we separately enlisted the assistance of 8 attending physicians to assist with case
      development for these SPs. (2) The research team subsequently enrolled 3 real patients from
      each physician's practice with "red flags" such as poor adherence, or missed visits,
      suggestive of contextual issues that need to be addressed. Physicians were scored on their
      performance at identifying the underlying contextual factors that account for these red flags
      and on formulating an appropriate plan of care. (3) The coders prospectively defined
      successful vs. unsuccessful outcomes for each case. At the follow up visit data was collected
      on whether the desired outcome was achieved. The analysis compared the skills, performance
      and outcomes of the intervention compared with the control group to determine the efficacy of
      training residents to individualize care.
