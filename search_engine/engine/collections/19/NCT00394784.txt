      patients in the liver transplant ICU by the medical team. These cultures are then processed
      by the clinical Microbiology laboratory in the normal manner. If these cultures grow a
      Gram-negative bacteria, they are eligible for this study. Typically the clinical Microbiology
      laboratory saves these bacteria for a period of time after the final microbiology report. At
      this time, unless asked otherwise, the bacteria will be placed in biohazardous waste
      containers for proper disposal. If these cultures have grown a Gram-negative bacteria, they
      are eligible for this study, and will not be disposed of but will be given to the
      investigators without identifiers for this study. The antibiotic susceptibility of these
      organisms will be tested by the investigators in a separate research laboratory. Mechanisms
      of antibiotic resistance may also be assessed.
