    
      This is a prospective imaging study evaluating the utility of baseline metabolic MR imaging
      as a predictive response biomarker to androgen signaling inhibition in patients with
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. Patients with a target lesion that is amenable for
      metabolic MR imaging will be eligible for study participation. Patients will undergo baseline
      metabolic MR imaging with Hyperpolarized Pyruvate C-13 pyruvate followed by initiation of
      androgen signaling inhibition (either as standard of care or as part of clinical trial;
      including abiraterone and/or enzalutamide treatment). Patient will subsequently undergo
      repeat metabolic MR scan after 28 days (+/- 7 days) of therapy. For those without primarily
      refractory disease, a third metabolic MR scan will be completed at the time of radiographic
      disease progression by The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria.
      MR- or CT-guided tumor biopsies are optional at baseline and at the time of disease
      progression.
