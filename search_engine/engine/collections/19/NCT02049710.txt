      drivers ages 16 to 19 are four times more likely than older drivers to crash. Death and
      injuries could be reduced with a change in behaviors that include improved visual and
      attention skills while driving, more seat belt use, appropriate speed control, and not
      combining drinking or texting with driving. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
      unplanned pregnancies are particularly common among adolescents. The U.S. adolescent
      birthrate is by far the highest among industrialized nations. These problems can be decreased
      by less sexual activity and better protection.

      This study uses a randomized controlled trial to measure how well interactive video
      interventions can reduce these common risks to adolescents. Adolescent females will be
      invited to participate if they are currently seeking care at a participating clinic. They
      will answer survey questions about their driving and sexual behaviors, and then a computer
      will determine whether they will be given a video about driving or a video about sexual
      behavior. Participants will have unlimited access to their video, which they can watch at
      their clinic or from any Internet-enabled computer, and will be followed for 6 months.
