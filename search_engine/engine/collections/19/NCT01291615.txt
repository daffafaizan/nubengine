      because of high surgical morbidity ratio and high adverse event ratio of adjuvant therapy.
      For example, our preliminary results showed that regular gemcitabine administration
      (1000mg/m2, day1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks) after hemihepatectomy was too toxic and induced severe
      leukocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Herein, we planned this study to decide more safety
      adjuvant protocol(recommend dose) for gemcitabine and S-1 after hemihepatectomy using
      continual reassessment method analysis. In this study, we decided that tolerable ratio of
      dose-limiting toxicity would be less than 10%.
