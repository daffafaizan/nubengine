    
      Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare pulmonary disease occuring preferentially in women. Few
      data are available regarding the epidemiology of this disease, the frequency of the various
      forms with mild to moderate or severe disease, and the rapid or slow progression.

      Several sources of information will be used in order to increase completeness. The registry
      will also allow to estimate the proportion of patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis who are
      managed by the Reference Center and Competence Centers for rare lung diseases in France.

      Data will be collected by a research assistant, and the study will be coordinated by the Pole
      IMER - Department of Public health and Epidemiology of HCL (Lyon Hospitals).

      This study will provide a better knowledge on the natural course of the disease and the
      variability in severity and progression of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and the applicability of
      diagnostic criteria proposed in 2009. This study will provide the first detailed
      epidemiological information on Lymphangioleiomyomatosis, will assess the management of this
      rare disease within the French National Plan for rare diseases 2005 - 2009, and will provide
      valuable medical information prior to the establishment of clinical trials
