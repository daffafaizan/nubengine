    
      Subjects with documented symptomatic, recurrent, PAF refractory to at least one beta blocker,
      calcium channel blocker or Class I or Class III anti-arrhythmic drug, who meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and are deemed appropriate candidates for catheter ablation will
      undergo PV ablation with the VAS. Pre-procedural CT scan or MRI will be obtained to assess LA
      and PV anatomy and size. PV ablation will be performed utilizing the VAS (see procedure
      description below). Acute post-ablation confirmation of PV electrical isolation will be
      evaluated via standard mapping techniques.
