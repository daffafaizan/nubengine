      115-135 million people suffering from dementia. Inside dementias, Mild Cognitive Impairment
      (MCI) has a prevalence in adults aged â‰¥65 years of 10-20%.

      Patients with MCI also show greater progression towards dementia, higher mortality and
      disability, and a greater use of medical care compared to cognitively normal subjects that
      converts MCI into an important public health problem, which reinforces the need to perfect
      clinic assessment procedures to improve the early identification of individuals with MCI.
      Early diagnosis could allow effective medical treatments that prevent or slow the onset of
      dementia, and could improve the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions.

      Currently, it can be used an Inertial Sensor and 3D motion capture systems with a camera to
      analyse kinematics and these instruments are being integrated as a rehabilitation tool in
      patients. The use of Inertial Sensor and 3D motion capture cameras would help to find fast
      and cheap assessment methods for professionals.
