    
      Twenty to Forty patients with documented overactive bladder will receive 30 minutes of
      treatment one day a week for 12 weeks. Treatment will consist of stimulating the posterior
      tibial nerve in the area of the ankle with a pulsed electromagnetic field. Study treatments
      will be administered by a commercially available MagPro R30, with a cooled figure eight coil,
      and a surface electrode placed over the afferent pathway of the sacral nerve.

      The specific aim is improved urinary frequency and urgency after 12 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary goals.

        -  To estimate the extent to which the device will decrease the number of episodes of
           involuntary urine loss due to frequency/urgency in comparison to historical controls.

        -  To evaluate the potential of the device for improving patient quality of life as
           measured by a clinically validated scale, such as the Incontinence Quality of Life
           Instrument (I-QOL) or equivalent

        -  To periodically employ a micturition diary to record variables such as day/night
           urgency/frequency episodes, number of voids per day, severity of leaks, number of
           absorbent products used per day, etc.
