      I. Establish safety and efficacy of oral ixazomib citrate (MLN 9708) and lenalidomide in the
      maintenance setting post autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in myeloma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Incidence of secondary primary malignancy. II. Evaluate the best response rate (stringent
      complete response [sCR]/near complete response [nCR]/very good partial response
      [VGPR]/partial response [PR]).

      III. Evaluate time to progression. IV. Evaluate time to next therapy. V. Evaluate the
      tolerability and toxicity. VI. Evaluate M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-myeloma
      symptom evaluation.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 60-180 days post-transplant, patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days
      1, 8, and 15 and lenalidomide PO on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
