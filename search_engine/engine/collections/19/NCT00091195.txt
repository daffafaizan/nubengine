      I. To estimate the response rate of recurrent, platinum-sensitive adenocarcinoma of the
      ovarian or peritoneal to depsipeptide (romidepsin).

      II. To determine the toxicity of depsipeptide in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive depsipeptide (romidepsin) intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and
      15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed up for 5 years.
