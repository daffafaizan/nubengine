      ineffective in an important number of children with cerbreal palsy (CP) and gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (GERD), and failure of medical therapy is associated with a substantial
      morbidity. Many patients, particularly children with CP and GERD, continue to experience
      complications despite aggressive therapy because antisecretory medications do not address the
      primary reflux mechanism (TLESR).

      This is a placebo controlled trial of baclofen for the treatment of GERD in children with CP.
