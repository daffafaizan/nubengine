      interferes with care or function at the Tennessee State Veterans Home (TSVH), which is a
      long-term care facility for veterans and their spouses in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In order
      to accomplish this goal, each of the 140 residents will be examined by the principal
      investigator and a medical record review will be performed; also, each patient and their
      medical decision-maker (if applicable), direct caregiver, and treating physician will be
      surveyed in order to further elucidate the barriers to treatment in this population. All
      consenting residents of the TSVH will be examined, but the data will be separated prior to
      analysis based on whether the resident is a veteran or a veteran's relative.
