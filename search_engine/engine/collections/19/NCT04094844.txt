      participants in their healthcare.This study is not to provide any treatment, but rather to
      investigate the use of this mobile health technology-mediated intervention (Roadmap 2.0).
      Roadmap 2.0 is a web-based application that integrates patient-specific information and
      includes several domains: laboratory results, medications, clinical trial details, photos of
      the healthcare team, trajectory of transplant process, and discharge checklist.

      This trial is anticipated to enroll 664 participants, but only caregivers (332 total) will be
      evaluated for the primary and secondary outcome measures. Thus, the sample size is 332. The
      total enrollment includes 166 caregiver-patient dyads of adult patients (age >/=18 years)
      undergoing HCT ("adult dyads" = 332 total) and 166 caregiver-patient dyads of pediatric
      patients (age 5-17 years) undergoing HCT ("pediatric dyads" = 332 total).
