      I.To assess the microscopic pathologic complete response rate (pCR) in patients treated with
      a two part, neoadjuvant regimen consisting of daily oral sunitinib with weekly IV paclitaxel
      for 12 weeks followed by weekly doxorubicin and daily oral cyclophosphamide given with
      filgrastim (G-CSF) support for 15 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the association between microscopic pCR and clinical complete response rate at
      the primary tumor site.

      II. To assess the relapse rate, overall and disease-free survival in patients with breast
      cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of daily oral sunitinib with weekly
      IV paclitaxel for 12 weeks followed weekly doxorubicin and daily oral cyclophosphamide given
      with G-CSF support for 15 weeks.

      III. To assess the toxicity associated with these regimens. IV. To explore the relationship
      between planned correlative laboratory and clinical studies and indicators of efficacy such
      as pathologic response, clinical response and relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily
      and paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once weekly for 8-12 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning within 3 weeks of completion of
      sunitinib malate and paclitaxel, patients receive doxorubicin IV once weekly for 15 weeks,
      cyclophosphamide PO once daily for 15 weeks, and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-7
      for 16 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 3-6
      weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
