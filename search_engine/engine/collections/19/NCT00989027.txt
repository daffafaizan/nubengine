    
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. In 80%
      cases of PPH, the primary cause is failure of the uterus to contract after delivery of the
      baby, which then requires further treatment of the mother with uterotonic drugs (drugs used
      to contract uterus and thus prevent bleeding).

      Patients participating in this study will be asked to donate a very small sample of uterine
      tissue during Cesarean section, which will be tested for the ability to contract after
      treatment with various uterotonic drugs (oxytocin, ergonovine and carboprost) in the
      laboratory. This information will help us know the effect of these drugs by comparing the
      contractile capability of the uterine tissue.
