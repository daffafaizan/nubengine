    
      The study aims to evaluate the impact of contact isolation on the rate of hospital-acquired
      transmissions of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli and the rate of colonization and infection.

      Hematological and oncological wards in hospitals with a non-outbreak setting for ESBL-EC and
      adhering to at least the following standard of care are eligible for study participation:

        -  Fecal screening for the presence of ESBL-EC of all patients within 72 hours of each
           admission by use of a rectal swab or stool sample

        -  Follow-up fecal screening once a week and within 72 hours of discharge

        -  Implementation of clinical standards aimed at ESBL-EC decolonization is not allowed on
           wards participating in this study, including in the context of clinical studies.

      Sites will be grouped according to their approach regarding contact isolation (see group
      description).

      As a control for external factors a hand hygiene program, including training and adherence
      assessments, will be implemented.
