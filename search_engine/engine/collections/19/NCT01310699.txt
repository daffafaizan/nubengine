      colonoscopy have been reported at a rate of 1 cancer/1000 person years.The majority of these
      cancers are likely a consequence of a missed neoplastic lesion during routine colonoscopy.
      Recent tandem colonoscopy studies have shown no significant difference in adenoma miss or
      detection rates using narrow band imaging as compared to colonoscopy using white light.
      However, higher detection of flat neoplastic lesions using NBI was shown in a meta-analysis
      and should be furthered studied, especially considering that they are thought to be a strong
      contributor to a false negative colonoscopy.
