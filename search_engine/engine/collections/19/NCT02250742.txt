      disorders. Yet, the association between dry needling and motor performance of muscles is
      still unclear.

      This study aims to investigate the immediate effect of dry needling on lumbar multifidus
      muscles' function in healthy and low back pain subjects.

      The sample will be divided into: low back pain group and control (healthy) group. Both groups
      will receive dry needling to the lumbar multifidus muscles using a deep insertion technique
      with 4 needles (2 on each side of the spine). The needles will be left in situ for 10
      minutes. Ultrasound imaging will be used to measure multifidus muscles' thickness, pre and
      post- procedure during rest in a prone position and during contralateral active straight leg
      extension.
