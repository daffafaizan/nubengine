    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter, single
      arm (only one treatment group) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abiraterone
      acetate in patients with mCRPC. The study will be divided into screening phase (up to 28 days
      before enrollment), treatment phase including treatment cycles (each cycle of treatment will
      be 28 days), and follow-up phase. Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled into this study.
      Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram and vital
      signs as well as pharmacokinetic (what the body does to drug) assessments will be conducted
      in this study. Patients will continue to receive abiraterone acetate plus prednisolone until
      disease progression or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity.
