      reservoirs.

      Although current therapies are effective at "killing" new viruses that are produced, they are
      unable to access the virus in cells which were infected before antiretroviral therapy began.
      HIV can remain "hidden" in a latent (or resting) form in these cells for many years. Since
      these infected cells can live for many years, they are thought to be the most important
      barrier to HIV eradication (or "cure").

      Many experts believe that one way to attack latent or "hidden" HIV is to use a drug than can
      "turn on" the virus and hence force HIV-1 out of resting T cells. In a recent study done in
      the laboratory, disulfiram proved to be among the most effective drugs currently available
      that can reactivate latent HIV-1,

      Our primary hypothesis is that disulfiram will reduce the latent reservoir of HIV-1 in
      patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Theoretically, disulfiram will
      force HIV to replicate (grow) and thus result in the death of the infected cell. Standard
      antiretroviral drugs should prevent new cells from becoming infected. The end result of this
      process is that the total amount of HIV in the body will decline over time.
