      events or unanticipated adverse device events. The efficacy will be measured by comparing the
      overall functional performance based on the Harris Hip Score, implant survivorship, and
      radiographic parameters, including radiolucencies, osteolysis, stem subsidence, cup
      migration, and change in cup angle and a change in the femoral shaft angle.
