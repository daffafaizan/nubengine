      criteria are consist of non-metastatic esophageal cancer who are going to receive
      chemo-radiotherapy. One hundred patients are going to assign randomly by blocked randomized
      allocation (1:1) to receive radiotherapy (median treatment dose will be 50.40 Gy in 25 to 32
      fractions) with weekly concurrent chemotherapy (paclitaxel [50 mg/m2] plus carboplatin [area
      under the carve=2]) with or without enoxaparin (40 mg daily). During radiotherapy and before
      each course of chemotherapy, all patients are going to visit by physician and complete blood
      count will be checked. All patients are going to undergo gastrointestinal endoscopy and then
      esophagectomy, 4-6 months after completion of chemo-radiotherapy.
