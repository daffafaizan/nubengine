      will be instructed and trained to use the Tobii™ Eyegaze System. The number of sessions
      required to successfully master the device depends on the learning curve of the patient. The
      progress will be documented accordingly. After successful completion of the training and
      supervised use, the inpatients will be offered the Tobii™ Eyegaze System for unsupervised
      use, 4 hours a week, for the following 2 months. It is hypothesised that using the Tobii™
      Eyegaze System by inpatients with tetraplegia results in improved disability perception and
      independence scores. For the current feasibility study 12 participants will be recruited and
      assessed for 'Appraisal of Disability', 'Mood', 'Assistive Technology perception' and
      'eyeskills' to instruct the computer system. Positive study outcomes will encourage future
      studies of the role of the Tobii™ Eyegaze System in both a rehabilitation and home
      environment.
