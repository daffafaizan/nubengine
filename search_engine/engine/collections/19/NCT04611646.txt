      in blood and content of respiratory mitochondria in skeletal muscle. Low-intensity training
      (LIT) with heat exposure may be beneficial for development of these variables. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate the effects of five weeks of LIT-training with heat suit (five
      times a week; 50 min per session) on hemoglobin mass and other blood characteristics in elite
      cyclists (males and females) compared to a non-heat-suit training control group, including
      subsequent investigation of the retrograde effects of ~one month of training without heat
      suit. The study will also investigate the effects of heat-suit training on endurance exercise
      performance/performance determinants and other muscle biological charateristics, and will
      investigate the basic characteristics of mitochondrial function and abundances in these
      highly trained athletes. Training sessions with heat suit (or lack thereof) will complement
      the habitual training routines of the participants.
