    
      This study represents a prospective, randomized assessment of the potential clinical and
      economic benefit to be derived from the continuous non-invasive monitoring of regional
      cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) during cardiac surgery employing cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB). Previous studies have shown that low rSO2 values obtained during surgery are highly
      associated with postoperative frontal lobe dysfunction, cognitive declines, disorientation,
      and other clinical indices of prolonged recovery. Low rSO2 values are thought to reflect the
      development of tissue hypoxia within susceptible regions of the cerebral cortex during the
      non-pulsatile perfusion of CPB. Rapid detection and correction of such episodes should help
      avoid regional hypoxia and its attendant postoperative sequelae. This study will assess
      neurologic, psychometric, and quality of life markers of brain dysfunction which could result
      from CPB. Each study patient will be assessed both pre- and postoperatively (pre-hospital
      discharge and at three months) for neurologic and neurocognitive dysfunction.

      Comparison(s): Intervention versus control group. Patients assigned to the intervention
      rSO2-monitored group will be managed with conservative measures designed to maintain the rSO2
      value at, or above, its preoperative value. Such measures include increases in pump flow,
      blood pressure, anesthetic dose, arterial oxygen tension, carbon dioxide tension, and
      hematocrit. Those patients in the control group will be managed according to current
      established practice. Although rSO2 is also recorded in this group, the monitor's readings
      are blinded.
