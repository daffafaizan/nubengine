      biliary tree very challenging for the surgeon or the endoscopist. There are different
      techniques described to overcome this downside, being laparoscopic assisted trans-gastric
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) approach an outstanding method to
      access the remnant stomach for reaching the duodenal papilla, with a high rate of success
      reported. We describe a case of a 57-year-old patient with altered RYGB anatomy, who
      underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a intra-operative cholangiogram showing a stone
      on the common bile duct. A laparoscopic assisted trans-gastric ERCP was successfully
      performed, introducing the duodenoscope through a gastrostomy without the need of an
      intra-gastric trocar. The patient evolved favorably and was discharged on his second
      postoperative day without complications.
