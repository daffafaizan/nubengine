      -To select the arm(s) achieving a 2-year progression-free survival rate of >= 85% without
      unacceptable swallowing toxicity at 1 year.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine patterns of failure (locoregional relapse versus distant) and survival
           -(overall and progression-free) at 6 months and 2 years.

        -  To determine acute toxicity profiles at the end of radiation therapy and at 1 and 6
           months.

        -  To determine late toxicity profiles at 1 and 2 years.

        -  To determine patient-reported swallowing outcomes at 6 months and 1 and 2 years.

        -  To determine the predictive value of 12-14 week, post-treatment fludeoxyglucose F 18
           (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for locoregional
           control and progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years.

        -  To determine the predictive value of blood and tissue biomarkers for disease outcomes at
           2 years.

        -  To determine swallowing recovery per videofluoroscopy imaging at 2 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months then every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
