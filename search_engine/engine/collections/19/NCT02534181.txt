      chronically undernourished patients. A number of organs may be affected due to imbalance of
      fluids and electrolytes. In the intensive care setting, there are no formal guidelines to
      recommend the appropriate treatment of this condition. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the implementation of a nutritional protocol to address cancer patients admitted to the ICU
      with refeeding syndrome.
