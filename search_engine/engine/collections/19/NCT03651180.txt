      disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there are a
      considerable number of patients who continue to have major adverse event despite this
      treatment. More recently a polymer-free drug eluting stent (Amphilimus eluting stent) has
      shown to have a superiority in terms of efficacy and safety if compared with stable polymer
      drug eluting stent when used in diabetic patients. These more favorable effects translate
      into reduced event rates, but to date there are no existing data comparing directly the
      mid-long term effect of this new polymer-free drug eluting stent with the other drug eluting
      stents in a larger cohort of patients.
