    
      Study FX006-2011-001 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active comparator,
      parallel-group, single-dose study designed to assess the magnitude and duration of pain
      relief of three doses (10, 40, and 60 mg) of FX006, an extended-release formulation of TCA,
      relative to commercially-available TCA IR.

      The general tolerability of a single injection of FX006 also was assessed.

      Secondary objectives included exploration of the effect of FX006 on functional improvement,
      responder status, time to onset of pain relief, global impressions of change, and consumption
      of analgesic medications and evaluation of the PK profile of single injection of the three
      dose levels of FX006.

      The study was planned to be conducted in up to 224 male and female patients â‰¥40 years of age
      with OA of the knee enrolled at 22 study centers in the US, Australia, and Canada.
