      according to the approved indication of Abilify Maintena, for subjects who are taking oral
      antipsychotic drugs. It is expected that this will serve as a basis for suggesting a
      successful switching guideline from oral antipsychotics to Abilify Maintena, which can be
      applicable in clinical practice.
