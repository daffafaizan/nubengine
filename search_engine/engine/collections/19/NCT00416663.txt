      therapeutic alternative will undergo screening and be treated with an injection of Angiogenic
      Cell Precursors (ACPs), contained in VesCell (TM). 250 ml of blood will be drawn from the
      patient and from this blood sample progenitor cells will be generated and differentiated into
      ACPs. The product will be administered into the obstructed coronary arteries using a
      catheter. Following injection, patients will be hospitalized for 24-48 hours in intensive
      care and later as required by their medical condition. Patients will return for follow up
      testing at one, three and six months following treatment.
