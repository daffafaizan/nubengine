    
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how 'MyPlan 2.0' helps older adults to be
      more physically active or less sedentary. Two groups will be created, an intervention group
      and a waiting-list control group. Both groups will be tested during three testing waves:
      pretest, posttest and follow-up test. Only the intervention group will be given acces to
      'MyPlan 2.0'.

      'MyPlan 2.0' consists of a website and mobile application targeting physical activity and
      sedentary behaviour. The intervention has a duration of five weeks.
