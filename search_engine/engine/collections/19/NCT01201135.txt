      activity on iron balance to be studied and has created the basis for better defining the
      erythroid regulators.

      In iron-loading anemias, ineffective erythropoiesis suppresses hepcidin production, which
      result in dysregulating iron homeostasis. Miller and co-workers showed that release of
      cytokines like growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) during the process of ineffective
      erythropoiesis inhibits hepcidin production, thus defining a molecular link between
      ineffective erythropoiesis, suppression of hepcidin production and parenchymal iron loading.
