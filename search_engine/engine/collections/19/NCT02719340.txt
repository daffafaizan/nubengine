      neurological compromise. The participants were followed-up for a period of 40.6 (24-68)
      months. A visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to
      measure back pain and disability. Radiologic assessment and neurological status were also
      analyzed.
