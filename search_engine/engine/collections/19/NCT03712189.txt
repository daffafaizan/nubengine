      either the LifeFlow® fluid delivery or an IV fluid bolus through the Alaris® pump (standard
      of care). IV fluids will be provided until the subject notes the sensation of a full bladder,
      at which point, the standard of care clinical practice is to perform the ultrasound. The
      transabdominal pelvic ultrasound requires a full bladder for optimal visualization of the
      ovaries, adnexa, and uterus, and is the only alternative to a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound
      for virginal young women. All other clinical care is per standard of care. The only research
      component is the randomization and data collection.
