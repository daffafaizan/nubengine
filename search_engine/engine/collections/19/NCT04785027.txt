      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,
      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and
      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or
      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to
      find new treatment for psoriasis.

      As current experience and cases of AD-MSCs in the treatment of psoriasis are still relatively
      small, and it is unknown about their safety and efficacy combined with traditional medicine
      in the treatment of psoriasis.

      This study designed a randomized controlled trial to compare PSORI-CM01 formula vs Guben
      Huayu formula combined with expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the
      treatment of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and
      efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic
      AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And it also aims to determine the
      feasibility and the potential of the protocol for the full-scale randomized controlled trial
      (RCT).

      Therefore, 16 subjects will be enrolled in this study and their expectations for the
      treatment of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their experience to
      participate in this study will be interviewed.
