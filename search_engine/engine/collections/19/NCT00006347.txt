        -  Determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA
           monoclonal antibody MN-14 in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  Determine the dosimetric and pharmacokinetic properties of this treatment regimen in the
           blood, normal organs, and tumors of these patients.

        -  Determine the stability and complexation with circulating carcinoembryonic antigen of
           this radioantibody in the plasma of these patients.

        -  Determine the antibody response of these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14
      (90Y-hMN-14). Patients are stratified according to prior radiotherapy (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo pretherapy imaging with indium In 111 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14 IV
      over 30-40 minutes on day -7 or -6 followed by external scintigraphy on days -7 or -6 to 0.

      Patients who show positive localization of at least one documented tumor site receive
      90Y-hMN-14 IV over 30-40 minutes on day 0.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y-hMN-14 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks; every 3 months for 2 years; and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-14
      months.
