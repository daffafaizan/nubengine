    
      This is a prospective study, where subjects for the morbidly obese group (N=60) will be
      recruited from the patients undergoing bariatric surgery according to normal treatment
      protocol and the bariatric procedure is decided on clinical data together with the bariatric
      surgeon and the patient. The morbidly obese patients are studied before and 6 months after
      bariatric surgery.

      Results of obese are compared to results of healthy subjects (N=30), who are studied once.

      MRI studies: Brain structural MRI and MRS Structural brain MRI will be performed to obtain
      anatomical reference. The MR part of a 3T PET-MR system will be used for the study . MR
      spectroscopy (MRS) will be used to determine levels of different metabolites.Brain activation
      studies (functional MRI) The aim of the fMRI is to assess how morbid obesity and weight loss
      influence the brain reward system in response to visual cues (not food related); resting
      state fMRI will also be performed.

      Brain inflammation: [¹¹C]-PK11195 tracer with PET/CT is used to determine activation of glial
      cells, or inflammation, in the brain. After intravenous injection of 500 MBq [¹¹C]-PK11195, a
      60-minute dynamic scan on the brain using the same PET/CT cameras will be performed. Both
      ROI- and SPM based statistics will be used in the statistical analyses.

      Whole-body scan with [18F]-FDG and PET/CT during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia used to promote
      tissue glucose uptake and measure insulin sensitivity. After 60 minutes from the start of
      clamp, the subjects will be injected intravenously with 150 MBq of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose
      ([18F]-FDG) Thereafter [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the brain, abdomen, femoral region
      will be measured.
