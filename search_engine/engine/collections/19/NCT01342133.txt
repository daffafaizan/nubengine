      plantar surface of newborn infants using a non-invasive confocal microscopy device (Lucid
      VivascopeÂ®). This approach has the potential to be valuable in repeated sweat endpoint
      assessments, as the device was selected based on its ease of use, the low risk to patients of
      all ages, and its ability to generate quantitative data.
