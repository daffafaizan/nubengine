      encapsulation of rocuronium and vecuronium molecules. Numerous studies show a potential role
      of magnesium in reducing anesthetic requirements, sympathetic response to surgical trauma,
      antinociceptive action and neuroprotective effects. However, its use is limited because
      magnesium potentiates non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.

      Primary outcome: evaluate the effect of pretreatment with magnesium sulfate on the time
      reversal with sugammadex (recovery of the T4/T1 ratio = 0.9) of moderate neuromuscular
      blockade (two answers to a train-of-four TOF) induced by rocuronium.

      Secondary outcome: evaluate severe respiratory events, the incidence of residual
      neuromuscular blockade in the post anesthesia recovery room and postoperative pain.
