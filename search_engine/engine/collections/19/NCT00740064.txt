           safety, and tolerability of RTG BID and ABC/3TC QD. A total of 30 subjects will be
           enrolled at 3 U.S. sites.

        -  The study includes a 30-day screening period, a treatment period (baseline through week
           48), and a follow-up visit, 2 to 4 weeks after the last study visit, as needed to
           resolve any ongoing AEs or to confirm virologic status.

      Virologic failure (VF) is defined as having either virologic non-response or virologic
      rebound. Virologic failure is confirmed by having 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA levels taken
      at least 2 weeks apart according to the following definitions:

        -  virologic rebound is defined as HIV-1 RNA level ≥400 copies/mL after initial response of
           HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL or >1 log10 copies/mL increase above nadir;

        -  virologic non-response is defined as HIV-1 RNA >400 copies/mL at week 24.

        -  Subjects will be discontinued from the study if virologic failure is confirmed. When a
           subject is suspected to have virologic failure, a confirmatory HIV-1 RNA must be
           performed at an unscheduled visit between 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the initial
           assessment, and a plasma sample collected for resistance testing.

        -  Subjects who experience symptoms consistent with a clinically suspected ABC HSR must
           permanently discontinue ABC/3TC, and will be allowed to substitute study-provided
           fixed-dose combination ZDV/3TC 150/300 mg (COMBIVIR®) BID for ABC/3TC and remain in the
           study.
