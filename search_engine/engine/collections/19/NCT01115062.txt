      70 mg/tetracaine 70 mg) with the effectiveness of a cream (LMX-4- 4% liposomal lidocaine) and
      a placebo patch applied for the same length of time in reducing pain due to needle sticks in
      children. One hundred fifty children and adolescents 5-17 years old admitted to emergency
      department or presenting to the phlebotomy lab. will be randomly placed in each group.
      Children will rate their level of pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) before the
      medication is applied, after the medication is removed and after the needle stick. Parents
      and research observer will fill out the Observed Behavioral Distress (OBD) score. The
      phlebotomist will rate how difficult it was to perform the needle sticks. Any skin reaction
      seen by the investigator after the cream or patch is removed will be noted and compared among
      the three groups.

      Subjects will be monitored from the time of enrollment to 5 minutes post phlebotomy.The Time
      Frame for which data will be presented is one (1) year.
