    
      Healthy young adult aged 18-30 years will be recruited from the College of Applied Medical
      Sciences (CAMS), King Saud University, Riyadh. Subjects will be excluded if they had a
      history of a hip or knee injury, sensory deficits in the lower extremity, a history of
      lower-extremity surgery, or a history of a quadriceps or hamstring muscle injury. The
      protocol was submitted to and approved by the Ethics Sub-Committee of Rehabilitation Research
      chair (RRC-2018-011). Participants will be requested to sign a written informed consent form
      approved by the institution ethics committee. A total of 50 participants were randomly
      assigned to the quadriceps cooling (QC: n = 10), hamstrings cooling (HC: n = 10), calf
      cooling (CC: n = 10), back muscle cooling (BC: n = 10) or control (no cooling: n = 10) group
      by a lottery method.A baseline assessment of mean center of gravity (COG), sway velocity
      (degrees/sec) for the unilateral Stance (US) will be performed. After the baseline
      assessment, a cold pack (gel pack, temperature -6 degrees to -12 degrees Celsius) will be
      placed on the target muscle for 20 minutes. One thin dry towel will be kept between the cold
      pack and the skin to prevent skin damage. Before and after the application of ice application
      the skin sensibility will be assessed by testing the participant's to a pinprick.
