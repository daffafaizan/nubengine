      observational data by creating a prospective study of incident users of oral agents. For the
      first six months the research team will ensure a protocol driven dose titration, standardised
      monitoring of adherence, response and side effects and standardised deviations from therapy.
      Thereafter patients will receive 6 monthly monitoring and further protocol led dose titration
      by the GP. Biochemistry, prescribing data, morbidity and mortality data will be captured for
      up to 10 years from drug initiation. The ROAD study will provide a highly powered prospective
      cohort to investigate phenotypic and genotypic determinants of response in its own right.
      However, this cohort will be used synergistically with ongoing observational pharmacogenetics
      studies, allowing for crucial replication of 'positive' signals. Furthermore, by
      randomisation at drug initiation, long term community follow up will allow a comparison of
      time to treatment failure in patients treated with gliclazide, pioglitazone and sitagliptin
      in a much more cost effective and 'real-world' setting than traditional prospective
      randomised trials This pilot study is to assess the feasibility of the larger complex
      intervention. The primary outcome of the pilot is HbA1c change. Other measures regarding
      recruitment and dose titration will be assessed. With knowledge from this pilot, an
      application will be made for a large region or Scotland wide study to collect 2000 patients
      incident to oral diabetes treatment.
