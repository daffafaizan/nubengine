      contraction squeezes the deep veins of the leg and pushes blood upwards, back towards the
      heart. In immobilised patients, or those with blood vessel problems, the pumping process can
      be helped by machines that either squeeze or shock the muscles of the calf (e.g. intermittent
      pneumatic compression, electrical stimulating devices). Many are licensed for medical use,
      and some are common place in hospitals and outpatient departments.
