    
      This is a Phase IV, open label, single center study of OBV/PTV/r + DSV +/- RBV for 12 or 24
      weeks for the treatment of chronic HCV-1 infection in a real world urban clinical setting.

      The study will enroll chronically infected GT 1 patients who are treatment na√Øve or who have
      failed a regimen including pegIFN/RBV +/- telaprevir, boceprevir, or simeprevir.

      In addition, up to 20 chronically infected GT1 patients who have traditionally been excluded
      from clinical trials due to mild to moderate renal insufficiency, irrespective of other
      co-morbid conditions including poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, high BMI, HIV infection
      will be enrolled.
