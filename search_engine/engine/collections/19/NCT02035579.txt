      imperative that efficacious treatment protocols be developed to reduce the morbidity
      associated with PCS in adolescents. In adolescent athletes, timely return of normal
      neurocognitive function and return to sports safely is critical to normal development. The
      proposed study will fill a critical gap by systematically evaluating the potential efficacy
      of an aerobic training intervention for management of PCS in adolescents. To our knowledge,
      this will be the first randomized controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of aerobic
      training for treatment of PCS in adolescents as soon as four weeks after injury. The study
      will also improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of PCS and the biologic influence
      of aerobic training on PCS. The proposed study will fill a critical gap and inform the
      development of larger studies to assess the efficacy, and if proven efficacious, optimize the
      timing and intensity of aerobic training treatment protocols, thus transforming the care and
      limiting the adverse public impact of this condition.
