    
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
      Research has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly infect kidney issue via the
      Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 receptor which is pH dependent. The aim of this randomised
      controlled feasibility study is to explore whether urinary alkalisation using intravenous
      bicarbonate is feasible and can reduce the risk of acute kidney injury in critically ill
      patients with COVID-19.

      Critically ill patients with COVID-19 and no AKI will be randomised to intravenous NaHCO3
      8.4% versus standard care for up to 10 days.
