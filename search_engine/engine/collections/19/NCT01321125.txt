      as for irrigation of wounds and burns. Since it has been used successfully in caring for the
      exit side of hemodialysis catheters, it is reasonable to propose its use for the insertion
      and care of central intravascular catheters, as well as for skin preparation before surgery.
      Alternatives for povidone-iodine, which is the agent most commonly used, are costly or
      ineffective. In a recent study perform by our group it was demonstrated that 10% sodium
      hypochlorite was not inferior than povidone-iodine.

      It has been demonstrated as well that 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol is
      superior to povidone-iodine. The aim of this study is to know if 10% sodium hypochlorite has
      a similar effect that the best current option for skin antisepsis.
