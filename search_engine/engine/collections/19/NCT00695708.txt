      currently one of the challenges in the treatment of the disease.

      In this study we compare effects of two computer-aided training programs. One focused on
      auditory perception and processing as a basic ability underlying higher order information
      processing.

      The other training involves a variability of cognitive abilities.

      Both trainings are computer-aided and time-intensive, including up to twenty sessions within
      four weeks.
