      conducted in T2DM subjects receiving background metformin therapy. Subjects will complete
      screening procedures to determine eligibility, followed by an 8 week metformin stabilization
      period prior to randomization. In addition, subjects taking other OADs, in combination with
      metformin, will undergo a washout during this period, in which non metformin OAD medications
      will be temporarily discontinued for the duration of the trial. Following confirmation of
      study eligibility criteria at randomization, subjects will be stratified into 2 groups based
      on the use of concomitant statin therapy. Each stratum will be randomized across treatment
      groups, such that the number of subjects taking concomitant statin therapy and those not
      taking statin therapy will be approximately balanced across treatment groups.
