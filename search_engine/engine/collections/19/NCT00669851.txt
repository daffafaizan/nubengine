    
      Because the quality of AI-700-enhanced images is in part determined by the ultrasound (US)
      settings selection, the continuing study of different imaging modes and/or techniques is
      required in order to provide US settings recommendations for the many available systems.
      Therefore AI-700-enhanced imaging was performed in this study using imaging platforms and
      modes not previously tested and the AI-700 dose and administration methods employed in
      previous Phase 3 studies.

      Two cohorts of subjects were studied at each site. Enrollment commenced with Cohort A and
      included normal (healthy) volunteers and stable cardiac patients. Settings optimization was
      performed in Cohort A using a single platform and real-time imaging. If the Sponsor agreed
      that the images and settings acquired in Cohort A were acceptable, the site was authorized to
      begin enrollment in Cohort B using the platform and settings that were defined in Cohort A.
      Authorized sites enrolled stable cardiac patients in Cohort B; no healthy volunteers were
      studied. For Cohort B subjects, the first 0.04 mL/kg dose of AI 700 was used to evaluate
      real-time imaging with the settings defined in Cohort A. The second dose of AI-700 for Cohort
      B subjects may have been used to confirm the data obtained with the first dose, or to explore
      imaging in a second mode (e.g. 3D/4D) and/or using real-time, high mechanical index triggered
      imaging on a second platform.
