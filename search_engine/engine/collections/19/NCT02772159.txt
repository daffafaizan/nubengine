    
      This is an open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period study in up to 12 healthy male subjects.
      The present study is designed to fully characterize the rates and routes of elimination of TD
      4208 using radiolabeled drug administered via the oral and IV route. This study will provide
      information regarding the metabolic fate of TD 4208, the need for evaluation of potential
      drug-drug interactions, the need for studies in special populations and the absolute oral
      bioavailability of TD-4208. The results from this study will allow a comprehensive comparison
      between animal and human routes of elimination and metabolic profiles of TD 4208.

      This study will be conducted in a small number of healthy male subjects (up to n=12) to
      minimize the number of individuals exposed to radioactivity. Each subject will receive the
      following treatments: Treatment A (Period 1): 20 μg IV infusion of [14C] TD-4208 administered
      in a fasted state over 30 minutes. Treatment B (Period 2): 200 μg oral solution of [14C]
      TD-4208 administered in a fasted state. Blood, urine, feces, and vomitus (if applicable) will
      be collected until the subject is released during Periods 1 and 2. In Periods 1 and 2,
      subjects may remain in the clinical research unit for a maximum of 15 days. Between the
      dosing in periods 1 and 2, there will be washout intervals of at least 28 days.
