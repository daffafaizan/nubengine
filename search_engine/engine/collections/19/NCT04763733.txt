      pediatric age group. Benign hematological diseases represent the main indications of that
      procedure. There are some score systems of difficulty of the technique but they are for adult
      patients. The aim is to develop a prognostic score system of LS in children with benign
      hematological diseases.

      Methods: LS was performed in all children with benign hematological diseases. LS was done by
      the same team. They operated children in lateral decubitus position. The control of pedicle
      was achieved using bipolar sealing devices, polymer clips or endoscopic linear staplers.
      Preoperative, operative, and postoperative data were recorded and analyzed. Children were
      divided into two groups A and B according to the development of complications.
