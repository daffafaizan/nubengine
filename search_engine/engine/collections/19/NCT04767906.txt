      are all specialized in treatment of patients with HCC. Once potential patients are identified
      by trial physicians, they will be asked for trial participation and informed consent by one
      investigator of the CaPture trial. Patients included within 4 weeks after diagnosis of
      failure of preceding PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory treatment.

      After baseline, visits are previewed on a 4weekly (28 days) basis during the whole duration
      of Cabozantinib study treatment, which can be used for a maximum of 12 months (336 days). The
      treatment with Cabozantinib will be performed in accordance with the valid license and
      according to the judgement of the treating physician.The tablet is taken once a day, starting
      normally with the highest dosage (60 mg). The doses 20mg and 40mg are still available and can
      be used for dose reduction. During the visits, the patient will be questioned for compliance
      and side effects and examined for clinical and laboratory parameters.

      Response to Cabozantinib should be assessed at least every 12 weeks (84 days) by either CT
      scan or MRI.

      After termination of Cabozantinib study treatment the first follow-up visit takes place one
      month after the end of therapy in person. Further follow-up visits can be done by phone to
      collect patient's status and further treatment.

      In addition to the time on treatment (TT), survival, response, feasibility, biomarkers,
      health status and safety should also be tested.
