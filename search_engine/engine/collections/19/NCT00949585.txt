      and may help prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke. In animal models, K prevented
      kidney injury and decreased kidney inflammation. CKD patients may especially benefit from
      higher K intake, due to their high prevalence of hypertension, CVD, and stroke, and the
      possibility that K may retard CKD progression. Despite these potential benefits, there is
      great uncertainty about the optimal K intake in CKD patients. K is often restricted in these
      patients due to concerns about elevating serum K. However, renal K excretion does not appear
      to be substantially impaired until the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is severely decreased
      (< 10-20 mL/min/1.73 m2). In this randomized feeding study with a two-period crossover
      design, the benefits and safety of 4 weeks of 100 mmol versus 40 mmol K/day in 26
      non-diabetic adults with stage 3 CKD (estimated GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2) will be evaluated.
      After a one-week run-in period, all participants will be randomized to receive either a diet
      containing either 40 mmol K/day or 100 mmol K/day (within the current K/DOQI recommendations
      for K intake for stage 3 CKD) during period 1 (they will receive the other during period 2).
      The primary outcome variable is 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP. Secondary outcomes are other
      measures of peripheral BP, central BP, inflammatory markers, and serum K. We hope that this
      study will lead to a larger trial with sufficient power to examine the effects of increased K
      intake on clinical outcomes such as CKD progression. The ultimate goal of this effort is to
      develop the scientific basis for guidelines on K intake in CKD.
