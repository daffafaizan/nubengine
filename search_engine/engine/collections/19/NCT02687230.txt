    
      This is an open label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation trial of a fixed dose of MVT-2163 and
      varying antibody masses of MVT-5873. The study is designed to identify an optimal dose (total
      antibody mass) and optimal timing, for tumor imaging using PET scanning. This trial will
      include a dose escalation and an expansion phase. During the dose escalation portion of the
      study, a determination of the optimal time to perform PET imaging will be made. Following the
      identification of the "optimal" dose and timing, an 10 additional subjects will be imaged
      using the best dose and timing.

      In each portion of the study subjects will have a screening visit and, no more than 28 days
      later, those who are eligible for the study will receive MVT-2163. Each cohort will have 3-6
      subjects. Subjects in cohort 1 will be administered MVT-2163 alone on day 1. Subjects in
      cohorts 2 and 3 will receive MVT-5873 on day 1, followed approximately 10 minutes later by
      MVT-2163. Subjects will return for visits to the clinic on days 2, 4, and 7 for additional
      imaging and safety assessments. A follow-up visit will occur on day 28.

      The study will also evaluate the tissue distribution and pharmacokinetics of MVT-2163 and,
      based on these data, the study will estimate the radiation dosimetry of MVT-2163. Safety
      assessments will be performed using ECGs, vital signs measurements, assessments of
      performance status, and clinical laboratory measurements.
