      I. To determine the response rate and toxicity of BMS-247550 given in two dosing schedules in
      taxane-na√Øve and taxane-exposed patients.

      II. To provide information about the response rate and toxicity of BMS-247550 given in two
      dosing schedules.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure surviving expression and correlate with the therapeutic responsiveness to
      BMS-247550.

      II. To determine the changes in tumor vascular density and endothelial cell apoptosis in
      response to therapy and the correlation of these changes to outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior taxane
      therapy (yes vs no) and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm II: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both arms, patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR
      if a minimum of 6 courses have been administered.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
