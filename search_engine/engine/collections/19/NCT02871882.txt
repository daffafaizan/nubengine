    
      This is a single-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single dose, randomized,
      controlled trial. Participants will receive 28 days (+/- 4 days) of treatment to study the
      effect of delayed (ileocolonic)-release ox bile extract 500 mg BID (twice daily) on insulin
      sensitivity, gastric emptying of liquids and solids (measured by scintigraphy) and weight
      loss I overweight and obese type 2 diabetic subjects. Participants will be receiving therapy
      with DPP4 inhibitors alone or in combination with metformin. Blood samples will be collected
      at defined times to measure glycemia, FGF-19 and incretins (GLP-1 [glucagon-like peptide-1],
      OXM [oxyntomodulin], PYY 3-36 [peptide YY]) fasting levels and responses to the meal.
