    
      -  This is a dose-escalation study in which 3 participants will be given a particular
           starting dose of RAD001 on a certain schedule. If the dose and schedule are well
           tolerated, then the next 3 participants enrolled will be assigned a new dosing schedule
           and/or a higher dose of RAD001. This will continue until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
           is reached for RAD001.

        -  Each cycle of treatment consists of 28 days on an outpatient basis. Participants will
           receive RAD001 as the assigned schedule and dosage on day 1 and on days 8 through 28 for
           the first cycle. For all subsequent cycles RAD001 will be taken once daily.
           Additionally, all participants will take PKC412 twice a day on days 2 through 28 for the
           first cycle. For all subsequent cycles PKC412 will be taken twice daily.

        -  During the course of the trial the following evaluations and procedures will be
           completed at various times: review of medical history; review of concomitant
           medications; physical exam; performance status; vital signs; EKG; chest x-ray; blood
           tests and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy.
