      recruited for the study. These patients were to undergo general anesthesia with tracheal
      intubation. starting force was 20 N in both sex. These forces were standardized by
      reproducing a new device : cricometer. The sequence of the applied forces was done by using
      the up and down method in both sex. After preoxygenation, anesthetic induction, muscular
      relaxation and mask ventilation, the study commenced. Direct laryngoscopy using the
      Glidescope video laryngoscope was performed and the view of the glottis and the esophageal
      entrance was video recorded with each CF. 2 attempts to insert a lubricated gastric tube (GT;
      size 20 F, 12 F) were carried out by a "blinded" operator in each patient. A successful
      insertion of the GT indicated a patent esophagus. When this occurred while CP was applied, it
      indicated ineffective CP. An unsuccessful insertion of the GT while CP was applied indicated
      a non-patent esophagus (effective CP). The position of the esophageal entrance relative to
      the glottis during CP was assessed from the video recordings.
