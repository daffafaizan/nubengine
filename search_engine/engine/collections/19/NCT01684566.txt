      to one of two parallel treatment groups: episil® in combination with SOC or SOC alone.

      The study was originally planned to be conducted in several sites in the following countries:
      Denmark, Israel, Poland, and Sweden. Following a country-specific Amendment on 20-Feb-2013
      and a German Ethical Committee (EC) approval in 07-May-2013, Germany was added to the list of
      countries where the study would be conducted. No study sites were initiated in Denmark.

      The study design was aimed to facilitate direct comparison of the performance of SOC +
      episil® versus SOC alone. The study was conducted in an open-label manner that is common in
      trials involving cancer patients, as this takes into the account the ethical issues involved
      in this indication and patient population. To reduce the likelihood of bias, assignment to
      study treatment was randomised.

      SOC as control group is appropriate and widely used, especially in trials involving cancer
      patients. In this particular study, basic oral hygiene consisting of brushing, flossing,
      rinsing and moisturising was taken as the SOC used as control group.
