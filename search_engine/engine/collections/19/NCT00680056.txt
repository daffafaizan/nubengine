      treatment periods separated by a 5-7 days washout phase without long-acting bronchodilators.
      Eligible patients who complete the one week screening phase will be randomized to one of two
      treatment sequences: 1) Formoterol --> Formoterol + Tiotropium or 2) Formoterol + Tiotropium
      --> Formoterol. During the treatment periods, patients will be allowed to use a short-acting
      beta2-adrenergic+short-acting anticholinergic as rescue medication (salbutamol+ipratropium
      via MDI)
