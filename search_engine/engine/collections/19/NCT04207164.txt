    
      Foot Functional Index, revised short form is a foot specific patient reported outcome
      measurement (PROM) which covers pain, stiffness, activity limitations, disability as well as
      psychosocial issues.

      The aim of this study is to translate into Norwegian and cross-culturally adapt Foot
      Functional Index revised, short form (NFFI-RS). Furthermore, the reliability, validity,
      interpretability and responsiveness will be determined.

      The Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Oslo University Hospital has an
      ongoing double blind, randomized sham-controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effect of radial
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT), sham rESWT, standardized exercise program and
      usual care for patients with longstanding plantar fasciopathy (NCT03472989). The testing of
      the psychometric properties of the NFFI-RS will include totally hundred patients, both from
      the mentioned RCT as well as patients with other foot diagnosis recruited from our
      department.

      The translation of the original FFI-RS into Norwegian has been done following the official
      guidelines.

      In the test-retest study fifty patients will complete the NFFI-RS at a one week interval.

      Smallest detectable change, measurement error, floor and ceiling effects as well as internal
      consistency will be calculated by using the baseline data. To decide the construct validity
      we will test the various hypothesis at baseline.

      To calculate the responsiveness and the minimal clinically important change three months data
      will be assessed. Patient Global Impression of Change Scale will be used to assess the
      minimal clinically important change and responsiveness of the NFFI-RS with ROC and AUC
      analyses.
