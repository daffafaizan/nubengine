    
      Endometrial biopsy is a common gynecological office procedure performed to assist in the
      pathological diagnosis of abnormal vaginal bleeding. The procedure can be painful and it may
      be difficult to obtain an endometrial sample with a hard and closed cervix. Giving
      Misoprostol before the procedure may soften the cervix sufficiently to allow an easier and
      more successful test. This medication has been tested before hysteroscopy and in some
      patients it has been shown to be beneficial.

      104 patients need to be recruited for this study. Participants will be divided according to
      pre-menopausal and post-menopausal status. Each of these groups will then be divided into a
      treatment arm (with Misoprostol) and a placebo arm. Participants will place a vaginal
      suppository containing either Misoprostol 400 ug or a placebo 12h or more before their
      appointment for the endometrial biopsy.
