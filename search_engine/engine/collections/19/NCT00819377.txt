      as the security of Milrinone, used in inhalation, to diminish the degree of pulmonary
      hypertension before the cardiopulmonary bypass (ECC) circulation. In addition, the
      pharmacokinetic and echo graphic repercussions of administering the medication will be
      analysed. At the present time, there is no data on the pharmacokinetics of the medication
      when it's administered through inhalation. For this reason, we would like to study the serous
      rate of the medication in the minutes following its administration through inhalation.
