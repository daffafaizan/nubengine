      can recognize and distinguish the odor of their mother from their father and others.
      Premature infants are capable of smelling and they experience less pain and agitation when
      they smell their mother's milk; studies have shown that premature infants have better sucking
      and feeding, and they may go home earlier when they are exposed to the odor of breast milk.
      It is not known whether the same will happen if preterm infants are exposed to their mother's
      smell rather than the smell of the maternal milk.
