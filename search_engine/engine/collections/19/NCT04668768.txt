      a regimen containing high dose methotrexate (HD MTX), which requires inpatient monitoring in
      order to ensure adequate clearance of methotrexate levels (MTX). The goal of this
      prospective, multi-institution study is to evaluate the effect of prophylactic glucarpidase
      in patients receiving high dose MTX and are at increased risk of delayed MTX clearance and
      nephrotoxicity. Glucarpidase is a recombinant bacterial enzyme (carboxypeptidase G2) that can
      convert MTX to non-cytotoxic metabolites (DAMPA). This is the first controlled trial
      comparing glucarpidase with supportive care alone in patients with MTX induced nephrotoxicity
      and delayed MTX clearance.
