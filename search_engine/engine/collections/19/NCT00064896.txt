      such as coronary artery angioplasty and stenting. These procedures generally can be conducted
      on awake patients with few complications, and were developed as alternatives to conventional
      open surgery. Conventional cardiovascular interventional procedures are conducted by
      physicians manipulating medical devices inside patients under the guidance of fluoroscopic
      x-ray.

      We are developing minimally-invasive cardiovascular interventional procedures using real-time
      magnetic resonance imaging, also known as MR Fluoroscopy. These procedures have the advantage
      of excellent imaging without surgery and without radiation exposure or toxic contrast agents
      (dyes). Moreover, because MR Fluoroscopy can produce excellent images of soft tissue, blood,
      and of three-dimensional structures, it may be possible to guide minimally-invasive
      procedures not possible even with invasive surgery.

      The goal of this protocol is to develop and test incremental technical advances in patients.
