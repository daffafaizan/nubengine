      Macroglobulinaemia or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia will be entered into this study.

      For the vast majority of patients, B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic
      leukaemia are incurable using existing therapeutic approaches.

      Although anti-CD20 directed therapy has improved outcomes, more than fifty percent of
      patients still relapse following treatment or are refractory to it and therefore additional
      novel non-cross resistant therapies are urgently required.

      DI-B4 is a humanised, low-fucosylated anti-CD19 Immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody
      with potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) but minimal complement
      dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The target antigen, CD19, is the canonical B-cell marker that
      is expressed on all B-cells including the malignant B-cells in NHL, CLL and acute
      lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The CD19 antigen is therefore an attractive B-cell lineage
      specific target for monoclonal antibody therapy. DI-B4 is expected to act through the
      depletion of normal and malignant CD19 positive cells, primarily via ADCC.

      This is a multi-centre, Phase I, dose escalation/dose expansion study. For the first three
      cohorts, an intra-patient dose escalation scheme will be followed unless a DLT is observed.
      From Cohort 4 onwards, a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schedule of DI-B4 will be continued
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined, up to a maximum dose of 1000mg.
