      due to lower levels of androgens in this patient population. Previous studies have shown that
      long-term opiate use may lead to narcotic induced hypogonadism, resulting in significantly
      decreased testosterone levels in men. One area of chronic opiate use that has not been looked
      at extensively is the correlation between narcotic-induced hypogonadism and associated side
      effects such as osteoporosis and sexual dysfunction in male patients receiving methadone
      maintenance therapy. Marked testosterone deficiency is a well-established rick factor for
      both osteoporosis and altered sexual function, and recent information demonstrated that
      altered estrogen levels may play a role in these side effects as well. Thre present pilot
      study investigates the role of sex steroids in male patients maintained on methadone therapy
      and their association with bone densitometry and sexual dysfunction. Free testosterone,
      estradiol, lutenizing hormone, sex hormone binding globulin, Vitamin D levels and albumin
      will be measured in thirty community-dwelling outpatient men participating in a methadone
      maintenance program as well as thirty age-matched controls from a general medicine clinic.
      Osteodensitometry will be performed with the DEXA technique at the lumbar spine. Participants
      will also complete the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory as well as be assessed for
      smoking/alcohol use, calcium intake, physical activity, length of time receiving opiates as
      well as concurrent medications. It is hypothesized that patients receiving methadone
      maintenance therapy will have lower bone mass densities, free testosterone, estradiol, and
      sexual dysfunction scores than the age-matched controls.
