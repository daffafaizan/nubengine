    
      The Main Purpose of the Study:

      - Evaluation of efficacy of Vaccae to prevent Tuberculosis in high risk groups of
      Tuberculosis Infection.

      The Secondary Purpose of the Study:

        -  Evaluation of Lesion Degree ( Bacteriology Indicators, Cavity) of patients and its
           relationship with Skin Test results of TB-PPD after Injection of Vaccae into the high
           risk groups.

        -  Evaluation of Changes in Humoral Immunity and Cellular Immunologic Response Before and
           After Injection of Vaccae

      Test Hypothesis:

      In the test, TB incidence and degree of pathological changes of experimental group are lower
      than that of control group, and no drug-related SAEs are reported in treatment groups

      Blinding and Random:

      Using random, double-blind, and placebo-controlled methods, evaluation of the efficacy and
      safety of Vaccae.

      Using block randomization method, a random sequence was generated by the statistics personnel
      in Fourth Military Medical University Clinical Evaluation Center using SAS9.1.3 statistical
      software

      The Unblinding includes the first time of Unblinding and the second time of Unblinding. The
      first time of Unblinding only distinguish groups , and the second time of Unblinding will
      uncover the final Blind Codes.

      The Blind Codes of the design produce at one time, and unblinding will be carried out
      respectively at the first year and the second year after the beginning of the experiment.
