      intensities. Low glycogen content (stored form of carbohydrates in the body) is associated
      with fatigue. Thus, greater initial glycogen content has been associated with better
      performance not only in high intensity intermittent sports, but also in prolonged endurance
      sports. Dose-response studies have determined that ingestion of 1.2 g·kg-1·h-1 of CHO is the
      appropriate acute recovery dose to optimize glycogen repletion, with no apparent benefit at
      higher doses. Protein in combination with CHO has also been proposed to enhance glycogen
      resynthesis when 1 part protein is provided with ~4 parts CHO. Both strategies, optimal CHO
      intake and CHO in combination with protein for glycogen resynthesis, have resulted in better
      exercise performance a few hours after a depleting exercise bout. A recent study provided
      athletes with ketone esters in a drink after glycogen depleting exercise and found that in
      the presence of high glucose availability, ketone esters increased glycogen stores by 50%
      compared to a no ketone, high carbohydrate treatment. However, the authors of this study
      provided a large quantity of carbohydrates intravenously to maintain blood glucose at 10Mm/L.
      Consequently, it is unknown whether or not ingesting glucose at the optimal dosage would have
      the same effect. Furthermore, it is unclear whether or not this difference would translate
      into improved performance in efforts of more moderate duration. Therefore, the purpose of
      this study is to assess the effect of glucose-ketone supplementation on a 20 km cycling time
      trial with a 2-hour feeding during a 4-hour recovery period following glycogen depleting
      exercise.
