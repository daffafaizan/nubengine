      disease. Familial PD (FPD) has its unique clinical feature and genetic basis. We aim to
      establish a database of FPD,and characterize the clinical feature, genetic basis,
      environmental factors and their interactions FPD in China.

      Method:

        1. Clinical feature will be measured by scales and neurological tests.Standard scales
           includes: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS), Hoehn-Yahr stages, NMSS,
           MMSE, PDSS(Parkinson disease sleep scales),Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder
           Questionnaire(RBDQ-HK),ESS(Epworth Sleepiness Scale),Rome III functional constipation
           scale，SCOPA-AUT (the Scale for Outcomes in PD for Autonomic Symptoms)，PFS(Parkinson
           Fatigue Scale)，CH-RLSq，Hyposmia rating scale(HRS)HAMILT depression scale，the 39-item
           Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire(PDQ-39)，Freezing of gait scale(FOG)，dyskinesia related
           scales, Wearing-off scale(WO)

        2. Peripheral blood from patients and other members in family will be collected for
           familial PD genetic testing.

        3. The environmental factors are exploded by questionnaires including smoking,drinking,
           pesticide and heavy metals.
