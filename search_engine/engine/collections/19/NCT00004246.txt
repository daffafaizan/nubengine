      the sixth and seventh weeks of radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell
      carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx, based on the systemic toxicity of the drug
      and the acute mucosal reactions in the irradiated fields. II. Document the qualitative and
      quantitative toxicity of this combination therapy in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of fludarabine. Patients receive radiotherapy on
      days 1-5 for 7 weeks. Patients receive fludarabine IV on days 1-5 of weeks 6 and 7 of
      radiotherapy. Fludarabine is administered 3-4 hours prior to daily radiotherapy. Cohorts of 3
      patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose that produces a severe toxicity rate nearest to
      20%. Patients are followed every 4 weeks after the completion of treatment until acute
      reactions have resolved, then every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and then
      every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
