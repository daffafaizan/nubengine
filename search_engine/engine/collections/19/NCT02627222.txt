      pro-vitamin A rich cassava during 10 weeks on body retinol pools of 3-4 year old children in
      Nigeria after high-dose vitamin A supplementation. The secondary objectives are: 1) To
      investigate the effect of daily consumption of pro-vitamin A rich cassava on functional
      indicators such as nutritional anaemia and gut integrity; 2) To investigate the effect of
      zinc deficiency and genetic polymorphisms in the Beta-Carotene Oxygenase 1 (BCO1) and related
      genes on the efficacy of pro-vitamin A rich cassava consumption; 3) To compare the skin
      colour in the palm of the hand of each participant with their serum retinol levels using a
      handheld non-invasive spectrophotometer.

      Study design: Open-label (single-blinded) randomized controlled trial with two parallel
      groups Study population: Pre-school children, aged 3-4 years living in Osun State area,
      South-Western Nigeria. Children (n=750) will be screened for eligibility. Out of these, n=250
      will undergo a 4-week run-in phase. n=200 children will be randomly allocated to two
      different treatments: 1) Yellow cassava providing ~50% of the recommended daily allowance
      (RDA) for vitamin A; 2) White cassava.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome was the difference in body retinol pools
      between groups 1 and 2 at the end of intervention; however, due to the inability to assess
      body retinol pools, the modified primary outcome is the difference in serum retinol
      concentrations between groups 1 and 2. Other outcome measures include: other vitamin A status
      indicators (Î²-carotene, retinol binding protein, transthyretin), inflammatory markers, iron
      status indicators, anthropometrics, gut integrity, and thyroid function.
