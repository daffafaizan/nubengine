      hospital validated RT-PCR detection standard. Nasopharyngeal, nasal and saliva samples will
      be collected along with hospital standard of care collection. Nasal and saliva will be
      self-administered collection. Samples will be collected in an Emergency Room setting from up
      to 100 subjects who entered the hospital over concerns about SARS-CoV-2. The goal is to
      collect a minimum of N=30 confirmed Covid-19 positive subjects and N=30 confirmed Covid-19
      negative subjects of comparable ages, genders and races. The SARS-CoV-2 Direct Antigen Rapid
      Test ("DART") is an immunoassay for point-of-care, qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral
      particles/secreted protein in nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected patients with Coronavirus
      Disease 2019 or COVID-19 infection. Dipsticks are printed with a monoclonal antibody that
      binds the signature SARS-CoV-2 viral particles/protein (Test line) and a control antibody
      (Control line) for quality control. A second monoclonal antibody is attached to gold
      nanoparticles (conjugate) and quencher buffer, and mixed with the patient samples, though in
      the near future the final format will contain the dry conjugate. The SARS-CoV-2 viral
      particles/Spike protein attach to both antibodies resulting in a visual line on the test
      strip within 15 minutes. Prior experience for detection virus and viral proteins via antibody
      binding using lateral flow are E25Bio portfolio platform for dengue, Zika and Chikungunya
      viruses among others.
