    
      Patients All patients starting active end stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment at the
      participating centres and their satellite centres.

      No. Patients: 1000.

        1. Patients who have received their recent predialysis care at another centre can be
           included if the previous centre's notes are available, otherwise not.

        2. Patients receiving a preemptive transplant are included, even if the transplant is
           performed at another centre. A patient questionnaire is not required for these patients.

        3. Africans are excluded (inaccurate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
           calculation) Each patient is allocated a local identity number (1,2,3â€¦.). The local
           author keeps a registry of the true patient identity of each identity number for
           follow-up purposes. This registry is not to be used in any communication outside the
           centre.

      Comment: Most patients have known chronic uremia at dialysis start. In a few cases, it is
      unknown whether the uremia is acute or chronic. There are two main groups:

        1. Acute uremia of unknown origin. Doctors should fill the questionnaire in Table 2, which
           can be discarded if the patient recovers renal function within three months.

        2. Acute kidney injury (AKI). Most of these patients will recover within three months, so
           the questionnaire can wait, and be filled in retrospectively for the few remaining
           patients.

      Methods

      Responsibilities National coordinators are responsible for translation of protocol to local
      language, and compliance with any necessary national regulatory requirements (data protection
      agency, ethical committee?) Local representatives: local coordination and follow-up. Patient
      notes review. Additional secretarial assistance, paid or unpaid, is permitted.

      Definitions

      ESRD

      A patient has ESRD if any of the following:

        1. He receives a transplant

        2. The doctor "believes" that he has ESRD at first dialysis

        3. He has received >90 days dialysis

        4. If the doctor is in doubt whether the patient has acute or chronic renal failure, the
           patient is registered as soon as there is no doubt that the patient has ESRD For 3 & 4,
           registration is performed retrospectively from the first dialysis day.

      Planned dialysis

      The patient's first dialysis is planned if:

        1. His first hemodialysis uses an AV fistula

        2. His first hemodialysis uses a permanent catheter as the patient's permanent access

        3. His first peritoneal dialysis is >6 days after catheter placement.

      The patient's first dialysis is unplanned if:

        1. His first hemodialysis uses a temporary catheter

        2. His first hemodialysis uses a permanent catheter as the patient's temporary access (i.e.
           a later AV fistula is planned.

        3. His first peritoneal dialysis is <7 days after catheter placement.

      besides the primary reason for starting dialysis today. Put a "2" besides a (possible)
      secondary reason for starting dialysis today. Put a "X" besides any other reasons that have
      been important in influencing your decision to prescribe dialysis today.
