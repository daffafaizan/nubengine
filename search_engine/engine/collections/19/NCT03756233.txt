      both groups, anesthesia was maintained with total intravenous anaesthesia(TIVA) to keep
      bispectral index values between 40 and 60.

      In the Remifentanil gradual reduction group (test group), 20 minutes before the end of the
      operation, remifentanil was gradually decreased by 25% every 5 minutes. The control group
      stopped remifentanil 10 minutes before the end of the operation.

      SPI was recorded before the intubation, after the intubation, directly before the end of
      surgery. The number of unwanted somatic events, hemodynamics, Patient-controlled
      analgesia(PCA) consumption, narcotic analgesics consumption, and recovery times were
      recorded.
