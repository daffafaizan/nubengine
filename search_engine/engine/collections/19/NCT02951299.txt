      days) decrease in renal function, which is a common and important diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge for clinicians. The disorder has a frequency of 7.0 % in hospital inpatients and is
      especially common in critically ill patients, in whom the prevalence of acute kidney injury
      is greater than 40% at admission to the intensive care unit if sepsis is present. AKI is
      independently associated with important morbidity and mortality although many efforts have
      been used in past years. Therefore, alternative strategies are required to confer better or
      more complete renoprotection for those who suffered from AKI.

      There had been many studies demonstrated that the phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline
      (PTX) is a potent anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-fibrotic agent capable of
      attenuating experimental renal disease such as drugs, ischemic and sepsis induced AKI. We
      thus hypothesized that PTX may have therapeutic value for AKI in human. We thereby design
      this controlled, non-randomized clinical trial, aiming at investigating the potential
      renoprotective efficacy of PTX, as compared to placebo, in 200 patients with AKI.
