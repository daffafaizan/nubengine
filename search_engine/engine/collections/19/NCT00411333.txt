      prior to the pathological neovascularization seen in proliferative disease that results in
      blindness in more than 50 percent of patients, and whether the adverse, early vascular
      remodeling and neovascularization can be reversed by anti-angiogenic therapeutics. We have
      shown that vascular density decreases during early stages of diabetic retinopathy, prior to
      the pathological neovascularization that defines proliferative retinopathy, and that this
      change may be reversible with new anti-angiogenic therapeutics. To test this hypothesis we
      will determine (1) how blood vessels remodel and whether vascular density truly decreases
      during diabetic retinopathy and (2) how the anti-angiogenic steroid triamcinolone acetonide
      affects vascular density and pattern during human diabetic retinopathy and in our
      experimental model, the avian CAM model.

      Twenty patients (n = 20) for each of the 4 NPDR stages will be enrolled. In addition, a
      control group of 20 normal subjects will be recruited from the same clinical practice that do
      not have diabetes and no evidence of any vascular disease, for a total of 100 patients in the
      clinical trial.
