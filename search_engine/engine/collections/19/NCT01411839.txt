      medication monitoring and reminder system (MedSignalsÂ®) in the form of an electronic pillbox
      with monitoring and reminding functions that is available in a Spanish-language version. Our
      hypotheses are grounded in a conceptual model proposing that the CBT-AD intervention will
      improve problem-solving ability and decrease depressive symptomatology, which will directly
      improve biomedical outcomes of HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 as well as indirectly improve
      biomedical outcomes through increased motivation, improved memory, and better medication
      adherence. Evaluating and implementing generalizable and sustainable mental health and
      adherence interventions such as the ones proposed are urgently needed in the region to
      improve HIV treatment outcomes and thwart the development and transmission of drug resistant
      virus.
