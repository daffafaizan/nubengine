      phase: The volunteers are applying a commercially available sunscreen lotion containing
      titanium dioxide nano particles 6 times a day for one week in an area of the back that is
      30x20 cm. Before the first application a 2mm punch biopsy is to be taken and examined by
      scanning electron microscopy. After applying sunscreen lotion for a week, a new biopsy will
      be taken in order to see how far down in the skin the particles have penetrated. In the
      second phase: An artificial sunburn will be induced in the same area of the back. They will
      thereafter apply the sunscreen lotion 6 times a day like in the first phase. After two days
      (estimated time of maximum skin irritation) a biopsy will be taken in order to see if the
      nanoparticles have penetrated down in the layers of the skin, and the investigators will also
      take a biopsy after a full week of applying the sunscreen lotion. The investigators will also
      examine the urine, before and after the use of sunscreen, to see if the investigators can
      find the particles there.
