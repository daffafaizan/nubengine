      transporters. Pharmacogenetics is one of the first clinical applications of the Human Genome
      Project. Pharmacogenomics is the study of the role of interindividual genomics variability on
      drug response, efficacy, and metabolism. It correlates the effects of the entire expressed
      genome to the clinical usefulness and toxicity of a drug. Pharmacogenomics has the potential
      to change the way patients' therapy is optimized, allowing an era of "personalized medicine"
      in which patients will be divided into groups based on genetic markers that treatment
      outcomes.
