      against COVID-19 in vitro. The investigators aim to study the security and efficacy of this
      drug in trough a double blinded randomized clinical trial. Recruited patients with severe
      respiratory disease from COVID-19 will be randomized to an intervention group (400mg per day
      dose of hydroxychloroquine) and placebo. The investigators' main outcome will be all cause
      hospital mortality. The investigators hypothesize that a 400mg per day dose of
      hydroxychloroquine for 10 days will reduce all-cause hospital mortality in patients with
      severe respiratory COVID-19 disease. Results will be compared in an intention to treat
      analysis. All clinical, analysis and data team members will be blinded to treatment
      assignment.
