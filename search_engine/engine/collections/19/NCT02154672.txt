      in a population of BRCA2 carriers. All men identified to have a BRCA2 mutation as part of the
      Yale Cancer Genetic Counseling Program will be approached and offered participation in the
      study via our program newsletter, BRCA listserv, Facebook page and a targeted mailing.

      Standard of care screening at the Yale Cancer Center for men with a normal prostate cancer
      risk consists of a PSA test and prostate physical examination beginning at age 50 years and
      if either is abnormal an MRI of the prostate followed by Fusion-targeted biopsy of the
      prostate is performed.
