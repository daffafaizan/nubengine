      autoimmune inflammation is very often a chronic disease which causes irreversible articular
      damage. Rheumatoid arthritis is very often a painful and disabling disease if the treatment
      turns out to be ineffectual. Several of the available remedies can not treat the disease
      totally but only keep the patients in check.

      The biological mechanisms which cause an autoimmune inflammatory articular disease have not
      been proved scientifically yet. Under normal conditions, the immune system adapts easily in
      order to protect the body against pathogenic bacteria and virus without causing damage on the
      body's own cells. Autoimmune inflammatory diseases displace this balance in a way so that the
      immune system can not distinguish between "self" and "non-self". Different kinds of cells are
      involved in this chronic inflammation in the joints. Majority of these cells belong to the
      heart of the immune response, for example T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, macrophages,
      dendrites and granulocytes. However, other cells are also involved, for example synovial
      fibroblasts and endothelium.

      It is very important to understand the interaction of these cells in order to develop new
      medicinal products for inflammatory articular diseases. The big challenge for conduction
      research in inflammatory articular diseases is to achieve more evidence-based knowledge of
      the synovial tissue from the patients and the control group.
