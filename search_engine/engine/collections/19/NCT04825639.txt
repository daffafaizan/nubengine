      cohorts of sepsis and Diabetic Ketoacidosis ( DKA). In addition we aim to evaluate the
      relation with hyperchloremia. In both groups, attempts will be made to evaluate the
      association of risk factors such as severity of dehydration/shock and hyperchloremia with AKI
      in the two groups.

      Data will be analysed using SPSS software. Categorical variables will be analysed using
      Chi-square test and if appropriate, multiple logistic regression analysis. Continuous
      variable will be analysed with Student's T test and if possible, by linear regression
      modelling. The differences between the two groups may analysed using Analysis of Variance
      (ANOVA).

      The study will collect anonymous data from 2015 to 2020 from the Paediatric Intensive Care
      Audit Network (PICANet) database for a tertiary PICU servicing the pediatric population of
      Wales.This data is submitted prospectively for audit of clinical outcomes of children
      admitted for paediatric intensive care in the United Kingdom. The study was reviewed by the
      Institutional Research and Development department and was given exemption for ethics
      committee review as it does not involve direct patient contact and the data is anonymous.
      Approval was obtained from the relevant database manager, institutional information
      governance department as well as the Health Care Research Wales.
