      COVID-19. This is attributed to a severe reaction where releases too many cytokines (proteins
      that play an important role in immune responses) which rush into the lungs resulting in lung
      inflammation and fluid buildup. This can lead to damage to the lungs and leading to breathing
      problems. Ruxolitinib when given early in the disease, may prevent the overproduction of
      cytokines which, in turn, may prevent lung damage.
