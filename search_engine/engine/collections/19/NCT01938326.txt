      laparoscopic surgery.

      Recently, Beyond laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG), which has the
      mini-laparotomy, TLDG, which has no mini-laparotomy in epigastrium but in umbilicus, has been
      popular procedure in the treatment of gastric cancer. Furthermore, the report on early
      experience of SIDG, which has no incision except umbilicus port, is going to be published.

      However, there've been no objective reports and data on real minimal invasiveness and
      benefits between 2 procedures. In this study, I would like to find out the benefits of the
      reducing port and wound size by comparing the above 2 procedures' immune response and
      postoperative complications.

      This study is planned as a phase II study.

      There are no references on this subject, so the investigators set the numbers of each groups
      into 30, which is minimal requirement for the parametric comparisons.
