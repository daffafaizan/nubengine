      treatment (ART) are candidates for surgical sperm retrieval with the aid of microdissection.
      We believe that this approach may currently be the best option for these subjects.

      We evaluated our surgical sperm retrieval rate associated to their serum LH, FSH, TOTAL
      TESTOTERONE and PROLACTIN levels, pre-operative testicular volume and also compared to the
      post-operative histological analysis of fixed testicular tissue specimens collected during
      the procedure, stained with haematoxylin and eosin.

      We also evaluated the outcomes using ICSI based ART for these couples observing mean ICSI and
      fertilized oocytes, number and quality of embryos transferred, implantation and pregnancy
      rates.
