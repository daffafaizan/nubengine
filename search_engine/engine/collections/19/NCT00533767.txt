      virus (ANDV) is the primary pathogen in Chile and Argentina. This is a prospective
      observational study to access the incidence of and risk factors associated with transmission
      of HCPS to close household contacts from HCPS index cases including examination of the
      shedding of virus in various body fluids as a factor in transmissibility. The study will
      enroll 76 cardiopulmonary syndrome HCPS index cases and 140 of their close household
      contacts, age 2 and older, at risk for contracting HCPS.

      The index cases will participate for the initial visit; the household contact participants
      will be followed for 35 days. The primary objectives of this study are: to estimate the
      secondary attack rate of hantavirus infection among close household contacts of an HCPS case
      after one incubation period of follow up; to use personal interviews and questionnaires to
      assess and compare risk activities and demographic factors in close household contacts who
      develop HCPS with those contacts who do not identify specific high-risk activities such as
      exposure to saliva or respiratory secretions; to use personal interviews and questionnaires
      to assess and compare risk activities and demographic factors in index cases (the first case
      in the household) versus household contacts who do not develop HCPS; and to determine the
      prevalence of hantavirus in various body fluids in index patients with HCPS and in household
      contacts who acquire infection and consequently determine any association of presence of
      virus in a body fluid with phase of infection.

      Both infectious virus (culture) and viral genomic RNA (quantitative RT-PCR) will be measured.
      The secondary objectives of this study will be: to determine the quantity of hantavirus in
      various body fluids in index patients with HCPS and in household contacts that acquire
      infection and consequently determine any association of presence of virus in a body fluid
      with phase of infection. Both infectious virus (culture) and viral genomic RNA (quantitative
      RT-PCR) will be measured; to develop a predictive statistical model where the epidemiological
      and the virological variables (cultures, ANDV antibodies, PCR, neutralizing antibodies, HSV 1
      and 2 antibodies) could be scored and used to predict a new case within a household group; to
      determine the feasibility of rapid viral diagnostic testing to determine whether virologic
      results can be obtained sufficiently in advance of the onset of illness to permit more
      effective triage of patients who are indeed about to develop HCPS; and to determine the
      sequences of ANDV from index and additional cases to establish the extent of sequence
      identity from viruses within and outside of family clusters.

      The primary endpoints of this study are: to determine the incidence of additional cases of
      hantavirus (ANDV) among close household contacts of a confirmed index case during a complete
      incubation period of follow up; evaluate risk activities and demographic factors associated
      with increased risk of transmission of ANDV between index cases and members of households and
      their respective index cases; measure risk activities and demographic factors associated with
      increased risk of acquisition of ANDV from environmental sources by comparing index cases
      with household contacts that do and do not develop HCPS; and determine the presence of virus
      and measure of viral RNA in body fluids over time in index cases and in additional cases in
      household contacts.

      The secondary endpoints will be: to determine the most sensitive culture approach for
      detection of ANDV in body fluids at different stages of infection; identify the best model to
      predict the occurrence of an additional case within a family group; evaluate nucleotide
      similarity as ancillary marker to enrich or de-enrich the probability of person to person
      transmission of AND virus. The duration of this study is expected to be 3 years.
