      (n=40). The mothers of one of the groups of premature newborn children will receive an oral
      supplementation by means of capsules with high dose of DHA (900 mg/day) during the lactation
      (minimum period of 3 months). In addition, all the groups will be underwent to a nutritional
      surveillance (a follow-up of 48 hours and a questionnaire of frequency of consumption) and
      will be given nutritionally-balanced diets, insisting especially in the suitable consumption
      of fish (4 portions/week). Blood samples will be obtained in all the groups at the birth
      moment, at the week 40 of gestational age corrected in the groups of premature babies and at
      the end of the lactation in all the groups (minimum 3 months).We will obtain samples of
      motherÂ´s milk (colostrum, transition and mature milk). In these samples we will study bone
      turnover biomarkers, pro - and anti-inflammatory citoquines and markers of aggression
      oxidative damage. In addition, we will perform psychomotor and visual development tests in
      the newborn children.
