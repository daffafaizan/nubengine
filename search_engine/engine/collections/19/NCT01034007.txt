      safety of the use of tissue engineered vascular grafts as conduits for EC TCPC. Primary end
      points of the study will include determination of graft failure rates and graft related
      morbidity and mortality. Graft failure will be defined as any graft narrowing/occlusion or
      dilation/rupture requiring surgical or endovascular intervention. Graft related morbidity and
      mortality will include any post-operative complication such as any thromboembolic or
      infectious event that requires treatment and is thought likely to be caused by the tissue
      engineered vascular graft as determined by the investigators and confirmed by the data safety
      monitoring board. All appropriate patients requiring EC TCPC who meet study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated for enrollment in the clinical trial. After
      obtaining informed consent from the patient's parents, patients with single ventricle cardiac
      anomalies will undergo EC TCPC using a tissue engineered conduit. Post-operative care and
      monitoring will follow an established, standardized, clinical algorithm in which the
      patient's clinical status including complications and measurements of graft function will be
      serially evaluated and recorded over a three year period using physical examination,
      echocardiography, and MRA.
