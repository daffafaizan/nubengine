      POEMS(Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes),
      or myeloma plus amyloidosis and have had no more than 12 months of prior treatment.
      Furthermore, participants cannot have had a prior autologous or allogeneic transplant. The
      study schema consists of one round of induction chemotherapy, two transplants, one round of
      consolidation chemotherapy, and two years of maintenance treatment. This study design differs
      from its historical predecessors in the following manner:

        -  In contrast to Total Therapy II and III, which only allow enrollment of patients with
           one cycle or one month of treatment prior to enrollment, the proposed study allows
           enrollment of participants with up to 12 months of prior treatment.

        -  Induction therapy has been reduced to a single cycle.

        -  Bortezomib and thalidomide have been added to the transplant regimen.

        -  Carmustine is added to the second transplant.

        -  Gemcitabine is added to the second transplant regimen.

        -  Consolidation treatment has been reduced to a single cycle.

        -  The first year of maintenance consists of 12 28-day cycles of bortezomib,dexamethasone,
           and either thalidomide, lenalidomide, or cyclophoshamide. The second year of maintenance
           therapy consists of lenalidomide and dexamethasone.

        -  The novel agents thalidomide and bortezomib are not introduced upfront, but only with
           transplantation, consolidation, and maintenance.
