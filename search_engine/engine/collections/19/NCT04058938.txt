      opioid pain medication use. It is known that the quality of pain control after surgery is a
      large factor of the patient's perception of their experience. However, little research has
      been done to improve pain control in plastic surgery patients. To the investigators
      knowledge, no study has yet looked at education of breast surgery patients to improve pain
      experience. The study goal is to survey breast surgery patients in the Plastic Surgery
      department before and after surgery to evaluate the participants experience with pain and
      pain medications. Half of the participants in the study will be randomized to receive an
      information sheet about pain control at the participants pre-operative appointment.
