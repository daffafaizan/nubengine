      randomly assigned to receive a dose of either 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, or 120 IU of NovoLog
      insulin aspart prior to being randomized into participating in a 20 minute session of either
      moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or a passive control condition. The efficacy of the
      intranasal insulin for inducing alterations in cognition will be assessed using both
      behavioral and neuroelectric measures. The safety of the protocol will be assessed using a
      symptom questionnaire assessing common symptoms of altered blood glucose and common side
      effects of intranasal insulin.
