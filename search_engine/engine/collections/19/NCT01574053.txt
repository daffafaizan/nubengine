      and systematically collected clinical research data (demography, clinical features, family
      history, genetic characteristics) and biological specimens (blood) from individuals with
      manifest HD, unaffected individuals known to carry the HD mutation or at risk of carrying the
      HD mutation, and control research participants (e.g., spouses, siblings or offspring of HD
      mutation carriers known not to carry the HD mutation). Enroll-HD is conceived as a
      broad-based and long-term project to maximize the efficiencies of non-clinical research and
      participation in clinical research. With 158 active clinical sites in 19 countries, Enroll-HD
      is now the largest HD database available and is accessible to any interested researcher -
