      Supported Employment interventions (i.e., Individual Placement and Supports) elicit benefit
      for those with mental health conditions in getting and keeping productive work. Similarly,
      previous research demonstrates that Supported Education has efficacy in helping young adults
      with mental health conditions in their academics. However, to date, no evidence-based
      practice exists which combines both supported education and supported employment
      interventions into a single model that has efficacy and utility for young adults with serious
      mental health conditions. Supported Education has been fruitful for navigating academics, but
      hasn't demonstrated efficacy for supporting young adults with their careers, and Supported
      Employment programs, like IPS, have shown poor efficacy for helping young adults, as it was
      designed to assist mature adults. Therefore, the HYPE Model will become the first
      evidence-informed intervention to combine Supported Employment and Supported Education
      paradigms in an effort to help young adults with mental health conditions successfully
      navigate college so they can move into a primary labor market career and attain economic
      self-sufficiency.
