      potential in the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer. This trial is
      designed as a prospective, open label study for 20 patients with advanced (recurrent,
      refractory or metastatic) endometrial cancer, including carcinosarcoma of the uterus. The aim
      is to investigate the efficacy of the combination therapy of Lenvatinib 80-120mg daily orally
      and durvalumab 1500mg by IV infusion every 4 weeks in terms of progression free survival.
