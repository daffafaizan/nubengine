        -  Determine the efficacy and safety of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
           transplantation in achieving engraftment in patients with hematologic malignancy.

        -  Determine the hematopoietic recovery, incidence of chemoradiotherapeutic toxicity,
           relapse, graft-versus-host disease, and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive a preparative chemoradiotherapeutic regimen and graft-versus-host
      disease prophylaxis prior to transplantation. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood
      stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      Patients are followed every 1-2 weeks for 6 months and at 9, 12, 24, and 36 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
