      contributed to a considerable reduction in mortality rates,however, with the increase in
      diseases that contribute to morbidity and mortality, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia
      (BPD). Such condition is defined by the need for supplemental oxygen and/or ventilatory
      support for more than 28 days.One of the complications of BPD is the inability to maintain
      differences in tonus patterns(extensor and flexor) between the cervical muscles, upper and
      lower limbs, which can be assessed by surface electromyography (EMG). Babies who develop BPD
      remain in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a prolonged period of time, undergoing
      a large number of painful procedures.Exposure to pain in premature newborns (PTNB) is one of
      the most damaging factors in the extrauterine environment, also causing stress, which can be
      measured by salivary cortisol.Studies with pain relief methods in these babies are needed,
      such as hydrotherapy.This approach has proven to be effective and safe in reducing the signs
      of pain and stress and to improve sleep quality in preterm infants in the NICU, besides
      improving physiological parameters, such as peripheral oxygen saturation. OBJECTIVES: To
      evaluate the effects of hydrotherapy on muscular activity, pain, sleep and wakefulness,
      stress, physiological conditions and the need for oxygen in PTNB with BPD during
      hospitalization in the neonatal unit. METHODOLOGY: PTNB with a diagnosis of BPD will be
      randomized into two groups: conventional physiotherapy (GP) and conventional physiotherapy
      plus hydrotherapy (GH). The PTNB randomized to GH will be submitted to 11 hydrotherapy
      sessions. The PTNB from both groups will be submitted to evaluation of heart rate (HR),
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), pain, respiratory distress, sleep
      state, and wakefulness. The level of salivary cortisol and muscular activity (EMG) will also
      be evaluated. EXPECTED RESULTS: Hydrotherapy is expected to relieve pain, improve sleep
      quality and reduce oxygen therapy and ventilatory support in hospitalized PTNB babies with
      BPD.
