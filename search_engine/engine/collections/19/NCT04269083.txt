    
      BoRgES trial is a multicenter, randomized phase II study of BIRC3-expression directed
      preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
      and EGJ. The main objective of this proposal is to provide evidence for a novel therapeutic
      strategy with enormous significance for patients affected by this disease.

      Only a part of the patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma benefit from neoadjuvant therapy,
      and the clinical efficacy of chemoradiotherapy is reduced by the pre-existence of cellular
      drug resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify patients who could not benefit
      from preoperative treatment. The study will define an innovative therapeutic strategy
      directed by the expression of BIRC3 as a predictive marker for discriminating patients who
      will most likely be resistant to preoperative chemoradiotherapy.
