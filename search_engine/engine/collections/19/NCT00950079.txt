      prolonged hospitalization, significant morbidity or mortality, and cost. CIN has been
      reported to account for 10% of hospital acquired renal failure. Several strategies or
      medications were tried to prevent CIN. Of these, mucomyst and normal saline infusion are
      effective to prevent CIN. Sodium bicarbonate has shown mixed results from recent randomized
      trials. Moreover,limited data have been available for preventing CIN in diabetic renal
      dysfunction undergoing coronary angiography or intervention. Our hypothesis is that addition
      of sodium bicarbonate will be more efficacious than normal saline in preventing CIN at above
      situation.
