    
      One Hospital ClinicalService is a project aiming to provide information and analysis of
      clinical and device data, back to the treating healthcare providers regarding their own
      patients, in order to help those healthcare providers improve outcomes and understanding of
      their patients' care or patients' management.

      The mission of the One Hospital ClinicalService Project is to improve outcomes and
      comprehension of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies applied to patients wearing Medtronic
      implantable devices or treated by Medtronic therapies. One Hospital ClinicalService provides
      services to evaluate and improve the quality of clinical care in the International clinical
      practice.

      One Hospital ClinicalService collects acute and chronic patient and device data in a large
      population during routine usage of the device, without specific study interventions, and
      always within the approved intended use of the device.

      One Hospital ClinicalService uses a core database which can be expanded with specific data
      sets for particular patient populations, diseases, therapies, devices or features.

      One Hospital ClinicalService, with its prospective data collection and its data management
      infrastructure, forms a data-bank where physicians collect patient data and from which they
      receive reports about clinical and device diagnostics data. Usage and understanding of
      diagnostics data may help physicians to optimize tailor device programming and patient
      therapies. This data-bank, queried by retrospective statistical analyses, may help physicians
      in quality improvement activities, education, research and scientific activities.

      Some examples of scientific focus available through the One Hospital ClinicalService Project
      include:

        -  Describing the use of implantable devices, such as cardioverter defibrillator (ICD),
           pacemakers, implantable loop recorders or others in the Italian clinical practice

        -  Identifying predictors or clinical variables correlated with clinical outcomes or
           therapy response

        -  Evaluating and testing methods to optimize device programming and patient therapy via
           device diagnostics or patient reports
