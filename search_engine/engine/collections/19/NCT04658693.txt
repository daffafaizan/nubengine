      lost a lower limb due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy by providing feedback of foot-floor
      interactions via a Sensory Neuroprosthesis employing neural stimulation. In parallel, the
      investigators aim to assess the potential of this intervention to impact reports of phantom
      pain and improve the health and viability of the tissue of the residual limb in all
      recipients of the system regardless of the etiology of their limb loss.

      Electrodes are surgically implanted on one to four nerves of the residual limb. An external
      stimulation device will send pulses to the electrodes. The participant will be asked what
      they feel, and to draw the location of any perceived sensation on schematic maps. A
      sensorized prosthesis will be worn and stimulation will be administered while the participant
      is engaging in various functional tasks, such as standing, walking or climbing stairs or with
      visual or mental distractions. The investigators will apply standard subjective pain
      inventories and objective physiological measures of tissue health (e.g., temperature or
      oxygen perfusion) to document systemic changes related to context-appropriate electrically
      induced sensory input.
