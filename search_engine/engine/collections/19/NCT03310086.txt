      crowding, including extraction and nonextraction. Corticision is an important methods to
      accelerate tooth movement in crowded cases. Cortical bone incision without flap elevation
      enhances turnover rate of surrounding structures and decreases the time for leveling and
      alignment. In orthodontics, CBCT imaging has been applied to evaluate impacted teeth and root
      resorption. But the data are very rare regarding the application of CBCT in tooth movement.
      So CBCT will be used in this research to evaluate the amount of external apical root
      resorption (EARR) and presence of dehiscence in the lower anterior teeth in the crowded
      cases. Furthermore, the duration of alignment will be compared between corticision group and
      non-corticision group.
