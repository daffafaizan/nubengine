      safety of assisted vaginal delivery with vacuum extraction has been discussed since its
      introduction almost fifty years ago. Serious complications such as asphyxia, intracranial
      hemorrhage and seizures are overrepresented at vacuum extraction compared to spontaneous
      vaginal delivery.

      Little has been done to improve the procedure since the introduction. Safety measures
      recommended include restricting total time and number of pulls, a full 34 week gestation, and
      station of the head at the spines or below. A general advice is also to avoid excessive
      traction force. There is no general agreement to what a safe traction force might be. With
      exceeding force there seems to be an increased risk for rupture of the sagittal sinus and
      tearing of the falx at its attachment to the tentorium. Furthermore, when the fetal head is
      becoming exceedingly elongated and flattened, and as the cup pops off it might cause damage
      to the brain and blood vessels.

      During the procedure the obstetrician is under significant stress and the subjective element
      of the evaluation of traction force is a concern. The difficult decision of whether to
      continue a heavy extraction or abort the operation is made under stressful conditions and
      based mostly on subjective impressions.

      To provide the obstetrician with more objective information, the investigators developed a
      new device consisting of an intelligent handle hooked to the chain of a regular metal cup.
