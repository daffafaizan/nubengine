      of EE. Omalizumab will be dosed depending on the patient's body weight and baseline IgE
      level. Omalizumab or placebo will be administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.
      At study entry subjects will have EGD with biopsies performed to ensure the diagnosis and
      obtain tissue for histologic analysis. No dilation will be performed at this time. Baseline
      validated questionnaires for dysphagia, GERD, and atopy will also be administered. Blood will
      be drawn for baseline serum testing. Repeat questionnaires and rating of overall symptom
      improvement will be administered at 4 week intervals for the rest of the study period. At the
      end of the 16 week period, repeat endoscopy will be performed and biopsies taken. Esophageal
      dilation may be performed if clinically indicated at this time. Blood will also be drawn for
      repeat serum testing.
