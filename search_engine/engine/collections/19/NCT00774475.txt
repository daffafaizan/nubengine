      antiplatelet therapies in terms of extent of platelet function inhibition. This laboratory
      finding is the so-called aspirin or clopidogrel resistance which we prefer to define residual
      platelet reactivity (RPR) on antiplatelet therapy.

      A growing body of evidence is demonstrating the clinical relevance of this laboratory
      parameter, i.e. patients with RPR are at higher risk of a subsequent adverse cardiovascular
      event.

      In particular, it has been demonstrated that RPR measured by light transmittance aggregometry
      induced by ADP or by the point of care assay VerifyNow P2Y12 identifies patients which, after
      coronary revascularization with stent implantation, at higher risk of a potentially
      catastrophic event such as stent thrombosis.

      No randomized trials are available in the literature on the efficacy and safety of an
      antiplatelet therapy tailored on the extent of platelet function inhibition.
