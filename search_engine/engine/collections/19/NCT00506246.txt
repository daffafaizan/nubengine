    
      Propofol (chemical substance 2, 6-Diisopropylphenol) is a short-acting intravenous general
      anaesthetic which is used for induction and maintenance of a general anaesthesia, for
      long-term sedation of ventilated intensive care patients or for short-term sedation in
      diagnostic and surgical procedures. As an active substance propofol produces good and readily
      controlled anaesthesia with smooth and problem-free recovery both in adult patients and in
      children over 1 month of age. One potential advantage of this formulation is that the
      MCT/LCT-emulsion reduces pain on injection, a frequently reported adverse reaction with
      LCT-emulsions of propofol.
