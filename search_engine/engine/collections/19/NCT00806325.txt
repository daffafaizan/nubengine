    
      Primary hypothesis: Hyperglycemia during inpatient therapy of AML is associated with
      increased mortality (fewer hospital free days to Day 60, see below).

        -  H1a: Hyperglycemia will result in an increased risk of developing clinical signs of
           infection (fever).

        -  H1b: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of developing severe sepsis
           after the onset of clinical signs of infection (fever).

           o H1b1: Hyperglycemia will be associated with the development of acute lung injury after
           the onset of signs of infection (fever).

        -  H1c: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission.

           o H1c1: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission for
           severe sepsis.

        -  H1d: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of death in those subjects
           with severe sepsis (fewer hospital free days to Day 60, see below).

      Secondary Aim: To investigate whether TSP-1 is important in modulating the course of
      sepsis-induced acute lung injury.

      Secondary hypothesis: In patients with sepsis, increased levels of functional TSP-1 will be
      associated with a lower incidence of and a less severe course of lung injury.

        -  H2a: In human sepsis, increased TSP-1 levels will be associated with a lower incidence
           of lung-injury.

        -  H2b: In human sepsis, increased TSP-1 levels will be associated with a less severe
           course of lung-injury.

        -  H2c: In human sepsis, patients with the Asn682Ser polymorphism in the TSP-1 gene will be
           associated with a higher incidence of lung-injury.

        -  H2d In human sepsis, patients with the Asn682Ser polymorphism in the TSP-1 gene will be
           associated with a more severe course of lung-injury.
