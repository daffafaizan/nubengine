      many stroke survivors suffer from somatosensory impairment of their paretic arm, leading to
      their inability to perform activities of daily living using upper limb. In this respect,
      recent research on motor recovery following stroke has begun to place more emphasis on the
      inclusion of somatosensory retraining in stroke rehabilitation program. Although evidence is
      still scarce, training paradigms that simultaneously combine both somatosensory and motor
      aspects are considered useful for motor recovery in stroke survivors. Principally, studies
      focusing on such form of training paradigm sought to employ robotic technologies to assist in
      the retraining of both motor and somatosensory function in stroke survivors. Robotic
      technologies have gained popularity recently for assessing somatosensory function in clinical
      setting due to its objective quantification of patients' performance and high inter-rater
      reliability. Thus, with the purpose of improving both motor and somatosensory functions in
      chronic stroke survivors, this proposed study will provide an intensive robotic-based
      behavioral training intervention to chronic stroke survivors from the community. The
      intervention will require active participation of the patients through an exploratory
      strategy.
