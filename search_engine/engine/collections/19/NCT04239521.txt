    
      The overall purpose of the first study (Study 1) is to describe the epidemiology of Alopecia
      areata (AA) and to assess the current level of primary care service utilisation and
      management patterns associated with patients diagnosed with AA.

      The overall purpose of the second study (study 2) is to assess the prevalence and incidence
      of mental health conditions (depressive episodes, recurrent depressive disorder and anxiety
      disorder) in adult patients diagnosed with AA relative to a control population of patients
      without a diagnosis of AA. In addition, the study will determine both the treatment, 'sick
      day' and unemployment burden. Treatment burden comprises that of medications and
      psychological interventions used to treat mental health conditions in adult patients
      diagnosed with Alopecia areata.

      The overall purpose of the third study (Study 3) is to assess the prevalence and incidence of
      atopic and autoimmune conditions in adult patients diagnosed with AA relative to a control
      population of patients without AA.
