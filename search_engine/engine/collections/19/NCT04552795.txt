      engagement, CNS penetration, efficacy and safety in older adults with early stage Alzheimer's
      disease. If successful, data will be used to design a larger phase 2 clinical trial. The
      investigators aim to I) Quantify 3TC target engagement and CNS penetration, II) Determine if
      3TC suppresses Alzheimer's disease-relevant outcomes, and III) Assess the safety and
      tolerability of 3TC in older individuals with early Alzheimer's disease. The study will
      consist of a screening/baseline period of 30 days pre-treatment, a 24-week open label
      treatment period, and a follow up visit one month following treatment. Visits to the clinic
      include a pre-treatment screening visit that includes a comprehensive neuropsychological
      exam, a tablet-based neuropsychological exam, and a blood draw. For eligible participants, a
      lumbar puncture will be performed on day one of treatment. Participants will visit the clinic
      on day one of treatment and at weeks 8, 16, and 24 of treatment to complete medication
      checks, physical examinations, tablet-based cognitive screening, and blood draw. At week 24
      of treatment, patients will undergo a post-treatment comprehensive neuropsychological exam, a
      lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal fluid, and a blood draw. One month after the final
      dose of medication, participants will return to the clinic for a final safety assessment and
      disenrollment.
