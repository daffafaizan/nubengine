      babies. Families with a newborn baby carrying a DR-DQ genotype associated with increased risk
      for T1D are invited to participate in regular follow-up at the age of 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24
      months, and thereafter once a year until the age of 15 years or until T1D is diagnosed.
      Clinical details including maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and child's diet
      starting from the age of 3 months are recorded, blood samples are collected, and serum
      autoantibodies associated with development of T1D are measured. Children who develop
      beta-cell specific autoimmunity are followed more intensively with measurements of glucose
      metabolism parameters such as glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), oral glucose tolerance tests
      (OGTT) and intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT). In the DIPP Study more than 1000
      children have developed multiple islet autoantibodies and more than 450 of these have
      progressed to clinical T1D. It has been estimated that 5% of children in the follow-up will
      develop T1D and 60% of future T1D cases will be reached by the current screening and
      follow-up strategy.
