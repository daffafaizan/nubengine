      vaccine is a safe and effective treatment for HIV-1 patients. This will be a phase I,
      single-center, study in HIV infected patients. The primary objective is to evaluate safety of
      the vaccination schedule (from apheresis procedure to week 24) at week 24 and safety of the
      Analytical Treatment Interruption (ATI; from week 24 to week 48) at week 48 in HIV-1 infected
      patients who have been receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months with HIV-1 RNA
      â‰¤50 copies/mL and CD4+ T cell counts >500/mm3 at entry in the trial and who received, in
      addition to anti-retroviral therapy for 24 weeks, vaccination with ex vivo generated
      interferon-alpha dendritic cells loaded with HIV-1 lipopeptides and activated with
      lipopolysaccharide (BIIR/ANRS-HIVax-001, the DC vaccine product).
