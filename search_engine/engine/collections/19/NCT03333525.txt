      carbohydrate counting method, HPFM-a: high protein-fat meal using carbohydrate counting
      method and HPFM-b: high protein-fat meal using carbohydrate and fat-protein counting method)
      were compared on postprandial early (0-120 minutes), late (120-240 minutes) and total (0-240
      minutes) glucose response.
