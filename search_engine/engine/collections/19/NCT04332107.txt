      that prevents disease progression and reduces hospitalization would reduce the burden on the
      health system. High dose hydroxychloroquine is being evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and
      COVID-19 disease treatment, but has a high risk of a number of potentially severe adverse
      events. Recent evidence has indicated that the broad-spectrum macrolide azithromycin may have
      some activity against coronaviruses. Here we propose an individually-randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a single dose of azithromycin for
      prevention of COVID-19.

      Potential participants will undergo remote eligibility screening with study staff prior to
      enrollment. Upon determination of eligibility and signing electronic informed consent
      documents, participants will be emailed baseline study forms and will be mailed their
      randomized study treatment. At the end of the study (21 days), participants will be emailed a
      final study questionnaire. Note that there will no contact between study staff and
      participants in this trial, minimizing risk of infection spread.
