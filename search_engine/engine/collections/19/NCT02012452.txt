      recovery as well as the effect of PTSD recovery on tobacco use. This study has 3 aims: (1) to
      evaluate whether tobacco use interferes with recovery from PTSD during empirically based,
      trauma focused PTSD treatment. (2) To gather preliminary data about whether tobacco use
      alleviates PTSD symptoms among continued tobacco users vs. recent quitters. (3) To explore
      the impact of recovery from PTSD treatment on tobacco use quantity and frequency, tobacco
      withdrawal symptoms, and craving for tobacco. To test these aims, the investigators propose a
      randomized two group design where 75 participants are assigned to receive either tobacco
      treatment (Contingency Management plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or control treatment
      (Health Education) before completing Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for PTSD. Study
      outcome variables will be PTSD symptom severity following CPT, PTSD symptom severity during
      tobacco cessation treatment, and tobacco use and tobacco withdrawal during CPT.
