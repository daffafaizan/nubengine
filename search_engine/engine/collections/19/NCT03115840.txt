      days in the hospital using two different, objective measures, a clinical mobility scale and
      accelerometry. We will evaluate the independent association between activity and outcomes 3
      and 12 months after ICU discharge. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine the relationship
      between activity and disability in ADLs and mobility. Aim 2a will determine the relationship
      between activity and physical and cognitive function. Aim 2b will evaluate physical and
      cognitive function as mediators of long-term disability. Aim 3a will determine the
      relationship between activity and biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation. Aim 3b will
      determine the relationship between these biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation and
      disability, physical and cognitive function.
