      format to assess the quality of life of psoriasis patients taking adalimumab as prescribed by
      their physician in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization with regard
      to dose, population, and indication. The prescription of adalimumab was clearly separated
      from the decision to include the participant in this study. No procedures other than standard
      of care were to have been performed. Visits were non-interventional and timing of participant
      appointments was left to each physician. After therapy initiation, visits occurred over 12
      months usually close to Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 for a total of 6 visits (Visits 1 through
      6 including Screening). Because participant visits were left to the physician, participant
      failure to meet the suggested visit weeks did not constitute a breach of the protocol.
