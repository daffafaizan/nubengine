      pancreatic beta cells. Previous studies indicate that some patients retain the capacity for
      limited endogenous insulin production. AC2993 (synthetic exendin-4) has been shown in
      preclinical and in human studies to have several potentially beneficial antidiabetic actions,
      including recovery and neogenesis of pancreatic islets. Thus, we plan to enroll adults with
      long-standing T1DM who have some C-peptide secretion indicating residual beta cell mass. The
      latter will be targeted by AC2993. Due to the possibility of stimulating the underlying
      autoimmune process of T1DM, especially if islet regeneration occurs, we will subject half of
      the enrollees to immunosuppression. We plan to study the effects of AC2993 alone,
      immunosuppression (daclizumab) alone, as well as the combination of AC2993 and
      immunosuppression on insulin secretion and glycemia control.
