      Primary

        -  Test the scale structure, reliability, and validity of the gastrointestinal
           neuroendocrine tumor module (QLQ-G.I.NET21) in patients with gastrointestinal-related
           neuroendocrine tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients using QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-G.I.NET21 before and
           after treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to treatment
      (somatostatin analogue therapy or interferon therapy vs radionuclide therapy or chemotherapy
      vs ablative therapies [embolization or radiofrequency ablation] or liver resection).

      Patients complete the EORTC C30 questionnaire, QLQ-G.I.NET21 module, and are evaluated for
      Karnofsky performance status at pretreatment, at 3 and 6 months after treatment, and then 2
      weeks later. Patients also complete a clinical data and sociodemographic data form and
      debriefing questionnaire at pretreatment; a follow-up form at 3 months and 6 months after
      treatment; and a test-retest form 2 weeks later.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 408 patients will be accrued for this study.
