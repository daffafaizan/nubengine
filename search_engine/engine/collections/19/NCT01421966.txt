      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is growing at epidemic rates in Europe, United States and
      in general worldwide. Foot ulceration is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus
      associated with increased risk of infection, gangrene and amputation. These ulcers are
      reported to be the leading cause of hospitalization among people with diabetes. Despite
      existing ulcer therapies and technologies, there continues to be a great necessity for new
      wound healing technologies that will further improve healing rates for these chronic ulcers
      that remain a major source of morbidity, concern, and cost. This Phase 3 multinational,
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study is designed to evaluate CureXcell® in
      treating lower extremity chronic ulcers in adults with Diabetes Mellitus.

      CureXcell® is a cell based therapy obtained from donated whole blood. The blood are collected
      from healthy, young adult (age 18-40), the cells separated and then activated by hypo-osmotic
      shock.

      A total of 280 patients, in approximately 35 sites in the US, Canada and Israel, will be
      randomized to receive either CureXcell® or control.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of CureXcell® (study
      biologic) compared to control, as adjunct to Good Ulcer Care. Additional objectives are to
      demonstrate safety, tolerability and durability of CureXcell® compared to control.

      The study has two phases: a core double-blind phase and a follow up phase.
