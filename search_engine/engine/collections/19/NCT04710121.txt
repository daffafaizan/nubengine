      in the endoscopy unit for colonoscopy procedure where the study will be conducted will
      comprise the patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study.
      The research was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study. The block
      randomization method will be used to determine the experimental and control groups. In order
      for the groups to be distributed homogeneously, the order produced by a computer program
      (https://www.randomizer.org/) will be used. Randomization will be done by a biostatistician
      outside the researcher. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in
      the study will be assigned to the experimental and control groups according to the
      randomization list. Research data will be collected in a hospital's endoscopy unit between 1
      October 2020 - 1 October 2021. The independent variable of the study is virtual reality
      glasses. The dependent variables of the study are anxiety states, pain intensity, and vital
      signs score average. In the research, "Individual Characteristics Form", "State and Trait
      Anxiety Inventory", the Analog Scale (VAS), and "Vital Signs Follow-up Form" prepared by the
      researcher in line with the literature will be used as data collection tools.
