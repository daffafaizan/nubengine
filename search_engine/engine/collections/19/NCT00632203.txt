      versus observation in subjects with stable or responding stage III/IV NSCLC to be conducted
      in conformance with Good Clinical Practices. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a study
      drug (temozolomide) or observation arm. The study drug will be administered at a dose of 75
      mg/m^2 PO daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day rest period, until progression
      or up to a maximum of 6 cycles, whichever occurs first. Subjects completing 6 cycles of
      treatment will be followed up for incidence of brain metastasis for up to 2 years, or until
      progression.
