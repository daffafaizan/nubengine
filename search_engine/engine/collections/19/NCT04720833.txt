      receive either 100 g dried plum/day or a control regimen for 12 months. Both groups will
      receive 500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily.

      Evaluation will be based on analyses of bone mineral density at baseline, 6 and 12-months and
      serum and urine markers of bone formation and resorption at baseline and 3, 6, and 12-months.
