      Pre-procedural planning for coronary revascularization using CTA provides detailed
      characterization of bifurcation anatomy and morphology including the spatial distribution of
      coronary plaque. To date there has been no compiled CTA-based prediction model for SB
      occlusion in coronary bifurcation intervention.

      The CT-PRECISION registry is a retrospective observational cohort study of patients
      undergoing preprocedural coronary CTA before PCI involving coronary bifurcation lesions
      between January 2010 and July 2018. The study is designed to enroll 400 consecutive patients
      undergoing elective main vessel stenting with a provisional approach to the SB at a single
      high-volume PCI center.
