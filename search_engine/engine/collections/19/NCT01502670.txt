      radioactivity attached to it. This substance has a natural tendency to go to tumor cells, as
      has been shown in the detection and staging of prostate cancer and for brain tumors. In this
      study we are going to test this new substance in patients with lung nodules. Lung nodules are
      a common finding. It is very important to non-invasively determine whether the nodule is
      cancer or not, as early cancer detection and treatment may cure the disease. The substance is
      called [18]FACBC and it is given in the form of an injection into a vein. After the substance
      reaches the lung nodules, scans called PET or Positron Emission Tomography, are done. This is
      similar to having CAT scans or x-rays. Usually a compound called [18]FDG is used for PET
      scans but this substance often goes to inflammatory tissues as well. This new substance does
      not significantly go to inflammatory tissues, and may allow tumors in the lungs to be better
      identified.
