      preventive therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation. The risk of stroke can be reduced by
      approximately 65%. However, long-term anticoagulation therapy also increases the risk of
      major bleeding.

      A significant proportion of patients at high risk of stroke do not tolerate long-term
      anticoagulation due to various relative or absolute contraindications. As demonstrated in
      previous studies with non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants (NOAK), 20-25% of patients were
      unable to tolerate long-term anticoagulation therapy.

      For this reason, additional therapeutic approaches for stroke prevention in patients with
      atrial fibrillation have been developed.

      A promising approach is catheter-based closure of the left atrial appendage, because more
      than 90% of cardiac thrombi in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation are detected in
      the left atrial appendage. Recent registry studies show that the safety of LAA occluder
      implantation is promising. However, further scientific studies are required, in order to
      explore more benefits of the underlying method and eligible patients for implantation.

      Study objectives:

      The study goal is to determine the clinical benefit of percutaneous catheter-based left
      atrial appendage (LAA) closure in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) at
      high risk of stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc Score â‰¥2) as well as high risk of bleeding as compared to
      best medical care (including a [non-vitamin K] oral anticoagulant [(N)OAC] when eligible).
