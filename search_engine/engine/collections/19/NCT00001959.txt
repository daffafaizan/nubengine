      anti-fibrotic agent, to reduce the proteinuria and slow the rate of progression of renal
      insufficiency in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). We will enroll 25
      patients with renal biopsy proven FSGS and evidence of impaired renal function (glomerular
      filtration rate, GFR, of 10-80 ml/min; after 1/02 must have GFR greater than 25 ml/min) as
      assessed by the 4 variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. As standard of
      care therapy, all patients will also receive angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)
      therapy, and will receive an HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor drug if hypercholesterolemic.
      Preliminary evaluation will assure that the patients meet the study requirements, and an
      evaluation period will be used to ensure that patients are on maximal conservative therapy
      prior to the baseline period. Patients will receive treatment with pirfenidone daily, with
      dose adjusted for body weight and level of kidney function. The primary end point will be the
      decrease glomerular filtration as a marker of glomerular injury; reduction in proteinuria
      will be a secondary end-point. If the pilot study suggests this drug delays progression of
      renal insufficiency or reduces proteinuria in patients with FSGS, we will proceed with a
      large scale randomized, placebo-controlled study.
