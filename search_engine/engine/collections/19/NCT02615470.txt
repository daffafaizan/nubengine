      immunization rates, especially among those who do not visit their primary care provider
      regularly. This study seeks to increase the level of pharmacy-based immunization delivery.

      The study intervention is designed to increase the current level of pharmacy-based
      immunization delivery and foster practice change to sustain the intervention effect. Our
      intervention combines evidence-based strategies for improving immunization coverage and
      strategies to overcome system barriers to increase sustainability of the intervention over
      time. The study will focus on pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccination services.

      Specific aims include:

        1. To compare the change in the number of pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccinations
           administered in pharmacy from the corresponding 6-month period prior to the intervention
           to the 6-month intervention period between intervention pharmacies and the control
           pharmacies. The pre-intervention period will correspond to the intervention period.

        2. To compare the extent of immunization activity implementation during the intervention
           period between intervention pharmacies and control pharmacies.

        3. To compare the level of sustainability of immunization services over the period of 6
           months after the intervention period ends between the intervention group and the control
           group.

        4. To explore facilitators and barriers to implementing immunization services.

        5. To explore factors affecting patient acceptance of pharmacist's vaccine recommendations
           within the intervention pharmacies.
