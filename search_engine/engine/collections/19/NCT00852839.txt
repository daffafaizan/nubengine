      an oromucosal formulation of 552-02 improves the global assessment of dry mouth, as assessed
      by visual analog scale (VAS), in subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the safety of daily administration of an oromucosal formulation of 552-02 in
           subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome.

        -  To evaluate whether administration of an oromucosal formulation of 552-02 improves the
           subjective measurement of 6 different salivary functions, as measured using VAS, in
           subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome.
