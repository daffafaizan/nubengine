      neurosurgery under MRI guidance. The device combines 3 previously FDA-cleared devices: the
      Visualase Cooled Laser Application System, which delivers the laser (energy) to the tumor
      tissue; the PhoTex , Diode Laser Series, which is the laser itself; and the Visualase
      ENVISION Workstation, which is the computer system that helps the surgeon plan and monitor
      your treatment.

      The Visualase Thermal Therapy System will be used in this study to give subjects a type of
      therapy called Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT). LITT uses laser light to heat and
      destroy the affected tissue; this is sometimes referred to as tissue ablation. In LITT, small
      fiber-optic applicators are placed directly into the tumor and heating is performed from the
      inside out, which may lead to the destruction of the tumor. During the heating process, MRTI
      can be used to watch the temperatures around the applicator to make sure that the tumor
      receives enough treatment and that the normal tissues around the tumor do not get too hot.
