      represents a major challenge. In beta thalassemia, the beta globin gene is affected by a
      variety of mutations. The group of patients to be analyzed here is homozygous for a splice
      site mutation that is common in the Middle East. In contrast to this genetic homogeneity, the
      spectrum of the clinical phenotype ranges from mild anemia to most severe, transfusion
      dependent anemia. We will use a genetic linkage approach to identify modifying factors and by
      analyzing the efficiency of an mRNA surveillance mechanism that is referred to as
      nonsense-mediated decay and represents a candidate genetic modifier of beta thalassemia and
      other genetic disorders.
