    
      This study will retrospectively investigate doppler images from the second phase of the CTEVD
      trial.

        1. To determine the prevalence of CCSVI in patients with MS, compared with the prevalence
           observed in a control population consisting of Other Neurological Diseases (OND)
           patients and Healthy Controls (HC) by using blinded, controlled centralized ultrasound
           reading assessment of 5 Venous Haemodynamic (VH) CCSVI CCSVI Doppler UltraSound (CDUS)
           criteria.

        2. To investigate whether prevalence of CCSVI is different between centralized and local
           CDUS reading of 5 VH CCSVI CDUS criteria.

        3. To investigate the prevalence of CCSVI in patients with MS, compared with the prevalence
           observed in a control population consisting of OND patients and HC, when bidirectional
           flow in the intracranial veins and sinuses CDUS criterion is not considered as part of
           VH CCSVI CDUS criteria.

        4. To determine whether prevalence of CCSVI in patients with MS, compared with the
           prevalence observed in a control population consisting of OND patients and HC differs
           when using CDUS velocity and flow parameters in the Internal Jugular Veins (IJVs) and
           Vertebral Veins (VVs).

        5. To determine the reproducibility of VH criteria by using of centralized and local
           blinded, controlled CDUS reading assessment.
