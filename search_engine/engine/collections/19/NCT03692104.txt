      undergo collection of prostate US images at the completion of their procedure. This will add
      approximately 5 minutes to the duration of their brachytherapy procedure. The US study will
      not entail any discomfort or risk to participants as they are still under anesthesia for the
      implant procedure. The institution standard of care for quality assurance will be complied
      with, obtaining a CT and MRI of the prostate at 30 days after the procedure. These will be
      co-registered and analyzed in the normal fashion. In addition, the post implant US images
      will also be co-registered with the CT and the resulting dosimetric parameters compared.
