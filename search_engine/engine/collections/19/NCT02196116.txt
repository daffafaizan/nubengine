      development and cognitive function will be assessed, as measured by amyloid PET imaging and a
      battery of neuropsychological tests at the very early stages of the disease, comparatively to
      age-matched controls. In addition, this project will explore the influence of cognitive
      complaint.

      It's assumed that 1) the amyloid-PET measures in age-matched controls and subjects from the
      two cohorts will correlate with cognitive performances; 2) the amyloid burden will be higher
      in high- than in low-educated subjects with similar cognitive impairment; and 3) similarly
      the amyloid burden will be higher in subjects with cognitive complaint compared to subjects
      without cognitive complaint.

      Considering a longer term, the clinical follow-up of study participants will allow to
      investigate the prognosis value of amyloid load for improving the prediction of cognitive
      decline and disease progression.
