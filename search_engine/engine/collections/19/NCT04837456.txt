      degenerate meniscus lesions by MRI from orthopaedics department from June 2017 to March 2020
      at First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University. Participants were diagnosed with
      MetS and degenerate meniscus tear with a mild or no osteoarthritis KL<2 verified by X ray.
      Participants were randomly dividied into calorie-restricted diet and exercise intervention
      group; libitum diet and waiting list control group; early APM (syndrome within 3-6 months)
      group or a delayed APM(syndrome more than 6 months) group as a computer sequenced number. The
      primary outcome was the change in metabolic syndrome components and knee function score of
      WOMAC, KOOS,WOMET,IKDC were determined by two fixed orthopadic surgeons who were blinded to
      the intervention.
