    
      ARMS Pharmaceuticals LLC intends to apply for approval of ARMS-I as a prescription drug for
      the prevention of influenza, rhinovirus and RSV (collectively, "vURTI's). The company plans
      on confirming the limited systemic bioavailability, through conducting a study to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of ARMS-I administered orally in healthy adults. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of ARMS-I following oral
      administration to healthy subjects. Specifically, investigators will assess whether there is
      measurable systemic exposure and if so, to determine the plasma and pharyngeal fluid
      pharmacokinetic characteristics of ARMS-I after single and multiple oral dosing. The
      secondary objective will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ARMS-I.
