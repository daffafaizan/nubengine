      and 40% of patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), respectively, develop DME.
      One-third of diabetic patients who have had DM for more than twenty years will develop DME .
      Early impairment in the function of the middle and inner layers of the retina has been
      reported in diabetic patients before appearance of vascular complications . A good
      independent guide of macular function in patients with DME is multifocal electroretinogram
      (mfERG) readings from the macular area, which strongly associate with morphologic alterations
      in the macula. Some investigators suggested that temporal characteristic (implicit time) of
      mfERG waves are more important than amplitudes for evaluation of retinal function in diabetic
      patients. They concluded that patients with DM show temporal changes indicating delayed
      neural transmission due to local impairment of blood glucose metabolism. In contrast, others
      emphasize the importance of both parameters (implicit time and amplitude) in identifying
      retinal affection in DM.

      Intravitreal (IV) injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents
      provided good visual outcomes in treatment of DME. However, IV anti-VEGF injections are
      expensive, need to be repeated many times and have the potential risk of causing
      endophthalmitis . Subthreshold micropulse laser (SML) treatment of DME has the same effect as
      conventional laser treatment, nonetheless, there is less damage to adjacent tissues of the
      burn area in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). SML allows laser emission to be divided
      into bursts of short cyclic pulses that remain for microseconds permitting substantial
      cooling amid these short pulses .
