      post-operative patient reported outcome (PRO) scores including the modified Harris hip score
      (mHHS) and the non arthritic hip score (NAHS), both are externally-validated surveys for hip
      function. One cohort will be assigned a rehabilitation regimen that includes 2 weeks of
      partial weight bearing on crutches, and the other will be assigned a regimen of 4 weeks of
      partial weight.
