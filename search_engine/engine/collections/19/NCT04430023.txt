      coronavirus disease 2019 wards to our units. The criteria for intensive care requirement was
      identified as oxygen saturation<90%, partial oxygen pressure<70 mmHg, respiratory rate>
      30/min or PaO2/FiO2(partial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen) <300 despite
      conventional oxygen treatment of 5lt/min. Primary objective was the effect of defined data on
      28-day mortality, and secondary objective was the impact of lymphocyte count, lactate
      dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimer and procalcitonin levels, and SOFA(Sequential Organ Failure
      Assessment) score on prognosis, which are among the risk factors determined by previous
      studies. All data were evaluated and recorded using the standardized International Severe
      Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) case report forms, complemented
      by electronic records of the hospital, nurse observation records, and missing information was
      completed by telephone interviews with patients' relatives.
