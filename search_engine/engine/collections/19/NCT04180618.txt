           health records are not immediately provided because patient information is separately
           managed by each hospital. Another reason for the difficulty is that if the patients
           don't know their personal health record, they can't inform medical staffs of it. In
           addition, the increase of emergency situation of the chronically ill is also
           problematic. And patients have a growing desire for their health information. In this
           situation, the investigators developed the service showing patient health record
           altogether which is managed by each hospital separately and recording the patient health
           information based on mobile application.
