      open-label, flexible-dosing, outpatient trial at Duke Addictions Program. On days 1-3,
      participants will receive buprenorphine/naloxone daily at a starting dose of 4mg,
      progressively decreasing to 2 mg on days 2- 3. Participants will also receive very low dose
      naltrexone (VLNTX) at a dose of 0.25 mg to 1mg on Days 1-3, 2 to 6 mg on Day 4 and between 10
      and 50 mg on Days 5-7. Then a VIVITROL injection, 380 mg, will be administered on Day 8.

      Evaluations will occur daily for up to 6 hours until 1 day after VIVITROL injection and then
      weekly for 4 weeks. Patients will receive ancillary medications as needed and weekly
      psychosocial intervention. At the end of the study, participants will be offered outpatient
      treatment of OD at the study site, or will be referred to other treatment programs.
