      systolic pressure, high blood volume wounds, and to promote hemostasis on a massive scale
      compared to the hemostasis requirements of oral surgery wounds. Therefore, a human clinical
      trial has recently been completed evaluating the efficacy of using the HemCon® Bandage in a
      smaller finished size for dental extraction and other oral surgery sites. The HemCon® Bandage
      was proven to be significantly better at promoting hemostasis of oral surgery wounds than the
      control (cotton gauze or Gelfoam) in all subjects tested. All HemCon® Bandage sites achieved
      hemostasis faster than the control sites. Based on this data, a 510(k) was submitted and has
      received FDA clearance for the HemCon® Dental Dressing to be used as an oral wound dressing
      intended as a physical barrier for temporary protection of oral mucosal tissue and to provide
      pain relief.

      This study evaluates the FDA cleared HemCon® Dental Dressing for use in hemostasis of soft
      oral tissue subsequent to dental surgical procedures such as tooth extractions excluding
      procedures involving primary closure of the HemCon® Dental Dressing within the oral wound.
