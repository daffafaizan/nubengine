      survival rate in patients with limited brain metastases from malignant melanoma undergoing
      whole brain radiotherapy followed by stereotactic radiosurgery boost. II. Evaluate the
      qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks, followed 3-5
      weeks later by stereotactic radiosurgery. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
