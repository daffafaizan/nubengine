      et al in 2001. In a triple combination, the authors were able to define the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD) of 3.5 mg / m² / day x 5 days for topotecan, 250 mg / m² for paclitaxel and AUC at
      12 for carboplatin (46). The MTD of topotecan combined with carboplatin (AUC 16) and VP 16
      could not be determined by Carroll et al (47). However, in the study ITOV01bis (ASCO abstract
      2007 No. 1661), the MTD of topotecan was determined in combination with cyclophosphamide at
      120 mg / kg and was fixed at 9 mg/m2/jx 5 days, the same as the DMT used in monotherapy ITOV
      01).

      Studies related above, the combination of high dose of topotecan and carboplatin seems
      possible with a limited dose of carboplatin at AUC 20, an allocation of 5 days for both drugs
      [with a fixed daily AUC 4 for carboplatin , same as the program TAXIF I in germ cell tumors,
      published by our team (Annual Oncology 2004) as well as TAXIF II developed by Tenon's
      hospital] with an administration time of 30 minutes daily for topotecan and 2 hours for
      carboplatin.

      these data justify the pattern of our study:

        -  established treatment of 5 consecutive days provides the best therapeutic index,

        -  infusion of 30 minutes, seems to give less non-haematological toxicity compare to
           continuous infusion, which prevailed in the trial ITOV 01,

        -  Rescue by blood stem cells (collected by chemotherapy mobilization-type high-dose
           cyclophosphamide followed by hematopoietic growth factors (G-CSF, Filgrastim)
           reinjection is scheduled to H96 after the treatment end ,

        -  six sequential doses established in the absence of limiting toxicity, as follows: 7.5 -
           8.0 - 8.5 - 9.0 - 9.5 - 10.0 mg/m2. Steps 9.5 mg / m² and 10 mg / m will be discussed
           after approval by an independent committee in charge of the studyContinuation of
           Topotecan at conventional dose can be done thanks to clinical data based on efficacy and
           tolerance
