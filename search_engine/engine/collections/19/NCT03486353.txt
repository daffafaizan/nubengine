      azacitidine in previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS, or in patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are otherwise candidates for treatment with azacitidine in
      the judgment of the Investigator. The Phase 2 portion of the trial will be preceded by a
      Phase 1 "run-in" to evaluate the safety of the combination of FF-10501-01 plus azacitidine.
