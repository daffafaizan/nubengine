    
      Prospective, controlled, longitudinal-cohort phase IV study to assess safety of Omegaven in
      Pediatric Patients with PNAC, in order to demonstrate short-, mid-, and long-term safety with
      respect to EFAD, serious bleeding events, life-threatening pleural and pericardial effusions,
      and neurocognitive development. Pediatric patients with PNAC receiving Omegaven as part of
      their routine nutritional management will be compared to those treated with another
      FDA-approved ILE for pediatric patients. Patients who are switched to a non-FDA-approved ILE
      or to Omegaven will be analyzed separately. Use of ILE will be as indicated by their treating
      physician, ideally for â‰¥ 1 year. Dosing modalities are to be taken from the pertinent
      prescribing information.
