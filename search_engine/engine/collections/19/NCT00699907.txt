      undergoing prophylactic oophorectomy and are interested in taking flutamide vs patients at
      high risk for ovarian cancer who are undergoing prophylactic oophorectomy and are not
      interested in taking flutamide (control) vs patients who are undergoing oophorectomy for a
      medical indication (control).

      OUTLINE: Patients who elected not to receive flutamide received prophylactic oophorectomy or
      oophorectomy for a medical indication. Patients who elected to receive flutamide received
      125mg once daily for 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients then underwent
      prophylactic oophorectomy. All patients underwent blood and ovarian tissue sample collection
      at the time of surgery for biomarker laboratory studies. Proteomic, microarray, and
      polymorphism analysis were performed on the blood and tissue samples.
