      testing the hypothesis that reductions in blood pressure will be greater with a
      genetically-driven anti-hypertensive approach (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist,
      eplerenone) compared to a non-specific approach (amlodipine). 56 participants will be
      enrolled in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, active controlled, outpatient study to assess
      whether eplerenone (LSD1 specific treatment) proves superior in 24-hr ambulatory systolic
      blood pressure reduction than amlodipine (non-specific treatment). Participants will be
      randomized to either eplerenone 50mg or amlodipine 2.5mg with escalations in dose of study
      drug every 4 weeks if the participant's blood pressure is > 140/90.
