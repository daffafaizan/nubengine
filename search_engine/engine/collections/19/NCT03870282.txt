      increases in childhood sleep. The primary objectives of this study are to determine if
      different messaging strategies lead to the longer sleep duration.Children aged 9-12 who sleep
      about 6-8.5 hours per night will wear a Fitbit for 11 weeks in order to measure sleep
      patterns. Participants will have a sleep goal to meet each night. Participants will be
      randomized to one of thirty-two study conditions and receive text and/or email messaging.
      Some study arms receive additional messaging with different content and frequency of
      delivery. The study involves one visit to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).
