      other foreign invaders becomes weaker; in particular, the cellular (T-cell) immune response
      is particularly affected by HIV. A boosting agent called CpG7909 ODN may be an ideal adjuvant
      for vaccines given to HIV infected people, because it may help elicit an increased CD8 T-cell
      response. This study will evaluate the safety of and immune response to a hepatitis B virus
      vaccine series given with CpG7909 ODN in HIV infected and uninfected people.

      There will be three groups in this study; participants will be stratified by baseline CD4
      counts and viral load. Within each group, participants will be randomly assigned to receive 3
      injections of hepatitis B vaccine with CpG7909 ODN or 3 injections of hepatitis B vaccine
      alone. Injections will be given at study entry and Months 1 and 6. There will be 10 study
      visits; a physical exam and blood collection will occur at each visit.
