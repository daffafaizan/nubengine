      nervous system (CNS). Normally, nerve fibers carry electrical impulses through the spinal
      cord, providing communication between the brain and the arms and legs. In people with MS, the
      fatty sheath that surrounds and insulates the nerve fibers (called "myelin") deteriorates,
      causing nerve impulses to be slowed or stopped. As a result, patients with MS may experience
      periods of muscle weakness and other symptoms such as numbness, loss of vision, loss of
      coordination, paralysis, spasticity, mental and physical fatigue and a decrease in the
      ability to think and/or remember. These periods of illness may come (exacerbations) and go
      (remissions). Fampridine-SR is an experimental drug that has been reported to possibly
      improve muscle strength and walking ability for some people with MS. This study will evaluate
      the effects and possible risks of taking Fampridine-SR in subjects with MS.
