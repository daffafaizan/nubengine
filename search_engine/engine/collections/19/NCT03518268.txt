      treatment for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Estrogen
      depletion leads to significant loss of bone mineral density and an increased fracture risk.
      One contributing mechanism to "estrogen deficiency associated bone loss" is the increase in
      systemic and local gut inflammatory responses upon estrogen deficiency. Probiotics have been
      shown to decrease inflammatory cytokine formation in both the systemic circulation and gut.

      Vivomixx is a high potency probiotic medical food designated for the dietary management of
      inflammatory gut conditions in adults and children and is currently being studied in clinical
      trials in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions such as asthma and diabetes. In
      preclinical studies Vivomixx has been shown to protect from estrogen deficient bone loss.
