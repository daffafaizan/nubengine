      program including education on health and wellness topics such as food groups, physical
      activity and stress management. Special skill builders for managing the thoughts, feelings
      and emotions associated with changing health behaviors will also be included. Pairs will have
      biweekly 15 minute coaching sessions to check in on progress in the past week, set goals and
      problem solve. Optional group sessions will be offered for peer support. In order to assess
      progress, pairs will also complete assessment visits before and after the program. These
      visits include one virtual assessment via Zoom and one in-person assessment at the University
      of Alabama at Birmingham. Caregivers and children will complete questionnaires and measures
      such has height, weight, blood pressure and a finger prick.
