      encephalitis vaccine as control. In Infants at 6-23 months of age were injected with
      experimental vaccine with 0,7 days and 0,28 days vaccination schedule to evaluate
      immunogenicity and safety of the experimental vaccine and the effectiveness of different
      vaccination schedule. Participates were assigned to three groups (350 per group): group 1
      with experimental vaccine using 0,7 days vaccination schedule; group 2 with control vaccine
      using 0, 7 days vaccination schedule; group 3 with experimental vaccine using 0, 28
      vaccination schedule.

      Blood samples were collected before immunization and 30 days after immunization, and the
      neutralization antibody of Japanese encephalitis was detected by plaque reduction
      neutralization test. Medical observation was conducted 30 minutes after each injection. Body
      temperature of participates was continuously measured for 7 days, and any adverse events were
      observed and recorded from the first dose to 30 days after the whole vaccination. Serious
      adverse events were collected within 6 months after the first dose.
