      chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and inhibition of the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) may retard CKD
      progression. Dual pharmacological blockade of the RAAS with ACEI and ARB is recommended as a
      standard renoprotective management at least in patients with nondiabetic proteinuric CKD.
      However, neither ACEI nor ARB, even in high doses or in concomitant usage, abrogate the
      progression of CKD completely. Innovative approaches are needed to keep patients with CKD off
      dialysis. Additional antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) may prove to be such beneficial
      therapeutic concept. To shed more light on this issue, we performed a randomised open
      controlled study to evaluate the influence of triple N-acetylcysteine and RAAS therapy on
      surrogate markers of kidney injury, i.e. proteinuria, markers of tubular involvement and
      kidney fibrosis.
