      compared to placebo in a phase III clinical study of pivotal character with a representative
      number of patients suffering from fully reversible asthma +/- allergic rhinitis. This
      condition is present in paediatric and adult patients with a shorter history of GINA II and
      III asthma, who were investigated in this study.
