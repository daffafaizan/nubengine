    
      Wandering, or elopement, is a life-threatening behavior that has been reported to occur in a
      third of all children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Wearable electronic tracking
      devices (ETDs) that are able to pinpoint a child's location have emerged as an appealing
      intervention for families concerned about wandering risk. However, the impact of ETD use on
      the families of children who wander has never been studied prospectively. In this pilot
      study, parents will be provided with a commercially-available ETD to use for their child with
      ASD for 6 weeks. Preliminary data will be obtained to evaluate the impact of ETD use on the
      strain experienced by families due to their child's wandering behavior. The feasibility of
      all study procedures will be assessed in preparation for a larger subsequent trial.
