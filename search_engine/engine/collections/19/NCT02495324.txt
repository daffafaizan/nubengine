      evaluate the anti-hypertensive efficacy and safety of Fimasartan in patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension. Approximately 360 patients will be enrolled in 8 centers in South
      Korea. This study has planned 6 visits during 8 weeks.(2 weeks of placebo run-in and wash
      out, 2 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of forced titration) All of the subjects who agreed to
      participate in this study and gave written informed consent voluntarily are assessed the

      for 24 hours. Subjects who determined to be appropriate for this study are allocated to
      experimental group(Fimasartan 60mg) or control group(Valsartan 80mg) or Reference
      group(Olmesartan 10mg) randomly at ratio 3:3:1.Subjects take their investigational products
