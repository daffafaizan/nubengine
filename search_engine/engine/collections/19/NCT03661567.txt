    
      This study is to determine the efficacy of the preventively use of methylprednisolone after
      split-course chemoradiotherapy(CCRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer with
      bulky tumor.

      All patients received four cycles of weekly docetaxel (25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin (25mg/㎡)(DP),
      each of 1 day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy, with one-month
      break. In the experimental arm, patients were treated with methylprednisolone after the first
      course of radiation, once a day, 32 milligram (mg) for 7 days, 24 mg for the next 7 days,then
      16mg for 7 days, and 8 mg for the last 7 days. Toxicities will be graded according to
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0.
