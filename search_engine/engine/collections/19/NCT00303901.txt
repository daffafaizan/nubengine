        -  Estimate the local and distant failure rates after percutaneous thoracic cryotherapy
           (PTC) in patients with unresectable primary lung cancer or lung metastases.

        -  Estimate rates of PTC complications and adverse reactions.

        -  Determine the correlations between procedural parameters and follow-up imaging
           parameters, with the latter being used as surrogates of local and/or distant treatment
           failure.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo CT-guided percutaneous thoracic cryotherapy over 2 hours under
      local or general anesthesia. Grouped cryoprobes are inserted into the tumor, utilizing a
      freeze-thaw-freeze cycle, creating cytotoxic temperatures (less than -20°C to -40°C) that
      encompass the entire anticipated tumor volume.

      Patients undergo positron emission tomography at baseline and after cryotherapy to assess
      tumor standard uptake variable.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
