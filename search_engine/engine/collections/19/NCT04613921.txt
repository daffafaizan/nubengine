    
      The aim of this study is to compare 1-year graft and patient survival rates after liver
      transplantation (LT) in patients with ACLF-2 or 3 at the time of LT, with patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis without ACLF-2 or 3 at the time of LT and also with transplant-free
      survival of patients with ACLF-2 or 3 not listed for LT.

      Secondary objectives are as follows:

        -  To assess the proportion of patients with ACLF-2 or 3 referred to transplant team who
           are listed or not and reasons of this decision.

        -  To evaluate the outcomes of patients listed with ACLF-2 or 3 on the waiting list
           compared with those of patients listed with decompensated cirrhosis without ACLF-2 or 3.

        -  To define independent predictive factors of death/delisting on the waiting list for
           patients listed with ACLF-2 or 3 and develop a new prognostic model based on ACLF
           criteria to predict mortality on the waiting list and to improve the allocation of
           organs.

        -  To compare the characteristics of accepted grafts for patients listed with ACLF-2 or 3
           with those of patients listed with decompensated cirrhosis without ACLF-2 or 3 and their
           impact on post-LT outcomes.

        -  To explore independent predictive factors of death after LT for patients transplanted
           with ACLF-2 or 3 to design futility criteria for LT.

        -  To compare post-LT survival rates of patients with ACLF-2 or 3 at listing and patients
           without ACLF at listing who develop ACLF-2 or 3 on the waiting list.

        -  To compare post-LT quality of life (QoL) for patients listed with ACLF-2 or 3 with those
           of patients listed with decompensated cirrhosis without ACLF-2 or 3.
