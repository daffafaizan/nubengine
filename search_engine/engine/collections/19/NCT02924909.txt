    
      Phase II trial of induction chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC 6 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 in
      a 21 day cycle for two cycles followed by radiotherapy 4500 cGy in 25 fractions plus
      carboplatin AUC=2 paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 in a week regimen followed by minimally invasive
      surgery after 6 to 10 weeks. A PET scan will be performed at the time of randomization and 14
      days after de first cycle to determine the relation between metabolic response and survival.
      The primary endpoint is to the evaluate the number of complete pathologic response. The
      secondary endpoints are evaluation of toxicity, radiologic response, metabolic response,
      results of the minimally invasive surgery (blood lost, number of conversion to open surgery,
      type of resection, R0, 1 or 2, post-op complications, time of hospitalization, 30 day post-op
      mortality), evaluate the viability of treatment protocol (number of patient that complete the
      phases), evaluate quality of life during the treatment and after the surgery. Inclusion
      criterias are: Histologically proven adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the middle
      and lower third of the esophagus (included tumors located in the gastro-esophageal junction
      Siewert I and II), age between 18 and 75 years, Performance Status 0 or 1, neutrophils count
      > 1500/mm3, platelets count > 100.000/mm3, hemoglobin count > 9 g/dL, preserve hepatic and
      renal function, stage (TNM AJCC 7th edition): cT1b-3, N0-1, M0, signature of the informed
      consent. Exclusion criterias are: history of another cancer, except skin non melanoma,
      pregnancy or history of hypersensitivity to the study drugs
