      childhood. Families concerned about the pain associated with vaccine injections may be
      reluctant to vaccinate their children. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the
      mother-sung lullaby during vaccine administration on vaccine-induced pain in babies and
      anxiety in mothers. Two family health centers in Turkey between March 4, 2020, and August 28,
      2020. A total of 60 babies who received the Bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin vaccine and their
      mothers.These babies were randomly assigned to one of two groups, including 30 babies in the
      lullaby group and 30 babies in the control group. Data on descriptive information for all
      babies and mothers were collected through face-to-face interviews with the mothers before
      vaccination. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, and crying duration were measured in all babies.
      Heart rate and oxygen saturation of the babies were recorded using a pulse oximeter during
      and after vaccine administration. The crying time, measured for up to 20 seconds after
      vaccination, was recorded as the total cry time (using video seconds). The pain score was
      evaluated by two observers using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale, based on video recordings
      obtained during and after vaccine administration. In addition, mothers' anxiety scores were
      measured using the "State Anxiety Inventory," both before and after vaccination.
