      lipids and lipoprotein composition in human subjects who are healthy. Niacin (vitamin B3 or
      nicotinic acid) is a common nutrient found in many foods and is currently sold over the
      counter as a nutritional supplement. Extended-release versions of niacin are available over
      the counter (e.g., Slo-Niacin) or by prescription (Niaspan) and help to alleviate symptoms of
      flushing associated with larger doses of the vitamin. Studies of the effects of niacin
      therapy on clinical lipid measures consistently indicate a shift toward a healthier
      lipoprotein profile with increased HDL-C and decreases in both triglyceride and LDL-C.
      Despite this favorable shift in lipid profile, cardiovascular outcome studies on patients
      receiving niacin alone or in combination with statin therapy have resulted in mixed results
      creating uncertainty of the value of niacin therapy. The proposed study will examine in
      detail the effects of niacin therapy on lipoprotein composition and function, while also
      tracking measures of vascular health.
