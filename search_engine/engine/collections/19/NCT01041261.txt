    
      STUDY SUMMARY The purpose of this pilot study is to compare a medical food intervention with
      the dietary standard of care at Boston Medical Center, in obese women subjects undergoing
      Roux-en Y gastric bypass surgery. Commercially available nutritional supplements will also be
      provided as part of the study's protocol.

      Subjects will be selected from surgical candidates of the Nutrition and Weight Management
      Center who meet the study criteria. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups
      (treatment and control). Subjects will be seen at the study site 2 weeks before surgery and 4
      weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery (for a total of 5 visits). Data recorded
      during the study visits will be used to assess post-operative progress and will include: body
      composition, resting energy expenditure, muscle strength, quality of life questionnaires,
      hair loss, and blood markers for insulin resistance, nutritional state, organ function, lipid
      profile and inflammation. Safety indicators and compliance will also be monitored.
