    
      Design : multicenter randomized openlabel, phase II trial.

      Number of patients to include : 500 (250 with plasma, 250 without plasma).

      The principal objective is to assess the efficacy of the treatment to reduce day-28 mortality
      in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who require mechanical ventilation.

      Hypothesis: Passive immunization with plasma collected from patients having contracted
      COVID-19 and developed specific antibodies may alleviate symptoms and viral load of
      SARS-CoV-2 and reduce mortality.

      The patients will receive currently accepted standard of care for both COVID-19 and usual
      organ dysfunctions observed in such cases. half the patients will be administered either
      Convalescent plasma, depending on the randomization process. All patients will be followed-up
      for one year after inclusion. The study will be considered either positive or negative, based
      on the principal objective. This means that the product convalescent plasme will be
      considered effective if mortality at day 28 is lower is patients treated with convalescent
      plasma than without it. The follow-up will allow to assess a series of secondary objectives,
      addressing the evolution of organ failures, viral infection, inflammatory response and
      long-term physical of psychological impact of COVID-19. Interim analyses will be performed
      every 100 patients included in order to stop the trial if an exceptionally good or bad result
      is observed, to prevent using or not using the product appropriately in further patients.
      These analyses will be supervised by an independent committee.

      The choice to include only those patients under mechanical ventilation for severe respiratory
      failure makes this study different from other trials testing convalescent plasma, as most
      trial include less severe patients.
