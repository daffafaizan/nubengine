      "medicinal" mushrooms are still widely used in alternative medicine all over the world.
      Although a number of fungal components have been implicated in these properties, Beta-glucans
      have attracted the most attention. However, although Beta-glucans are widely used as a health
      food supplement, their immunomodulatory effects after administration in humans have not yet
      been determined.
