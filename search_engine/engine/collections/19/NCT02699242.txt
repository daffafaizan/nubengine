      basis. Modern training method in skill acquisition involves the use of simulators. Recently a
      portable, computer based, bronchoscopic simulator (ORSIM) was developed. The investigators
      hypothesized that operators trained with the ORSIM simulator will be more proficient in
      performing asleep FOB intubation than those trained with didactic teaching alone.

      This randomized trial involves 34 consented residents or anesthesia assistants (AAs). In
      preparation, each consented person will view a teaching video of FOB intubation and tips.
      They will then perform an asleep FOBI in the OR under a staff anesthesiologist's supervision
      who's familiar with the study. Those who are randomized to the ORSIM group with undergo
      simulator training of 30-60 min. Those in the Didactic group will not undergo further
      training. Within about a week, the resident/AA will perform another asleep FOB intubation.

      The study results will impact on how FOB intubation will be taught effectively in the future.
