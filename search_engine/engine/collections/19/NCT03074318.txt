    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of trabectedin and avelumab in
      subjects with advanced leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma.

      II. To assess the objective response rate of advanced L-type sarcoma patients receiving the
      combination regimen of avelumab and trabectedin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To further explore the clinical activity and safety profile of avelumab and trabectedin as
      a combination therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Avelumab will be administered every 2 weeks. Trabectedin will be administered every 3 weeks
      for the first two doses (Week 1 and Week 4), and then every four weeks (Week 7, Week 11,â€¦)
      moving forward. After Cycle 2 of trabectedin, dosing may extend to every 5 weeks at
      investigator discretion, for management of trabectedin-associated toxicity only. Delays of
      trabectedin beyond 5 weeks may be allowed but require written approval from the
      Sponsor-Investigator. On days where both drugs are scheduled to be administered, avelumab
      will be administered first. This will continue until unacceptable toxicity or confirmed
      disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every
      12 weeks for 2 years.
