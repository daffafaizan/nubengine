      obstructive pulmonary disease. There are positive reports of surgical as well as
      bronchoscopic volume reduction in selected patients, but data comparing LVRS and BLVR is
      unfortunately lacking to date. The investigators therefore anticipate that their study will
      make an important contribution to the worldwide efforts in better understanding selection and
      management of surgical and bronchoscopic treatment of emphysema patients and that it will be
      of high public interest.
