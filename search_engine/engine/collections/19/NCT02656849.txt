    
      -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
           effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
           specific cancer.

        -  "Investigational" means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors
           are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it
           may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer.

        -  It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved BAY
           1000394 for use in participants with your type of cancer.

        -  The study drug is a pan-CDK inhibitor targeting the genetic defect in several tumors,
           MCL1, Myc, or CCNE.
