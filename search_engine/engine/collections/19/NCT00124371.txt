      any medical and nursing input, at a time which is very stressful for them and their families.
      This randomised controlled trial will test whether a home-based, nurse-led support and
      education programme for patients waiting for such surgery can optimise mental and physical
      fitness and improve coronary heart disease risk factors by addressing anxiety, hypertension,
      obesity, diabetes and serum cholesterol in the waiting period. Patients will be followed up
      in their own homes monthly by a cardiac nurse and given lifestyle advice and information to
      prepare them for surgery. Primary outcome measurements will be anxiety, length of stay, blood
      pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, smoking and body mass index. Secondary outcomes will be
      quality of life, and post-operative complications. Economic analysis and qualitative
      assessment of patients' opinion of the programme will also be performed.
