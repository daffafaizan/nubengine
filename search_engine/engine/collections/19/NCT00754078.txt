      concurrent 5-FU/mitomycin C for the treatment of T2-T4 cancer of the anal canal. They
      hypothesis is that helical tomotherapy could minimize radiation related toxicity by avoiding
      or limiting doses to structures such as small bowel, external genitalia, skin, bladder,
      rectum, and femoral neck and head. This is expected to limit or reduce treatment related
      toxicity and hence prevent or reduce treatment breaks. This may result in delivery of radical
      treatment with better local control and treatment outcome than using the current radiation
      treatment technique at our center.
