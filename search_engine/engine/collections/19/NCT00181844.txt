      maintenance treatment of adults with Bipolar I disorder to delay the time to occurrence of
      mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania,& mixed episodes) in patients treated for acute
      mood episodes with standard therapy. Recent studies have shown that Lamotrigine maintenance
      treatment was more robust in bipolar depression.

      The study includes 1) use of a 12-week design to document the response rate 2) assessment of
      the impact of Lamotrigine on functional capacities and cognition, 3) careful assessment of
      safety and tolerability.
