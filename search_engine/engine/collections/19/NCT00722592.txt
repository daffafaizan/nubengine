      vintafolide and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD; available in the United States as
      Doxil® and outside the United States as Caelyx®) compared to PLD alone.

      Vintafolide is a drug that is specifically designed to enter cancer cells via the folate
      vitamin receptor (FR). Experimental evidence shows that this target receptor is expressed on
      virtually all ovarian cancers. Early clinical evidence in a small number of Phase I subjects
      and in a subset of subjects in an on-going single-arm Phase II study suggests that
      vintafolide may have antitumor effect in women with advanced ovarian cancer and that it is
      generally well-tolerated. This evidence suggests that vintafolide may be useful as
      chemotherapy against advanced ovarian cancer.

      Patients at centers with EC20 imaging capability will also undergo imaging with the folate
      receptor (FR-)targeting investigational diagnostic agent EC20 during the screening period to
      assess uptake of this agent into tumors. This non-invasive procedure will provide additional
      information on the utility of EC20 imaging to identify subjects with the FR molecular
      "target" before treatment with vintafolide therapy.
