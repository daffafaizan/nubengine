      cardiotoxicity as compared to other androgen-deprivation therapies. This study investigates
      the main characteristics of patients affected by cardiovascular side effects of which
      supraventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular
      tachycardia), and cardiac failure imputed to drugs classified as L02, and G03 according to
      anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification. A causality assessment according to the
      World Health Organization-The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) is systematically applied.
