      subsequent to left hemisphere stroke. Even when language functions recover sufficiently to
      enable the patient to return to work, continuing dyslexia often interferes significantly with
      job performance. This study will evaluate cognitive therapies for the treatment of acquired
      dyslexia.

      Each therapy is based upon a cognitive neuropsychological model of reading; the therapies
      target specific types of reading deficit and stem from the question of re-learning versus
      re-organization of function. The therapies focus on dyslexic disorders stemming from the
      following underlying deficits: 1) impaired access to the orthographic word form from the
      visual modality (pure alexia); 2) impaired orthographic/phonologic connections
      (phonologic/deep dyslexia); and 3) decreased ability to hold phonologic codes in memory
      (phonologic text alexia).

      Participants in this study will undergo a comprehensive and detailed battery of reading and
      reading-related tests to determine the underlying impairment causing the reading deficit.
      Based upon the results of these tests, the patient's dyslexic disorder will be characterized
      and, if appropriate, the patient will be assigned to one of the treatment programs devised
      specifically for that type of deficit. Treatment programs are evaluated for efficacy by
      comparing the accuracy and speed of reading pre- and post-treatment.
