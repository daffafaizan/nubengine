      pulmonary ailments in Canada, affecting about 2.5 million and 750 thousand individuals,
      respectively. In the last two decades, the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) has successfully
      developed and disseminated evidence-based asthma and COPD clinical practice guidelines.
      However, evidence suggests that guideline implementation in these diseases remains
      inadequate.

      Successful guideline implementation requires tailoring of selected strategies to settings and
      population-specific barriers, based on established theories and principles. In 2004, the CTS
      and its collaborators organized a symposium in Quebec City, to discuss existing barriers to
      respiratory guideline implementation and possible knowledge translation (KT) strategies. This
      was followed in the fall of 2007 by an expert-led workshop on guideline implementation
      strategies.

      Herein, the investigators report the planned methods and outcome of a project which resulted
      from these meetings. This study sought to explore the effectiveness of a multi-faceted KT
      strategy in improving concordance with COPD and asthma guidelines among primary care
      physicians (PCPs) in Canada, but was aborted due to inadequate PCP recruitment. The
      investigators discuss the difficulties encountered in recruiting PCPs, factors which may have
      influenced recruitment, and alternative strategies. The goal of the investigators is to
      provide practical lessons to inform the design of future KT initiatives with similar
      interventions and/or a similar target audience.
