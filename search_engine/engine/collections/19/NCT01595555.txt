      35% of North Americans. Stress management programs, while effective, may be prohibitively
      resource intensive or difficult to access by broad populations.

      This research is examining whether an online stress management program - Stress Free NowÂ©
      (SFN) - can achieve meaningful improvements in measures of stress and wellbeing. We are also
      examining whether improvements in wellbeing and stress can be enhanced through an online,
      internet based support group which share experiences as they go through the Stress Free Now
      program. This program is modeled after an intensive group program, called Mindfulness Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR), which has shown benefits across a broad array of medical issues in
      addition to more specific stress related problems.

      This is a three arm randomized controlled trial which will last for 12 weeks. Participants
      will be randomized into one of the study arms: Non intervention Control, Stress Free Now and
      Stress Free Now + Message Board. We aim at enrolling 600 participants, with the expectation
      that 50% will complete the study (100 per group).

      A series of questionnaires will be collected at baseline, at the end of the 8-week program
      and at follow up at week 12. Outcome measured are stress, mindfulness, vitality, physical,
      social and emotional health, transcendence and self-acceptance. We will also ask participants
      to complete a weekly log to measure program adherence and usage.
