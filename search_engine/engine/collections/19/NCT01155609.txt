      I. To determine the complete response rate, decrease in severity, and time to complete
      response of oral mucositis related to head and neck cancer irradiation and chemotherapy after
      using L-lysine supplementation daily.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the functional impact of use of L-lysine for oral mucositis on daily life as
      measured by the Functional Life Index-Cancer (FLIC) Questionnaire total score.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive L-lysine orally (PO) once daily (QD) until completion of radiotherapy and
      resolution of mucositis in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly until mucositis
      resolves.
