      of atherosclerosis. Recently, it was reported that monocytes can develop a long-lasting
      immunological memory after stimulation with various microorganisms, which has been termed
      'trained innate immunity'. This memory is induced by epigenetic reprogramming. We hypothesize
      that trained monocytes augment atherogenesis.

      Objective: The main objective is to study whether patients with coronary atherosclerosis show
      specific epigenetic changes in the promoter regions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
      chemokines and whether this correlates with the inflammatory phenotype of these cells.

      Study design: Observational study

      Study population: Adult patients who have had computed tomography coronary angiography
      because of chest pain: 20 patients without atherosclerosis and 20 patients with severe
      atherosclerosis will be included.
