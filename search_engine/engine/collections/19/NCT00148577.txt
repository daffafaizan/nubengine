      at term pregnancy using TENS on 4 acupuncture points (Li 4 and Sp 6) (n=50) and the placebo
      group (n=50). Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the effect on pain before the
      application, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after TENS. The objective parameter of outcome was the
      score of VAS decreased in each groups. A post-partum questionnaire was given 24 hours later
      to evaluate the satisfaction and the use of this pain relieving method for the next delivery.
