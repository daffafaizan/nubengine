      -supported Supplementary Feeding programmes in Ethiopia. The proposed study is a prospective
      cluster-randomized equivalence trial that will compare the relative effectiveness of two
      feeding interventions in four woredas (districts). Research will be implemented in two
      comparable woredas (one with CSB and one with RUSF), in two different areas in Sidama zone
      that represent different livelihood zones, main source of crop income, and level of food
      insecurity
