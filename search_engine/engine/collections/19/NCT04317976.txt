    
      All patients consented for the study were having their airway examined via US. Cross
      sectional sonography of the airway was performed to determine the anatomic relationship of
      the oesophagus relative to the trachea:

        1. before induction of anaesthesia

        2. after GA before external airway pressure manoeuvre

        3. after GA with external airway pressure manoeuvre.

      US guided CP was applied on subjects with central oesophagus; CP and PLP were applied on
      subject with eccentric oesophagus anatomy.

      PLP was performed by lateral compression on the eccentric oesophagus by fingertips under US
      guidance. To standardised the application of CP and PLP, only 2 well trained investigators
      were allowed to performed the CP and PLP, US scan on airway and patient recruitment. The
      conduct of trial involved 2 investigators where first investigator provide US scan, and
      second investigator provide compression of CP or PLP using fingertips guided by the
      instruction of first investigator.
