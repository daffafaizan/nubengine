      hospital who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and signed informed consent. Baseline oxygen
      saturation and clinical findings were noted. Chest x-ray was done on admission. Baseline labs
      were sent, initial level of CRP (C-reactive protein) was noted down.

      Patients with oxygen saturation < 94% on room air with normal chest x-ray and CRP between 30
      - 50, were labelled as having moderate covid 19 disease. Patients with CRP> 50 and having
      infiltrates on chest x-ray at the time of admission were considered having severe covid 19
      disease. Intravenous methylprednisolone in a dose of 1 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses or
      dexamethasone 8 mg/day IV was given to alternate patients for 5 days. After 5 days, the
      investigator again recorded the oxygen saturation, CRP level and repeat chest x-ray findings.

      Patients were given tocilizumab and convalescent plasma as and when indicated. Oxygen was
      given by nasal cannula and face mask. Patient was shifted to ICU if clinical condition
      deteriorated and/or mechanical ventilation is needed.

      The investigator noted the improvement in clinical, radiological and biochemical parameters
      of the patient on day 0 that is admission day and later on day 5 after giving steroids
      (methylprednisolone or dexamethasone) for 5 days.

      Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. Descriptive statistics like frequency and means
      were calculated. Paired sample t-test was applied for comparison of the two groups.
