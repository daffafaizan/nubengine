      of all available evidence to publish a report on Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for calcium
      and vitamin D. In the absence of adequate sun exposure, acquiring the new RDA of 600-800 IU/d
      for vitamin D through diet alone is difficult. There is a need to increase dietary sources of
      vitamin D for Canadians.

      In a double blind, randomized trial, our objective was to assess the effect of high
      temperature pizza baking on the bioavailability of vitamin D3 fortified Mozzarella cheese. We
      tested the following hypotheses, set a priori: 1) vitamin D3 is bioavailable from pizza baked
      with fortified Mozzarella cheese and heat does not significantly break down vitamin D3; and
      2) the change in serum 25(OH)D (from baseline to 10 wk) will be significantly greater in the
      high-dose vitamin D treated group (28000 IU/wk) compared to the low dose vitamin D-treated
      group (200 IU/wk).
