      protein, Cyclic amine monophosphate-Response Binding Elements (CREB) binding protein or CREP
      Binding Protein (CBP). Patients are treated with many different doses of metformin, some
      patients respond well to low doses while others require much higher doses. The investigators
      do not understand why this may be and are interested in knowing if the investigators can
      treat patents effectively with low doses. What the investigators do not know is how this
      process is affected when the dose of the metformin is increased or changed. Changes in
      metformin's target protein will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the dose.

      Also, currently the same doses of metformin are often used in both children and adults, but
      it is possible that the dose of metformin should be based on age and weight. Understanding
      how CBP works could potentially help us to tailor metformin treatment individually for
      patients based on their age, weight and CBP response.
