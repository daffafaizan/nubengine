        -  To describe the gene expression of VEGF and non-VEGF angiogenic growth factor genes in
           kidney cancer specimens from patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with
           sunitinib malate.

        -  To describe the association between quantitative gene expression levels of VEGF and
           non-VEGF angiogenic factors and clinical efficacy of this drug, as measured by response,
           duration of response, and time to progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 8 weeks. Within 2 weeks after
      completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo a nephrectomy and evaluation for
      response to therapy. Beginning 4-8 weeks after surgery patients resume oral sunitinib malate
      once daily for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients with disease progression after 8 weeks of adjuvant treatment receive treatment off
      study with other agents.

      Viable (non-necrotic) tumor and non-tumor kidney tissue samples are obtained at the time of
      nephrectomy for correlative biomarker studies. Tissue samples are analyzed for gene
      expression of VEGF and non-VEGF angiogenic factors by real-time RT-PCR, western blot, and/or
      IHC. Blood samples are obtained at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks for evaluation of
      circulating levels of VEGF and selected chemokines.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed monthly.
