      excellent fast acting antidepressant. By acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist, its mechanism
      of action is complementary to classical and long acting antidepressants like Selective
      Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). In particular, ketamine is able to boost synaptogenesis
      in only a few hours whereas long-term prescription of SSRI can stimulate neurogenesis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new therapeutic strategy that could integrate
      ketamine in the same time than SSRI, to control depression symptoms faster and optimize
      patient's quality of life complementary to treatments of cancer.
