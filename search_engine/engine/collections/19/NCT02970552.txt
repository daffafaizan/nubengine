      VP to prevent PTB among HIV-infected Zambian women. To assess the feasibility of a full-scale
      clinical trial, the investigators will implement a pilot two-arm, double-masked,
      placebo-controlled trial of VP among HIV-infected women in antenatal care in Lusaka, Zambia.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either daily self-administered VP or
      indistinguishable placebo prior to 24 weeks gestational age. In this pilot study, the
      investigators will be able to estimate study uptake, adherence to study product and protocol,
      and study retention. To assess the acceptability of a trial to test VP among HIV-infected
      women in Zambia, the investigators will employ a qualitative approach of longitudinal
      semi-structured interviews among women agreeing to trial participation and one-time
      semi-structured interviews (SSIs) among those who decline to participate.
