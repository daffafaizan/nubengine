      had been shown that the contact of blood components with artificial surfaces, the surgical
      trauma, endotoxemia and a reperfusion injury are in part responsible for the seen
      immunological affect after surgery. The purpose of this study is to test the effect of
      continued mechanical ventilation during surgery on a blood marker called soluble ST2 in
      patients sera. Soluble ST2 acts as a decoy receptor of IL-33 and has anti-inflammatory
      effects. Elevated soluble ST2 concentrations are reported in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction, sepsis, congestive heart failure and elevates soluble ST2 levels are associated
      with adverse outcome.
