      of alcohol and support the examination of neuroactive steroid modulators as treatment options
      for alcohol use problems. Dutasteride, a widely prescribed medication for benign prostatic
      hypertrophy, blocks a key step in the production of neuroactive steroids and represents a
      promising candidate for treatment of alcohol use disorders. This study will use a 12-week
      randomized placebo controlled design to examine the safety and efficacy of dutasteride to
      reduce drinking among a sample of 160 men with hazardous levels of alcohol use. It will
      additionally examine the potential moderation of dutasteride treatment effects by a common
      missense polymorphism in a neuroactive steroid biosynthetic enzyme that we have previously
      reported to be associated with alcohol dependence. Identification of genetic predictors of
      medication response offers the potential for matching alcohol treatment medications with
      those most likely to respond.
