      tremor (ET - essential tremor) is a pharmacotherapy. In the case of lack of its
      effectiveness, the gold standard procedure is deep brain stimulation (DBS). Despite the
      proven efficacy, still remains a group of patients not eligible for this treatment. in such
      cases, ablation within the deep structures of the brain (thalamotomy, subthalamotomy,
      pallidotomy) can be considered.

      Thermoablation and radiosurgery (SRS - Stereotactic radiosurgery) are used: SRS is prefered
      for patients who are not candidates for invasive procedures.

      27 patients will be enrolled in this study. All patients will be immobilized in thermoplastic
      masks and planned (RT) on the base of CT/MRI fusion.

      The initial total dose in the target volume (thalamic nuclei complex - VoP and VoA ) will be
      70 Gy given in one fraction. The dose will be escalated every 5 Gy and the treatment effect
      and possible side effects will be evaluated. Dose escalation will be finished at a dose at
      which the effect of treatment will be satisfactory, or if side effects are unacceptable. The
      highest dose tested dose will be 110 Gy. Three patients will be irradiated with particular
      doses and observed at least 3 moths; then study will be continued.

      Patients will be controlled 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 months after treatment completion and, next every
      each 6 months. Neurologic and neuropsychologic status, local effect (MRI ) and eventual
      toxicity will be checked during follow-up (FU).
