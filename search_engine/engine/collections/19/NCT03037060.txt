      billion dollars annually in the US. In the clinical treatment of alcoholism, reducing alcohol
      consumption in heavy drinkers is a major clinical challenge. As such, there has been much
      emphasis in both clinical and preclinical research to identify the substrates that mediate
      craving, excessive drinking and addiction. Identifying the neurobiological mechanisms of
      alcohol dependence may lead to the development of new and better treatment strategies.
      Preclinical studies indicate that the D3 receptor is involved in alcohol-cue response and in
      the motivation to drink alcohol. However, there is currently no data available in human
      subjects exploring the relationship between D3 and those behavioral responses in subjects
      with alcohol use disorders.

      Aim #1: To measure the [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET binding levels in the brains of subjects with
      alcohol use disorders.

      Aim #2: To determine the relationship between D3 receptor binding and alcohol cue induced
      craving and motivation to self-administer alcohol in the laboratory.

      To achieve designated goals, the investigators will recruit 25 male and female subjects who
      are non-treatment seekers. After a period of abstinence from alcohol, participants will come
      to the Centre for Addiction of Mental Health for a [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET scan. Participants will
      also have additional sessions during which other alcohol-related measures will be assessed
      (i.e. alcohol cue induced craving and motivation to self-administer alcohol in the
      laboratory).
