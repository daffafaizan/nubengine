      the side effects of opioids (nausea and vomiting and sedation), and NSAIDs (bleeding) makes
      it difficult to obtain adequate analgesic control in these patients. On the other hand,
      preoperative anxiety may be associated with a poorer postoperative analgesic control and
      hinder the adequate postoperative evolution. The main outcome is to assess the postoperative
      analgesic management in patients undergoing to craniotomy. Secondary objectives are to
      evaluate the appearance of postoperative side effects related to the analgesics and to assess
      the relationship between preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain
