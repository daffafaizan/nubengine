      initiation, progression to AUD, and development of significant, lasting adverse outcomes from
      use. Effective treatments must be developed for AUD in this especially vulnerable age range.
      The identification of a well-tolerated, effective pharmacological treatment would represent a
      significant advance and could yield tremendous public health impact. The proposed trial will
      provide critical data to evaluate NAC as a highly promising pharmacotherapy for adolescent
      AUD, and regardless of NAC versus placebo outcomes will provide key methodological guidance
      for future randomized controlled trials of pharmacotherapies for adolescent AUD. Randomized
      participants will be provided and instructed to take their assigned medication at 1200 mg
      twice daily, in approximately twelve-hour intervals.
