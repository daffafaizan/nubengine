      trial with 30 patients aged â‰¥ 40 years with PAD. Eligible patients will be screened according
      to specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients will be treated per our current
      practice as reflected in the American Heart Association Practice guidelines on PAD. n-3 PUFA
      supplementation will be achieved with 4 capsules of Pro-Omega twice daily (Nordic Naturals,
      Watsonville, California, USA), corresponding to a total of 4.4g/day given prior to and
      immediately after the operation. Each ProOmega capsule contains 325mg of EPA and 225mg of
      DHA. The placebo group will take the same number of capsules containing inactive substance
      (soybean; Nordic Naturals), designed to be the same color and shape as the treatment
      capsules. Blood draws, questionnaires, and ultrasounds will be done periodically. Specific
      measurements will include established markers of inflammation and resolution of inflammation,
      as well as ultrasound measures of PVI patency. The study proposed here has the potential to
      provide important new insights on the role of nutritional interventions in PAD, as well as to
      improve outcomes related to surgical revascularization.
