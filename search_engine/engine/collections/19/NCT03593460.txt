      levels. Patients will be administered a starting dose of sPIF 1mg/kg (n=10/cohort) for 14
      days assessing safety, tolerability and clinical response based on the effect on ALT levels
      until day 84. This will be followed by enrolling (n=10) patients administering 2mg/kg sPIF
      for 14 days assessing safety, tolerability and clinical response based on the effect on ALT
      levels until day 84. This be followed by an interim analysis that will determine clinical
      efficacy by comparing the 1mg and 2mg dose results; testing the decrease in mean ALT percent
      and determining the number of patients in remission defined as normalized ALT level. The
      successful cohort will enroll additional patients to enable power analysis. If no significant
      improvement is observed in the two cohorts, N=10 patients will be enrolled and administered
      3mg/kg sPIF for 14 days assessing safety and tolerability. If no significant improvement is
      noted and safety and tolerability is maintained additional 10 patients will be enrolled at
      4mg/kg. Following the same analysis, the maximal dose to be administered will be 5mg/kg.
