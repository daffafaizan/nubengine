      randomly assigned to one of three groups: control: 0.5% ropivacaine adding normal saline;
      epinephrine: 0.5% ropivacaine adding epinephrine; dexamethasone: 0.5% ropivacaine adding
      dexamethasone. We assess time to first analgesic request after post-anaesthesia care unit
      discharge.
