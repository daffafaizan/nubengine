    
      The primary aims of this prospective cohort study are:

        1. To determine the long-term (up to 10 years) anatomic success rate of sacrocolpopexy
           (defined as Stage 0 apical prolapse AND <= Stage 2 anterior and posterior prolapse AND
           no re-operation or pessary treatment for POP), and whether anatomic success differs
           between women who had vs. those who did not have concomitant Burch colposuspension at
           the time of sacrocolpopexy;

        2. To determine whether there is a difference in long-term stress continence (by symptoms)
           between women who had vs. those who did not have concomitant Burch colposuspension at
           the time of sacrocolpopexy;

        3. To determine whether there is a long-term difference between overall pelvic floor
           symptoms and pelvic-floor specific quality of life between women who had vs. those who
           did not have concomitant Burch colposuspension at the time of sacrocolpopexy.
