      to their medical history, physical examination, blood testing, and computed tomography (CT)
      scan of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Those patients who qualified for the study received a
      single intravenous dose of CRS-100 on study day 1, after which they remained in the hospital
      for five days for safety monitoring of health status, including serial blood collections.
      Study participants returned for out-patient follow-up for further blood tests and additional
      monitoring of safety and immune response to CRS-100. At day 56, after administration of
      CRS-100, participants had a repeat CT scan to measure tumor size, and they were then
      discharged from the study.
