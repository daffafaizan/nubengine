      performance at two adjacent cervical levels (C3-C7) in the treatment of patients with
      symptomatic degenerative disc disease. One-half of the patients in this randomized pivotal
      clinical trial will be treated at two adjacent cervical levels with the PRESTIGE-LP device.
      The remaining patients will receive a bi-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with
      cortical ring allografts and the ATLANTIS Cervical Plate System.
