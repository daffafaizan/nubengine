      high-dose chemotherapy, with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, who will be
      randomized into two groups. The physical performance and fatigue outcomes will be compared
      between the control and the experimental group. The control group will perform an exercise
      program based on the standard protocol of physical therapy, consisting of bicycle ergometer
      endurance training for 5 minutes, with resistance individually adjusted based on the
      patient's feedback (from 70% of maximum heart rate) and resistance exercises for muscle
      groups hip flexors, knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors and resistance training form
      arms, with weigths of 0,5 to 1,0 kg (10 repetitions, 1 set).

      The experimental group will perform a periodic resistance training program, with an
      auto-regulated and a non-linear model, using the Submaximal Ergometer tests with incremental
      load (from 85% of maximaum heart rate or maximum effort related), 30-Second Chair Stand, Hand
      Grip strenght and submaximal effort of arms with weights of 0,5 to 1,0 kg.
