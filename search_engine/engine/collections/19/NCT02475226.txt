      2-year period were retrospectively reviewed. 135 patients, determined with traumatic or
      nontraumatic brain damage, with a more than 24-hour stay in the ICU, included the study.
      Reasons for brain damage were determined as brain damage associated with pure head trauma
      (Group HT), head trauma accompanying general body trauma (Group HT+GBT) and spontaneous
      haemorrhage (Group SH). The type of brain damage was defined from the radiological diagnosis
      as subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), subdural haematoma(SDH),
      epidural haematoma(EDH), skull fracture, brain contusion or a combination of these (COM).
