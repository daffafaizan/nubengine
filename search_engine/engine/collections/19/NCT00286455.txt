      diabetes mellitus, of which 90% to 95% are type 2. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes varies
      among racial and ethnic populations and has been shown to correlate with age, obesity, family
      history, history of gestational diabetes, and physical inactivity. Over the next decade, a
      marked increase in the number of adults with diabetes mellitus is expected.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      enzyme. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of
      2 peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of dipeptidyl peptidase IV will improve glycemic (glucose) control in patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of alogliptin in subjects with type
      2 diabetes mellitus who are inadequately controlled and who have failed treatment with diet
      and exercise. Individuals who participate in this study will be required to commit to a
      screening visit and up to 14 additional visits at the study center. Study participation is
      anticipated to be about 34 weeks (or 8.5 months).
