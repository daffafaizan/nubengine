      the brain, retina and other nervous tissue. LCPUFAs are found naturally in seeds, nuts, fish
      and human breast milk. The body can also make LCPUFAs from shorter-chain fatty acid
      precursors.

      The researchers in the study have previously found that LCPUFA supplementation during infancy
      has a beneficial effect on vision and development in the early years of life. However,
      researchers feel there is a growing need to better understand if there are structural and/or
      functional changes in the brain that explain these benefits. It is also important to
      understand if changes in development are still present later in childhood.
