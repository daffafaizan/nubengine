      their propensity to induce resistance when not taken with absolute regularity and their cost.
      Treatment interruption in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment in the setting of
      chronic infection are associated with viral rebound and rapid CD4 T cell decrease conducting
      to antiretroviral therapy restart.

      In patients with high CD4+ cell counts (patients receiving treatment of chronic infection
      with controlled viremia and patients who are receiving HAART now in whom treatment would not
      have been started based on current guidelines), we evaluated the safety of long term
      supervised treatment interruption. Another aim of this study was to assess the immunological
      and virological factors associated with the duration of treatment interruption (proviral HIV
      DNA at baseline and during follow-up, plasma HIV RNA at baseline and during follow-up, CD4 T
      cell and CD8 T cell HIV specific responses at baseline and after 12 months).
