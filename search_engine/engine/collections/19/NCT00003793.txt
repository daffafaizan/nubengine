        -  Identify genetically susceptible patients to therapy-induced myelodysplastic syndrome or
           acute myelogenous leukemia (t-MDS/AML) prior to initiation of high-dose chemotherapy for
           sarcoma.

        -  Identify patients who are at increased risk of t-MDS/AML during or after therapy.

      OUTLINE: Blood is collected from patients at diagnosis (preferably before chemotherapy or
      transfusion), at end of therapy, and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after therapy.

      Blood specimens are examined by clonality analysis (HUMARA), variant cell frequency
      (glycophorin A assay), GST NAT2/CYP1A1 genotyping, microsatellite instability, and ras
      mutation detection (single strand conformation polymorphism and sequencing of mutant
      alleles).

      Patients do not receive the results of the genetic testing and the results do not influence
      the type or duration of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 321 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
