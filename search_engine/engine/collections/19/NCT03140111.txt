      eye drops, and a CE-marked comparator product. All Participants will be allocated to a
      treatment group in a random order.

      The study design allows observations to be made between the treatments at both an intra- and
      inter-patient level regarding relationships between the patient's disease specific quality of
      life, symptoms and adverse events, and satisfaction with treatments.
