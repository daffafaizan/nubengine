    
      Study TDE-HF-302 was a multicenter, open-label study in subjects participating and completing
      all required visits for Study TDE-HF-301. This study assessed the long-term safety of oral
      treprostinil in subjects with PH associated with HFpEF.

      Subjects received oral treprostinil as 0.125-, 0.25-, 1-, and 2.5-mg sustained-release
      tablets. For subjects who were randomly allocated to receive oral treprostinil in Study
      TDE-HF-301, the initial dose of oral treprostinil was the same as the final dose in Study
      TDE-HF-301. Subjects randomly allocated to receive placebo in Study TDE-HF-301 were
      administered the initial dose of oral treprostinil at 0.125 mg 3 times daily (TID). Dose
      increases could occur in 0.125-mg increments every 72 hours at the discretion of the
      Investigator up to 6 mg TID, the maximum allowable dose determined by the Data Monitoring
      Committee during Study TDE-HF-301. Doses of study drug were to be increased in the absence of
      dose-limiting drug-related adverse events (AEs) to ensure that each subject received the
      optimal dose throughout the study. Subjects returned for visits at Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24,
      and every 12 weeks thereafter. Subjects who terminated the study early were asked to return
      to the study center for a final evaluation.

      Safety assessments consisted of AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, and clinical assessment
      of heart failure signs and symptoms.

      Due to the lower than expected number of subjects enrolled, the planned secondary
      efficacy-related endpoints were not analyzed.
