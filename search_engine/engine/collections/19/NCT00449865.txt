      the coming decades as the population ages. Symptoms of PD may include tremor, rigidity or
      stiffness of the limbs and trunk, slowness of movement, and impaired balance and
      coordination. These problems occur because as PD worsens, some of the brain cells that
      control body movement die.

      This study will determine if creatine--an investigational compound--is able to slow the
      progression of PD. Creatine, a widely used dietary supplement is thought to improve exercise
      performance. In animal models and human studies, creatine has been shown to be well tolerated
      and may have some ability to protect brain cells.

      In the NET-PD LS-1 study, 1,720 participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      creatine or a placebo (inactive substance). Participation in this study lasts a minimum of 5
      years and includes at least 9 follow-up clinic visits and at least 3 telephone calls.
