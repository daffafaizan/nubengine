      bioavailability of single oral doses of XS003 compared to TasignaÂ® given as single oral dose
      in healthy male subjects. The second part is a food-effect part which assesses the food
      effect of a single oral dose of XS003 in healthy male subjects either fed or fasted. The
      study will also evaluate safety and tolerability of XS003 as secondary objectives.
