      are highly prevalent in primary care. The primary care sector plays a key role in the
      treatment of common mental disorders as general practitioners (GPs) set the course for
      identification, diagnosis, therapy and referral to specialized treatment. The objectives of
      the CoLiPri study are to implement a complex consultation-liaison service at the intersection
      between primary and secondary care and to investigate its clinical and cost effectiveness in
      patients who are identified at primary care practices with elevated symptoms of depression
      and anxiety. Focus of the complex intervention is on improved collaboration and communication
      among GPs, mental health experts, and other services involved in the care of patients with
      common mental disorders. The novel service aims to support the decision-process at primary
      care practices, to increase access to evidence-based mental health treatment, and to help
      improve patients' pathways of care. The CoLiPri service for GPs include expert consultations,
      on-demand patient referral for structured diagnostics, and/or treatment planning, as well as
      brief psychotherapeutic interventions and triage. The effectiveness and cost effectiveness of
      the intervention as an add-on to enhanced usual primary care (usual care plus structured
      depression and anxiety screening) are evaluated in a cluster randomized clinical trial in
      screened patients with at least mild symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. In case of
      positive results, the service might serve as a model how to improve multi professional
      collaboration and clinical resource allocation for better delivery of mental health care.
