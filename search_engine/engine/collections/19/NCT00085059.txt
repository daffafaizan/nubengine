      Primary

        -  Determine the therapeutic activity and efficacy of boron neutron capture therapy using
           boronophenylalanine-fructose complex in patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the objective local response in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of local response and time to local progression in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the dose-response relationship at the per-lesion level in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive boronophenylalanine-fructose complex IV over 90 minutes followed by boron
      neutron capture therapy on days 1 and 2.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 6 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter. In the event of
      disease progression, patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
