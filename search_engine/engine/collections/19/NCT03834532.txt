      reconstruction decision aid or an educational website on healthy living with breast cancer.

      Participants will complete up to three surveys; a baseline survey before viewing the decision
      aid or website, a second survey immediately after viewing the decision aid or website, and a
      third survey six months after surgery. Tablets will be made available to participants at the
      study site through which they can complete the surveys and view the decision aid or website.
      Participants will have the options of viewing the decision aid or website outside of the
      study site, and completing the three surveys electronically or on paper.

      The baseline survey and second survey will each take approximately 45 minutes for
      participants to complete. The third survey will take approximately 30 minutes for
      participants to complete.
