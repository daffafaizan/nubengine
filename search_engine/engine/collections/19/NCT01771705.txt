    
      This is a single center randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of
      adjusting calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dosing based on Nuclear Factor of Activating T Cells
      (NFAT)-dependent cytokine gene expression as compared to standard of care adjustments based
      on trough level. Before any study-related evaluations are performed, the patient must give
      written informed consent. Once consent is obtained, a patient's eligibility to participate in
      the study will be assessed within 4 weeks of their 6 month management biopsy. Approximately
      40 patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized at University of California, San
      Francisco (UCSF). Eligible patients include any patient maintained on triple therapy with
      tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil ,and prednisone who has had no prior rejection episodes and
      who has undergone a 6 month management kidney biopsy that shows no evidence of acute cellular
      rejection or antibody mediated rejection.
