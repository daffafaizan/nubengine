      cross-sectional investigation. Oral health literacy level will be assessed by conducting a
      structured interview. Background variables, attitude, socioeconomic factors and psychological
      factors shall be assessed using self-administered questionnaires. A clinical examination will
      be conducted including general health information and extended oral health examination. The
      oral health examination performed includes record of oral hygiene status such as dental
      caries and periodontal status. An assessment of oral bacteria will also be performed.

      The second stage will be carried out approximately 6 months after starting with the baseline
      investigation. At that time a modified version of the questionnaires will be used followed by
      a shorter clinical examination. The modified questionnaires at the second data collection
      exclude some background variables. The clinical examination carried out during this time will
      be on dental plaque and bleeding index and the level of oral bacteria.
