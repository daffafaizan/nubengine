      for GC to discriminate allowed and not allowed administrations. However, recent studies have
      proven that the use of a unique criteria is not adequate given the diversity of
      administration routes, doses and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of each
      drug.

      The goal of this study is to conduct additional studies using dexamethasone (DEX),
      methylprednisolone (MP) and deflazacort (DEF) in order to generate additional data of urinary
      concentrations and wash-out periods after single and repeated oral doses of these drugs.
