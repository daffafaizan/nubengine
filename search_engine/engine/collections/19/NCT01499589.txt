    
      Anesthesia-controlled time means anesthesia pre-procedure time plus anesthesia post-procedure
      time.

      We also compares the anesthesia-controlled time in 3 groups of

        -  general anesthesia

        -  regional anesthesia

        -  general anesthesia combined with regional anesthesia
