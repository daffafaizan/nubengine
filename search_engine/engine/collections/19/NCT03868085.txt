      weeks) associated with the surgical treatment of peri-articular injuries of the lower
      extremity (ie acetabulum, distal femur, tibial plateau, pilon, talus, calcaneus) can lead to
      a measurable decrease in bone density in the injured limb. Furthermore, this osteopenia can
      persist for extended periods of time - much longer than the original period of restricted
      weight bearing. This relative osteopenia can delay recovery from injury, lower fracture
      threshold for subsequent injury and potentially delay return to active duty in the case of a
      wounded warrior. There exists a significant body of research in the modulation of the
      osteopenia associated with restricted weight bearing as it pertains to long term space flight
      (microgravity).
