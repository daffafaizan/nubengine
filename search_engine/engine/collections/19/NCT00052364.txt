      I. To assess response rate and progression free survival in patients with hepatocellular
      cancer treated with oxaliplatin.

      II. To assess the toxicity and tolerance of oxaliplatin in patient with hepatocellular
      cancer.

      III. To evaluate the mRNA expression of enzymes in tumors of the patients entered on this
      study which may be important to the cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin (ERCC1, mismatch repair,
      ribonucleotide reductase, bcl-2, bax, p53). An attempt will be made to obtain tumor biopsies
      from all patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of the
      fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular cancer (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.
