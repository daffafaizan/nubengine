      in adult chinese participants with cancer. The study will consist of a screening phase
      (within 21 to 1 days before admission to the research facility on Day -1) followed by a 4-day
      open-label treatment phase (Day -1 to Day 3). Participants will remain confined to the study
      center from Day -1 until completion of the end-of-study visit or withdrawal assessments,
      which will be done upon completion of the 48-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 3, or upon
      early withdrawal. The total study duration will be approximately 24 days. All participants
      will undergo a naloxone challenge test (at a subcutaneous [under the skin] dose of 0.8
      milligram [mg]) for opioid dependency during the screening phase. Only those participants who
      pass this challenge test will be allowed to continue in the study. During the treatment
      phase, upon completion of a 10-hour overnight fast, participants will receive a single oral
      (having to do with the mouth) 8 mg dose of hydromorphone in the morning of Day 1. Serial
      blood samples will be collected immediately before and through 48 hours after dosing for the
      determination of plasma hydromorphone concentrations. Participants will be administered
      naltrexone 50 mg, to block the opioid effects of hydromorphone, 14 hours before, 2 hours
      before, and 10 hours after study drug administration. After the 10-hour dose, additional
      doses of naltrexone will be administered every 12 hours up to 34 hours postdose.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
