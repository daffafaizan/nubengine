      and other complications associated with stroke can result in decreased quality of life and
      significant declines in the activities of daily living. Mirror therapy has been shown to have
      a moderate effect, facilitating the functional recovery among individuals who have
      experienced a stroke. A prototype for a computerized, mirror therapy device was developed and
      found to be feasible. Recently, the investigators published a critical review and an
      activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis analysing the widespread reports of
      brain activity associated with mirror therapy. Observations using functional near-infrared
      spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate a group of people with stroke (n = 14) and healthy
      volunteers (n = 18) revealed that performing complex tasks during the mirror therapy paradigm
      enhanced top-down motor facilitation in the ipsilesional/ipsilateral hemisphere relative to
      the moving limb. An important next step in this series of studies is to evaluate the training
      effects associated with the performance of complex tasks during mirror therapy among stroke
      patients, using the designed computerized mirror therapy device to deliver the enhanced
      mirror therapy training. The results of this study will help the investigators to understand
      the underlying mechanisms through which mirror therapy facilitates motor rehabilitation and
      will add to the body of literature describing the best, evidence-based practices for mirror
      therapy during stroke rehabilitation. The investigators propose a pilot study (n = 30) to
      test the methodological procedures and obtain preliminary results for a fully powered,
      randomized, controlled trial (RCT), combined with economic evaluation, to compare the
      therapeutic and cost-effectiveness between standard mirror therapy and enhanced (complex task
      and blurred image) mirror therapy.
