      transplant centers whose interactions are managed by the NMDP's Center for Cord Blood. Banks
      agree to comply with uniform collection, screening, testing and storage requirements. Upon
      approval of membership, cord blood banks submit detailed information on each stored CBU for
      registration into a proprietary computer system. A transplant center, working on behalf of
      potential recipients, submits search requests to the NMDP and receives electronic reports
      detailing potentially suitable CBUs. From these reports, the transplant center selects a
      CBU(s) for further testing, which includes at a minimum confirmation of the CBUs Human
      Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing data. Upon final selection of the desired CBU for
      transplantation, arrangements are made for timely shipment of the unit to the transplant
      center. Following transplantation, recipient outcome data are submitted by the transplant
      center for addition to the study database.
