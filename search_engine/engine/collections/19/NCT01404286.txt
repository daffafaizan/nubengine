      evaluations (total body mass, height and body mass index calculation) to characterize the
      sample. Three familiarization sessions were conducted with the exercise machines used in the
      study, and one repetition maximum test (1 RM) was completed in order to quantify the training
      session load. A PSG test was conducted on the same day of the exercise session for the
      resistance group, and the control group had a second PSG without exercise to compare the
      groups at both times.

      The body composition assessment, the adaptations to the exercises and the training sessions
      were held at the Center for Psychobiology and Exercise Studies.
