      diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer die within 2 months from the diagnosis. Patients
      eligible for systemic treatment have a median survival of less than one year and often
      receive limited benefit from chemotherapy, usually with progression of disease after only a
      few months of treatment. Patients with pancreatic cancer experience marked physical
      suffering, psychological distress and resource-demanding care at the end-of-life.
      Complications such as pain, fatigue, malnutrition, cachexia, exocrine insufficiency and
      diagnosis itself lead to a poor quality of life and are associated with high rates of
      depression and anxiety.

      These invalidating symptoms are best alleviated by attachment to specialized palliative care
      and by starting this support early in the course of the disease and not just in the terminal
      phase. Early implementation of specialized palliative care is not a standard of care in
      Denmark.

      Thus, an urgent need exists to evaluate the early, integrated palliative care model in a
      comparative study and across multiple care settings to define quality of life and survival
      benefits for patients with pancreatic cancer in Denmark.
