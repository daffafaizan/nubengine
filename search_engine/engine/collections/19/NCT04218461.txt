    
      Delirium, a disturbance of consciousness with an acute onset and a variable course of
      impaired cognitive functioning, is common in patients admitted to the ICU. Several tools are
      available for assessing delirium in ICU patients, of which the confusion assessment
      method-intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) has the highest sensitivity and specificity.

      Although several predictive models for non-intensive care patients exist, as well as one for
      older medical intensive care patients, no evidence based prediction model for general
      intensive care patients is available. Also the tools are not involved the metabolic
      parameters which cause delirium. Because of that the tool need to have biochemical
      parameters.

      In the light of these information our aim is to validate the PRE-DELIRIC model in medical ICU
      in Turkish people.
