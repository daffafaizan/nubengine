      social situations affect financial quality of life. For people who are experiencing financial
      hardship, a cancer diagnosis can be devastating. For others, cancer may cause or even worsen
      financial stress, for example, with their work, their ability to maintain benefits such as
      health insurance, their ability to pay bills, and their ability to get the cancer treatment
      they need. The impact of cancer on financial quality of life is an important area of study
      within cancer care. Considering the financial burden of cancer also lends greater
      appreciation for the problems that people face if they cannot handle cancer's costs, or if
      needed resources are either not present or are too stretched to help with the care they need.
      For this study, up to 180 cancer patients will be interviewed with a written questionnaire.
      Of this group, 15 people will also be asked if they would like to participate in a follow-up
      personal interview with the researcher. The major hypothesis of this study is: The greater
      the vulnerabilities in predisposing factors and enabling factors, the greater the need
      factors with respect to cancer diagnosis and treatment, and the lower the perceived ability
      to adhere to treatment, the poorer will be the financial quality of life.
