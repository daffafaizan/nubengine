      (death during or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy) and hypertension related
      morbidity. Black women, women with lower education and less access to health care resources
      also have increased maternal mortality and morbidity. This project will use Bluetooth enabled
      blood pressure devices to monitor blood pressure in a population of postpartum women at
      increased risk for maternal mortality and morbidity. We will compare the number of postpartum
      hypertensive incidences and severities to a population of women who did not have a postpartum
      blood pressure control intervention.
