      olfaction. The normal olfaction group will be randomized (15-15)to either daily saline nasal
      irrigation for one week or no irrigation. Normal olfaction subjects will be seen for two
      visits, olfactory dysfunction for one. All subjects will complete an UPSIT (smell
      identification test)and a co-morbidity form. All subjects will have a brief nasal exam and
      then have nasal cells collected by means of a curette on one side and a cytobrush on the
      other. All subjects will receive Afrin and lidocaine, to improve visualization and for
      comfort during cell collection. Subjects will then complete a Comfort Scale related to the
      methods of cell collection. Normal olfaction subjects randomized to nasal irrigation will
      receive instructions on how to do it and the irrigation results will be collected for
      analysis along with the nasal cells. At their return visit, normal olfaction subjects will
      repeat the UPSIT and the comfort scale--all normal olfaction subjects will have a repeat cell
      collection. Subjects randomized to nasal irrigation will also complete a transition scale
      which asks if they feel the irrigation made a difference in their sense of smell. Subjects
      are compensated for time with a gift card.
