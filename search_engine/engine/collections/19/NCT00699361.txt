      stomach. H+/K+ ATPase was also found in smooth muscle cells and in other tissues (McCabe,
      R.D. et al., Am J Physiol. 1992). For myocard a localisation is only proven for rats yet
      (Beisvag, V. et al., Acta Physiol Scand. 2003). Moreover biochemical hints lead us to a
      highly probability of a myocardial H+/K+ ATPase (Nagashima, R. et al., Jpn Heart J. 1999).
      Aim of our clinical study is to examine, whether proton pump inhibitors have an influence on
      myocardial contraction of human myocard and we want to ascertain the amount of influence of a
      H+/K+ ATPase on myocardial contraction. Therefore the mechanism of a putative inhibition by
      proton pump inhibitors is at our focus. These findings will be of major credit regarding
      treatment of patients with congestive heart failure with common proton pump inhibitors. We
      want to find out, whether this intake may have a negative inotropic effect on the heart
      failure myocard.
