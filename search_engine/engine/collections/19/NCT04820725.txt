      mobility is important factors that can cause impairment quality of life, reduction of
      exercise tolerance and pulmonary capacity with the progression of AS. Extra articular
      symptoms such as neurologic, cardiovascular and pulmonary involvement affect morbidity and
      mortality rate. Foot and ankle involvement may stem from both postural changes in patients
      seen spinal deformity with the progress of the disease and enthesitis. Şahlı et al. concluded
      that 52% of AS patients had foot involvement but 35% of the patients had symptoms. To be
      determined plantar pressure distribution is important to be decided body weight distribution,
      postural control and selection of shoes. The purpose of the study is to investigate the
      relationship plantar pressure distribution and balance, mobility and disease activity in AS
      patients and to compare AS patients with and without postural changes and healthy subjects.
