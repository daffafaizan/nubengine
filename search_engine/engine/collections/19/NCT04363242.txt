      T-cells are a type of cell produced by the body that can attack and kill cancer cells.
      Unfortunately, many cancer cells have ways preventing T-cells from working properly. SYN125
      and SYN004 can make T-cells work again. This is a study to find the maximum tolerated dose of
      SYN125 when it is used as a single treatment (Part A) for solid tumors, and when it is used
      as a combined treatment with a fixed dose of SYN004 (Part B), in patients with epithelial
      cancers with EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor) expressions.
