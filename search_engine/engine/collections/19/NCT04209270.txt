      the initial phase of ventilatory support, with few studies observing the weaning in
      mechanical ventilation.The RS in patients with ARDS is characterized by a greater or lesser
      degree of low functional residual capacity (FRC) in relation to normal.

      At the time of performing a spontaneous breathing trial, these mechanical characteristics
      determine the need to develop a high transpulmonary pressure during each breath, with high
      work of breathing (WOB) to achieve adequate alveolar ventilation.

      Inspiratory muscle weakness could alter the ability to generate the necessary transpulmonary
      pressure over time according to the loads imposed at the time of performing a spontaneous
      breathing trial, with the consequent development of fatigue and ventilatory failure.

      This is why the investigators propose to evaluate the association between elastic WOB and the
      failure of the spontaneous breathing trial.
