      with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in population studies, supporting the
      possibility of its modulation by dietary factors. To investigate the interaction between the
      common LIPC -514(C/T) SNP and dietary fat, the investigators compared changes in lipids and
      glucose in response to two levels of dietary total fat (20% energy intake vs. 39% energy
      intake) in a crossover, randomized dietary intervention study enrolling Caribbean Hispanics.
      Individuals were screened for LIPC rs1800588 genotype prior to enrollment, and
      genotype-associated differences in response to diet were evaluated.

      The study was designed to test the following hypotheses:

        1. Carriers of the T allele consuming a low fat (LF) diet will have decreased hepatic
           lipase activity as compared with subjects with the CC genotype at the -514(C/T)
           polymorphism. Conversely, in individuals consuming a high fat (HF) diet, T carriers will
           exhibit an impaired ability to down regulate hepatic lipase activity.

        2. Based on differences in hepatic lipase activity, the investigators hypothesized that a
           significant and clinically relevant proportion of the individual variability in fasting
           plasma HDL-C responses to changes in dietary fat intake would be due to variability at
           the LIPC locus. Specifically, CC subjects will respond to increases in total dietary fat
           consumption with significant increases in HDL-C concentration. Conversely, increased fat
           consumption in T carrying subjects will result in decreased HDL-C concentration.
