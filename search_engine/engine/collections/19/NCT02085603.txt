      to radiotherapy or chemotherapy and sometimes the sideeffects of strong painkillers, like
      morphine, can limit the dose of drug that can be given. The investigators have some evidence
      that a molecule called Src is involved in the development of cancer-induced bone pain. This
      study will use a drug, saracatinib that targets Src and will see if giving it to patients can
      reduce pain from cancer in the bones. The investigators will compare saracatinib to a placebo
      over a 4 week period in an estimated 62 patients. The investigators will measure whether the
      pain that patients report is less with saracatinib than placebo. The investigators will also
      measure how many painkillers people are taking before and after saracatinib/placebo, if pain
      thresholds have changed, if pain-related symptoms and quality of life have been improved and
      if saracatinib has a direct effect on the rate at which cancer breaks down bone.
