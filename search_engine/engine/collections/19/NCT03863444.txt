      weeks of primipara and their spouses. Specifically, inclusion criteria are (1) gestational
      age 35 to 39 weeks, (2) adults, (3) primipara and their spouses, (4) having routine prenatal
      visits and plan to have birth in the medical center, (5) able to communicate with Mandarin or
      Taiwanese, and (6) willing to participate in this study and give written inform-consent
      forms. Exclusion criteria are (1) having fetus with abnormality, (2) high-risk pregnancy, and
      (3) cannot room-in due to newborn's medical conditions. Participants would be assessed on the
      time points of recruitment (T1), early postpartum during hospitalization (T2), and one-month
      postpartum (T3).

      Before conducting this study, the institutional review board (IRB) has approved this study.
      The research staffs will approach potential participants during their prenatal visits and
      invite them to participate in the study. Potential participants would be informed of the
      study purposes, interventions (routine care for control group, routine care plus intervention
      for intervention group), and interview contents. After written consent is obtained, the
      interventions will be arranged. In order to control the quality of data collection, the
      investigators will train the research assistants. Research training will include ethical
      concerns about collection of research data, methods of approaching eligible subjects,
      interviewing techniques, and pilot testing of data collection. The training will provide
      research assistants by the PI and Co-PI of this study.
