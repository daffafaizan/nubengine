      disease, as both preterm birth rates and infant survival increase worldwide. Hypertension and
      cardiovascular disease begin in early adulthood in individuals born prematurely, but the
      reasons especially in regard to the role of preterm birth are unknown. An improved
      understanding of why hypertension and cardiovascular disease occur in early adulthood in
      individuals born preterm will enable the development of prevention and treatment strategies
      to mitigate the burden of cardiovascular disease. Investigators propose to investigate these
      relationships mechanistically in a clinical trial of subjects born preterm to establish the
      SSBP (salt sensitivity of blood pressure) phenotype and study its relationship to CVD
      (cardiovascular disease) compared to a control group of healthy term- born peers.
      Investigators will then propose to determine if blocking UA (uric acid) formation improves
      SSBP and cardiovascular function in subjects born preterm.
