      sporadic (s-) and familial (f-) frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) patients and
      asymptomatic family members of f-FTLD patients, characterizing the cohorts longitudinally and
      informing clinical trial design. The study has two arms: a "longitudinal arm" involving a
      comprehensive assessment of clinical, functional, imaging, and biofluid data collection
      annually, and a "biofluid-focused arm" involving limited clinical data to accompany
      biospecimen collection. For more information: https://www.allftd.org/
