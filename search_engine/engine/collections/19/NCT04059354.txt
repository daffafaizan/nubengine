      intervention study assessing the efficacy of an integrative speech treatment approach for
      individuals with DS. DS is a common genetic disorder that causes lifelong intellectual
      disability where speech intelligibility is typically compromised affecting quality of life.
      The clinical management of communication disorders in individuals with DS is a priority for
      NIH's National Institute on Deafness and Other Communicative Disorder. The proposed treatment
      addresses the void in speech intervention and is based on our Vocal Tract Development
      Laboratory's (VTLab) research findings on anatomic, acoustic and perceptual studies from
      speakers with DS. Having identified specific difficulties in the production and perception of
      select vowels, this treatment focuses on accurate vowel production, while combining and
      adapting two established speech treatment approaches on articulatory accuracy and motor
      learning. The articulatory treatment uses the cycles phonological approach and the motor
      learning treatment is script training.

      Findings from this clinical intervention study are expected to pave the path towards optimal
      management of speech intelligibility in speakers with DS. The current pilot study is open to
      males based on findings from our lab's research that males are less intelligible than their
      female peers. The investigators also expect findings to provide the preliminary data needed
      to bridge the gap towards an exploratory clinical research proposal on functional anatomy as
      an intervention strategy for both males and females.
