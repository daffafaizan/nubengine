      laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN), which can obviously affect the post-operational renal
      function. Pneumoperitoneum preconditioning (PP) is a promising strategy to render a
      protective effect on kidney, which has been already confirmed in some clinical settings. This
      study is designed as a randomized, prospective, double-blind and parallel controlled clinical
      trial to assess the short-term and long-term renoprotective role of pneumoperitoneum
      preconditioning in patients undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, and observe its
      effect on the other abdominal organs. Patients with renal tunours and willing to accept
      elective LPN will be screened as eligible participants. The investigators aim to enroll 86
      subjects. Patients randomized to the treatment arm will receive PP consisted of three cycles
      of 5 min insufﬂation and 5 min desufﬂation before PLN, while the control arm receive a sham
      operation.
