      leukemia, representing 20% of all childhood cancers in the United States (1). Although
      significant strides have been made in therapies for other pediatric malignancies, mortality
      for patients with brain tumors remains high. The mainstay of therapy for CNS tumors has been
      a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. High dose chemotherapy with stem cell
      transplant has been proposed as an alternative to radiation, in very young children and for
      relapsed patients. Stem cell transplantation however is not without significant side effects
      as well as transplant related mortality.

      Busulfan is an alkylating agent and is able to exert its cytotoxic effects through hydrolysis
      and subsequent production of carbonium ions, directly alkylating DNA, interfering with its
      replication, and ultimately leading to cell death (2). Busulfan readily crosses the blood
      barrier, allowing for CNS levels nearly equal to those of plasma levels (5,6).

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Busulfex ® in children with recurrent,
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To obtain preliminary data regarding progression free survival (PFS) and event free survival
      (EFS) when Busulfex ® is used at submyeloablative doses in children with recurrent,
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.

      To describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of Busulfex ® in children with recurrent,
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors, using a continuous infusion.
