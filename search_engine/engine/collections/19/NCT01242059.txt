      apart, and received 1 of the 5 treatments per week. The 5 treatments were tomato soup with 10
      or 20 g of isolated yellow pea fibre or protein, or a control soup with no added pea
      fractions. Food intake was measured at an ad libitum pizza meal served 2 hours after
      treatment. Satiety and blood glucose (via finger prick) were measured throughout the
      treatment period.
