      Demographic and Health Survey 2014 revealed a rising caesarean section rate .

      Many of these procedures are elective allowing time for preparation of the patient for
      surgery.

      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal, multi disciplinary, evidence based
      approach to surgical care with an ultimate goal to enhance recovery and improve maternal and
      neonatal outcome .

      This is done through optimizing multiple aspects of patient care to enhance recovery and so
      accelerate (facilitate) earlier discharge (decrease length of stay, decrease opioids use and
      encourage breastfeeding) .

      A comparative study in Egypt found ERAS to be effective in controlling perioperative
      gastrointestinal symptoms, pain control and encourages early ambulation with offering earlier
      resumption of intestinal motility, higher satisfaction and fewer days of admission .

      The clinical audit is a tool for assessing the compliance of current practice with the
      standard of care. In an audit, both process of care compliance and outcome of care can be
      measured to highlight gaps that need to be addressed by the institution . Enhanced Recovery
      After Surgery society issued Guidelines for elective Cesarean Section care .

      They include elements in preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative care. Compliance with
      each of these items was associated with improved maternal or neonatal outcome and a better
      recovery experience .
