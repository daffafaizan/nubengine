      characterization is crucial and a scoring system would be useful to standardize the imaging
      report and thus, improve patients management. Recently, the coordinating center developed the
      first MR scoring system named ANDEXMR SCORING system in a retrospective study which is
      accurate and reproducible. The objectives of this trial are to perform an external
      prospective validation of this scoring system to evaluate its potential impact on therapeutic
      strategy and to test its reproducibility.

      This is a prospective large multicenter study. All patients with a sonographically
      indeterminate adnexal mass referred for MR imaging will be included from each participating
      center. One senior and one junior radiologists independently analyze the different MR
      criteria to characterize adnexal masses. The reader will then classify the mass using ADNEXMR
      SCORING system.
