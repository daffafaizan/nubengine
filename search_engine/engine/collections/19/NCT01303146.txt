    
      Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by the
      deficiency of the Arylsulfatase A enzyme (ARSA), resulting in accumulation of galactosyl
      sulfatide (cerebroside sulfate), a major constituent of the myelin sheath. Accumulation of
      galactosyl sulfatides leads to a progressive degeneration of the white matter in the central
      and peripheral nervous system (CNS, PNS) and neuronal degeneration. The late infantile form
      of MLD, which usually is diagnosed in the second year of life, is the most frequent and
      severe form of the disease. The prognosis is severe, leading to vegetative stage or death
      within few years after the diagnosis. There is no treatment for patients affected with this
      early onset form of the disease. In patients with late-onset MLD (juvenile and adult forms),
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can stabilize the cerebral demyelination.
      This treatment is however inefficient in patients with late infantile MLD at a symptomatic
      stage. The overall objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rhASA treatment in a
      patient with late infantile MLD who had received HCT at a presymptomatic stage of the
      disease. Patient will receive rhARSA (100 U/kg) intravenously every other week for a period
      of 18 months.
