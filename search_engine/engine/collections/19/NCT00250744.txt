      "delayed" (days later) nausea and/or vomiting for patients receiving chemotherapy treatment
      for cancer. Patients on the study will receive aprepitant or gabapentin in addition to the
      standard medications used to prevent nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant is approved by the FDA
      for nausea and vomiting. Gabapentin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of seizures but
      it may be effective in controlling nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy. Subjects
      receiving aprepitant will be receiving a proven treatment for delayed nausea and vomiting,
      while subjects receiving gabapentin will be receiving a drug that has only shown limited
      effectiveness.

      Patients are eligible for participation in this study because they are going to receive
      chemotherapy that may cause nausea or vomiting. If patients have delayed nausea or vomiting
      after the first cycle of treatment, they will be offered a chance to receive additional
      treatments with their second cycle of chemotherapy. The University of New Mexico Health
      Sciences Center is sponsoring the study.

      The first 40 patients enrolled in the study will participate in the pilot phase of the study.
      A pilot study is a smaller version of a full study to determine how effective the treatments
      are. All 40 patients in the pilot phase of the study will come from UNM. If the pilot phase
      is found to be successful, then the study will continue and approximately 200 patients will
      eventually be enrolled. The full study will be conducted at the University of New Mexico
      Cancer Research and Treatment Center (UNM CRTC), the New Mexico VA Healthcare System, and at
      members of the New Mexico Cancer Care Alliance.
