    
      Population studied: anesthetized patients for cardiac surgery of coronary bypass.

      Secondary endpoints : - comparison between TEE and mini-invasive monitoring systems in
      accuracy of measurement of stroke volume variation during ARM. These mini-invasive systems
      are : Clearsight system (Edwards Lifescience) and Flotrac system (Edwards Lifescience)

      - Difference between pre and post-cardiopulmonary bypass status on principal purpose
      evaluation
