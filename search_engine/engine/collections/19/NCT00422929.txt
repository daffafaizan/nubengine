      pathogenesis and/or persistence of otitis media (OM). Cross-sectional studies report a lower
      prevalence of OM in older children, a better ET pressure-regulating function in older
      children and age-related differences in ET form, length and width, and the vector orientation
      of the paratubal musculature. These growth-related changes in ET structural relationships are
      demonstrably predictive of increasingly more efficient ET function (ETF) and, because the ET
      and paratubal musculature are intimately related to the cranial base, the vector orientation
      of the ET system can be reconstructed from osteological or radiographic data. Together, these
      observations suggest that measurable, age-related changes in ET-paratubal muscle vector
      relationships are reflected in more efficient ETF and, by consequence, a decreased OM risk.
      The overall goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to evaluate the validity of this
      hypothesis.
