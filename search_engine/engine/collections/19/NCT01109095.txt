    
      When the patient enrolls on this study, they will be assigned to a dose of HER2-CAR CMV-T
      cells.

      The patient will be given a single injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the
      assigned dose. The injection will take between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed
      in the clinic after the injection for 1 to 4 hours. If later the subject seems to be
      experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms),
      s/he may be able to receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if they wish. These
      additional infusions would be at least 6 to 12 weeks apart and at the same dose level
      received the first time.

      Medical tests before treatment--

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests as follows:
      Physical exam, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart
      function tests (Echocardiogram),Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies

      Medical tests during and after treatment--

      The patient will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusions and after:Physical
      exams, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart function
      tests (Echocardiogram) at 6 weeks after the infusion, Measurements of the tumor by routine
      imaging studies 6 weeks after the infusion

      To learn more about the way the HER2-CAR CMV-T cells are working and how long they last in
      the body, blood will be taken on the day of the T-cell infusion, before, 1 hour and 4 hours
      after the T-cell infusion, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the T-cell infusion and every 3 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years.
