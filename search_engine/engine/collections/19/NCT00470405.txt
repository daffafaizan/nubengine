      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of pemetrexed
           disodium in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic solid tumors or
           lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pemetrexed disodium and oxaliplatin until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, the recommended phase II dose will be identified.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then periodically
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
