      feasibility has been tested in our previous study. This 3-year research project aimed to
      further examine the immediate and lasted effects of BMS program for bipolar disorders (BD),
      and to assess its knowledge dissemination and the transferability of its evidence-based
      practice across multiple sites.

      During the first 2 years, a randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients diagnosed
      with BD were recruited and 104 patients were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU) or
      to 8 BMS sessions. A battery of three outcome indicators-social rhythm, illness perception,
      and symptom severity-were used to examine the effects of the two groups at baseline, after
      intervention, and every 3 months until half year. In addition, a pre- and post-test
      quasi-experimental study combined with qualitative design was used to assess the
      translational feasibility of BMS and to explore related barriers and facilitators of
      implementing BMS in clinical settings in the third year. Nurses from 4 Hospitals received the
      BMS training, and patients with BD received the BMS translated in practice were recruited.
