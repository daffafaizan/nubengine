      genetically modified T cells. Genetic material is transferred into the subject's previously
      harvested autologous T cells to redirect them to target myeloma cells rather than their usual
      target. Study subjects must have systemic or multifocal myeloma requiring autologous stem
      cell transplantation whose disease has relapsed or incompletely responded to prior therapy or
      have high-risk features. Subjects must also have measureable disease on study entry, as
      defined by quantifiable or detectable levels of serum or urine paraprotein or elevated serum
      free light chains with an abnormal ratio.
