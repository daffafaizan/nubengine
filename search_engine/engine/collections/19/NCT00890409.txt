      disabilities. Data from animal studies have shown protective effects of mild hypothermia to
      both the mature and immature brain. Recently research priorities have moved from bench to
      bedside. Several studies have shown a trend for brain protection of mild to moderate
      hypothermia and mild hypothermia has emerged as a promising treatment for HIE. Therefore,the
      investigators organized a multi-centered randomized controlled trial of selective head
      cooling (SHC) combined with mild systemic hypothermia in HIE newborn infants.
