    
      This is a multicentre, Phase III trial with a parallel-group design, consisting of a 2 week
      drug-free run-in period, followed by a 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment
      period, a drug-free washout period of at least 2 weeks, and a second 4-week double-blind
      treatment period.

      During the initial run-in period, the subject's bowel habit will be documented in a daily
      diary and the existence of constipation will be confirmed. Eligible subjects will be randomly
      allocated to double-blind treatment with either 4 mg prucalopride or placebo, given orally
      once daily before breakfast, for 4 weeks.

      After 4 weeks of treatment, each subject will enter a drug-free washout period. The length of
      the washout period will be either 2 or 4 weeks, depending on how long it takes for the
      subject to meet the criteria for constipation. If the subject is unable to re-qualify after a
      4-week washout, the subject must be discontinued from the trial.

      Subjects who qualify for the second double-blind treatment period will receive the same
      treatment as during the first treatment period, once-daily for an additional four weeks.
