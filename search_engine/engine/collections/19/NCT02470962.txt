      adolescence, including the heart. The usual method to evaluate the heart is echocardiography,
      emphasizing few parameters. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not as widely available as
      echocardiography, but early changes can be detected before they become visible on
      echocardiography. In this study, the investigators compare the methods of measuring heart
      function in order to find the best measurements for follow up and to see how fast the
      degenerative changes occur in the hearts of patients with muscular dystrophy.
