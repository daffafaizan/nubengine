      Primary

        -  To characterize the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on the modulation of markers of
           autophagy, as measured by p62, Beclin1, LC3, and GRp170 expression, in pre- and
           post-treatment tumor biopsy samples, skin samples, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell
           samples from patients with stage III or IV melanoma undergoing palliative or curative
           surgery.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether the steady-state plasma concentration of HCQ correlates with
           observed trends in induced markers of autophagy.

        -  To determine the potential mechanisms of antitumor effect of HCQ, as measured by a
           reduction in tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67 and mitotic rate) or an increase in
           apoptosis (activated caspase-3 and TUNEL assays) in melanoma specimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral hydroxychloroquine twice daily for 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery.

      Blood, tumor tissue, and skin samples are collected for pharmacokinetic and correlative
      laboratory studies. Expression of p62, Beclin1, LC3, and GRp170 (autophagy markers) is
      analyzed.
