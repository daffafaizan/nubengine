      using a sealed envelope method. The etoricoxib 90 mg group receives etoricoxib (Arcoxia®,
      Merck Sharp & Dohme GmbH, Haar, Germany) 90 mg orally, the etoricoxib 120 mg group receives
      etoricoxib 120 mg orally and the control group receives a placebo tablet orally 1 h before
      surgery (day 0). All patients receive a standard general anesthesia with intravenous propofol
      (2-3 mg/kg), fentanyl (2 µg/kg) and mivacurium (0.2 mg/kg) for induction. Patients are
      ventilated via a tracheal tube, anesthesia being maintained with sevoflurane (0.8 - 1.5%
      end-tidal concentration). If mean arterial blood pressure or heart rate increase to more than
      25% above the pre-operative baseline value despite an end-tidal concentration of 1.5%
      sevoflurane, an intravenous bolus of fentanyl 0.05 mg will be administered. Monitoring
      includes electrocardiogram (ECG), non-invasive arterial blood pressure, pulse oximetry,
      end-tidal CO2 and end-tidal sevoflurane. On days 1 to 3 patients will receive etoricoxib (90
      mg or 120 mg qd.) or placebo. After discharge on day 3, patients will receive etoricoxib (90
      mg or 120 mg qd.) or placebo until cessation of pain during activity (swallowing). According
      to the current label for Arcoxia® 120 mg in Germany, patients taking etoricoxib 120 mg will
      switch to etoricoxib 90 mg on day 8. Rescue medication will be piritramid i.v. (day 0),
      oxycodone p.o. (day 1-2) and paracetamol p.o. (day 3-14).
