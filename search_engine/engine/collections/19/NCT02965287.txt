      will test it in a large cohort that is likely to resemble a real population. The purpose of
      validation is to see if the test is able to recognize the few malformed fetuses in the entire
      population and especially its specificity in real conditions. In addition, the investigators
      will check whether particular maternal conditions (such as preeclampsia, gestational
      diabetes, etc.) or fetal conditions (Small for gestational age, Large for gestational age,
      etc.) affect the test results.
