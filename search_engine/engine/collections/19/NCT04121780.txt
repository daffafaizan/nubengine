    
      GHD is the most common anterior pituitary abnormality after traumatic brain injury (TBI). It
      can occur as a result of either direct pituitary or indirect hypothalamic injury.
      Sports-related repetitive head trauma might induce pituitary dysfunction, and in particular,
      isolated GHD. Growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) has long been known to have a
      beneficial effect on body composition and exercise capacity. However, it has recently been
      shown that GHRT also benefits the brain. The primary objective of the current study is to
      assess the effect of GH on memory, executive function and attention domains of cognitive
      function in GHD- professional football players with TBI. The study will also utilize the
      adult growth hormone deficiency assessment (AGHDA) questionnaire, quantitative
      electroencephalogram (QEEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, respectively, to
      measure the quality of life (QoL), electrical activity and structural changes in the brain
      that may correspond to cognitive deficits.
