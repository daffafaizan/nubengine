    
      Patients and Methods: Data will be collected (after Nepal Health Research Council approval)
      for 1 year as patient gets admitted with Intracerebral haemorrhage. 160 spontaneous
      intracerebral haemorrhage patients presenting within 24 hours of ictus or last known well
      will be taken in the study. Outcomes of these patients will be calculated to establish a
      relationship between hematoma expansion, underlying pathology and outcome of the patients.

      Results: Primary outcome i.e. radiological improvement (CT scan): Difference between hematoma
      volume with perilesional edema from baseline and 48-hour post treatment scan, hematoma
      location, and new infarction.

      Secondary outcomes: Neurological impairment (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) at
      day 7, Outcome: Dependency (modified Ranking Scale), Cognition (Telephone Interview Cognition
      Score-Modified), and mood (Zung Depression Scale) at days 10 and 90 and 180. Similarly,
      costs: Length of stay in hospital, readmission, ability to return back to daily activities.
      Also, Safety endpoints recorded until day 90: Death (cause), venous thromboembolism confirmed
      by ultrasound, vascular occlusive events (stroke/transient ischemic attack/myocardial
      infarction/peripheral artery disease), seizures. Serious adverse events (AEs) in first seven
      days will be analyzed and calculated.
