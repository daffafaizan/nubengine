      postoperartively, stimulation will be initiated in all patients. Voltage and contact position
      will be altered initially, looking for optimal and stabilized responses in depressive
      symptoms, while trying to minimize any side effects.

      Following this 6 month open-label optimization phase, patients will be then undergo
      randomization to receive 2 weeks of stimulation followed by 2 weeks of sham stimulation, or
      vice versa. These 2 week phases will be separated by a 1 week washout period. Depressive
      symptoms will be evaluated at the end of each 2 week phase, then patients will resume
      open-label stimiulation.
