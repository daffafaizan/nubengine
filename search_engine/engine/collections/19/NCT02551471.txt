      to the care management of PRC-bTME (Primary rectal cancer beyond total mesorectum excision
      planes) and LRRC (Locally recurrent rectal cancer), France and Australia. Regarding its
      healthcare system for patients with PRC-bTME and LRRC, Australia equipped itself with a
      veritable policy of centralisation and clinical pathway, appearing as an international
      referent country in this surgical field.

      The main hypotheses of research are that these differences rest on individual and collective
      representation of disease, organisations, structures, clinical pathway and care management.

      Benchmarking of clinical practices is a process that consists of a structured comparison and
      the sharing of good practices of clinical care; it is based on a quality of care assessment
      and allows to fit into an approach of continuous improvement of this quality of care.
