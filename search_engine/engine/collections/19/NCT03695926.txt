    
      The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate [18F]MNI-1054 as a Lysine-specific
      histone demethylase 1A (LSD1) enzyme targeted radiopharmaceutical. The specific objectives
      are:

        -  To measure the dynamic uptake and washout of [18F]MNI-1054 in brain using positron
           emission tomography (PET) in healthy volunteers.

        -  To measure blood metabolites of [18F]MNI-1054 in the healthy volunteers and to perform
           invasive as well as non-invasive modeling to assess its ability to measure LSD1 in the
           brain.

        -  To acquire safety data following injection of [18F]MNI-1054

        -  Evaluation of [18F]MNI-1054 PET reliability (test/retest) of the tracer parameters in
           healthy volunteers.
