      different conditions (social, sexual, physical, psychological, domestic relationships,
      financial, etc.), many people still have no, limited knowledge, or awareness of pelvic floor
      health and so do not have, or seek how to prevent or correct these disorders . This
      dysfunction may be presented as pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence, fecal
      incontinence , chronic pelvic pain, sexual problems, and/or chronic constipation . Assessment
      of pelvic floor muscle activity plays a major role in Urogynecology and physiotherapy as a
      part of the conservative treatment of pelvic floor disorders (PFD) . Presence of Levator
      avulsion is a major risk factor for female pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and recurrence after
      surgical correction . This dysfunction can be diagnosed clinically using vaginal palpation .
      Palpation is subjective, less reproducible, and difficult to teach than imaging methods [6].
      Studies that used ultrasound for assessment of pelvic floor muscle activity and strength are
      still few . The present study aimed to evaluate the levator ani muscle in both morphology
      (rest), and function (contraction and valsalva) in symptomatic women using 2D, 3D
      trans-perineum ultrasound (TPUS), to compare these features to clinical digital palpation and
      symptoms, and helping in diagnosis of muscle dysfunction.
