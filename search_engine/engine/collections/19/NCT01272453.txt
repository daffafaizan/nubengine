      in most patients (Siemens Definition Flash) represents a potentially crucial technical
      innovation at a particularly critical juncture. National healthcare systems are under
      pressure to deliver accurate and cost-effective diagnosis of an increasing number of patients
      and CT angiography in various settings is a proven, highly accurate technique that has been
      shown to improve diagnostic efficiency and reduce the cost of care.

      However, there has been increasing concern about the lifetime attributable risk of cancer
      from radiation related to diagnostic procedures. Such concern extends to other
      radiation-based procedures that contribute to the cumulative lifetime radiation exposure of
      patients. The Flash scanner holds the promise of substantially reducing exposure resulting
      from a variety of examinations.

      The CT DOSE multicenter trial is therefore designed to validate the extent of dose reduction
      attendant to the use of the Flash scanner in cardiothoracic scanning, and to determine
      whether image quality is preserved in spite of significant dose reduction.
