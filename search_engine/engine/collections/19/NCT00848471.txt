      Harris-Benedict equation, which consider the patient's weight, height, age and sex to
      determine energy needs. However these have been shown to be unsystematically incorrect and
      may vary by 70-140% when compared with indirect and direct calorimetry measurements.

      That is why the most popular method of measurement of energy expenditure in research is via
      indirect calorimetry using a metabolic cart. Indirect calorimetry is the measurement of the
      volume of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.

      Actually, there are few numbers of indirect calorimeters available commercialy. The Deltatrac
      II metabolic cart was the gold standard. It has been extensively used in clinical research
      both for resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation measurement during postprandial or an
      insulin clamp. The Quark RMR is also a metabolic cart too which was launched on the market to
      compete with the others calorimeters measuring resting metabolic rate.

      As the Quark RMR and Deltatrac II use the same measure device (paramagnetic analyser for
      oxygen detection, infrared absorption for carbon dioxide detection) with the same sensitivity
      and time response according to constructor's data, we want to compare these two calorimeters
      for the measurement of energy expenditure and substrate oxidation at rest and during a meal
      in standardized conditions.
