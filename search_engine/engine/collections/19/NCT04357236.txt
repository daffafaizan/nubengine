      mainly depends on the clinical experience of physicians. This study aimed to investigate
      different patterns of antiepileptic drug (AED) responses in patients with BECTS using
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) imaging for better
      personalized medication.

      Methods A total of 55 patients with BECTS (36 AED responders, 19 remitting-relapsing
      patients) and 23 pseudo-controls who underwent 18F-FDG PET imaging were retrospectively
      included. The group comparison was performed to investigate metabolic differences among AED
      responders, remitting-relapsing patients and pseudo-controls. Three different logistic
      regression models were employed to distinguish remitting-relapsing patients from AED
      responders based on clinical features, 18F-FDG PET images and a hybrid of both. Ten AED
      responders who reduced AED dose and one remitting-relapsing patient who relapsed within one
      month after PET examination were included in the model evaluation.
