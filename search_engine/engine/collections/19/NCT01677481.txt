      radial or femoral arterial access sites, and the coronary angiogram will be performed in a
      standard fashion, including left ventriculography. Radiation exposure parameters including
      Air Kerma, Dose-area product, Fluoroscopy time and Operator radiation exposure will be
      recorded. Operator experience as well as demographic data will be recorded.
