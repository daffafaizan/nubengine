      and approximately 50% of women undergoing this surgery require blood transfusion.
      Perioperative blood transfusions have been shown to increase of length of stay, surgical
      complications, postoperative morbidity and mortality. There are a few data on the reduction
      in red blood cell count (RBC) transfusions using perioperative management with intravenous
      iron and tranexamic acid in women with gynaecological carcinoma surgery. This study is to
      determine the effect of perioperative treatment with intravenous iron and tranexamic acid on
      the reduction of intraoperative and postoperative RBC transfusions in gynaecological
      carcinoma patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
