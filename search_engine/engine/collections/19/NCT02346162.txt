      adopt improved dietary and physical activity habits and lose weight prior to becoming
      pregnant, and then help them maintain those habits and prevent excessive weight gain during
      their pregnancy. We model this intervention after successful, frequent-contact interventions
      designed by ourselves and other investigators. We start with face-to-face counseling followed
      by frequent telephone counseling contacts. The expected outcomes for mothers include reduced
      pregnancy-related weight gain (primary) and lower weight at the start of pregnancy
      (secondary) and for babies, decreased risk of exceeding national norms for weight at birth
      (secondary).
