      proportion of patients (57%) diagnosed with metastatic disease, for which the 5-year relative
      survival rate is 5%.With the development of three-dimensional radiotherapy technology, the
      wide application of comprehensive treatment concept, and the understanding of the
      relationship between different metastatic state and survival of stage IV NSCLC, prospective
      and retrospective studies have confirmed that systemic therapy combined with primary tumor
      three-dimensional radiation Treatment is more conducive to improving symptoms and prolonging
      survival than medication alone. Some retrospective analysises of stage III NSCLC, omitting
      clinical target volume of primary tumor with intensity modulated radiotherapy showed no
      reduction in local control rate and survival time.Omitted CTV in Ⅳ NSCLC patients with
      primary tumor radiotherapy can make smaller target area, which could push up most of the
      local stage of late Ⅳ NSCLC patients with primary tumor radiation dose. Prospective studies
      are needed to further clarify whether omission of target areas may affect local control time,
      survival time, and radioactive toxicity.
