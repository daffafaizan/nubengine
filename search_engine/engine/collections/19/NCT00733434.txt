      thrombosis cannot be completely eliminated. Postoperative pharmacological augmentation of the
      established blood flow is considered as a feasible solution to this problem. Prostaglandin E1
      (PGE1 )has been shown to have vasodilatation and anti-thrombosis effects, so it is used by
      some surgeons after microsurgery to keep the patency of the anastomosed small vessels.
      However, PGE 1 may also causes some complications, like pleural effusion or deep vein
      thrombosis. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether a routine use of PGE 1 in every patient
      after head and neck microsurgery is justified. We aim to test the hypothesis that PGE 1
      increases postoperative vessel patency rate in patients undergoing head and neck
      microsurgery, and yielded a comparable complication rate as the control group.
