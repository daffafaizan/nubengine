      Primary

        -  Determine the tolerability of trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) and concurrent external beam
           radiotherapy in women with HER2-overexpressing stage III or IV breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pathologic response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the locoregional recurrence rate (as site of first recurrence or any
           recurrence) and time to locoregional recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to local progression in patients (who are deemed to be non-surgical
           candidates) treated with this regimen .

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once a week for 5 weeks. Patients also
      undergo external beam radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

      Three weeks after the completion of trastuzumab and radiotherapy, patients undergo surgical
      evaluation. Patients deemed to be surgical candidates undergo surgery. Patients deemed to be
      non-surgical candidates continue to receive trastuzumab and external beam radiotherapy for 2
      additional weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
