      condition such as traumatic injury and post surgical conditions. Edema in the hand and wrist
      can result in detrimental physiological changes which decrease the range of motion of joint
      and limit the overall functional capacity and dexterity of the hand. The gold standard
      Volumetric measurements are reliable for measuring edema changes in upper extremity. Using
      volumeters can be cumbersome in a busy clinic. Figure-of-eight measurements using a tape
      measure on the wrist and hand is an easy way to measure edema and can capture the
      accumulation in the dorsal hand that circumferential tape measurements do not capture. This
      study was performed in two parts. Part A determined the intra-rater and inter-rater
      reliability of the Figure-of-Eight method on healthy hands, and compared the figure-of-eight
      measurements to the gold standard volumetric measurements. No study other study has compared
      right and left hands. Part B of the study was conducted in a clinic to assess the intra-rater
      reliability and inter-rater reliability on both hands of patients with hand injuries.
