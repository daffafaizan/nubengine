    
      This nested project of the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Cohort (SMSC) is to assess the severity
      of COVID-19 and the magnitude of antibody response after infection with Severe Acute
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients already treated or not with
      various immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis followed in the framework of the SMSC.

      To assess the frequency and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated symptoms in the
      study population, data is collected from systematic questioning during the SMSC-visits and
      from serum samples collected every 6-12 months within the SMSC (for measurement of
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pre-pandemic reference samples and prospectively to determine
      the anti-SARS-CoV-2-serostatus during the study period).

      Combining the information on anti-SARS- CoV-2 serostatus and infection history opens the
      opportunity to determine the number of patients without or with only mild vs. moderate to
      severe COVID-19 symptoms in large groups of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treated
      with immunotherapies targeting various components of the immune system.
