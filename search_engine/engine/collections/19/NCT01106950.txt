    
      Patients achieving a complete remission and neutrophil recovery (ANC > 500) for at least 4
      weeks will be considered for allogeneic transplant to prolong remission (independent of this
      study).

      All patients, including those who go on to transplant, will be followed to determine disease
      free survival, treatment related mortality, and time to relapse.
