      chromosomal abnormality or birth defects. Both prenatal screening and diagnostic testing
      options to exclude aneuploidy should be offered to all pregnant women early in their
      pregnancy. A standardized educational video on prenatal screening may enhance a patient's
      understanding and knowledge of testing and support more informed decisions.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare patient knowledge scores on prenatal
      genetic screening before and after a standard prenatal care visit compared to the addition of
      a pre-appointment educational video.
