    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomly assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups. The first group undergoes sequential antiepileptic therapy with pyridoxine,
      corticotropin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and nitrazepam. The sequence of administration
      may be altered based on drugs taken prior to entry. Any drug may be omitted due to medical
      contraindications or prior use at study doses or higher.

      The second group undergoes surgical resection of the zone of cortical abnormality. A
      functional hemispherectomy is performed for hemiparesis or diffuse unihemispheric
      dysfunction.

      If seizures are controlled in the first group at 3 months, the current medication is
      maintained; if seizures are not controlled, sequential therapy continues to completion.
      Patients experiencing uncontrolled seizures at 6 months cross to surgery.

      Surgical patients experiencing uncontrolled seizures at 3 months or persistent seizures after
      taper of pre-study antiepileptics cross to drug therapy.

      All patients are followed at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years.
