      of TruePath device with that of the CROSSER device in patients with symptomatic
      femoro-popliteal CTO. Subjects will be followed clinically while in the hospital and at 1
      month following the index procedure. All subjects will undergo procedural intravascular
      ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. The study population will consist of up to 75 patients with
      symptomatic femoro-popliteal CTO and indications for revascularization. Subjects must have a
      previously documented conventional percutaneous procedure or a concurrent failed attempt to
      cross the CTO using conventional guidewire techniques. All subjects must meet all inclusion
      and no exclusion criteria and sign an Informed Consent Form approved by the local
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to enrollment and randomization.
