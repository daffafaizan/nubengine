      hyperbilirubinaemia in extremely premature infants, especially in the first week when patency
      of the ductus is a clinical problem. Phototherapy has also been implicated in increased
      ductal patency. One randomized, controlled trial showed that chest shielding during
      phototherapy reduced the incidence and severity of PDA by 50% in preterm infants. These
      findings were mainly based on clinical evaluation of the ductus with echocardiographic
      studies performed only on a subgroup of infants noted to have a murmur on clinical
      examination.
