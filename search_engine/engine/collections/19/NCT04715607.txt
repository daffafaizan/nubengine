      is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal
      swab (NPS). However, other specimen collection methods like oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and a
      saliva specimen collection have also been accepted by the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention for SARS-CoV-2 testing during the current coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)
      pandemic. It is unclear how much the SARS-CoV-2 detection rate differs when using different
      sampling methods and the aim of this study is to compare the expected COVID-19 detection rate
      using saliva, oropharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal swab in a public setting.

      We, therefore, aim to investigate the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in Saliva, oropharyngeal
      swab, and nasopharyngeal swab specimen samples collected in symptomatic and non-symptomatic
      individuals tested for COVID-19 in a public test center during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Individuals referred for outpatient COVID-19 testing center will be invited to participate in
      a prospective clinical study. They will have saliva, OPS, and NPS specimen collection
      performed at the same time and analyzed separately for SARS-CoV-2. The rate for SARS-CoV-2
      detection in saliva, OPS, and NPS will be compared using a logistic regression mixed-effect
      analysis. A Sample Size Calculation estimated that a sample of 18,000 participants would be
      needed for the trial with 80% power at a significance level of 5%.
