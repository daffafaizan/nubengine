      of a model to generate bones for possible use in clinical settings; the non-viral and viral
      administrations will be compared for best osteogenesis effects.

      The first year purpose:

      The best concentration of canonical Wnt3a will be investigated in promoting the
      osteoblastogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells.
