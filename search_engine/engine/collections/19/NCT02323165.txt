      blood draw, while the subject is being treated for their burn/wounds. The additional research
      samples will be examined for bacteria. A second blood draw will be performed at approximately
      24 hours of initial blood collection. The blood is being collected and then correlate with
      results of routine medical care blood cultures and clinical status of the subject (diagnosis
      of sepsis, hemodynamic instability). Data that will be abstracted from the current electronic
      medical record includes whether there is any type of catheter indwelling (brand name and
      type), insertion methods including place of insertion (Intensive Care Unit, Operating Room,
      Emergency Department), adherence to bundle, complications during insertion, colonization of
      the subject with bacteria (MRSA), and culture results obtained as part of clinical care.
      Demographics (subject's age) and diagnoses will also be captured as some studies have shown a
      higher risk of infection with certain processes (burns) and percentage of burn.
