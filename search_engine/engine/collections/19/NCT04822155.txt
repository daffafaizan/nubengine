      an oft- cited public concern, yet has taken a back seat to other environmental hazards. A
      limited number of observational studies demonstrate that chronic environmental noise exposure
      is associated with poor outcomes in adults and children, including cardiovascular disease,
      poor mental health, impaired sleep, and reduced cognitive performance in children. Further
      investigation and direct measurement at a community-level is needed to not only better
      understand the spatial-temporal distribution of aggregated environmental noise exposure and
      its impact on health, but also to lay the groundwork to develop and evaluate needed
      noise-reducing interventions.

      The broad objective of this pilot proposal is to examine the social gradient of noise at a
      micro-spatial level in Philadelphia and evaluate its impact on the health of pediatric and
      adult local residents. Our multi-disciplinary team uniquely combines emerging digital and
      remote-sensing technologies, and expertise in place- based interventions to achieve the
      following specific aims: (AIM 1) Document the spatial-temporal distribution of environmental
      noise exposure across 24 Philadelphia neighborhoods with low, medium, and high socioeconomic
      status (SES), and (AIM 2) Explore the feasibility of evaluating the relationship between
      noise exposure and biometric health data - including sleep quality, cardiovascular metrics,
      and neurobehavioral profiles in pediatric and adult participants.
