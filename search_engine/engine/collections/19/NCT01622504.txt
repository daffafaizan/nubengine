      intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. It has also been used by intranasal
      administration (off-label use) when the intravenous route is not suitable by administering
      the Solution for Injection using a mucosal atomization device (MAD). However, due to the
      volume of naloxone solution administered this way, some of it may be inadvertently swallowed
      and not absorbed into the nasal mucosa and the product requires administration by medically
      trained personnel. The study aims to investigate intranasal administration of naloxone using
      a more concentrated solution and a nasal delivery device.
