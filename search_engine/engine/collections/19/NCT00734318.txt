      phase. During the run-in phase, subjects receive Flixotide®. In the treatment phase subjects
      will be randomised to one of the four treatment groups and will receive either high dose
      FlutiForm® and Foradil® plus Flixotide® placebo or low dose FlutiForm® plus Foradil® and
      Flixotide® placebo or Foradil® plus Flixotide® and FlutiForm® placebo or Flixotide® and
      FlutiForm® plus Foradil® placebo. Efficacy will be assessed by lung function tests, asthma
      symptoms, sleep disturbance due to asthma and rescue medication use. Safety will be assessed
      by adverse events, lab tests, ECGs and vital signs.
