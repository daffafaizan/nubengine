      patients with OSA via a comprehensive and multidisciplinary program based on stratification
      and individualized care plans, including the motivational interview.

      A multicentre, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was used. The control group followed
      the usual treatment, while the intervention group (PIMA) followed the treatment with an
      adapted and flexible care plan depending on socio-demographic, clinical and psychological
      variables. The treatment plan includes different channels (home, telephone, care center), a
      continuous evaluation, and the use of the motivational interview in each of the interventions
      with the patient. The main outcome was adherence. Secondary outcomes were quality of life,
      emotional state, activities, social relationships, perceived competence and motivation.
