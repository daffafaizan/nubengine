      I. To evaluate anxiety and depression in women with stages I-III breast cancer during the
      first 8 weeks of doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy randomized to receive either minocycline
      (minocycline hydrochloride) or placebo.

      II. To evaluate markers of neuro-inflammation as assessed by blood based inflammatory
      cytokines and C11-choline positron emission tomography (PET) in women with stages I-III
      breast cancer during the first 8 weeks of doxorubicin-based adjuvant therapy randomized to
      receive either minocycline or placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Beginning 1 week prior to chemotherapy, patients receive minocycline hydrochloride
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 9 weeks.

      ARM II: Beginning 1 week prior to chemotherapy, patients receive placebo PO BID for 9 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
