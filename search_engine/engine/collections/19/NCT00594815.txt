      is a safe treatment for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a rare
      tumor. It is usually treated with chemotherapy and radiation. This combination prolongs
      survival, but about half of patients relapse. We hope that the addition of rituximab will
      improve the control of your tumor.

      The second goal of this study is to assess a lower dose of brain radiation. Brain radiation
      may cause memory loss or dementia. For patients over the age of 60, the risk of significant
      memory loss is 80-90%. The risk for younger patients is smaller but less clear. In this,
      study patients whose tumors are in remission after chemotherapy will be treated with a lower
      dose of brain radiation. We hope that this lower dose will be less toxic. However, it is also
      possible that using a lower dose of radiation will be less effective in controlling your
      tumor.
