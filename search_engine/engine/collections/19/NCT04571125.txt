    
      In the present project, investigators aim to explore the complex gene-environment interplay
      in children with ADHD to identify the crucial pathophysiological pathways from genes to the
      brain. To achieve our objective, investigators will use multimodal neurobiological approaches
      to effectively resolve the four major challenges in exploring gene-environment interactions
      on ADHD.

        1. investigators will use multiple levels of neurobiological approaches to identify the
           interactions between monoamine transporter genes and environment on ADHD, including
           neuropsychology, neuroimaging, and neuroactive metabolites in plasma, which will provide
           larger effects than clinical diagnosis.

        2. investigators will employ correlation analyses to test for the presence of correlations
           between the monoamine transporter genotypes and the environmental factors.

        3. investigators will use both categorical (diagnosis of ADHD) and dimensional (inattention
           and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms of ADHD) approaches to assess the interaction
           effects between monoamine transporter genes and environment.

        4. investigators will conduct interactions with ageitems to model more accurately the
           effects of age, which may be non-linearly related to the neurobiological basis of ADHD.
