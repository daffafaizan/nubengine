      disorders individually can be exceedingly rare and many are not yet well characterized.
      Additionally, available clinical testing is not always diagnostic in this group of patients.
      The investigators propose to study disorders across the RAS/MAPK pathway, identifying both
      commonalities and differences, under one unified ongoing research protocol. The investigators
      propose:

        1. To investigate the metabolic and molecular basis of established and suspected
           RASopathies.

        2. Collect specimens derived from blood, buccal cells, sputum, urine, bone marrow, tumor
           tissue and residual specimens, including but not limited to pleural fluid, ascetic
           fluid, chyle, skin, lung, lymphatic or renal tissue and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,
           tissue specimens, and/or cells that are left over from clinical procedures from enrolled
           patients for research purposes only.

        3. Non-invasive or minimally invasive procedures to collect tissues for research purposes
           only, such as saliva, skin, or blood samples are also allowed. The collection of all
           samples from minor subjects will be done only if it is safe for the participant.
           Clinical studies will take precedence over research procedures.

        4. Collect demographic information, medical history, and clinical test results to create a
           longitudinal research database of participants with suspected or diagnosed RASopathies.
           Participants will also complete surveys to be included in the research database (see
           "Research Database" section for details).

        5. Provide a facility for long-term storage of bio-specimens and clinical data from
           participants with suspected or diagnosed RASopathies and their unaffected relatives.
