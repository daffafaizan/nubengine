    
      120 patients enrolled for ophthalmic surgery (cataract or posterior segment surgery
      (epiretinal membrane, macular hole, vitrectomy)) will be recruited in the Department of
      Ophthalmology, Robert Debr√© Hospital, Reims, France.

      Each patient will benefit a complete ophthalmologic examination, and either an aqueous
      sampling (cataract) or a vitreous sampling (posterior segment) along with a serum sampling at
      the beginning of the surgery. ELISA test will be performed on vitreous or aqueous samples in
      triplicates. Luminex will be performed on vitreous samples in order to determine the
      concentrations of several ischemia biomarkers (VEGF, PlGF, Platelet-derived growth factor
      (PDGF-B), SDF-1, Angpt2, InterIeukin IL-6, IL-8, CD105, Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
      (MCP-1), IL-10, interferon-inducible protein-10 ( IP-10), IL-1B and CD106, RAGE).

      Primary objective is:

      - Evaluation of the association between ischaemic retinopathies (patients with or without)
      and sCD160 concentrations of the vitreous or the aqueous humours.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  Evaluation of the association between diabetic retinopathies (patients with or without)
           and sCD160 concentrations of the vitreous, the aqueous humours and the sera.

        -  Evaluation of the association between several vitreous biomarkers of ischaemia and
           sCD160 concentrations of the vitreous and the sera.

        -  Evaluation of the association between sCD160 concentrations in the vitreous and the
           sera.

        -  Evaluation of the association between sCD160 concentration in the aqueous humours and
           the sera.
