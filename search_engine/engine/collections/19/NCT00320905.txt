      CR and 30 will not. CR patients will complete standardized neuropsychological tests (45-60
      minutes) and Transcranial Doppler (30-40 minutes) during their first and last week in the CR
      program. Patients who do not enroll in CR will undergo testing at similar intervals to serve
      as a matched control group. Standard medical records will be collected for participants in
      both groups to obtain demographic and medical information. CR-specific medical records will
      also be collected to obtain information about possible mechanisms for cognitive benefits
      (e.g. improved stress test performance, reduced blood pressure, etc.). All participants will
      be compensated for their time.
