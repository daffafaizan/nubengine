      patients with recurrent or progressive brain tumors. II. Determine the acute and chronic
      dose-limiting toxicity and cumulative toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III.
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this patient
      population. IV. Determine the effects of hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs, such as
      anticonvulsant agents, on the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. V.
      Determine the efficacy, in a preliminary manner, of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      concurrent use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (yes vs no drugs or modest-induction
      drugs). Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice a week for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats
      every 6 weeks for 17 courses (approximately 2 years) in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of
      SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients
      are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually for 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
