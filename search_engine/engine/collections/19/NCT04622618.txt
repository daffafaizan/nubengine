      be included in the study. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before
      randomization. Randomization will be done with the help of a computer generated list of
      numbers. Patients will be divided randomly and equally into three groups (50 patients each(.
      The first group of patients will receive 300 mg gabapentin orally 1 hour before induction of
      anesthesia by a sip of water (group G1), the second group of patients will receive 600 mg
      gabapentin orally 1 hour before induction of anesthesia by a sip of water (group G2), the
      third group of patients will receive 900 mg gabapentin orally 1 hour before induction of
      anesthesia by a sip of water (group G3). Drug formulation will be done by one of the
      researchers making the dosage of the three groups the same in number and shape of the
      capsules and then given to a junior anesthetist who is neither involved nor interested in any
      way in the sample to be administered to the patients surveyed
