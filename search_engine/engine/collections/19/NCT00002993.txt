      and cisplatin (MAP) in patients with recurrent or advanced uterine sarcomas. II. Determine
      the nature and degree of toxicity of MAP chemotherapy in this cohort of patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive IV doxorubicin, mitomycin, and cisplatin over 3 hours once every 3
      weeks, for a minimum of 1 course. Patients who have complete response, partial response, or
      stable disease will continue for at least 3 courses. If side effects are not severe, patients
      may remain on the study regimen at the investigator's discretion for a maximum of 6 courses.
      All patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: The first stage of accrual is anticipated to accrue 20 evaluable patients
      in approximately 12 months. If indicated, a second stage will accrue approximately 10
      evaluable patients.
