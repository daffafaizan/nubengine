      and safe anti-HIV agents and may have different biological behavior than other currently
      available non-nucleoside RT inhibitors.

      Patients are randomized to receive U-90152 at one of three doses (treatment arms I through
      III) or either AZT or ddI (treatment arm IV). Patients on arm IV who are AZT-naive receive
      AZT; those who are AZT-experienced receive ddI. Treatment continues for 24 weeks.

      PER 12/22/94 AMENDMENT: All patients receiving U-90152 have the same starting dose, to attain
      one of three target trough levels.
