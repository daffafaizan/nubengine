    
      This prospective randomized controlled trial will examine satisfaction and effectiveness of
      post abortion contraception by comparing the two types of copper IUDs currently available in
      Canada, and including a non-interventional group of other contraceptive options.

      The primary outcome measure is one year expulsion rates of copper IUDs places post abortion.
      Secondary outcomes are satisfaction with current method at 3, 6, and 12 months post-abortion,
      retention rates and repeat abortion rate over one year. One and five year pregnancy rates
      will be analyzed using access to universal health care databases.

      Our results will provide the first information on the effectiveness of post abortion
      contraceptive methods currently available in Canada.
