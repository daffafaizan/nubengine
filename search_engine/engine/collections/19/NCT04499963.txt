      utilizing a historical control group. Following informed consent and screening, participants
      with ALS will take Theracurmin 1 capsule (90mg) twice daily for 6-months. Treatment with the
      Theracurmin and all study outcome measures and labs are being performed exclusively for
      research purposes. Collected data includes saliva and stool microbiome sampling, adverse
      events, concomitant medications, weight and height, Theracurmin treatment evaluations, and
      Thrive Questionnaires. Participants will be asked to register on the website Patientslikeme.
