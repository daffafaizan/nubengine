      which underwent lumbar spinal surgery will recruited to this study. The patients were
      randomly allocated into two groups (1:1), via a computer-generated randomization list.
      Ultrasound (USG) guided erector spinae block will perform at T10 level (bilaterally) to the
      20 patients under general anaesthesia in Group E and same volume saline will apply to the ESP
      block region at T10 level for control group (Group C). Total intravenous anaesthesia
      (propofol+remifentanil) will perform to the all patients. 15 ml bupivacaine %0.5 and 5 ml
      lidocaine %2 will use for USG guided ESP block. 0.1 microgram/kg morphine intravenously and
      diclofenac Na 75 mg intramuscularly will apply for postoperative analgesia to the all
      patients at last 30 minutes of surgery. Postoperative pain assessment will perform with
      11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). NRS, morphine consumption and complications will
      record. If the NRS higher than 4 rescue analgesic 0.4 mg/kg mepheridine will administer
      intravenously. Diclofenac sodium 75 mg will repeat to the all patients at the 12th of
      postoperative period, intramuscularly.
