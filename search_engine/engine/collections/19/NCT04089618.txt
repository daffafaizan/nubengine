      the traditional Patanjali Yoga system, which can act as a coping factor on the one hand, and
      higher motivation and deepening of self-administered practice (mindfulness based exercises,
      body-oriented yoga exercises and mantra meditation). MBLM aims to establish an exercise
      routine in the daily lives of the participants, which leads to salutogenesis. The promotion
      of mental health through meditation and yoga has been well documented, also in clinical
      populations. The effects of meditation and yoga on addiction and pain are promising, but
      there is still a need for research. Furthermore, the preventive potential of the MBLM program
      will be examined for healthy volunteers, analogous to the already well-researched and widely
      used MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction) program, which was originally also developed
      for patients with pain disorders.

      The study will be conducted as an experimental single case analysis with multiple baseline
      design. Randomization takes place over time instead of control groups.
