      maintenance treatment (BMT) and naltrexone maintenance treatment (NMT) for recently
      detoxified opioid dependent patients (N=130; 65 heroin dependent, 65 opium dependent-Specific
      Aim 1). Manual-guided, HIV risk reduction and drug counseling (DC-HIV) is provided to all
      patients as the platform psychotherapy. Maintenance treatment is provided for 12 weeks to all
      patients; patients may also continue to receive maintenance treatment for an additional 12
      weeks following the initial treatment period. Primary outcome measures, assessed by twice
      weekly urine toxicology testing and self-report during the first 12 weeks and monthly during
      the 12-week extension, include resumption of heroin use, 1 and 3 weeks continuous relapse and
      reductions in HIV risk behaviors. The project will also evaluate the characteristics of
      treatment-seeking opioid addicts in Iran (including specific risk behaviors and patterns of
      HIV risk behaviors; prevalence of psychiatric and other medical comorbidity; and patterns of
      social, family, vocational, and criminal activity and service needs-Specific Aim 2). This
      data will be used to revise the DC-HIV manual to address the specific circumstances and risk
      behaviors of opioid addicts in Iran and to provide data regarding any differential response
      of opium compared to heroin addicts to BMT or NMT. Finally, the project will also provide
      clinical training for health professionals and training and mentoring in drug abuse treatment
      and HIV prevention research to clinical researchers who will continue development,
      implementation, evaluation and dissemination of HIV prevention and drug abuse treatment
      approaches in Iran after the project ends (Specific Aim 3). The Institute for Cognitive
      Science Studies will collaboratively fund the project and lead subsequent dissemination and
      drug abuse and HIV risk reduction efforts in Iran.
