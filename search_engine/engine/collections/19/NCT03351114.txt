    
      A Phase 2, pilot, proof-of-concept, open label, single arm prospective study to assess the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of using crisaborole 2% ointment for adult morphea.
      Patients identified by their physician, nurse, or other member of their clinical care team as
      meeting criteria for the study will be asked to apply crisaborole 2% ointment, twice daily,
      on affected plaques for 12 weeks. A 4 mm skin punch biopsy will be performed at baseline and
      at 12 weeks, on the same affected plaque. Dermal thickness will be measured and compared
      before and at the end of treatment. Patients will have a clinical assessment at baseline and
      at weeks 4, 8 and 12. After week 12, patients who need further treatment will undergo
      standard of care treatment as determined by their primary dermatologist. Physician and
      patient reported assessment and skin imaging will be performed at baseline, week 4, 8 and 12,
      and at week 20. Photography will also be performed at baseline and week 12. An optional post
      treatment follow-up will be performed at week 20.

      Medication will be provided free of charge by Pfizer, as part of the grant that is funding
      this study. These will be dispensed by the study group at baseline and during the subsequent
      clinic visits.
