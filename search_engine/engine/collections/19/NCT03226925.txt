      First, different ventilation modes will be tested and compared on healthy volunteers. This
      phase will be analysed with a ventilator and with dynamic MRI in order to measure the
      movement of anatomical structures in each ventilation mode (intra-fraction analysis).
      Further, we will repeat these exams in order to compare them with the first ones, in order to
      analyse the reproducibility and baseline shifts (inter-fraction analysis).

      Here are the different ventilation modes

        -  spontaneous breathing

        -  physiologic ventilation mode :

        -  shallow ventilation mode

        -  slow ventilation mode

        -  Jet Ventilation mode

      Second phase will be done with patients that are intended to have a radiation treatment for
      thoracic or upper abdominal tumors. All the previous ventilation modes will be analysed
      during repeated MRI, again in order to perform intra- and inter-fraction analysis of the
      tumor motion.

      Third phase also concerned patients intended to have a radiation treatment. It will be an
      in-silico-planning analysis in order to quantify dosimetric outcomes of these ventilation
      modes.
