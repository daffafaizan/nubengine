      they bring medical equipment into the bedroom and are used overnight. The aim of this
      prospective cohort is to assess the quality of life of patient's caregivers.

      Patient caregivers' quality of life will be assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire
      (World Health Organization Quality of Life - Brief version questionnaire).

      The investigators expect to enroll 200 patients' partners equipped with non-invasive
      ventilation, 100 patients' partners equipped with continuous positive airway pressure and 50
      patients' partners equipped with long-term oxygen therapy. Patients will be recruited from
      the cohort of patients already established on home treatment and cared for by Asten Sant√©.

      After consent, patient will receive dedicated questionnaires. During a home visit, home
      healthcare provider technician will retrieve data from the home device.
