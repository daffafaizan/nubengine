      I. To assess the effect of 5-azacitidine and entinostat on the hazard of 3 year
      progression-free survival in patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity of entinostat and 5-azacitidine in
      patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. To explore the effect of entinostat and 5-azacitidine on median disease-free and overall
      survival in patients with resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

      III. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of 5-azacitidine and entinostat on DNA methylation
      and gene re-expression in patients with resected stage I NSCLC through analysis of sputum.

      IV. To estimate the effect of entinostat and 5-azacitidine on progression free survival
      comparing patients with N2 lymph nodes categorized as methylated pre-treatment with those who
      are categorized as unmethylated.

      V. To establish factors that predict clinical outcome in patients treated with combination
      epigenetic therapy by performing genome-wide analyses on pre-treatment tumor DNA.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and 8-10 and entinostat
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 3 and 10. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
