      routine preoperative testing is going to expose infected patients with no or mild pneumonia
      symptoms. Currently, little is known regarding the true consequences of general anesthesia in
      COVID-positive (COVID+) patients. Surgeons are going to face challenging decisions regarding
      whether or not to operate for non-elective cases requiring general anesthesia when
      non-operative treatment options exist. Patients with acute appendicitis are usually treated
      with an operation to remove the appendix, but they can also be initially treated with
      antibiotics and have an operation at a later date. Similarly, patients with acute
      cholecystitis are usually treated with an operation to remove the gallbladder, but they can
      be treated with antibiotics and a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube (a tube that going
      through the skin to drain the gallbladder) and have an operation at a later date. However,
      patients managed without a definitive operation may require more resource utilization, PPE
      consumption, interactions with hospital personnel, and could experience treatment failures
      that exacerbate their viral illness. This is a pilot study comparing the safety of operative
      versus non-operative management of COVID+ patients with mild to moderate symptoms.
