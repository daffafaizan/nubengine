    
      Adult patients without prior history of ostomy, undergoing surgery involving a new ileostomy
      or colostomy will be randomized to receive standard ostomy nurse teaching or ostomy nurse
      teaching combined with preoperative and postoperative stoma care teaching video. Patients
      will be consented and randomized at the time of preoperative clinic visit. All patients will
      receive standard preoperative ostomy teaching materials and education from the surgeon and
      clinic nurse. Patients randomized to the treatment arm will receive additional take-home
      teaching materials based on the American College of Surgeons Ostomy Teaching videos.

      After post-operative inpatient ostomy-nurse teaching, and prior to discharge from the
      hospital, patients will fill out a survey detailing their level of comfort with various
      aspects of ostomy home care. Patients in the treatment arm will be be asked to review the
      ostomy teaching videos and fill out the survey prior to discharge. Primary outcome will be
      delay in discharge from hospital due to stoma-teaching related issues. Secondary outcomes
      will include rate of calls to the clinic for stoma-related questions, stoma-related
      clinic/urgent care/emergency department visits, and stoma-related complications.
