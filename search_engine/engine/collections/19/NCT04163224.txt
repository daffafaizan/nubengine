      FDA-cleared for the treatment of rib fractures. The RibFix Advantage System is designed to be
      implanted in a less invasive procedure where plates are introduced and placed on the pleural
      cortex of the rib during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Intrathoracic plate placement
      allows for smaller cutaneous incisions and less muscle disruption, which may aid in patient
      recovery compared to traditional open reduction internal fixation systems that are currently
      available.

      The purpose of this study is to gather the first clinical data on this novel device in the
      context of a case series of patients with radiologic and quality-of-life follow-up.
