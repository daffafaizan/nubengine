      day 1, 4, 8, 11 every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Cohorts of 3~6 patients receive escalating doses of CKD-516 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
