      soles has been based on theoretical considerations and empirical observations with minimal
      scientific study and validation. With the passage of the therapeutic shoe bill (PL-100-203,
      section 4072) authorizing Medicare coverage of shoes and shoe modifications for diabetics, it
      is important to have objective data regarding the effect of rocker soles. This cross-over
      study will randomize 46 subjects (40 sensate and 6 insensate) to a combination of 3 rocker
      soles. Patients will be evaluated at baseline and after 20 minutes wearing each rocker sole
      shoe design to determine the effect of the type of rocker sole on plantar pressure and gait.
