      cardiovascular risk. However, no effective and safe preventive treatment is available for
      this population. This study aimed to investigate whether their arterial wall phenotype could
      be turned to a preventive direction by low-dose fluvastatin/valsartan combination
      (low-flu/val).

      Twenty males at moderate cardiovascular risk (as classified by SCORE) were blindly randomised
      into the intervention group (n=10, low-flu/val: 10 mg/20mg) or control group (n=10, placebo).
      At inclusion and after 30 days of treatment, brachial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), beta
      stiffness coefficient, carotid pulse wave velocity (c-PWV), carotid-femoral PWV, reactive
      hyperaemia index, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin 6, vascular cell
      adhesion molecule 1, total antioxidant status and expression of several protective genes
      (SIRT1, mTOR, NF-ÎºB1, NFE2L2, PRKAA1) were followed.
