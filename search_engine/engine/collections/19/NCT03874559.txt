    
      All male and female patients, aged 18 and older with a histologically proven diagnosis of
      rectal adenocarcinoma, treated on this study will receive neo adjuvant chemotherapy
      (consisting of 5 FU or capecitabine) given concurrently with external beam radiation therapy
      to a dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Radiation treatments will be administered daily, Monday
      thru Friday. Within one week prior to beginning chemotherapy and radiation treatments, a
      serum sample will be obtained from each patient. Patients will also have serum samples
      collected every two weeks during radiation, and on the last day of radiation therapy, as well
      as at their one month follow up visit after completion of radiation and prior to planned
      surgery. A final serum sample will be collected within one month after definitive surgery.
      Each serum sample collected will be less than 50 mL.

      The study will involve obtaining serum samples from patients before during and after
      chemoradiation therapy. These serum samples will be analyzed to determine exosomal biomarker
      levels, which will be correlated with clinical, imaging, laboratory, and pathologic data
      obtained from the medical record.

      Additional data from the patients' medical records will be collected, including demographic
      data, clinical information from notes in the medical record, radiology images and reports,
      results of diagnositic tests, and information from procedure notes and pathology reports.
