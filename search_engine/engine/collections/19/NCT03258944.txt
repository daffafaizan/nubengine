      ventilatory muscle strength and the breath-stacking technique. Between 24-72 hours after the
      learning, the evaluation of the muscular muscular strength will be performed through the
      maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and the maximum expiratory pressure (MEP). PI max will be
      measured from a maximum expiration; While PE max will be measured from a maximum inspiration,
      using a digital manovacuometer (MVD 300Â®)
