      discrimination test. The Static 2-point discrimination test determines the minimal distance
      at which a subject can sense the presence of two needle. The modified American Society for
      Surgery of the Hand guidalines are used to stratify discriminator measurements(excellent <6
      mm, good 6-10 mm, fair 11-15 mm, poor >15 mm). Each area is tested 3 times with a
      Discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). Two out of 3 correct answers are considered proof of
      perception before proceeding to another lower value. We stopp at 4mm as a limit of 2PD and
      consider this normal. The measurements are performed at a single time point at final follow
      up.
