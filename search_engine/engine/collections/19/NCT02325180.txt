      uncomplicated falciparum malaria. It is highly effective with few adverse effects. The
      artemisinin component is combined with a partner drug with a longer half-life to ensure the
      clearance of the remaining parasites after rapid reduction by artemisinin.

      ACT is used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum infection in Indonesia
      since 2004. There are 3 combinations available in the country including
      artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ) and
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Studies at different sites across Indonesia have shown various
      efficacy. Yet, there is an increased concern of reduced susceptibility of P. falciparum to
      artemisinin in neighbouring countries. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate and monitor the
      efficacies of these combinations in Indonesia.

      Molecular markers are an important tool for detecting and monitoring the presence of
      antimalarial resistance. Their significant implication is to geographically map the extent of
      resistant-parasites, thus enabling strategies for their control and elimination to be applied
      before the inevitably increase in the disease burden occurs. Different markers have been used
      to identify antimalarial resistance and recently a molecular marker for artemisinin
      susceptibility in P. falciparum has also been proposed. The presence of these markers in
      parasites from our study will also be investigated.
