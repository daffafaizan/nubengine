      clinical trial research. According to 1:1 ratio, all participants are randomly divided into
      two groups, the metformin group and placebo group.

      According to the fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglycerides (TG),total cholesterol (TC) and
      body mass index (BMI), the investigators compared experimental group with control group to
      evaluate whether the use of combination therapy of glucocorticoid and metformin decrease
      glucocorticoid side effects in participants with autoimmune uveitis.

      According to best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation,
      fluorescence fundus angiography (FFA), electroretinogram (ERG) and so on, the investigators
      evaluate the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of metformin in treatment of
