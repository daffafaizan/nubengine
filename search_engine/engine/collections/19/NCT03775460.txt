    
      This is a double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of MTX for
      managing ENL. Patients diagnosed with moderate or severe ENL at ENLIST Group centres in
      Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia and Nepal will be randomly allocated to
      receive a 15 or 20 mg of oral MTX each week for 48 weeks and prednisolone 40 mg per day
      reducing to zero over 20 weeks. The control group will receive an identical prednisolone
      scheme. The participants will be stratified into two groups, those with acute ENL, those with
      chronic/recurrent ENL. The interventions for both populations are the same, although analysed
      separately. Adverse effects (AE) will be closely monitored clinically and using laboratory
      tests. Participants will receive folic acid, 5mg daily for 52 weeks except on the day of MTX
      to prevent AEs, and nausea will be managed with ondansetron.
