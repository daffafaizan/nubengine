      populations throughout the world-causes disability and loss of productivity, and leads to
      enormous costs in healthcare resources. Efforts to find relatively non-invasive therapies for
      individuals suffering from this problem are important.

      The main objective of this single-center, double-blind study is to determine the optimal
      dosing regimen-based on safety, tolerability, and pain relief- which should be used in
      planning a future, large-scale, clinical study to clarify conclusively whether chronic low
      back pain, unrelated to cancer, can be treated with pamidronate.

      Forty-four persons will be recruited for participation. There will be four study groups, each
      with 7 subjects randomly assigned to pamidronate and 4 to placebo. The dosage for the
      pamidronate participants will be 30 mg of pamidronate for the first group, 60 mg for the
      second group, and 90 mg for the third group. Members of the fourth group will receive 2
      treatments of 90mg IV pamidronate or placebo.

      In this study, scientists also hope to find out if the effectiveness of pamidronate can be
      predicted with bone scans (a procedure used to see bone inflammation or injuries to the
      bone), and if improvement in performance of daily tasks is related to the amount of
      pamidronate a participant receives and to improvement in pain intensity, and to evaluate
      patient satisfaction with the pamidronate treatments.
