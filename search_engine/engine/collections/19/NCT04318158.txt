      muscle invasive bladder cancer and is associated with a high risk of complications.
      Management of the postoperative pain is important to decrease the length of stay in the
      hospital and the risk of morbidity. Multimodal analgesia management is utilized for pain
      observed in the postoperative period.As part of a multimodal analgesic regimen, a peripheral
      nerve block can decrease opioid consumption, providing more effective analgesia with fewer
      adverse effects.TAP block is a relatively new regional anesthesia technique that provides
      analgesia to the parietal peritoneum, as well as skin and muscles of the lower anterior
      abdominal wall. Dexmedetomidine and fentanyl have been used as adjuvants to local anesthetics
      in different surgeries to provide superior analgesia and to improve the duration of the
      block.
