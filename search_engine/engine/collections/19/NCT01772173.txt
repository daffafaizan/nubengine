      using their automated, precise, fast, novel tool for measuring retinal vessels in retinal
      images can identify Veterans at increased risk for diabetic retinopathy and hypertension,
      before any overt signs of retinopathy or increased blood pressure have become apparent.
      Population studies have shown that changes in arterial and venous diameter are associated
      with future development of these complications.

      Purpose: Determine the potential utility of retinal vessel derived biomarkers, from color
      fundus photographs, as a non-invasive independent risk factor for diabetic retinopathy (DR)
      and hypertension in Veterans with diabetes.

      Methods: Aim 1. The investigators will evaluate automatically derived retinal vessel
      parameters (arterial and retinal vessel width and branch relationships) as an early biomarker
      for future development of hypertension no less than 2 years later, with normal current normal
      blood pressure. The investigators will compare this biomarker in retinal images from 500
      Veterans with diabetes, all of whom did not have hypertension at the time of imaging, for
      those who were and were not diagnosed with hypertension no more than 3 years later. Aim 2. To
      evaluate automatically derived retinal vessel parameters as an early biomarker for the risk
      for development of diabetic retinopathy (defined as transition from less than moderate
      retinopathy AND no apparent macular edema according to the International Clinical Diabetic
      Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema Severity Scale) in at risk Veterans with diabetes. The
      investigators will compare this biomarker in retinal images from a population of 4000
      Veterans with diabetes, currently without DR, ~10% of who developed retinopathy no less than
      two years later while the remainder did not.
