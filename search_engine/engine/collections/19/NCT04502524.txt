      ARM I: Participants use the new website smoking cessation program, which provides values
      driven, mindfulness based coping skills and utilizes non-judgmental acceptance of
      uncomfortable internal states like cravings. Participants also receive text messages
      consisting of motivational messages and reminders to use the program. At the end of the
      program, participants receive an email with handouts and available resources provided by the
      VA for continued support for smoking cessation.

      ARM II: Participants use the VA standard of care website, which provides educational
      materials about cessation treatments, tools to cope with urges and relapse, how to stay
      motivated, and brief tips on coping with physical and mental health problems. Participants
      also receive text messages consisting of motivational messages and reminders to use the
      program. At the end of the program, participants receive an email with a handout of available
      resources provided by the VA for continued support for smoking cessation.

      After study randomization, participants are followed up at 1 and 3 months.
