      breast cancer has the characteristics of mild biological behavior and slow progression.
      Currently, capecitabine combined with pyrotinib is the standard protocol for this kind of
      advanced breast cancer after trastuzumab failure, and the median progression free survival
      (PFS) is 11.0 months. The incidence of grade 3 hand-foot-syndrome was 16.4%, the incidence of
      grade 3 diarrhea was 30.6%, and the incidence of grade 3 myelosuppression was 6%. Therefore,
      the search for efficient and low toxicity alternatives has become a research hotspot.

      Our previous basic studies have shown that ER inhibitor fulvestrant and HER2 inhibitor
      pyrotinib have synergistic effect in inhibiting the proliferation of HR + / HER2 + breast
      cancer cells. At the same time, the preliminary analysis of our prospective, phase II, single
      arm study of "Fulvestrant combined with Pyrotinib in the treatment of HR + / HER2 + advanced
      breast cancer" shows that the efficacy is close to that of capecitabine combined with
      pyrotinib (median progression free survival is more than 13 months), and the adverse events
      are significantly improved compared with capecitabine combined with pyrotinib (grade 3
      hand-foot-syndrome). This project has been supported by the "Sun-yat sun clinical research
      and cultivation project" of Sun-Yat Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun-Yat Sen University. Therefore,
      it is necessary to further carry out a head-to-head phase III randomized controlled clinical
      trial to study the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant combined with pyrotinib in the
      treatment of HR + / HER2 + advanced breast cancer, with a non-inferiority cut-off value of HR
      = 1.30. Combined with the analysis of biomarkers, to find the molecular indicators to predict
      the benefit of pyrotinib combined with endocrine therapy, so as to provide theoretical basis
      for guiding precise treatment.
