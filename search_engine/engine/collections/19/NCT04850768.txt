      inflammatory reactions created by the supporting tissues surrounding the teeth against
      microorganisms and then result in loss of teeth. Inflammasomes are cytosolic multiprotein
      complex involved in the initiation and modulation of the immune response.

      Interleukine -1β ( IL-1β ) levels are associated with periodontal destruction in the
      pathogenesis of periodontal disease. Interleukine-10 (IL-10) has been reported to decrease
      periodontal disease progression rate.

      Gingival crevicular fluid shows the cellular response in the periodontium. The most important
      host-related ingredients are inflammatory markers, including cytokines, enzymes, and
      interleukins. Saliva analysis is used in the diagnosis of systemic conditions as well as in
      the diagnosis of oral pathologies.

      Both NLRC4 and NLRP3 inflammasomes have been shown to play an important role in the induction
      of interleukin-1β secretion. Periodontitis is induced by a complex microbial biofilm
      containing multiple Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including flagellate
      microorganisms) capable of activating a large number of NLRs. It has been said that
      proinflammatory cytokines released in the microenvironment of periodontitis can increase the
      expression of NLRC4 inflammasome genes. Evidence on the role of inflammasomes in periodontal
      disease is still very poor. The aim of this study is to compare the NLRC4, IL-1β and IL-10
      levels of healthy and periodontitis individuals.
