    
      Approximately 566 subjects will be randomized in approximately 116 global sites.

      This study consists of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, after which subjects will receive
      investigational product for 48 weeks, followed by a safety follow-up period to week 52, for a
      total study duration of up to 56 weeks.

      Subjects will be randomized in a masked 1:1 ratio to receive 2 mg (0.05 mL) of either ABP 938
      (Treatment Group A) or aflibercept (Treatment Group B) administered by IVT injection.

      At week 8, subjects will be assessed for the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint is the
      change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) as measured by Early Treatment Diabetic
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter score from baseline to week 8, in order to assess the
      efficacy of ABP 938 compared to aflibercept.

      Subjects will then be re-randomized at week 16 in a masked fashion such that:

        -  Subjects initially randomized to ABP 938 (Treatment Group A) will continue to receive
           ABP 938 by IVT injection every 8 weeks from week 16 until week 48

        -  Subjects initially randomized to aflibercept (Treatment Group B) will be re-randomized
           in a 1:1 ratio to either continue on aflibercept (Treatment Group B1) or transition to
           ABP 938 (Treatment Group B2) by IVT injection every 8 weeks from week 16 until week 48
