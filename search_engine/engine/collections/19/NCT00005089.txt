      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) plus rituximab followed by
      radiotherapy in patients with stage I, IE, or non-bulky stage II or IIE high risk localized
      intermediate or high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the toxicity of this
      treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 8 of the first course, then on day 1 of
      courses 2 and 3. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours, doxorubicin IV, and
      vincristine IV on day 10 of the first course, then on day 3 of courses 2 and 3. Patients
      receive oral prednisone on days 10-14 of the first course, then on days 3-7 of courses 2 and
      3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Chemotherapy is followed by radiotherapy administered 5 days a week
      for 4-5 weeks. Patients are followed every 6 months for two years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
