      hypothesized that LLLT may reduce pain and promote nerve regeneration through the speculated
      anti-inflammatory and immune enhancement properties of the therapy. Prior research has
      indicated LLLT to be a potentially safe and effective means of reducing pain. This clinical
      study was designed to evaluate the potential of the Erchonia EML Laser in offering a novel
      means of delivering LLLT to reduce pain and enhance healing following liposuction.
