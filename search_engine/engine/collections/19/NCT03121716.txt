    
      This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, Phase 1 study to evaluate safety and
      efficacy of using the combination treatment of SHR-1210, gemcitabine and cis-platinum by
      recurrent and metastatic NPC.

      The safety of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical laboratory tests,
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical examination,
      electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will also be
      conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory
      events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed
      at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.Tumor response will be
      assessed by radiographic examination in screening visit and every 2 cycles after first dose.
