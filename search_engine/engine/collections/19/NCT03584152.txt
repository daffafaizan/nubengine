        1. Is adequate postoperative pain management after nasal surgery achieved with opioid or
           non-opioid drugs?

        2. If opioid drugs are required for adequate pain control postoperatively, is it possible
           to reduce the number of days the drugs are prescribed for?

        3. What are the common side effect profiles of the included drugs?

      In light of the current opioid epidemic in the country, it is important the the physicians
      explore the utility of drugs other than opioids for adequate postoperative pain management.
      Also, reducing the dosage and/or number of prescribed opioid drugs lessens the propensity for
      misuse of physician prescribed opioid medications.
