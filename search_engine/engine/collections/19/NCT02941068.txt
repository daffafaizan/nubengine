      tract would colonize and go to the blood to develop severe bacteria and fungal infection in
      intra-abdominal perforation and about one-third of patients with gastrointestinal
      perforations or anastomotic leakages in ICU develop intra-abdominal fungal infection. In
      particular, the severe sepsis arisen from these infections could further increase the
      mortality. However, empiric/preemptive treatment in most studies failed to improve the
      prognosis and few of the studies that addressed the influence of prophylactic anti-fungal
      treatment in patients with GI Perforation.
