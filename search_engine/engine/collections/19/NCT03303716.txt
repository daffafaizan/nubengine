      medical condition. The researchers will also attain primary medical records.The registry is
      based at UCLA as the IRB of record with collaborating sites at Boston Children's Hospital,
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital, and Duke University in a partnership with the Bohring-Opitz
      Syndrome (BOS) Foundation and ASXL-Rare Research Endowment (ARRE). The BOS Foundation and
      ARRE are non-profit organizations run by families of patients with ASXL-related disorders
      that are focused on supporting research. The data is co-managed by the researchers and the
      family groups. Aggregate data from the Registry will be shared with the participants as well
      as used for publication. The Registry is HIPPA compliant and follows all the IRB requirements
      regarding securing and managing patient data.
