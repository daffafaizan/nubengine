      over 13,000 deaths annually, aortic aneurysmal disease is a potential cause of chest
      pain.There are multiple diagnostic imaging modalities in practice to interrogate the thoracic
      aorta, with the most common being computed tomographic angiography (CTA), trans-thoracic
      echocardiography (TTE) and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE), each with its own
      advantages and limitations. In the ED setting, point-of-care (POC) focused cardiac ultrasound
      (FOCUS) is increasingly being used as an adjunct to the emergency physician's (EP) workup of
      undifferentiated chest pain. Based on prior retrospective data FOCUS and CTA appear to have
      good agreement. This studies aims to confirm these findings through prospective evaluation

      Specific Aims

      Aim 1: To prospectively compare Point of Care (POC) Focused Cardiac Ultrasound (FOCUS) to
      thoracic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in the measurement of ascending aortic
      dimensions.

      Maximal diameter measurements of the ascending thoracic aorta by FOCUS will be compared to
      CTA. Bland Altman plots with 95% limits of agreement will be used to determine clinical and
      statistical significance.

      Hypothesis: 95% limits of agreement between FOCUS and CTA will be within +/- 5 mm.

      Aim 2: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of Point-of-Care Focused Cardiac Ultrasound for
      the detection of thoracic aortic dilation and aneurysm with computed tomographic angiography
      as the reference standard

      Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy of FOCUS will be computed with CTA as the reference
      standard.
