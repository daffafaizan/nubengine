    
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single day and multiple day
      dosing, in healthy, non-smoking, male and female volunteers.

      Part 1: Single day dosing

      Seven (7) healthy male and female volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive in a single
      day either 18-MC HCl (n=5) or placebo (n=2) in each cohort. There will be 10 cohorts:

        1. 4 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

        2. 8 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

        3. 12 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

        4. 16 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

        5. 25 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

        6. 40 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

        7. 75 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

        8. 150 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

        9. 300 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

       10. 600 mg twice a day (bid) for 1 day

      There are 3 phases: Screening, Enrollment and Follow-Up. All participants will be assessed
      for safety and tolerability for 28 days. Screening begins when a participant reports to the
      clinical unit (CU) for a screening visit to undergo safety and compliance assessments on this
      day. Participants that meet all eligibility criteria will be admitted to the CU on the day
      prior to receiving study drug. Enrollment begins on Day 1 where participants will receive two
      doses of study drug for 1 day, will be assessed for 18-MC PK up to 48 hours, and will remain
      admitted at the CU until Day 3, at which time they will be discharged. For follow-up the
      participants will return for safety and tolerability assessments at Days 7, 14, 21 and Day
      28.

      Part 2: Multiple day dosing

      Seven (7) healthy male and female volunteers will be randomly assigned to receive either
      18-MC HCl (n=5) or placebo (n=2) in each cohort. There will be up to 6 cohorts:

        1. 2 mg twice a day (bid) for 7 days

        2. 5 mg twice a day (bid) for 7 days

        3. 10 mg twice a day (bid) for 7 days

        4. TBD mg twice a day (bid) for 7 days

        5. TBD mg twice a day (bid) for 7 days

        6. TBD mg twice a day (bid) for 7 days

      The proposed dosages for the TBD MAD Cohorts will be determined upon completion of the SAD
      cohorts.

      There are 3 phases: Screening, Enrollment and Follow-Up. All participants will be assessed
      for 42 days. Screening begins when a participant reports to the clinical unit (CU) for a
      screening visit to undergo safety and compliance assessments on this day. Participants that
      meet all eligibility criteria will be admitted to the CU on the day prior to receiving study
      drug. Enrollment begins on Day 1 where participants will receive two doses of study drug
      every day for 7 days, will be assessed for 18-MC PK up to 48 hours on Day 1 and Day 7, and
      will remain admitted at the CU until Day 9, at which time they will be discharged. For
      follow-up the participants will return for safety and tolerability assessments at Days 14,
      21, 28, 35 and Day 42.
