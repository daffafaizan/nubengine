      TPE is an integral part of the care pathway for patients with a chronic pathology such as
      diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases requiring
      anticoagulants, haemophilia, renal failure, HIV infection, autoimmune diseases etc.... front
      of therapeutic progress, many cancers are now taken for a chronic disease.

      In oncology, TPE starts to grow. Indeed, TPE makes the patient more autonomous, which could
      reduce the occurrence and / or aggravation of some toxicities, improve the quality of life,
      the effectiveness of treatment and optimize health costs. Therefore, it is important to
      develop programme of therapeutic education in oncology.

      The toxicity of ICI is unusual and sometimes lethal. This toxicity must be recognized and
      managed quickly to maintain a satisfactory dose-intensity. TPE finds its place by raising
      awareness among patient to the occurrence of these toxicities.

      This randomized TPE versus standard care study project will assess the contribution of
      education in the management of severe toxicities. The investigators believe that changes in
      patient behaviour will reduce the number of toxicities â‰¥3 in the TPE arm.
