      cholesterol (LDL-C) when administered in addition to statin treatment. The effect of
      ezetimibe on the incidence and progression of vascular disease is elusive. Therefore, our
      objective was to examine the effects of fluvastatin and fluvastatin plus ezetimibe on
      lipoprotein subfractions in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or coronary heart disease.
