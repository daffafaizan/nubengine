      critical pathways in RBCs. The FT-4202 clinical development program will investigate whether
      decreasing 2,3-DPG may help oxygen bind to hemoglobin (i.e. increasing oxygen affinity), and
      thereby increase ATP and impact RBC function. This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, multicenter Phase 2/3 study of patients age 12 to 65 years (inclusive), with
      sickle cell disease. There are two planned interim analyses in this study design. Initially,
      patients will be randomized at 1:1:1 to one of two dose levels of FT-4202 or placebo. At the
      first interim analysis, one of the two FT-4202 dose levels will be selected for the Phase 3
      portion of the study, in which patients will be randomized at 1:1 to the selected FT-4202
      dose or placebo. Efficacy on hemoglobin will be evaluated at the second interim analysis, and
      then will be tested along with evaluation of efficacy on vaso-occlusive crises at the final
      analysis. Following completion of 52 weeks of double-blind treatment, patients may enter a
      52-week FT-4202 open-label extension period.
