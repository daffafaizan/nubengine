      eliminate their defective immune system and bone marrow. The preparative regimen consists of
      the chemotherapy drugs (busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG)).

      Transplantation: subjects will then have a source of blood stem cells (bone marrow) from
      their donor administered into their catheter. Medication will be given to help prevent
      Graft-Versus Host Disease (GVHD). The ATG will help to deplete the donor stem cells of the
      type of cells that can cause GVHD and will also help to promote engraftment of the new stem
      cells.

      Recovery Phase: The second phase of treatment consists of a period after transplantation
      during which we wait for the return of bone marrow function. This usually takes two to four
      weeks. Subjects will be given a blood cell growth factor, G-CSF, to help speed recovery of
      the white blood cells and potentially decrease the risk of infection and decrease the time
      until the bone marrow recovers.
