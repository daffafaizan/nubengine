    
      Approximately 40 individuals with HIV infection of at least 6 months duration who currently
      exercise infrequently will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either Intervention Arm (immediate
      exercise intervention program for 12 weeks duration), or the Control Arm (observation only
      for 12 weeks duration followed by treatment onset after observation is completed).

      Persons assigned to the Intervention Arm will meet initially once per week with a personal
      trainer, and once per week in small groups with a personal trainer, for a total of two weekly
      sessions of assisted strength training. In addition, participants will be encouraged to
      engage in three sessions of aerobic exercise per week of gradually increasing intensity of
      about 40 minutes duration each, for the 12 week intervention period. Instruction in walking
      and running form and body awareness that may reduce the risk of injuries (ChiWalking and
      ChiRunning technique) will be provided to the Intervention Arm by a certified coach during
      three sessions over the course of the 12 week intervention period as part of the aerobic
      exercise plan.

      Paid gym memberships will be provided for the 12 week treatment period for both groups
      (memberships for participants assigned to the Control Arm will not begin until the end of the
      12 week observation period).

      Data will be collected for strength training activity using the passive FitLinxx system at
      the study gym, and for aerobic steps and pace using accelerometers (Pebble by FitLinxx).
      Participants in both groups will be asked to wear accelerometers for the duration of the
      study period.

      Participants will be evaluated at baseline, week 6 and week 12 for changes in lab values and
      questionnaire items. Change in fitness will be assessed using V02 max at baseline and week
      12.
