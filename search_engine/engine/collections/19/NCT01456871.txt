      have specialized end organs surrounding the nerve terminal. Those receptors are concentrated
      in various human periarticular tissues. It is believed that these mechanoreceptors in the
      periarticular tissues are related to muscle reflexes. However, it is still unknown which type
      of mechanoreceptors contribute to the muscle reflexes and whether the mechanoreceptors excite
      and/or inhibit muscle activation. In the investigators previous studies, mechanoreceptors in
      the human proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and surrounding structures have been
      extensively examined. The investigators have identified that Pacini-like nerve endings in the
      PIP joint were found in substantial numbers in the junction of the C1 pulley and accessory
      collateral ligaments. The investigators hypothesize that the Pacini-like nerve endings in the
      junction of the C1 pulley generate activity in the associated flexor muscle/tendon in the
      finger.
