      consequently blood flow during CPR (cardiopulmonary rescuscitation). Current guidelines,
      however, are lacking guidance of the optimal ventilation strategy in such scenarios. This may
      lead to lung injuries caused by high pressure levels in the chest while applying compression
      and ventilation simultaneously or hypoventilation. Consequently, this pilot study assesses
      iwhich ventilation mode is optimal. Patients will be assigned randomly to one of the three
      ventilation modes (Volume controlled, BiPAP-ASB, CPAP). Ventilation parameters will be
      continuously monitored for 15 minutes while blood gas analyses are taken as well. Further
      secondary outcome parameters will be assessed, e.g. hospital mortality.
