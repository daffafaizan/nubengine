    
      This is randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter trial.
      Participants will be screened for the trial within 4 weeks prior to the Baseline (Day 1)
      Visit. Approximately 39 participants who meet the trial eligibility criteria will be
      randomized on Day 1 in a 2:1 ratio to receive 8 infusions of TEPEZZA (10 mg/kg for the first
      infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) or placebo once every 3 weeks (q3W). All
      participants will enter a 24-week double-masked Treatment Period, during which trial drug
      will be infused on Day 1 (Baseline) and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 (with a final visit
      at Week 24 of the 24-week Treatment Period).

      At the end of the double-masked Treatment Period (Week 24), all participants will be assessed
      for treatment response: proptosis responders (study eye has ≥2-mm reduction in proptosis from
      Baseline without deterioration [≥2-mm increase in proptosis] in fellow eye) or proptosis
      non-responders (study eye has <2-mm reduction in proptosis). Proptosis non-responders who
      have completed the double-masked Treatment Period may choose to receive 8 infusions of
      TEPEZZA (10 mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an
      open-label fashion q3W at Weeks 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42 and 45. These participants will
      return to the clinic at Week 48 for End-of-Treatment assessments, and participants will be
      contacted by phone/email 30 days after the Week 48 Visit for safety assessment. Proptosis
      responders, as well as non-responders who choose not to receive TEPEZZA in an open-label
      fashion, will enter a 30-day Follow-up Period, during which trial drug will not be
      administered. These participants will be contacted by phone/email 30 days after the Week 24
      Visit for safety assessment.

      Participants who prematurely discontinue trial drug dosing prior to Week 21 of the
      double-masked Treatment Period or prior to Week 45 of the open-label Treatment Period will
      return to the clinic, undergo the scheduled End-of-Treatment assessments (with the exception
      of the collection of blood samples for biomarker evaluations) and enter the Follow-up Period
      as applicable.
