      unstable patients were excluded. BNP (Biosite assay) levels were measured prior to physician
      assessment with randomization in 1:1 ratio to either BNP 1) level reported or 2) level not
      reported. ED physicians made triage decisions guided by clinical judgment and nomogram to aid
      in interpretation of BNP level. Primary outcome was mean total hospital cost per subject.
      Secondary outcomes included admission rate, service assignment, discharge diagnosis and
      length of stay. Differences between groups were compared by t-test with bootstrap. Costs
      reflect 2005 constant dollars.
