      when administered directly into the metastatic melanoma lesion in patients with advanced
      metastatic melanoma. IMCgp100 is a drug made up of two components. The first is the T cell
      receptor designed to bind specifically and tightly with protein found at high levels on the
      surface of melanoma cancer cells and second is an anti-CD3 fragment that is meant to bind to
      and activate the T cells. There will be two stage dose regimens each enrolling 3 patients.
      Stage 1 dose will 0.00017 mg IMCgp100 and Stage 2 dose will be 0.0017 mg IMCgp100. Inclusion
      Criteria: 1. Histologically confirmed dx of advanced unresectable melanoma not requiring
      immediate treatment and/or in a window between treatments 2. Two or more cutaneous or
      subcutaneous melanoma metastatic lesions 7 to 15 mm in at least one dimension and amenable to
      subsequent biopsy 3. Greater or equal to 18 years of age 4. ECOG PS 0-2 5.

      Able to provide informed consent and willing to comply with protocol requirements 6. Female
      patients must not be of childbearing potential or must have negative serum pregnancy test 48
      hours prior to receiving investigational drug 7. Male patients must agree to use reliable
      form of birth control throughout study 8. Must have adequate organ system function Exclusion
      Criteria: 1. Received any other chemo, immune, radiation or investigational therapy agents
      within 2 weeks prior to study treatment 2. Cutaneous metastasis that have received prior
      local therapy 3. Pregnant or breastfeeding 4.

      History of autoimmune disease 5. Current treatment with steroid or other immunosuppressive
      meds 6. Active uncontrolled infection 7. Known HIV infection 8. Uncontrolled seizures 9.
