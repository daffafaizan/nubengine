    
      This research study involves participants taking a medicine that inhibits proteins in cancer
      cells called CDK4 and CDK6 (palbociclib) in combination with a medicine that inhibits a
      protein called IGF-1R (ganitumab). This study is designed to see if these drugs are safe when
      given together and whether they are effective in treating Ewing sarcoma.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or drug combination to learn whether the drug(s)
      works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug or combination is
      being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ganitumab as a treatment for any
      disease.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved palbociclib for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for another cancer.

      This research study is:

        -  Testing whether palbociclib and ganitumab are safe when given together and effective in
           treating Ewing sarcoma.

        -  Testing markers in the blood and in tumor tissue to see if there are certain features of
           the tumor that may indicate this combination of drugs is effective or not effective
