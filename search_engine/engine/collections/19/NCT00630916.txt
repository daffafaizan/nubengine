      important being freedom from the need for anticoagulation and a low rate of thromboembolic
      events. Pericardial bioprosthetic valves are known to have hemodynamic performance superior
      to porcine valves, and the excellent hemodynamic performance of pericardial valves is
      particularly relevant in patients with a small aortic root. However, long-term durability
      continues to be the main concern with use of pericardial valves. Although the first
      generation pericardial valves were withdrawn from the market due to poor durability, further
      research has indicated that structural failure of early pericardial valves was due to tissue
      preparation techniques and design failure rather than the pericardial tissue.The unique
      desing of the Mitroflow Aortic Heart Valve may provide superior hemodynamic performance over
      other tissue valves.
