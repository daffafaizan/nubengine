    
      Double blind, randomized, controlled, dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial in
      hookworm-exposed adults aged 18 to 50 years living in the area of Lambaréné, Gabon.
      Participants will receive three doses of the assigned vaccine(s) delivered intramuscularly
      (deltoid) on approximately Days 0, 56, and 112.

      Safety will be measured from the time of each study vaccination (Day 0) through 14 days after
      each study vaccination by the occurrence of solicited injection site and systemic
      reactogenicity events.

      Unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the time of the first
      study vaccination through approximately 1 month after each study vaccination. New-onset
      chronic medical conditions and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be collected from the time
      of the first study vaccination through approximately 9 months after the final study
      vaccination (final visit). Clinical laboratory evaluations for safety will be performed on
      venous blood collected approximately 14 days after each vaccination.

      Immunogenicity testing will include IgG antibody responses to each vaccine antigen, by a
      qualified indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), on serum or plasma obtained
      prior to each study vaccination and at time points after each vaccination; the functional
      activity of vaccine-induced antibodies will be assessed by in vitro enzyme neutralization
      assays.

      Recruitment and enrollment into the study will occur on an ongoing basis, with each group
      being recruited and vaccinated in sequence.

      24 subjects will be enrolled into 2 groups:

        -  Group 1 (n=12):

             -  8 subjects will receive 30 µg Na-GST-1 plus 500 µg CPG 10104 delivered by IM
                injection in the deltoid muscle

             -  4 subjects will receive 100 µg Na-GST-1 delivered by IM injection in the deltoid
                muscle

        -  Group 2 (n=12):

             -  8 subjects will receive 100 µg Na-GST-1 plus 500 µg CPG 10104 delivered by IM
                injection in the deltoid muscle

             -  4 subjects will receive 100 µg Na-GST-1 delivered by IM injection in the deltoid
                muscle
