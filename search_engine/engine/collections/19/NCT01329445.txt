      age adults, and can lead to progressive joint degeneration. Adult cartilage has little
      regenerative capacity and many of the current treatment options have limited or unknown
      durability. DeNovo NT is an allogeneic tissue graft, prepared from donated juvenile
      cartilage, which has been shown to have a higher chondrogenic potential than adult cartilage.
      The graft involves a single surgery with no need for scaffolds, flaps or donor-site
      morbidity. This study will follow the long-term outcomes and durability of DeNovo NT in
      patients grafted with this product in the knee, for up to five years. It will enroll subjects
      prospectively (at the time of surgery) and retrospectively (those who have been previously
      implanted). Data will be collected on patient-reported outcomes, results of knee
      examinations, and reoperations and revisions.
