      requirement (EAR) and the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for older people. Very limited
      data obtained from older individuals are available to support the assumption that age does
      not affect protein requirement. Existing method like nitrogen balance has inherent
      limitations that diminish it from being considered a reference method. Indicator amino acid
      oxidation technique is emerging as an alternative method to measure dietary protein
      requirement. It is more accurate and less demanding. The current study will be the first time
      this technique is used with elderly adults and will provide an important foundation for
      geriatric nutrition research.
