    
      Primary Objective Examine the feasibility and acceptability of MBSR with YACs. We hypothesize
      that MBSR will be feasible and acceptable with this population, which will be assessed
      through examination of response rate and study attrition variables.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Evaluate the effects of MBSR on outcomes of health related quality of life and disease
           symptoms among YACs.

        2. Explore the impact of different forms of eHealth maintenance support following the MBSR
           intervention (instructor-delivered, peer-delivered, no message) to help uphold
           intervention effects over time.

        3. Compare intervention and control groups on changes in biologic measures of stress (blood
           pressure, pulse, salivary cortisol, CRP, IL-6, and IL-1b biomarkers) over a 32-week
           period.
