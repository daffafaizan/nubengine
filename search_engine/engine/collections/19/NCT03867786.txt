      disorders (CUDs), have continued to rise in recent years. The highest rates of use and CUDs
      are seen in young adults (20 - 24 years old) with more than 50% of young adults reporting
      lifetime use of cannabis, 35% report use in the past year, and 20% report use in the past
      month. Increased exposure produces higher risk for detrimental psychological and behavioral
      effects of cannabis use. Given this increased prevalence of cannabis use and associated
      risks, identifying effective behavioral strategies that reduce cannabis craving, negative
      psychological effects, and alter neurobiological mechanisms underlying problematic cannabis
      use are an avenue of needed research. Exercise, particularly resistance exercise, is a
      behavioral intervention with considerable potential as an adjunctive treatment for CUD.

      The aims of this proposal seek to address these issues by implementing acute resistance
      exercise protocol in men and women who have cannabis use disorder. This proposal will: 1
      examine the effect of an acute resistance exercise protocol on affect, stress, and compulsive
      urge to use in non-treatment seeking young adults with CUD 2.examine whether an acute
      resistance exercise session in individuals with CUD is associated with induced alterations in
      the appetitive/ reward hormone ghrelin These findings will inform the further development for
      exercise interventions for cannabis use disorder that can be used with the aim of supporting
      individuals with CUD reduce use and decrease the negative effects of withdrawal.
