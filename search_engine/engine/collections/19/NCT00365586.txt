      patients who have experienced a flare of osteoarthritis of the knee. At screening, patients
      whose pain is currently controlled by an analgesic will agree, after giving Informed Consent,
      to discontinue that analgesic. Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive
      double-blind treatment with either the ketoprofen topical patch or a matching placebo patch
      to be applied once daily for 28 days. Patients will return to the clinic on Days 7, 14, 21
      and 28. At Day 28, patients may choose to open a 2 month open-label period.

      Patients will rate their pain using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)
      which contains the WOMAC pain subscale. Patients will also complete an electronic diary in
      which pain intensity, pain relief, and quality of sleep ratings will be captured. In
      addition, rescue medication consumption data will be collected. Ibuprofen will be provided as
      prn rescue medication.
