      assigned 3 investigators who are blinded to this study design, We do image quality assessment
      by two methods; firstly, we categorize image quality as numbers based on each investigator's
      impression (1: Very bad, 2: bad, 3: acceptable, 4: good, 5: very good) and compare the
      difference in number before and after suctioning. Secondly, we evaluate consistency
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter-observer variability using investigator A,
      B and C. We evaluate absolute-agreement ICC for intra-observer variability using investigator
      C, who perform analysis for all images twice with a 6 to 8 months interval. This analysis was
      performed with left ventricular fraction area change using transgastric left ventricular
      short axis view.
