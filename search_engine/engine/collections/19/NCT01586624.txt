    
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to establish a safety and toxicity profile of combining
      two study drugs; vandetanib, a VEGFR (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor) and EGFR
      (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) inhibitor, with selumetinib a MEK (Mitogen Activated
      Kinase)inhibitor.

      This is the first time the drugs have been used together. These types of drugs have shown an
      effect in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therefore the aim is to see if combining these
      drugs has an increased anti-tumour effect for this group of patients for which treatment
      options are limited.

      The study is in two parts; the dose escalation phase and the expansion cohort.

      In the dose escalation phase, 9-50 patients will receive vandetanib and increasing doses of
      selumetinib to establish a safe dose to recommend for the next stage of the study. Patients
      with any solid tumour will be eligible.

      In the expansion cohort, approximately 30 patients will receive the dose recommended in the
      previous phase. Only patients with NSCLC will be eligible for this part of the study.

      The expansion cohort will look at further evaluating the safety of the drug combination and
      the anti-tumour activity. Patients in this cohort will be requested to also consent to have
      additional imaging assessments and optional tumour biopsies.

      Study treatment is administered orally; vandetanib tablets once daily and selumetinib
      capsules twice daily. Cycle 1 is 42 days long. Subsequent cycles are 28 days in length.
      Patients will receive a total of 6 cycles of the combination treatment. If the patient has
      not progressed after six cycles, they may be treated for further cycles following approval
      from the sponsor.
