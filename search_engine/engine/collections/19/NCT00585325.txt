      therapy will be screened for study inclusion criteria. Those with allergies to lidocaine will
      be excluded. Participants will be enrolled until a sample size of 80 wound VAC changes is
      achieved. Up to 4 VAC dressing changes can be included in this study per participant.
      Subjects will be randomized prospectively for each dressing change. Utilizing a randomized
      bracketed approach, patients will be assigned to one of two groups: Lidocaine group or
      Placebo group. The Pharmacy Research Center (PRC) will assign patient a study Identification
      (ID) number and record it along with their medical record number on the Master Study ID List.
      They will then randomize the participants by drawing randomly shuffled green vs white index
      cards. (40 white card = 0.9 normal saline and 40 green card = 5 mg/kg of 1% Lidocaine). They
      will draw up the appropriate amount of medication to be used, label it with the patients
      Medical Record (MR) #, date, and administration instructions and deliver it to the nurse who
      is doing the VAC dressing change. They will keep the Master Randomization Data Collection
      Tool in a locked drawer in her office.
