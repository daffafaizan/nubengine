      Administration (FDA) for the topical treatment of AK, superficial basal cell carcinoma and
      external genital and perianal warts. The FDA approved regimen for the treatment of AK is
      application of 250 milligrams (mg) of cream twice a week for 16 weeks to a 25 square
      centimeters (cm^2) area. In 2011, a lower strength imiquimod cream, Zyclara (imiquimod)
      Cream, 2.5% was approved by the FDA. When used for the treatment of AK, Zyclara is applied
      for a shorter duration and in an expanded treatment area (for example, face or scalp) in
      comparison to Aldara®. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). Marketed by Medicis,
      Zyclara® (imiquimod) cream 2.5% is a safe and effective topical therapy for the treatment of
      AK of the face and scalp. Actavis has developed a generic formulation of imiquimod 2.5% cream
      and the current study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this formulation.
