      parameters, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. The investigator involved in this
      trial has previously defined GDM subtypes based on underlying physiology and demonstrated
      that women with GDM and predominant sensitivity defects have an elevated risk of adverse
      pregnancy outcomes, while women with predominant secretion defects do not appear to carry the
      same risk. This supports the idea that not all gestational diabetes is the same. Ideal
      treatment strategies may differ between GDM subtypes. In this trial, investigators will
      evaluate the postprandial glycemic response to two test meals with different macronutrient
      content in different GDM physiologic subtypes. Two test meals with different macronutrient
      proportions have been designed by research dieticians. Participants will eat test meals at
      home for breakfast in a randomized order after an overnight fast. Participants will complete
      food and blood sugar diaries, and will wear a continuous glucose monitor, which will measure
      postprandial glucose.
