      patients undergoing cranial surgery that the use of L-PRF is non-inferior to classical fibrin
      sealants.

      Approximately 350 patients undergoing cranial surgery will be enrolled in this randomized,
      controlled, single-blinded monocenter study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      autologous blood-derived products (L-PRF and fibrinogen) compared to the fibrin sealants as
      an adjunct for dural repair (= primary objective).

      The investigators will also evaluate if the use of L-PRF obviates the need for the use of
      other autologous grafts (e.g. muscle/fat), commercial collagen-based products (e.g. Tachosil)
      or articifial dura (=secondary objective).
