    
      VRC 610:

      A Phase I Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study to Evaluate a Human Monoclonal Antibody (MAB)
      VRC-HIVMAB095-00-AB (10E8VLS) Administered Alone or Concurrently with MAB VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB
      (VRC07-523LS) Via Subcutaneous Injection in Healthy Adults

      Study Design:

      This first-in-human, open-label study evaluated MAb 10E8VLS (VRC-HIVMAB095-00-AB)
      administered alone or concurrently (i.e., at the same visit) with MAb VRC07-523LS
      (VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB) in healthy adults ages 18 to 60. The primary hypothesis was that
      administrations of 10E8VLS alone and concurrently with VRC07-523LS will be well-tolerated in
      healthy adults. A secondary hypothesis was that both broadly neutralizing monoclonal
      antibodies (bNAbs) will be detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.

      Product Description:

      The 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS bNAbs target the HIV-1 envelope at distinct epitopes: 10E8VLS
      recognizes the membrane proximal external region (MPER) and proximal viral membrane lipid of
      gp41, while VRC07-523LS recognizes the CD4 binding site of gp120. Both antibodies are human
      in origin, contain two amino acid modifications within the C-terminus of the heavy chain
      constant region designed to improve antibody half-life in vivo, and were developed by the
      VRC/NIAID/NIH. The 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS bNAbs were manufactured under current Good
      Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations at the VRC Pilot Plant operated under contract by
      the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick,
      MD.

      The 10E8VLS drug product was supplied at a concentration of 100 mg/mL in a sterile, aqueous,
      buffered solution of 5.25 mL in single-use 10 mL glass vials. The VRC07-523LS drug product
      was supplied at a concentration of 100 mg/mL in an isotonic, sterile solution of 6.25 mL in
      single-use 10 mL glass vials. Each drug product was prepared for administration in separate
      syringes.

      Participants:

      Healthy adults, 18-60 years of age.

      Study Plan:

      This open-label study included 4 dosing regimens of either 10E8VLS (5 mg/kg) administered
      alone or 10E8VLS (5 mg/kg) and VRC07-523LS (5 mg/kg). All injections were administered by the
      subcutaneous (SC) route. For Groups 1 and 2, 10E8VLS was to be administered once or
      three-times at 12-week intervals. For Groups 3 and 4, 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS were to be
      administered once or three-times at 12-week intervals, respectively. Enrollment began with
      Groups 1 and 2, followed by Groups 3 and 4.

      VRC 610 Study Schema:

        -  Group 1; Study Product: 10E8VLS; Planned Participants per Group: 3; Dose Administered
           SC: 5 mg/kg; Day 0

        -  Group 2; Study Product: 10E8VLS; Planned Participants per Group: 3; Dose Administered
           SC: 5 mg/kg; Day 0, Week 12*, Week 24*

        -  Group 3 (a,b); Study Product: 10E8VLS+VRC07-523LS; Planned Participants per Group: 5;
           Dose Administered SC: 5 mg/kg of each MAb; Day 0

        -  Group 4 (a,b); Study Product: 10E8VLS+VRC07-523LS; Planned Participants per Group: 5;
           Dose Administered SC: 5 mg/kg of each MAb; Day 0, Week 12*, Week 24*

        -  Total Planned Participants = 16

        -  Total Actual Participants = 9 (c)

      (*)Participants received only one product administration on Day 0 because of the voluntary
      study pause and termination by Investigational New Drug (IND) Sponsor/Principal Investigator
      (PI) decision.

        1. Enrollment into Group 3 and 4 commenced after positive protocol safety review team
           (PSRT) review of safety data from Groups 1 and 2

        2. 10E8VLS and VRC07-523LS were provided in separate syringes and administered at the same
           visit.

        3. The expected enrollment was 16 participants; however, enrollment was voluntarily paused
           by the IND Sponsor/PI and the study ultimately stopped after several Grade 2 and Grade 3
           redness local reactogenicity reactions were observed at 10E8VLS injection sites.

      Study Duration:

      Study participation was expected to be approximately 24 weeks for participants in Groups 1
      and 3, and 48 weeks for participants in Groups 2 and 4. Participants in the repeat-dose
      groups (2 and 4) were converted to a modified schedule per protocol. Study participation for
      all participants was approximately 24 weeks after Day 0 product administration.
