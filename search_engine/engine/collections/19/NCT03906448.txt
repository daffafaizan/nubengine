      resection (biopsy alone may be eligible) and chemoradiotherapy: concomitant 75mg/m2 daily
      temozolomide with 80% prescribed dose completed and RT with minimal RT dose of 40 Gy
      delivered.

      Within three weeks prior to beginning adjuvant temozolomide, all patients will undergo a
      Baseline contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain. Within two weeks prior to beginning adjuvant
      temozolomide, all patients will undergo baseline assessments. Patients will begin study
      treatment with temozolomide and TTFields within 2 weeks of the baseline evaluation, and no
      later than 6 weeks from last dose of concomitant temozolomide or radiation therapy (the
      latter of the two). A minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide will
      be given. Patients will be seen and examined before each cycle of temozolomide. After a
      maximum of 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, patients will be seen every 8 weeks. Brain MRI
      and QoL assessments will be performed every 8 weeks following the baseline MRI for the first
      2 years then every 3 months thereafter until second progression (when TTFields treatment will
      be terminated).
