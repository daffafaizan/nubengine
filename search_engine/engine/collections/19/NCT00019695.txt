      sodium produces acceptable disease responses as compared with ketoconazole alone in patients
      with androgen-independent metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and assess the bone marrow
      concentrations of both agents.

      III. Assess matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition potential of alendronate sodium by
      monitoring markers of angiogenesis, MMP breakdown, and changes in hydroxyproline.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive a single oral dose of ketoconazole on day 1. Patients begin taking
      ketoconazole 3 times per day on day 8.

      Arm II: Patients receive a single oral dose of alendronate sodium on day 1 and a single oral
      dose of ketoconazole on day 3. Patients begin taking alendronate sodium once every morning
      and ketoconazole 3 times per day on day 8.

      Treatment continues on both arms in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients who experience a clinical complete remission (CR) receive treatment for
      an additional 60 days beyond documentation of a clinical CR.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:

      A total of 72 patients (36 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
