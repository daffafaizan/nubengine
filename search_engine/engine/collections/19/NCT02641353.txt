    
      This is a phase 1, open-label, randomized, three-period, six-sequence crossover study in
      healthy subjects. The study will consist of a screening phase, a baseline phase, three study
      periods, and a follow-up phone call. Each study period will be four days in duration (Day 1
      through Day 4) of dosing followed by a five-day washout between doses.

      Within no more than 21 days (Day -21) and no less than two days (Day -2) prior to the start
      of the first study period, subjects will undergo routine screening procedures including a
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs, clinical laboratory safety tests, serology
      screen, pregnancy and FSH testing, and drug/alcohol screen.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted into the study center on Day -1 of study Period 1 for
      baseline measurements. During each study period, subjects will receive a single 30 mg oral
      dose of apremilast on Day 1 according to the assigned treatment sequence. Subjects will be
      domiciled at the study center from Day 1 of study Period 1 through Day 4 of study Period 3,
      including the 5 day washout between doses. All subjects will be discharged from the study
      center on Day 4 of study Period 3 following completion of required study procedures.

      A follow-up phone call will occur approximately four days (Â±2 days) after the discharge from
      the study center.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation
      (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).
