      strength duration curve and pressure pain threshold (PPT) in subjects with scapular downward
      rotation syndrome.

      Thirty subjects with age range of 18 to 30 years with scapular downward rotation were
      recruited in this study.

      Thirty subjects of both gender with scapular downward rotation were recruited in this study.

      All recruited subjects were examined to exclude defined pathological conditions.

      All subjects were assessed by screening examination for downward rotation of scapula.

      Pressure pain threshold was measured using pressure algometer. Mechanosensitivity of neural
      tissue was measured using neurodynamic test. Pain was measured using strength-duration (SD)
      curve. Treatment program consisted of 3 sessions/week, for 6 weeks. All measurements were
      taken pre and post the treatment period.
