      a homogeneous distribution of emphysema as determined by CT, who are not eligible for
      endobronchial valve therapy based on fissure integrity as determined by CT. Enrollment will
      continue until 10 patients have been treated per protocol or until a maximum of 15 patients
      total have been treated.

      Patients will be enrolled at Thoraxklinik University of Heidelberg, Germany and followed for
      twelve (12) months.

      The follow up data collected will include pulmonary function testing (spirometry, body
      plethysmography, DLCO), exercise capacity (six minute walk test) and imaging findings (chest
      x-ray and CT). Dyspnea score (mMRC) and quality of life questionnaire (SGRQ-C) information
      will be obtained. Information regarding adverse events, serious adverse events, and major
      medical complications will be collected at each visit. Serious adverse events will be
      adjudicated by an independent medical monitor in order to establish relatedness to the
      InterVapor device and procedure.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all safety and efficacy data. There is no
      predefined hypothesis regarding safety, or efficacy.

      Monitoring of the study will be undertaken as a continuous process to ensure that
      high-quality data are obtained and to ensure compliance with study procedures.
