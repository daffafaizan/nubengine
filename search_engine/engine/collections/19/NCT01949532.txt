      (ESRD) on area under the curve (both area under the curve, from time 0 to the last
      concentration measured [AUC0-last] and area under the curve, from time 0 extrapolated to
      infinity [AUC0-inf]) of carfilzomib 56 mg/mÂ² at Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) in patients with
      relapsed multiple myeloma.
