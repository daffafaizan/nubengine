      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of BMS-214662 when
      combined with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. Ii. Determine, in a
      preliminary manner, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BMS-214662.

      Patients receive BMS-214662 IV over 1 hour on days 2, 8, 15, and 22 and trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-214662 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients
      are accrued to receive treatment with BMS-214662 and trastuzumab at the recommended phase II
      dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-28 patients will be accrued for this study.
