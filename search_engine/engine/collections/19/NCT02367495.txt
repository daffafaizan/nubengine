      remains unclear. Data from recent randomized clinical trials have suggested that angioplasty
      with drug-coated balloons (DCB) is associated with excellent clinical outcomes. However, as
      the effectiveness of DCB devices depends critically on the specific composition of its matrix
      coating there may be important differences in clinical performance between different DCB
      devices. The prospective, non-randomized, single arm, historical-control ISAR-DESIRE 3A trial
      is designed to test that hypothesis that angioplasty with a novel paclitaxel-coated balloon
      with citrate-based excipient (Agent PCB, Boston Scientific) will be non-inferior to a
      conventional paclitaxel-coated balloon with iopromide excipient (SeQuent Please PCB, B.
      Braun; data from ISAR-DESIRE 3) for the treatment of coronary restenosis after implantation
      of limus-analogue drug-eluting stents (DES). The key inclusion criteria are patients with
      symptoms and/or objective signs of ischemia, restenosis at the site of previous
      limus-analogue DES implantation and written, informed consent. The primary endpoint is
      in-segment percent diameter stenosis (%DS) at 6-8 month follow-up angiography. Sample size
      calculation is based on a non-inferiority analysis: %DS of 35% after Both PCB,
      non-inferiority margin of 7% absolute, 1-sided Î±-level of 0.05 and power of 80% resulting in
      102 patients per group. To account for possible FU losses 125 patients in total will be
      enrolled.
