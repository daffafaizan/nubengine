      will be approached for inclusion in the study. Upon diagnosis, a patient diagnosed with a
      trigger will be informed of the study, asked if they would like to participate, and consented
      into the study. Patients will then be randomized to a control group versus our test group.
      The control group will be given a generic handout about trigger finger and the treatment
      options. They will then complete the decisional conflict survey without using the tool. The
      second group will use the tool and then complete the decisional conflict survey.

      The standard of care is not being altered- all treatment options will still be available to
      patients and they have select whatever option is most in line with their preference for
      treatment. The purpose of the tool is to facilitate preference elicitation for treatment.
