      L-tyrosine is the precursor for norepinephrine in the central nervous system (CNS).
      Norepinephrine in the CNS has important roles in pain and mood modulation and descending
      inhibition of pain pathways. By giving the precursor L-tyrosine in high doses we believe that
      we can increase levels of norepinephrine in the CNS. To study this question we designed a
      randomized blinded pilot study of 30 patients. Patients are randomly assigned to one of 3
      groups (placebo, tyrosine 1000mg/day, and tyrosine 2000mg/day.) for 3 weeks. Patients then
      complete the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) daily and the Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ)
      on day 1 and day 21. Patients also complete a drug diary. They are monitored weekly for
      progress during the study.
