      World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) because of its ability to improve the performance of
      athletes.

      Testosterone glucuronization by UGT2B17 isoenzyme (Uridine Diphosphate Glucuronyltransferase
      2B17) is inhibited in vitro by green tea flavonols like epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate
      (EGCG) and catechin gallate.

      Therefore a diet rich in green tea could interfere in androgens' glucuronization and cause a
      change on the steroid profile of the athletes that could be considered a false positive.

      A clinical trial designed to assess changes on steroid profile in healthy volunteers after
      green tea consumption will be conducted. Subjects with different UGT2B17 genotype will be
      recruited (10 of each type: ins/ins, ins/del, del/del) to study if the genotype can modulate
      the results obtained.

      Urine samples obtained before and during 7 days of green tea consumption will be used to
      compare steroid profile. Blood samples will be also collected to assess EGCG
      pharmacokinetics.
