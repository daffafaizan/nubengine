    
      Main outcome parameters are:

        -  Vessel Perfusion Area (%) of central ETDRS subfields and peripapillar region as
           evaluated by OCTA (single measurement)

        -  Blood flux index(*) of central ETDRS subfields and peripapillar region as evaluated by
           OCTA (single measurement).

        -  Peripapillary and perifoveal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (Âµm) as
           evaluated by OCT (single measurement)

        -  Intraocular pressure (IOP) (mmHg) (single measurement at study visit) and mean
           intraocular pressure during anti-VEGF treatment period (evaluated as mean of all
           retrospectively available IOP measures from the beginning of treatment, mmHg)

      (*)Blood flux index is automatically calculated by ARI Network as the mean flow intensity in
      the vessel area, where the blood flow signal was normalized to 0 to 1 by dividing by the full
      dynamic range of blood flow signal intensity.
