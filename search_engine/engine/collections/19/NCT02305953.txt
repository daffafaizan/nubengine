      A13-935) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01722214) patients who also underwent a
      pre-adalimumab FDG-PET scan for the study. Serum cytokine and chemokine levels in these
      samples will be measured; IL-17 and IL-22 using the Singulex immunoassay platform, and
      S100A9, IL-6 and TNF alpha using multiplex ELISA. Vascular inflammation will be measured as
      the target to background ratio (TBR) in the ascending aorta using PET-scan technology.
      Correlation analyses will be performed between serum levels of cytokines and a chemokine and
      vascular inflammation.
