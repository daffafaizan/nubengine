        1. Determine to what extent a nutritional prehabilitation regimen, which includes whey
           protein, initiated before surgery and continued after surgery, optimizes the recovery of
           functional walking capacity following colorectal resection for cancer.

        2. To understand further which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to
           prehabilitation interventions, and predict change in later outcome measures.
