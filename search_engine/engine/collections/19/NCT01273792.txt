      occlusion and sensorineural deafness. The pathogenesis is not yet clear, an autoimmune
      endotheliopathy is discussed. Because of the variable and often incomplete clinical
      presentation, the establishment of the diagnosis is often delayed or even completely missed.

      The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers that facilitate the reliable and prompt
      establishment of the diagnosis. Patients with a definite diagnosis of Susac syndrome and
      healthy subjects as controls are investigated.

      Furthermore, the correlation of serological markers with structural retinal and cerebral
      changes will contribute to clarification of the pathogenesis of Susac syndrome.
