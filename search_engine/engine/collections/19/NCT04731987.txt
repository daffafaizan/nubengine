      cross over trial with 3 arms, carried out on subjects with predisposition to cardiovascular
      diseases (CVD) based on age and overweight. This study aims to demonstrate the vascular
      protective effects (with Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD) as main criteria) of the consumption
      of a flavanone rich orange juice or of orange flavanones by comparison with a control sugary
      drink alone.

      The 42 recruited participants will receive the 3 drinks in a random order. For each subject,
      the study is divided into 3 identical experimental periods of 45 days (period 1,2,3):
      including 3 days prior to the beginning of the product intake, during which specific dietary
      guidelines, samplings and measures will be asked to be performed at home followed by a 6
      weeks period of consumption of each of the 3 beverages). A period of 4 to 6 weeks of wash-out
      is planned between each experimental period.

      To summarize: Visit 1 (D-14) = inclusion, Visit 2 (D1: baseline) to 3 (D42) = period 1, Visit
      3 (D42) to 4 (D70) = wash out 1, Visit 4 (D70) to 5 (D111) = period 2, Visit 5 (D111) to 6
      (D139) = wash out 2, Visit 6 (D139) to 7 (D180) = period 3. The wash-out periods (minimum
      duration: 4 weeks) may be extended until 6 weeks for the convenience of participants.

      The protocol includes a total of 7 visits to PIC/CIC Inserm 1405 of the Clermont-Fd
      University Hospital.

      The total duration of the study will be between 28 and 34 weeks
