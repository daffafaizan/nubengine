      by automating spinal bone landmark detection and depth measurements and providing a real-time
      assessment of scan plane orientation in 3D.

      Assuming a Type I error rate of 5% (α = 0.05) and a Type II error rate of 20% (β=0.2), a
      minimum of 76 subjects will be required. All the subjects will have their lumbar area scanned
      for the measurements of the depth of the epidural space (recorded in cm) by two
      anesthesiologist, one expert in UD and the other a novice, previously instructed to the use
      of the Accuro device.

      All measurements will be performed either in the sitting or in the supine position at L1/L2,
      L2/L3 and L3/L4 levels. The expert operator will assess the lumbar spine by using both the
      devices (standard US and Accuro) while the novice will use only the Accuro.

      The primary end-point of the study will be the accuracy of the Accuro to determine the depth
      of the epidural space using a midline approach using as comparator the measurement obtained
      with the standard ultrasound device performed by the expert operator.
