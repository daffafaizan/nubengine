      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide which can be safely combined
      with the fixed dose schedule of nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory primary
      central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL). (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) of
      nivolumab and pomalidomide combination in patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL and PVRL.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of pomalidomide.

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and pomalidomide
      orally (PO) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 weeks, then every 3
      months for 4 years.
