      diamine fluoride (SDF) in arresting dentin caries lesions when compared to MI Varnish a 5%
      sodium fluoride varnish which also contains RECALDENTâ„¢* (CPP-ACP): Casein
      Phosphopeptide-Amorphous Calcium Phosphate. For this, healthy children aged 4-8 years with at
      least one active dentin carious lesion will be allocated randomly to one of two treatment
      groups: Group (1) SDF and Group (2) MI Varnish. Each participant will be assigned to one
      treatment group to avoid the possible synergistic effect of the different agents.

      Parents/ guardians of each child will be fully informed regarding the study design,
      objectives and probable advantages and side effects especially the black discoloration of SDF
      before their involvement by written consent. The International Caries Detection and
      Assessment System (ICDAS II) will be used to determine caries diagnosis and activity.visual
      and tactile examination will be done with a WHO probe to assess the primary outcome. the
      secondary outcome will be conducted by a questionnaire given to the parents.
