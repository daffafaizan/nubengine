      This research protocol aims to evaluate the safety of intra-articular injection of a mixture
      of autologous microfat associated with autologous PRP for radiocarpal osteoarthritis
      resistant to medical treatment.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal, intrasubject, single-center clinical trial phase I-IIa
      evaluating the safety and feasibility of this innovative treatment.

      Twelve patients will receive an intra-articular injection of 4 ml of an homogeneous mixture
      of autologous PRP (2ml) and microfat (2ml).
