        -  To determine whether selenium (Se) supplementation decreases the incidence of prostate
           cancer.

        -  To determine whether Se supplementation inhibits the biochemical progression of prostate
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo daily. Treatment continues for up to 57 months in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of prostate cancer.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 200 μg of oral selenium (Se) as high-Se Baker's yeast daily.
           Treatment continues for up to 57 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
           diagnosis of prostate cancer.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive 400 μg of oral Se as high-Se baker's yeast daily. Treatment
           continues for up to 57 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or diagnosis of
           prostate cancer.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, at randomization, and then semi-annually for
      laboratory and other testing. Tissue samples may also be collected for biomarker analysis.
      Patients complete an initial questionnaire and urological-symptoms questionnaire at baseline,
      a follow-up questionnaire after randomization (to capture new illness, medications, and
      toxicity symptoms during the 30-day run-in period; a urological-symptoms questionnaire; a
      food-frequency questionnaire; and a mood questionnaire). Patients then undergo questionnaires
      semi-annually, including vital status, tablet compliance, nutrition, mood, new illnesses or
      medications, and any incidence of cancer or family history of cancer).
