      (sites were notified of the early enrollment halt on 7-Aug-2014) and the dose-expansion part
      was not conducted. Due to halted enrollment and/or lack of complete responses (CR) and
      partial responses (PR), efficacy analysis was only performed in terms of TTP for the patients
      treated during the dose-escalation part at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      dose expansion (RDE).
