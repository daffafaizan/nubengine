    
      The study was conducted on 40 patients with sepsis who admitted in the Critical Care
      department of Cairo University.

      The sepsis is identified according to surviving sepsis campaign guidelines with use of SOFA
      score to establish the diagnosis.

      The patients divided into 2 groups the first group included 25 patients who developed AKI as
      defined by KDIGO guidelines and the other group included 15 patients as a control group.

      The Plasma Endostatin level is sampled in the first 24 hours of diagnosis of AKI, the
      estimation of plasma Endostatin level done by ELISA technique.

      The results were presented in form of: descriptive, analytical and comparative data between
      the groups of study.

      It was found that the patients with higher levels of plasma endostatin had a higher incidence
      of recovery from AKI and higher incidence of 28 days survival, while the patients with lower
      levels of plasma Endostatin below the determined Cut-off value have increased incidence of
      RRT .

      Also that the patients with higher levels of plasma Endostatin levels were less labile to
      mechanical ventilation and had a higher incidence of weaning of vasopressors in comparison of
      the other group of lower levels of plasma Endostatin.

      Plasma Endostatin levels have no difference between the AKI group and sepsis group which may
      need further investigations to determine its role in sepsis.

      so that, the plasma Endostatin can be used as a marker of recovery from AKI.
