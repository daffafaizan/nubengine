      Healthy term primi or second gravid parturients (aged >18 years) with a singleton, live fetus
      in vertex presentation when in active stage of labor with cervical dilation of 3-5 cm were
      recruited in the study after they requested epidural for pain relief. PIEB epidural analgesia
      was used.

      Primary outcome was maternal satisfaction during labor and delivery. Our hypothesis was that
      patients would have a greater level of satisfaction when using PIEB technique. The secondary
      outcomes were to measure the degree of motor blockade, neonatal and obstetric outcomes.
