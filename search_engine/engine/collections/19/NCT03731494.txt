      has been reported to be one of the most common causes of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD),
      affecting nearly 15-20% of the general population. As known, Ni-hypersensitivity can induce
      less frequently also respiratory allergy (RA) and in approximately 20% of Ni-ACD patients
      cause a more complex condition termed Systemic Nickel Allergy Syndrome (SNAS). It is
      characterized by a combination of cutaneous (in regions without direct nickel contact) and
      extracutaneous gastrointestinal symptoms, after the ingestion of Ni-rich foods, especially
      vegetables. Then, a low-Ni diet, following positive patch tests, represents a effective
      diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the control of systemic manifestations, determining a
      significant clinical improvement.

      It is known that Nickel oral hyposensitization treatment (NiOHT) is a effective approach for
      the management of Ni allergy, especially in a subset of patients with SNAS, inducing
      immunological and clinical tolerance to metal at the doses normally taken with the diet.

      Although a large number of clinical trials focused on the health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) in allergic disease, the expectations, the needs and the psychosocial characteristics
      of patients affected by SNAS are limited and no data exist pre- and post-treatment and
      specifically with NiOHT. Given the high safety profile and beneficial effects of
      immunotherapy on HRQoL of patients with allergic rhinitis, we hypothesized similar positive
      results even after oral Ni desensitization.
