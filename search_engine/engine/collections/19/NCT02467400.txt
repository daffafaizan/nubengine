      treatment with low doses of a non-selective β-blocker (propranolol) will increase serum
      markers of bone formation and reduce markers of bone resorption (Aim 1a); and using
      increasingly β1-AR (adrenergic receptor) selective blockers (atenolol and nebivolol), to
      better define the β-adrenergic receptor selectivity (β1 versus β2) in the regulation of bone
      turnover by sympathetic outflow in humans.
