      practice. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) estimates that in
      2011 alone, one in three women who gave birth in the United States did so by cesarean
      delivery. Compared to vaginal births, the increasing rate of caesarean births worldwide is a
      well known cause of maternal morbidity, including hemorrhage, anesthetic complications,
      shock, cardiac arrest, acute renal failure, assisted ventilation, venous thromboembolism and
      increased risk of major postpartum infection.

      With increasing cesarean section rates and its associated complications, obstetricians are
      challenged to reduce perioperative and postoperative morbidity by adapting their surgical
      skills and techniques. Over the years, randomized clinical trials have tried to answer many
      questions surrounding the safety of several cesarean section techniques that impart maternal
      morbidity. For example, the optimal type of cesarean section skin incision, whether or not to
      create a bladder flap, one layer versus two later closure of the uterus, irrigating the
      abdominal cavity, closure versus non closure of the parietal peritoneum, and suture versus
      staples for skin closure at cesarean section.

      Cleaning the uterine cavity following cesarean section is a routine practice by many
      obstetricians. To ensure that the entire placenta and membranes are removed after delivery of
      the placenta at cesarean, the uterine cavity is usually cleaned with one hand holding a dry
      sponge to remove any remaining membranes or placental tissue, while the other hand is placed
      on the fundus to stabilize the uterus. However, despite the lack of evidence to support a
      policy of routine intrauterine cleaning after placental delivery at cesarean section, the
      benefits of intrauterine cleaning as a routine practice during cesarean sections remains
      uncertain. Obstetricians who do not routinely clean the uterine cavity after placental
      delivery argue that this procedure is not performed routinely after vaginal deliveries, and
      thus is a justification not to do so during cesarean sections
