      usually the result of either lacerations such as those from knives or glass, from crush
      injuries and occasionally they can rupture from where they are joined at the bone during
      contact sports such as football, rugby and wrestling. Flexor tendon injuries are a
      challenging problem for orthopaedic surgeons due to three main reasons. Firstly, flexor
      tendon injuries of the hands are a clinical problem because they cannot heal without surgical
      treatment, as the two ends need to be surgically brought together for the healing to occur
      unlike other tendons including the Achilles tendon where it could be placed into plantar
      flexion to heal. Secondly postoperative management needs to be carefully planned as
      mobilisation has shown to be essential to prevent adhesions and improve gliding but this can
      risk rupture. Lastly due to the unique anatomy of the tendons running through flexor tendon
      sheaths to function, surgeons need to plan preventing increasing the bulkiness of the tendon
      through its sheath, which is not always possible from scarring as this affects the functional
      outcome of the tendon

      -_ The ultimate goal of surgical intervention has remained constant: to achieve enough
      strength to allow early motion, to prevent adhesions within the tendon sheath, and to restore
      the finger to normal range of motion and function.

        -  The successful repair requires minimal gapping at the repair site or interference with
           tendon vascularity, secure suture knots, smooth junction of tendon end and having
           sufficient strength for healing.

        -  The strength of the core suture is one of the important factors for valid flexor tendon
           repair. It is obvious that an increased strand number increases repair gap resistance
           and strength
