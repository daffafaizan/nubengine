      worldwide and has proven to be a success in the treatment of end-stage osteoarthritic knees.
      TKA is associated with significant postoperative pain which may delay the patient's
      functional recovery and necessitate an increased use of opioid analgesias, which are
      themselves associated with significant adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. The
      selective cycloxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was previously shown in a clinical trial
      in a paper by Buvanendran et al to reduce postoperative opioid requirement and improve
      clinical outcomes. Feng et al studied the use of a single dose of rofecoxib pre-operatively
      and its effect on inflammatory markers and postoperative pain. Rofecoxib has, however, been
      withdrawn from the market due to its association with cardiovascular side effects. Our
      current clinical practice in post-operative pain management constitutes post-operative
      etoricoxib but we hypothesize that pre-emptively administering etoricoxib pre-operatively
      would give an even greater benefit in terms of post-operative opioid usage, pain scores, and
      functional recovery in the first 2-3 days. To date, there has been no study investigating
      etoricoxib as a pre-emptive medication in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. We aim
      to conduct a study to test the efficacy of pre-emptive etoricoxib in reducing postoperative
      pain, opioid requirement and improving the rate of functional recovery.
