      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with and without a 6-Hz primer. Although
      this paper studies able-bodied individuals, similar rTMS protocols are used to facilitate
      motor recovery in patients with hemiplegia following stroke. However, the cortical mechanisms
      associated with repeated daily doses of rTMS are not completely understood.
