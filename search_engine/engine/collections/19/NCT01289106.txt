      associated with greater chance of chronic HBV carrier state, higher level of HBV replication
      and increasing its potential for transmission. Currently, there are no concrete data to
      determine the best HBV vaccination schedule in HIV-infected patients. Standard HBV
      vaccination (20 μg at 0, 1 and 6 months) gives seroconversion rate of 33-63% in HIV-infected
      individuals compared with >90% in healthy individuals. This study aims to compare the
      efficacy of an intensive standard-dose regimen (0, 1, 2 and 6 months) to a standard-dose
      regimen (0,1 and 6 months) and to compare the seroconversion rate of an intensive double-dose
      regimen (40 μg at 0,1,2 and 6 months) to a standard-dose regimen (20 μg at 0,1 and 6 months)
      of HBV vaccine in HIV-infected adult patients with CD4 level above 200 permm3 and suppressed
      viral load.
