    
      This is a prospective, bi-center, open "Phase II" type study on a medical device (the LIR
      system). It is the first trial of the device on humans.

      The study, which begins at the signing of consent (made the day before or the day of
      surgery), ends when the patient leaves the hospital. The LIR system is used on a small
      population of patients under general anesthesia for the automated administration of
      intravenous fluids during major abdominal surgery by laparotomy or laparoscopy. Several
      criteria describing the fluids administered, cardiac output, blood pressure and other
      parameters will be identified during surgery.

      This Phase II study is carried out in two, subsequent stages of size "n1" = 19 and "n" = 42.

      Strengthening of security :

        -  The device will be used under the direct supervision of an anesthesiologist ; he / she
           can regain control instantly when needed .

        -  An independent oversight committee will be formed and consulted every 10 patients.
