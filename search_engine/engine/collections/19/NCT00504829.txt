    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 12 week study with a 52-week open-label
      follow-up to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LCP-AtorFen (the combination of atorvastatin
      and fenofibrate) in the treatment of hyperlipidemia.

      After a wash-out phase, eligible patients will be randomized on a 1:1:1 ratio to either
      LCP-AtorFen, atorvastatin or fenofibrate for 12 weeks. After the completion of the 12-week
      phase, all eligible patients will be offered to receive open-label LCP-AtorFen for another 52
      weeks.
