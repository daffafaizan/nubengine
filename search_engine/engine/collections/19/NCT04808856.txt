      treatment methods are often contraindicated . From the current clinical research evidence ,
      we have seen the non-inferior effect of ACTH on glucocorticoids and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of acute gout , as well as the good safety and
      extensive anti-inflammatory effect in addition to efficacy . Therefore , we designed this
      study to update and improve the treatment of acute gout attacks , and to try to clarify the
      mechanism of action .
