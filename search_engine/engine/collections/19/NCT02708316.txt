      multi-center cooperation. Investigators plan to collect 100 schizophrenic patients as case
      group, 100 healthy people as control group. Investigators will observe schizophrenia patients
      who use the single drug of risperidone in the treatment and follow up the patients on day 1,
      the third week, the third month, the sixth month and the first year. In addition, the other
      two groups of patients with schizophrenia will be included, one with olanzapine and the other
      with aripiprazole. There are three objectives:

        1. Compare healthy population with schizophrenia patients in the difference of gut
           metagenome and inflammatory factors in the blood, stool samples aimed at detecting the
           difference of composition of intestinal microorganism;

        2. Observe the change of intestinal microorganism, inflammatory factors, Î³-aminobutyric
           acid of schizophrenic patients who received risperidone treatment according to the
           blood, stool samples, cerebrospinal fluid during the follow-up period.

        3. Study the difference of intestinal flora composition between schizophrenia patients with
           metabolic disorder and schizophrenia patients without metabolic disorder after
           olanzapine or aripiprazole treatment and discuss the relationship between intestinal
           flora composition and metabolic disorder.
