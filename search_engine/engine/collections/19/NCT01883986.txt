      plus usual care or the usual care arm. Patients randomized to the intervention arm will
      receive usual oncologic care and phone calls from a nurse. Outcomes measures will be
      collected at baseline, and 3 months.

      The study will be performed at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System. The investigators will
      recruit individuals (n=40) with lung cancer over 1 year. The primary objective is to test the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, and recruitment of subjects. The
      investigators will estimate the effect of a nurse-led telephone based palliative care
      intervention to improve quality-of-life, symptom burden and patient satisfaction. In
      addition, using validated instruments, the investigators will assess the potential effect
      size of the intervention on quality of provider communication and on clinician knowledge of
      patient preferences for life sustaining therapies. The results of this pilot study will
      inform a future randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of the intervention on a
      larger scale.
