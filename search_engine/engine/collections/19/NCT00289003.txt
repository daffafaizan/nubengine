      mouth. The condition is very painful and might put the patient at risk of serious systemic
      infections and is a common dose-limiting toxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The
      present treatment of mucositis is primarily supportive; strong analgesics in addition to oral
      hygiene. Prophylactic antibiotics have been used and many topical agents are available to
      palliate mucositis, but no standard therapy has been accepted.

      Comparison: Methyl cellulose has been chosen as placebo due to its close resemblance to
      soluble beta-1,3/1,6-glucan in terms of general appearance and viscosity. Methyl cellulose is
      a viscous solution which might form a mucosal barrier. Physical barriers are considered
      having a protective function in oral mucositis, and methyl cellulose might be considered as
      an active control.
