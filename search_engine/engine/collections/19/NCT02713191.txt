      achieving sedation during endobronchial ultrasound and other bronchoscopic procedures.
      However, all these agents carry a risk of respiratory depression. Dexmedetomidine, a highly
      selective adrenergic alpha-2 agonist, has sedative and analgesic properties but does not
      cause respiratory depression. This study aims to compare efficacy and safety of
      dexmedetomidine as a sedative to midazolam in patients with hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy
      undergoing convex-probe endobronchial ultrasonography on day care basis. Patients will be
      randomized to receive either dexmedetomidine plus fentanyl or midazolam plus fentanyl prior
      to procedure, followed by dexmedetomidine or saline infusion respectively during the
      procedure. Ramsay sedation score of two will be targeted, failing which patients in both
      groups will receive midazolam bolus on as-needed basis. Bronchoscopist will remain blinded to
      group allocation. Patients will be monitored for sedation, oxygenation and hemodynamic
      parameters throughout. Need for additional midazolam, sedative efficacy, frequency of adverse
      respiratory and hemodynamic events, and bronchoscopist and patient satisfaction with the
      procedure will be compared between the two groups.
