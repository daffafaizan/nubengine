      and exhibits an acceptable safety profile. Due to its high selectivity for the kappa-opioid
      receptor, asimadoline does not produce mu-opioid like side-effects. Results from preclinical
      models indicate asimadoline significantly reduces the frequency of scratching induced by
      pruritic agents. This double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study is designed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of asimadoline in patients with pruritus
      associated with atopic dermatitis.
