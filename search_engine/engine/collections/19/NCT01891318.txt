      I. To determine the safety (risk of acute and long-term toxicities) of neoadjuvant
      radiosurgery at escalating doses followed by surgical resection of brain metastases. (Phase
      I)

      II. To determine the local control of brain metastases treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery
      followed by surgical resection. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of distant brain failure when brain metastases are managed with
      neoadjuvant radiosurgery followed by surgical resection.

      II. To estimate the rate of salvage surgery, whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), or
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for participants treated with neoadjuvant radiosurgery
      followed by surgical resection.

      III. To determine the rate of radiation necrosis/steroid dependency. IV. To determine the
      radiobiologic impact of neoadjuvant radiosurgery for resected brain metastases.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of radiosurgery followed by a phase II
      study.

      The following outcomes were removed from the protocol in an amendment:

        -  Changes in neurocognitive function as measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test
           (HVLT), Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) & Trailmaking Test B, and Trailmaking
           Test A

        -  QOL measured by FACT-BR and EORTC-QLQ30
