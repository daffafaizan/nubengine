      Monoclonal Antibody, VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS), and VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01),
      Administered Intravenously or Subcutaneously to Healthy Adults.

      Study Design: This is the first study of the VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) monoclonal
      antibody (MAb) in healthy adults. It is a dose-escalation study to examine safety,
      tolerability, dose, and pharmacokinetics of VRC01LS. The hypothesis is that VRC01LS will be
      safe to administer to healthy adults by the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes.
      The secondary hypothesis is that VRC01LS will be detectable in human sera with a definable
      half-life. With protocol amendment, Group 7 and Group 8 were added to the protocol Version
      2.0 to evaluate VRC01 and VRC01LS safety and pharmacokinetics in the same study.

      Product Description: VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) and VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) are human
      MAb targeted to the CD4 binding site of HIV-1. VRC01LS is a modification of the VRC01 MAb
      (which has been shown to be safe in human studies) with the addition of the LS , 2-amino acid
      mutation designed to improve the half-life of the antibody. VRC01LS and VRC01 were developed
      by VRC/NIAID/NIH and manufactured under cGMP at the VRC Pilot Plan operated under contract by
      the Vaccine Clinical Material Program operated for NIAID/VRC by Leidos Biomedical Research,
      Inc., Frederick, MD. Vials are provided at 100 mg/mL.

      Subjects: Healthy adults, 18-50 years of age.

      Study Plan: There are 4 open-label, dose escalation groups (Groups 1-4) to assess VRC01LS
      administered IV and SC once per subject. 2 open-label groups (Groups 5 and 6) to assess
      VRC01LS at 5 mg/kg SC or at 20 mg/kg IV administered every 12 weeks for a total of 3
      administrations per subject, and 2 open-label groups (Groups 7 and 8) to assess VRC01 at 5
      mg/kg SC or at 20 mg/kg IV administered every 4 weeks for a total of 2 administrations per
      subject. Subjects will be randomized into Group 1 or Group 2 at a 1:1 ratio, or directly
      enrolled into Groups 3-6 per the dose escalation and safety evaluation plan. Enrollments into
      Group 7 and Group 8 will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio.

      Study Duration: Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks after the last study product
      administration.
