      after age 9 with CD4+ T cells above 350 cells/mm3 who are randomized 3:1 to begin HAART
      consisting of TDF/FTC/ATV/r (preferred), AZT/3TC/ATV/r, or other recommended NRTI backbone
      with ATV/r upon entry or to begin treatment under current DHHS guidelines. Subjects in the
      experimental group who achieve virologic control by week 24 and maintain good control through
      48 weeks will then de-intensify to ATV/r alone and will be followed for two years. Subjects
      randomized to the standard care arm will begin HAART with TDF/FTC/ATV/r (preferred),
      AZT/3TC/ATV/r, or other recommended ATV/r based HAART regimen according to current DHHS
      standard of care.
