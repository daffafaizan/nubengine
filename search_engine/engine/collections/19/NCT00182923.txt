      hormones and drugs. For this study, healthy volunteers of normal body weight will be screened
      to find xxx individuals with the genes of interest. Very small doses of hormones and drugs
      will be given so that changes in forearm blood flow can be measured, while not causing
      effects throughout the body. A brachial artery line and venous line will be placed in the
      study arm so that blood samples may be withdrawn to compare amounts given into the artery and
      coming out of the vein after circulating through the arm. Forearm blood flow is determined by
      the rate of swelling of the arm after a blood pressure cuff is inflated (above venous and
      below arterial blood pressure). The hormones and drugs being studied include angiotensin I,
      angiotensin II, acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, enalaprilat, L-arginine, phenylephrine,
      endothelin-1, verapamil, and isoproterenol. This procedure will last 4-6 hours. The process
      will be repeated with the same participant over 2 weeks later.
