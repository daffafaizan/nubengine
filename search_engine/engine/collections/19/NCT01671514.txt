      has been shown in clinical trials to increase levels of nitric oxide (NO) as assessed by
      flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the brachial artery and measurements of circulating NO in
      plasma. NO is thought to be an activator of PGC-1 alpha [PPAR (peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor) alpha coactivator 1] which stimulates mitochondrial
      biogenesis. In both patients with heart failure and diabetes there is nitric oxide deficiency
      and mitochondrial dysfunction. In our proposed double-blinded placebo controlled clinical
      trial, we will test the hypothesis that chronic administration of epicatechin to patients
      with both heart failure and diabetes will increase levels of NO and PGC-1 alpha leading to
      increased mitochondrial biogenesis and improved mitochondrial function. We believe similar
      changes will occur in sedentary individuals.

      In a preliminary study with 5 patients with heart failure and diabetes (conducted under UCSD
      IRB protocol number #090688) we have shown that epicatechin enriched dark chocolate improves
      mitochondrial structure (Taub PR, Ramirez-Sanchez I, Ciaraldi TP, et al. Alterations in
