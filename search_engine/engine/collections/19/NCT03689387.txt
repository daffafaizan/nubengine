      an increase in energy expenditure. It brings many benefits after stroke, particularly in
      terms of secondary prevention by reducing modifiable risk factors, cardio-respiratory
      capacity, and neuromotive, cognitive and functional recovery by stimulating brain plasticity
      (Saunders et al., 2014).

      The Stroke Council of the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends, in prevention after
      the occurrence of a first stroke, the practice of moderate to intense physical activity for
      40 minutes a day, three to four times a week (Lackland et al., 2014). The World Health
      Organization (WHO) also recommends the practice of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
      endurance activity or at least 75 minutes of endurance activity of sustained intensity per
      week, adapted to the possibilities of the patient (World Health Organization 2010).
      Unfortunately, the majority of stroke patients have activity below recommendation (Rand et
      al., 2009).

      The main hypothesis of this work is that the amount of AP, measured by self-questionnaire, is
      insufficient, and below current recommendations in patients with stroke, after return home.

      Given the multiple physical, psychological, social, and economic benefits of PA practice, it
      is also important to identify the habits and challenges that patients experience with PA, so
      that they can be better informed. advise and guide them to reach AP stroke recommendations.
