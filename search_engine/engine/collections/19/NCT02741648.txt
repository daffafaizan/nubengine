      infants. Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough red blood cells (RBC).
      RBCs are important because they contain hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen
      throughout the body. Transfusions of RBCs in these infants is frequently required to correct
      the anemia. Oxygen levels in the digestive tract will be measured before, during and after
      each blood transfusion using a tissue oxygen monitor called Near Infrared Spectroscopy
      (NIRS). By using this technology, better understanding can be obtained of intestinal blood
      flow patterns.

      In addition, ELBW infants are more likely to have immature digestive systems and are at risk
      for digestive tract problems such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). NEC is a disease
      characterized by infection and decreased blood flow to the intestines. NEC is a major cause
      of devastating illness and death in this vulnerable preterm population. Leftover blood
      samples, urine, stool, and breast milk samples will be collected, frozen, and stored. In the
      event a baby develops a digestive tract complication they will be studied in a laboratory to
      identify markers that indicate a healthy digestive tract versus illness.
