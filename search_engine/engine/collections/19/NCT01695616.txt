      symptoms and prevent osteoporosis frames and cardiovascular disease. However, only 30 to 40%
      of women still using hormone therapy.

      One reason women do not continue or are reluctant to start Hormone Therapy is realizing that
      the prescription of hormones is not a natural situation. Therefore, there is an increased
      interest in the use and prescription of estrogen derived from plants, known as
      fitoestrogÃªnios.

      The development of a drug containing two standardized extracts was focused on two main
      symptoms of menopause: hot flashes and anxiety. This product comes from a longing for the
      doctors themselves can respond more promptly to patients who reach menopause and who already
      has a framework for mild to moderate anxiety.

      Thus, to meet the woman who develops menopausal symptoms and that these two are highly
      prevalent during menopause, causing intense discomfort routine for this woman, was produced
      in association with Soy Passiflora aiming to control anxiety and hot flushes
