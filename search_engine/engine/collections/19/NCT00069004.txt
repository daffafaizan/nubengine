      physical and metabolic problems, including changes in body fat distribution (lipodystrophy),
      osteopenia and osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and hyperlactatemia. Early studies suggest that
      protease inhibitors (PIs) were directly responsible for HIV Lipodystrophy Syndrome (HLS) and
      skeletal complications in HAART-treated patients. This study will compare HIV infected,
      HAART-treated children and youth and their uninfected counterparts to make connections
      between HAART, HLS, and skeletal and metabolic problems. The study is the first to address
      the prevalence and risk assessment of these complications in children, and will be useful in
      predicting long-term prognosis in HIV patients who use or have used HAART.

      There will be three groups in the study. Group 1 participants will be uninfected volunteers
      who will receive no protocol-specific treatment or other intervention. Vertically infected
      HIV patients in Groups 2 and 3 will continue their current HAART either on a
      non-PI-containing regimen (Group 2) or a PI-containing regimen (Group 3). Screening
      evaluations will be conducted within 30 days prior to study entry. Study evaluations may be
      completed at study entry or over the course of up to 3 study visits. All participants will
      undergo whole body and regional DEXA scans (to assess bone density), measurements to
      determine sexual maturity, and blood work.
