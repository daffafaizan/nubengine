      technical improvement in EUS-guided transmural Biliary drainage (BD) of distal malignant
      biliary obstruction Data is still limited, but recent studies and reviews have been reported
      with acceptable technical and clinical success. However, some concerns exist regarding its
      safety, as secondary adverse events

      There are doubts concerning the possible benefits derived from the insertion of
      double-pigtail plastic stents (DPS) within the lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) in the
      EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (CDS). Our hypothesis is that adding a coaxial plastic
      stent may offer benefits in terms of safety in CDS.
