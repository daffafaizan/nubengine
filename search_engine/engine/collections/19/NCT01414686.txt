    
      Objective: To determine if playing active video games results in improved balance and motor
      performance.

      Design: Randomized-matched, single-blind, control group cross-over study Setting: Laboratory
      Patients: Participants with chronic hemiparesis post-stroke were randomly assigned to a
      gaming group or normal activity control group.

      Interventions: Gaming systems provided an interactive interface of real-time movement of
      either themselves or an avatar on the screen. Participants played games 1 hour/day, 4
      days/week, for 5 weeks, totaling 20 hours of game-play. The intervention was strictly
      game-play without physical therapy. All games were played in standing position and trainers
      supervised to protect against loss of balance.

      Measurements: Both groups were tested prior to and following the 5 weeks (post-test) and 3
      months following the completion of the intervention/control. Outcome measures included:
      Fugl-Meyer Motor Exam, Single Leg Stance time, symmetrical weight bearing, Berg Balance
      Scale, Dynamic Gait Index, Timed Up and Go, Six Minute Walk, 3 Meter Walk, step length
      differential, and perception of recovery.
