      regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in combination with T cell
      depletion with alemtuzumab for patients with high risk hematologic malignancies will allow
      effective control of disease and improved disease free and overall survival compared with
      historical expectations. Specifically, the objectives are to estimate toxicity, disease free,
      progression free, event free and overall survival rates in patients treated with an
      alemtuzumab T cell depleted, reduced intensity preparative regimen followed by allogeneic
      hematopoietic transplantation; evaluate immune recovery following this reduced intensity
      allogeneic immunotherapy; develop an in vitro assay to allow patient individualized targeted
      dosing. The study population is HIV negative, adult patients who are not pregnant but have
      confirmed diagnosis of disease; must have Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performance
      status (PS) 0, 1, or 2; must have a 3-6/6 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor
      or 8/8 (A, B, C, DRB1, DQ are the primary determinants) or better HLA-matched unrelated donor
      who is evaluated and deemed able to provide peripheral blood stem cells (PBPCs) and/or marrow
      by the transplant team. The target population of patients is those with a high chance of
      progressive lymphoid or myelomatous diseases, progressive myeloid diseases, marrow failure
      syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders.
