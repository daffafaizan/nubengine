      occasionally resulting in vital organ dysfunction affecting heart, respiratory system ,
      gastrointestinal tract and brain. Hyperosmolar/hyperoncotic preparations (HSH/HSD) have been
      used in cardiac surgery essentially with the aim to mobilize fluid excess and improve
      postoperative cardiorespiratory function.Most studies dealing with the administration of HSD
      or HSH during and after CPB, have used protocols recommended for treatment of severe
      hypovolemia and shock, that is 4 mL/kg as a bolus, given within minutes.In animal experiments
      we have used HSD or HSH, 1 mL/kg/h to a total dose of 4 mL/kg during CPB. The use of HSH/HSD
      reduced the total fluid gain about 50 % and resulted in significantly lower content of tissue
      water in vital organs as heart and lungs. In the actual clinical trial we hypothesize that a
      continuous infusion of HSH will reduce fluid load and increase hemodynamic and respiratory
      functions monitored with the PiCCO system in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass with
      CPB.
