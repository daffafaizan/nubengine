      placebo (equiosmolar, volume-equivalent sterile water with 5% mannitol as dantrolene-IV also
      contains 5% mannitol). Study subjects will be visited daily by a study nurse to determine
      side effects, tolerability, record hemodynamic measures and laboratory values. Patients will
      have daily serum Na, osmolality, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALK) measured. In addition, daily bedside transcranial
      doppler will be performed by a blinded examiner. Patients will undergo cerebral angiograms
      per clinical routine. Angiographic measurements of arterial narrowing will be performed by a
      blinded radiologist. Specific stop criteria are pre-defined.
