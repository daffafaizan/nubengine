    
      This Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation clinical study will enroll up to 47
      subjects with previously treated PTCL including CTCL. The study is comprised of a dose
      escalation phase (Phase 1) and a preliminary assessment of efficacy (Phase 2).

      In the dose escalation phase, the starting dose will be 0.1 mg/kg administered i.v. once
      every week for four weeks, followed by a 2-week observation period in the first treatment
      course. Succeeding dose levels will include 0.3 and 1 mg/kg. During the first course of
      treatment if assessments performed at day 29 (end of week 4) indicate that a subject has
      demonstrated an overall CR, the subject may continue on study for up to an additional four
      infusions beyond CR on an every other week infusion schedule. Treatment will then be
      discontinued in order to determine duration of response. If a subject experiences a PR or SD,
      the subject may continue therapy after consultation between the investigator and the medical
      monitor on an every other week infusion schedule until disease progression occurs or other
      withdrawal criteria are met.
