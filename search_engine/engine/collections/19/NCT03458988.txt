      durable mechanical support has become widely available for end stage heart failure as
      destination therapy and as bridge to transplantation. The accurate measurement of blood
      pressure (BP) as well as the recognition and management of hypertension in patients with
      LVADs is an essential component of optimal clinical care. Hypertension is an established
      long-term risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The measurement of BP and the management of
      hypertension in patients with CF-VADs can present unique challenges. Patients with LVADs
      often do not have a palpable pulse, and therefore traditional BP measurement by auscultation
      or automated cuff is less reliable. Conventional occlusive BP measurement is able to to pick
      up signals in approximately 50% of cases due to coincidental phases of pulsatility. The
      arterial line is the gold standard, but is an invasive procedure and not practical for
      routine outpatient use.

      Although efforts are underway to identify an easier and more reliable method to measure
      ambulatory BP in these patients not one has been able to match the quality of an invasive
      arterial line.
