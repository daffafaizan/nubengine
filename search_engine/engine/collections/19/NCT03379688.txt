      little is currently known about the influence on patient-related outcome parameters. Recently
      it has already been shown that intraoperative variability of blood pressure during heart
      surgery has a postoperative effect on 30-day mortality.

      The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the effects of different hemodynamic
      measurements and management after cardiac surgery on patient-specific outcome parameters.
