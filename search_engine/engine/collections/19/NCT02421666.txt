      carcinoma (HCC) among all U.S. racial and ethnic groups. Inadequate chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
      monitoring and care are also likely to contribute to poorer outcomes and increased healthcare
      costs. The goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a Patient Navigator-led
      mobile phone text Messaging Intervention (PNMI) in improving hepatitis B follow-up care
      management for Asian Americans with chronic hepatitis B infection through a randomized
      controlled trial. The primary outcome of the study is Asian CHB patient adherence (measured
      as "having seen a doctor for CHB monitoring") to hepatitis B (HBV) monitoring guidelines at
      6-month and 12-month assessments post-intervention.

      Patient partners and stakeholders were engaged in all study stages. The findings of this
      study provided unique and promising opportunities for broadly disseminating and implementing
      the evidence-based intervention in the real-world practice, thus further preventing chronic
      liver diseases and reducing health disparities among high-risk underserved populations.
