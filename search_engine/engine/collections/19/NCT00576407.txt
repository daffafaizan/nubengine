      age of two. Complete DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by very low T cell or very low na√Øve
      T cell numbers. In this study, typical complete DiGeorge syndrome subjects underwent human
      postnatal cultured thymus tissue implantation (CTTI). Thymus tissue that would otherwise be
      discarded was processed and then implanted into complete DiGeorge subjects in the operating
      room. At the time of CTTI, a skin biopsy may have been obtained to look for any preexisting T
      cells. After CTTI, subjects were followed by routine research immune evaluations, using blood
      samples obtained approximately every 2-4 weeks. At approximately 2-3 months post-CTTI
      subjects underwent an open biopsy of the allograft. The biopsy was done under general
      anesthesia in the operating room. At the time of the graft biopsy, another skin biopsy was
      obtained to look for clonal populations of T cells.

      The protocol aims include: assessing thymopoiesis in the allograft biopsy; assessing
      immunoreconstitution of complete DiGeorge syndrome subjects after postnatal allogeneic
      cultured thymus tissue implantation; assessing minimally invasive methods of assessing
      thymopoiesis (flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); assessing pre-implant T
      cells which do not proliferate in response to mitogens (focusing on NK-T cells); and,
      assessing cultured thymus tissue implantation safety and toxicity.
