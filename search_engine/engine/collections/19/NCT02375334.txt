      I. To develop an adherence monitoring system within Epic that is functionally equivalent to
      the previously designed and validated system in the Cancer Center Oncology Research
      Information System (ORIS) for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas receiving
      concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy.

      II. To test the newly designed Epic system by comparing the frequency and timing of flags
      (laboratory date flags, visit date flags and in-patient status flags) and non-adherent days
      generated with the frequency and timing of those generated by ORIS for patients with newly
      diagnosed malignant gliomas receiving concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop both systems so that they may be easily adapted in the future to other
      therapies that require compliance monitoring.

      OUTLINE:

      Patient lab and visit dates are monitored by the Cancer Center ORIS and EPIC based systems
      during the 42 days of the concurrent temozolomide and radiation therapy.
