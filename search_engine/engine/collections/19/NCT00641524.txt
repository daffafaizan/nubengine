      (NAFLD), a common and important cause of liver disease. Phlebotomy has been used for many
      years in the treatment of disorders of iron overload such as hemochromatosis, where it is
      well tolerated and improves symptoms and survival. There is some evidence that it is also
      effective in treating NAFLD. However, previous studies have not evaluated whether phlebotomy
      improves liver biopsy findings. We will measure the severity disease in NAFLD patients prior
      to phlebotomy therapy and again at the end of treatment. This will allow us to accurately
      determine the benefit of this therapy in these patients.
