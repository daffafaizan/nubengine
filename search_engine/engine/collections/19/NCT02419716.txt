      3 years in average risk patients. Enrolled subjects will be prescribed Cologuard per approved
      labeling at baseline. Subjects with positive results will be referred to colonoscopy and
      study participation completed. Subjects with negative Cologuard results will be seen annually
      for 3 years. At year 3, subjects will repeat Cologuard, followed by colonoscopy, regardless
      of the Cologuard test outcome. Subjects who have a colonoscopy at any time during the study
      will be discontinued following collection of the colonoscopy and associated histopathology
      results.
