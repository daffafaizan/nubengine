      assess the effect of the DryMouth Shield on snoring frequency. To accomplish this we will
      compare the frequency of snores during 1) overnight polysomnography without using the
      DryMouth Shield and 2) overnight polysomnography using the DryMouth Shield. Secondary
      outcomes of the study will include: 1) compare the difference in the volume of snores without
      and with the use of the DryMouth Shield; 2) estimate the changes in apnea hypopnea index
      without and with the use of the DryMouth Shield; 3) describe symptoms of dry mouth without
      and with the use of the DryMouth Shield 4) describe symptoms of bruxism without and with the
      use of the dry mouth shield and 5) gather patient feedback about the user experience with the
      dry mouth shield.
