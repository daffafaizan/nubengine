      tracking. This method involves looking at targets on a computer screen while an eye-tracking
      system records eye movements and changes in pupil diameter in response to the presentation of
      the targets.

      Performance on the eye tracking measures will be evaluated to identify potential effects of
      neural injury on cognitive performance. Data from individuals with and without a history of
      brain injury will be used to standardize the eye tracking measure.

      Participants will also complete a short interview and several self report measures, including
      information about demographic characteristics, medical history, and psychological symptoms,
      along with a series of neuropsychological/cognitive measures that are already well
      established. Performance on eye tracking measures will then be compared to performance on
      these conventional cognitive tests to allow comparison of the different measures.

      All participants will complete one visit to the laboratory at USUHS in Bethesda, MD. This
      visit will take approximately 2.5 hours. Participants without a history of TBI may be asked
      to return for a 30 minute follow-up session in order to measure the reliability of the eye
      tracking system. Participants with a history of TBI will complete a 10 minute telephone
      follow-up 6 and 12 months after their visit.

      Compensation is available for civilians who are not employed by the Federal government.
