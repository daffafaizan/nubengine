      over time. A person's own fat may be used to improve the appearance of the body by moving it
      from an area where it is less needed. This is called fat grafting, and it is a common
      procedure, performed approximately 65,000 times by plastic surgeons in the United State last
      year. The fat is usually taken from the thighs or abdomen with a small liposuction tube and
      then moved to an area that has lost volume or fullness due to aging, trauma, surgery, birth
      defects, or other causes. Typically, the transferred fat results in an increase in volume of
      the body site being treated.

      Fat grafting is a minimally invasive surgical procedure in which a person's own fat may be
      used to improve the appearance of the body by moving it from an area where it is less needed.
      The fat is usually taken from the thighs or abdomen with a small liposuction tube and then
      moved to an area that has lost shape or fullness due to injury. This procedure is performed
      through very small incisions that allow a hollow tube to pass through.

      Fat grafting is a common cosmetic and reconstructive procedure. It was performed
      approximately 65,000 times by plastic surgeons in the United States last year. Typically, the
      transferred fat results in an increase in volume and shape of the body site being treated.
      The investigators believe this clinical technique of fat grafting could be of significant
      benefit to patients with facial injuries. The fat grafting procedure being performed in this
      trial is considered to be research, but not an experimental procedure.
