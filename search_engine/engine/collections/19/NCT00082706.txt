      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients with metastatic or
           unresectable adenocarcinoma of the urothelium or urachal remnant treated with
           fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, gemcitabine, and cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to diagnosis (adenocarcinoma of the urothelium vs
      adenocarcinoma of the urachal remnant).

      Patients receive fluorouracil by vein (IV) continuously, leucovorin calcium IV once daily,
      and cisplatin IV once daily on days 1-5 and gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 5. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3-6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-46 patients (7-18 with adenocarcinoma of the urachal remnant
      and 16-28 with adenocarcinoma of the urothelium) will be accrued for this study.
