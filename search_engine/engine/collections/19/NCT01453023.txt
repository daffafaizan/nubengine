    
      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      pharmacodynamics of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25mcg administered using the
      novel dry powder inhaler in children aged 5 to 11 years with persistent asthma. Fluticasone
      furoate (FF, GW685698) is a novel once daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and vilanterol (VI,
      GW642444) is an inhaled once daily long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA). FF/VI is a novel
      ICS/LABA combination with once-daily dosing being developed for the treatment of asthma in
      adults, adolescents, and children of 5 years and above.

      This study will be a randomized, double-blind, repeat dose, two period crossover study, with
      FF as the control. During each of two treatment periods subjects will receive either FF/VI
      100/25 micrograms (mcg) or FF 100 mcg daily on 14 consecutive mornings via the novel dry
      powder inhaler. Approximately 26 subjects will be recruited into this study, with a target of
      20 completed subjects. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and glucose , potassium and
      cortisol levels will be investigated.
