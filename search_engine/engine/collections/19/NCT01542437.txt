      million deaths in 2012. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histology comprises ap-proximately
      85% of cases. At the time of diagnosis, 75% of the patients have locally advanced or
      metastatic disease, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Although treatment options
      for these patients remain limited, drugs targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) have proved to be a highly effective therapy in NSCLC patients harboring sensitizing
      EGFR mutations.

      Afatinib, a second-generation irreversible TKI, confers a theoretical advantage over
      re-versible TKIs in patients with acquired resistance. Through covalent binding to the kinase
      domain of EGFR, afatinib down regulates signaling from all homodimers and heter-odimers
      formed by ERBB receptor family members including EGFR, HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4
      (ErbB4). HER2 mutations in NSCLC are rare, being found in approximately 1-4% of lung
      adenocarcinomas.

      In contrast with reversible TKIs, the mechanisms of resistance to irreversible TKIs have not
      been fully elucidated, and identification of biomarkers that predict response to these drugs,
      particularly in patients progressing after first line therapy, is needed. In this study we
      assess the usefulness of plasma HGF concentrations as a predictor of response to afatinib in
      patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.
