      myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation to prevent ovarian dysfunction in
      post-menarchal women.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of GnRH agonists on the incidence of ovarian
      failure.

      The secondary objectives are

        -  to determine how effective GnRH agonists are at suppressing menses during

        -  to determine the incidence and timing of resumption of menstrual cycles after HCT

        -  to determine the incidence and timing of resumption of normal FSH and LH levels after
           HCT

        -  to determine the incidence of normal AMH levels after HCT

        -  to determine the effect of GnRH agonists on immune reconstitution after HCT

        -  to assess the safety and tolerability of GnRH agonists in the context of HCT

      A total of 47 patients will be accrued in this study.
