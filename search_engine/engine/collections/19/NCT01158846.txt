      In the setting of STEMI, adjunctive pharmacological therapy plays a key role in the acute
      management. Along with the clear benefit of mechanical reperfusion strategies, several drugs
      showed to be beneficial. On top of clopidogrel, heparins and IIB/IIIa glycoprotein, other
      drugs have been recently introduced showing encouraging results. These "new" drugs, namely
      prasugrel and bivalirudin, have only been compared separately.

      Primary hypothesis: the combination of prasugrel/bivalirudin is superior to the combination
      of clopidogrel and heparin/abciximab in terms of net adverse clinical events, i.e. ischemic
      events plus hemorrhagic events

      Setting:

      - patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary PCI

      Mechanical reperfusion:

      -primary percutaneous coronary intervention

      Pharmacological Interventions:

      - Two arms: Clopidogrel plus heparin/abciximab vs Prasugrel plus Bivalirudin

      Follow up:

      - 1 year

      Measurements:

        -  efficacy end points in terms of reduction of ischemic events

        -  safety end points in terms of reduction of bleeding events
