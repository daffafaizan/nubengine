      assess the thyroid blood flow. Previous studies showed specific changes of thyroid blood flow
      in hyperthyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid nodules when investigated by CFDS.
      Subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are common laboratory findings, defined by
      normal thyroid hormones concentrations along with ,respectively,decreased or increase Thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH) level. We purpose to investigate thyroid vascularity by CFDS in
      patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism and compared them with euthyroid
      patients.
