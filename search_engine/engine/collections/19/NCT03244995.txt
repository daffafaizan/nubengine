      I. Examine the feasibility of the couple-based mind-body (CBMB) program in patients with high
      grade glioma (HGG) and their partners.

      II. Establish the initial efficacy of the CBMB program in patients and their partners
      regarding spiritual (primary), psychological and physical quality of life (QOL) (secondary)
      outcomes relative to a waitlist control (WLC) group.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore potential mediation (i.e., mindfulness, compassion, holding back, and intimacy)
      and moderation (e.g., baseline medical, demographic and psychosocial factors) effects of the
      intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (CBMB PROGRAM): Patients undergo CBMB program consisting of 4-5 deep-breathing and
      meditation exercise sessions over 60 minutes and 2 weekly telephone calls over 15 minutes for
      6 weeks. Patients also complete questionnaires regarding health, mood, sleeping habits,
      relationship, health care, work productivity, and quality of life.

      GROUP II (WAITLIST CONTROL): Patients complete questionnaires as in Group I. Patients may
      undergo CBMB program after completion of study.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.
