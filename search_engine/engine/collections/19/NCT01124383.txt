      two decades and became a standard surgical treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding
      unresponsive to medical management. Despite its increasing use, little information is known
      on the predictors of its potential complications. The absorption of glycine has been reported
      as the most common complication of this procedure and it remains an unpredictable
      complication that may lead to life-threatening conditions.

      This randomized controlled trial is conducted in two centers: a tertiary care center and in a
      community hospital over a period of 18 months. This study aimed to compare two types of
      anesthesia on the absorption of glycine in operative hysteroscopy. Eligible patients
      undergoing operative hysteroscopy for abnormal uterine bleeding are randomized in two groups:
      group general anesthesia and group local anesthesia with sedation.
