      disturbance, cognitive disorder and other physical symptoms that negatively affect physical
      and sensory functions and impair quality of life. [1]

      Fibromyalgia is seen in the society at 2-4%, and the ratio of women to men is 9:1. It is seen
      most often between the ages of 45 and 60. Neuroendocrine deviations arise with the
      contribution of central sensitization and / or peripheral pain mechanisms as a result of
      environmentally related physiological and psychological stresses of people with genetic
      predisposition.[2]

      The depletion of biogenic amines in the central nervous system is blamed on the basis of
      major symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, muscle fatigue, sleep disturbance, and comorbid
      chronic depression, anxiety, migraine, which are clinically observed in fibromyalgia.
      Decreased levels of aminergic neurotransmitters is detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of
      fibromyalgia patients, especially serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine.[3]

      Studies have found that different exercise programs have positive effects on pain and
      functionality in fibromyalgia cases, and no side effects of these exercise programs have been
      observed. Aerobic exercise training is one of the most studied exercise modalities in
      fibromyalgia patients.[4]

      However, an increase in post-exercise pain was also found in patients with fibromyalgia due
      to a decrease in muscle blood flow, defect in muscle contraction physiology and a change in
      post-exercise pain modulation. In addition, it has been reported that the hormone response
      given to the exercise is impaired. All of these disorders can decrease patients' compliance
      to exercise.[5]

      Exercise with blood flow restriction - Blood Flow Restriction Training (BFRT) - is an
      increasingly popular exercise modality that creates a physiological effect equivalent to a
      high exercise intensity when exercising at low exercise intensities. In current studies,
      although a similar response to high-intensity aerobic exercise was obtained by performing
      low-intensity blood flow-restricted aerobic exercise training in other patient groups, a
      recommendation regarding the use of BFRT in a specific disease such as fibromyalgia is
      lacking.[6]

      In our study, we aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of low-intensity aerobic exercise
      training with blood flow restriction and without blood flow restriction, on pain, functional
      status, quality of life and catecholamine and melatonin metabolite levels in 24-hour urine in
      adults with Fibromyalgia.
