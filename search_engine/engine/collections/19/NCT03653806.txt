      The investigators routinely apply EIT (Pulmovista, Dräger, Lübeck. Germany) in mechanically
      ventilated patients to optimize the ventilator settings .

      An algorithm will be developed by the Institute of Technical Medicine, Furtwangen University,
      Germany. The algorithm will automatically detect changes in both PEEP and inspiratory
      pressures. For each PEEP step and/or changes in inspiratory pressure the difference in
      regional alveolar overdistension and alveolar collapse will be calculated. This makes it
      possible to select the optimal ventilator setting depending on the best compromise between
      alveolar overdistension and alveolar collapse.

      The algorithm will be tested in 40 EIT guided mechanically ventilated patients. EIT
      measurements will be performed during an incremental and decremental PEEP trial. The EIT
      measurement will be performed in the same way as during standard clinical care. EIT data will
      be analysed offline by a ventilation practitioner with experience in EIT and with the newly
      developed algorithm. The resulting advice on optimal ventilator settings will be compared for
      inter-observer variability.
