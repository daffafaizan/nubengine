      Stimulation (tES) for 7-day treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to transcranial
      alternating current stimulation (tACS) group, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      group or sham-control group. Active tES comprised 20 min sessions of 1.5 mA peak-to-peak
      current delivered over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, for 7 consecutive days. Sham group
      was administered similarly, but with current turned off after 30s. Apart from studying the
      effects of tES on physiology signals, subjective scale assessments and behavioral data are
      performed before and after the treatment.
