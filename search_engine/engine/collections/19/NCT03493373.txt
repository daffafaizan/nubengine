      receive either exercise and neural mobilization (n=13) or exercise only (n=13).

      Data on pain intensity (a vertical numeric rating scale) and location (body chart),
      depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), balance, hand grip strength, timed up and go and
      gait velocity will be collected at baseline, end of treatment and at 3 months follow up.

      Statistical analysis will be performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.
