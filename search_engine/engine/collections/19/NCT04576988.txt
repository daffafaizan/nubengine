      Organization functional class II or III), including those with idiopathic or heritable PAH,
      PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD), drug or toxin induced, post-shunt
      correction PAH, or PAH presenting 1 year following the correction of congenital heart defects
      (CHDs), and currently on background PAH therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study
      is exercise capacity, as measured by the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) measured at 24 week
      following initiation of treatment. The key secondary endpoint is a novel, multicomponent
      improvement endpoint measured by the proportion of participants achieving all of the
      following at Week 24 relative to baseline:

        -  Improvement in 6MWD (increase ≥ 30 m)

        -  Improvement in NT-proBNP (decrease in NT-proBNP ≥ 30%) or maintenance/achievement of
           NT-proBNP level < 300 ng/L

        -  Improvement in WHO FC or maintenance of WHO FC II Approximately 284 participants will be
           enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either sotatercept or placebo on the background
           of stable standard-of-care PAH mediation. Study duration will be approximately 2 years A
           stratified Wilcoxon test will be used for analysis of the primary endpoint, with
           appropriate imputation for missing data, as detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
           An unblinded, external, independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor
           participant safety throughout the course of the study. Participants completing this
           study will be eligible to receive sotatercept in a separate, open-label extension study.
