      intubation in United States. The causes of adults' tracheal stenosis include trauma, chronic
      inflammatory diseases, benign neoplasm, malignant neoplasm and collagen vascular diseases.
      The most common cause of tracheal stenosis continues to be trauma, which can be internal
      (prolonged endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, flame, burn injury) or external (neck
      trauma). Approximately 90% of chronic subglottic stenosis in children and adults results from
      endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy and about 10% results from other causes.

      The resection anastomosis is the most effective treatment to cure this condition. The other
      treatments are mechanical dilation (dilators, rigid bronchoscopes), stents, laser co2, diode,
      and cold knife. But they are not as effective as resection anastomosis. Rigid bronchoscopes
      or dilators may shear the mucosa leading to further damage. Resection of all damaged segments
      of the airway, approximation and anastomosis of the two intact ends by means of fine
      synthetic absorbable sutures with minimum tension. Steroids with anti-inflammatory effect
      widely use as first line therapy for this condition.

      Patients who underwent resection anastomosis during 2014-2016 for treatment of
      post-intubation tracheal stenosis will be included in this study. Systemic prednisolone will
      be used for treatment and prevention of recurrent tracheal stenosis in post-operative
      patients. Post-operative patients will divide in two groups, one of them will receive
      prednisolone and the other will receive placebo for 30 days. The results will be compared by
      bronchoscopy (FOB or rigid) after 30 days.
