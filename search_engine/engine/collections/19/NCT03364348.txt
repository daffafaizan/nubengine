    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the recommended dose (RP2D) of
      utomilumab in combination with ado-rastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) or trastuzumab in subjects
      with HER2 positive advanced breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective tumor response (ORR)

        -  Determine the time to tumor response (TTR)

        -  Determine the duration of response (DR)

        -  Determine progression free survival (PFS)

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of utomilumab in combination with ado-trastuzumab
           emtansine or trastuzumab

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 cohorts.

      COHORT 1: Dose 1: Utomilumab 20 mg IV + ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) 3.6 mg/kg IV every
      3 weeks. Dose 2: Dose Level 2 - Utomilumab 100 mg IV + ado-trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg IV
      every 3 weeks

      COHORT 2: Dose 1: Utomilumab 20 mg IV + trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks. Dose Level 2 -
      Utomilumab 100 mg IV + trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks.
