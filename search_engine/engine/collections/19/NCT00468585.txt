    
      A. Primary Objectives:

      â€¢ To estimate the efficacy of every other week capecitabine and bevacizumab in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer in terms of overall response rate (complete response (CR) + partial
      response (PR)) when administered at the MTD of capecitabine determined by the phase I portion
      of this trial.

      B. Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate secondary efficacy endpoints of this combination including clinical benefit
           (CR+PR+SD > 6 months), time to tumor progression (TTP), progression free survival (TTP)
           and duration of response.

        -  To evaluate toxicity rates associated with this capecitabine schedule in combination
           with bevacizumab using the NCI CTC (version 3) and the Hand-Foot Syndrome Grading Scale
           developed by Roche Laboratories, Inc.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacogenetics of capecitabine in breast cancer patients by assessing
           the impact of specific candidate SNPs on toxicity and/or response.
