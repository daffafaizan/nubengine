      study. The module consists of 3 topics of nutrition (my meal plate, fruits and vegetables,
      healthy snacks). Each topic consists of 4 activities engaging children and teachers. A total
      of 12 activities will be delivered on 4 consecutive school day every week.

      The teacher will deliver the nutrition education which trained prior to the study.
