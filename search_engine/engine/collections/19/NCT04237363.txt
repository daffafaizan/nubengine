      setting that makes stepping movements easier to perform, may capitalize on the adaptability
      of the neuromuscular system and enhance locomotor function in persons with cSCI who have not
      undergone eSCS. In our study, a combined aquatics- and land-based approach to gait training
      was employed over a 12-month period that featured underwater treadmill training and
      supplemental overground walk training.
