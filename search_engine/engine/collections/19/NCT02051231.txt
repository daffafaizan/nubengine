      myometrial desensitization using pregnant human myometrium and an isometric tension recording
      device. The investigators propose to use this model in order to characterize the time course
      of recovery of oxytocin-desensitized myometrium to oxytocin sensitivity. These results will
      help in establishing whether myometrial recovery can occur within a clinically relevant time
      period, how much sensitivity is recovered, and the duration required.

      In the clinical setting of failed labour augmentation and OTR desensitization, it is not
      known if it is beneficial to wait a certain period of time after discontinuing intravenous
      oxytocin before proceeding to Cesarean section to allow for resensitization of the myometrium
      to oxytocin. The results of this study will provide insight into the time course of recovery
      of the myometrium using an in vitro model of failed labour augmentation. Based on the
      oxytocin dose-response curves after variable periods of time of "rest", the investigators
      will be able to determine the degree of recovery of myometrial contractility over time and
      whether this will occur in a clinically relevant time period for implementation into clinical
      practice.
