    
      Approximately 20 subjects in total will be randomized with 1:1 ratio to the high dose of
      Aralast NP infusion therapy plus antiviral and standard of care versus antiviral therapy and
      standard of care.

      Each subject will participate in the study for 24 days and have one safety follow-up phone
      call at 30 days. Active treatment will last 17 days, subject will be dosed on Days 1, 3, 5,
      7, 9 and have a final booster infusion on Day 17. If the subject is discharged from hospital,
      any remaining infusions and assessments will be conducted via outpatient clinic visit or home
      health visit. Subjects will have an in-person visit (hospital or clinic) on Day 24 for a CT
      scan and follow-up assessment.

      Efficacy will be evaluated by measuring the duration of new non-invasive ventilation or high
      flow oxygen used. Additional endpoints include clinical status, cytokine levels, oxygen
      requirements, SOFA scores, risk of coagulopathy, need for Vasopressors, mortality during the
      treatment period, PK samples, average days spent in the hospital/ICU, and number of days
      without a fever.
