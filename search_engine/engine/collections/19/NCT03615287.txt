    
      The aim of this study is to compare medical and surgery treatment in IBD patients and healthy
      controls, by assessing the endothelial and cardiac function and the inflammation status.

      In particular, three subject groups will be enrolled, as follows:

      40 patients [Crohn's disease (CD) & ulcerative colitis (UC)] who will undergo medical
      treatment (Group A), 40 patients (CD & UC) who will undergo surgery (Group B) and a healthy
      control group (Group C) comprising 40 subjects.

      Assessment of the inflammation load (CRP, WBC, IL-6, TNFa), the endothelial function (FMD,
      PWV, cIMT, endothelial glycocalyx) and the cardiac function - via echocardiographic
      parameters (systolic and diastolic echo values, tissue doppler imaging-GLS-strain rate) -
      will be carried out for every subject group in two phases: prior to treatment and four months
      after the treatment, as applicable.

      The objective is to investigate whether there is a statistically significant reduction of
      endothelial and cardiac dysfunction following medical and surgery treatment in IBD patients
      as well as to examine associations across the three groups.
