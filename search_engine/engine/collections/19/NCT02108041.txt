      Using a virtual clinical interaction experiment, we aim to better understand physicians
      decision-making processes and to explore their communication behaviors toward patients in the
      clinical encounter. Physician participants will enter a virtual exam room where they will be
      asked to respond to a virtual patient, acting as her primary care physician in a follow-up
      visit to evaluate her for depression. Various aspects of physician communication in the
      virtual clinic and self-report measures related to decision-making will be analyzed.
