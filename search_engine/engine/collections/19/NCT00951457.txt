    
      This is a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase I/II study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of bendamustine combined with alemtuzumab in patients with pretreated
      CD20-positive CLL (according to the revised NCI/ IWCLL criteria).

      Eligible patients will receive bendamustine as 4 courses of 70 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 every 28
      days and 30 mg alemtuzumab s.c. continuously on days 1, 3 and 5 of every week, for a maximum
      of 16 weeks. Safety assessments will be conducted weekly; efficacy assessments including
      imaging will be performed at months 2, 4, 6, 10 and 16. Bone marrow biopsies will be
      performed upon CR (according to the 2008 IWCLL response criteria) or fixed at 6 and 16
      months.

      Following recruitment of the first 3 and 7 patients safety evaluations will be performed by a
      data safety monitoring board. An interim analysis for response and safety as well as maximum
      tolerated dose levels will occur after the first 7 patients have completed treatment (Gehan
      timepoint). If the treatment is deemed clinically safe a further 13 patients will be
      enrolled.
