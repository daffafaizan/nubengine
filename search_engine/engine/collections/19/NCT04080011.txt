      for elective surgical incisions. Patients will be screened for inclusion criteria and asked
      to consent to participate in the study for single application treatment with the NP-PWD for
      3-6 days. Initial evaluation of the incision would occur on Day 0, including screening,
      pre-procedure evaluation, measurement and photography of the closed surgical incision. Follow
      up data is then gathered Day 3-6 with removal of the NP-PWD, surgical incision assessment and
      photography, and assessment for adverse effects. Day 9-14 follow up include the same
      assessments of progression of wound closure. Gathered clinical data of the 10 subjects will
      be used to evaluate the safety in using the NPWT device for effective wound healing.
