      pathology in sickle cell disease (SCD). When this sickling occurs in the renal
      microvasculature, and is compounded by chronic vasculopathy related to hemolysis, the result
      is local infarction, ischemic injury, and interstitial fibrosis. The kidney damage begins in
      early childhood and is cumulative over time, resulting in sickle cell nephropathy (SCN).
      Creatinine clearance remains the most commonly used method to evaluate renal function in SCD
      patients although serum creatinine generally over-estimates the GFR in SCD. Cystatin-C
      (Cys-C) is freely filtered. Unlike creatinine, it is not secreted by the tubules. Its serum
      levels correlate with GFR in adults with various kidney diseases as well as in pediatric and
      adult SCD populations as compared with creatinine-based assessments.

      This study seeks to evaluate whether Cys-C is a better noninvasive measure of renal function
      in the adult sickle cell population than creatinine. Further, this work will elucidate the
      ability of other markers, including beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) and endothelin-1 (ET-1),
      to predict sickle nephropathy. Finally, renal imaging by MRI will be performed and correlated
      with measured GFR and renal function markers. The results of this study could help alter
      clinical practice and thereby ensure the most accurate non-invasive assessment of kidney
      function by substantiating the role of Cys-C, beta 2M and ET-1 in adults with SCD. Finally,
      the descriptive analysis including measured GFR with renal MRI, novel biomarkers, markers of
      hemolysis, and analysis of urinary protein secretion will contribute to a better
      understanding of the pathophysiology of SCN.
