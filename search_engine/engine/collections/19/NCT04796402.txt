      Clinics to standard of care on the incidence of hospitalization for high-risk patients
      infected with SARS-CoV2. Furthermore, we aim to test the effect on the following secondary
      outcomes: mortality and health-related quality of life and patients' satisfaction with care.
      We will also assess the recruitment rate from the three primary strategies for rapid
      identification and consent of eligible patients. The data from this study will inform
      clinical decisions about the use of bamlanivimab in high risk COVID-19 patients and the
      operational requirements necessary for research in passive immunity therapeutics.
