    
      This study is a prospective, single-center Phase II trial of Neumega (rhIL-11) in women with
      type 1 VWD and menorrhagia refractory to estrogen, hormones, or hemostatic agents. It is
      anticipated that 10 subjects who meet eligibility criteria will enroll and complete this
      study. All aspects of this study, including the rhIL-11 injections and the screening,
      hemostatic and safety monitoring, and coagulation testing, are considered experimental. The
      specific objectives are to determine the efficacy and safety of rhIL-11 in reducing menstrual
      blood loss in adult women with type 1 VWD during six consecutive menstrual cycles, and to
      determine the mechanism of the hemostatic response of rhIL-11.
