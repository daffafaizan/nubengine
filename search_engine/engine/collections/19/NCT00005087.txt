        -  Determine the median, one-year, and long-term (defined as two-year) disease-free
           survival and overall survival in patients with previously irradiated locally recurrent
           squamous cell cancer of the head and neck treated with paclitaxel, cisplatin, and
           filgrastim (G-CSF) combined with radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the rates of acute and late toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pattern of disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy twice daily (4-6 hours apart) on days 1-5. Patients
      receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour beginning immediately after completion of the first
      fraction of radiotherapy and completing less than 3 hours before starting the second fraction
      of radiotherapy on days 1-5. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes beginning
      immediately after completion of paclitaxel infusion on days 1-5 and filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously on days 6-13. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who initially respond to therapy but
      develop a recurrence with a resectable lesion (inside or outside the retreatment field) may
      undergo surgical resection.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, every 3 months for 2
      years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 34 months.
