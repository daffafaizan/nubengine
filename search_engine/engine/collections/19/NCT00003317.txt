      stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer who are treated by postoperative chemotherapy with or
      without adjuvant radiotherapy. II. Compare failure free survival of these patients. III.
      Describe the patterns of local and distant recurrence in these patients. IV. Determine the
      toxicities associated with chemotherapy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Four to eight weeks after surgery, all
      patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days
      1, 22, 43, and 64. Following completion of four courses of chemotherapy, patients are
      randomized into one of two treatment arms.
