      therapy in PID and to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of Octagam 10% with that of the
      previously used Octagam 5%.

      The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy of Octagam 10% in replacement therapy
      in PID by monitoring the rate of occurence of serious bacterial infections, the rate of other
      infections, the trough (pre-next-dose) levels of total serum IgG and IgG subclasses (IgG1,
      IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4), the trough (pre-next-dose) levels of selected antigen specific
      antibodies, the use of antibiotics, the rate of absence from school/ work, and the number of
      days in hospital.
