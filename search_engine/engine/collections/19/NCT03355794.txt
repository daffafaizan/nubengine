      of ribociclib and everolimus which can be safely administered during maintenance therapy for
      up to 24 courses following completion of radiation therapy with newly diagnosed non-biopsied
      DIPG and RB+ biopsied DIPG and HGG, 2) characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile of
      ribociclib and everolimus as combination maintenance therapy following completion of
      radiation therapy with newly diagnosed non-biopsied DIPG and RB+ biopsied DIPG and HGG.

      Patients with RB+ tumors and non-biopsied DIPG will receive standard radiation therapy prior
      to enrollment followed by ribociclib and everolimus as maintenance therapy. Upon completion
      of radiation therapy, a 2 - 4 week break will occur and then ribociclib will be given orally
      daily for 21 days followed by a 7 day break every 28 days at 70% of the adult RP2D (300 mg)
      in combination with everolimus at 80% of the adult RP2D (2.5 mg) given orally once daily
      continuously for up to 24 courses. One course is equivalent to 28 days. Due to dosing
      concerns with the limited dosing capsules (50 mg and 200 mg are only available), dose
      escalations will have BSA restrictions to accommodate for variations from target doses and
      BSA adjusted actual dose. Two intra-patient dose-de-escalations will be allowed if dose
      limiting toxicities arise and may continue study treatment for up to 24 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
