      after it has been placed in the eye. Glistenings are seen in all lenses but certain lenses
      develop a higher number of glistenings than others. The effect of glistenings on patients'
      visual functioning is largely unknown.

      The occurrence of glistenings is in part related to the manufacturing technique. In 2013,
      manufacturers have claimed that recent improvements in manufacturing process have reduced the
      occurrence of glistenings. There is a lack of independent evaluation of this claim. We would
      like to assess independently: 1) How frequently do glistenings occur in patients implanted
      with the 2015 generation lenses? 2) Is there a difference in glistening occurrence between
      lenses manufactured by Alcon and Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) - the two largest companies in
      eye care products?

      Two-hundred and seventy-six patients will be randomly assigned to receive Alcon or AMO lenses
      for their cataract surgery at the Kensington Eye Institute (KEI). After surgery, patients
      will be instructed to return for follow-up visits at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and 18
      months to assess for the occurrence of glistenings. If glistenings are observed at an earlier
      follow-up visit (e.g., the 6 month visit), patients will still be instructed to come for
      future visits so that changes in the glistenings over time can be observed.

      Project Time-line:

      Months 1-8: Participants recruiting, surgical operations, follow-up visits. Months 9-24:
      follow-up visits, data entry, cleaning and analysis, early results presentation, manuscript
      preparation and final report.
