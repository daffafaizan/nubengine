    
      This study is observational-analytical and cross-sectional, because the same patient will
      receive both the diagnostic iter.

      For the rules of Evidence-based Medicine (Brown et al., 2006), the definition of this study
      PICO is:

      P (population)= all the patients with suspected FAI afferent to Orthopaedic-Traumatology and
      Prosthetic surgery and revisions of hip and knee implants

      I (intervention)= enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for C-terminal telopeptide of
      type II collagen (CTXII) in serum and urine

      C (comparison)= intra-articular lidocaine injection

      O (outcome)= sensibility/specificity of ELISA test

      From a literature analysis the C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen (CTXII) seem to be
      the best candidate for this kind of comparison. Some previous studies (Scarpellini et al,
      2008) demonstrated that this marker could be used in this way, and, for this reason, the aim
      of this study is to investigate the sensibility and specificity of this marker in serum and
      urine, vs the actual diagnostic gold standard (anesthetic intra-articular injection).

      If the marker will be equal or better than the actual gold standard, the clinical practice
      will have an improvement, because this kind of analysis is simply performing and less
      invasive for the patient.

      The study will enroll 20 patients with suspected FAI between 18-45 years and of both the
      gender.
