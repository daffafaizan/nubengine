      1- Development and development of the network: the conception of the social network is based
      on the point of view of the caregivers, which is one of the originalities of this project.
      Current social networks are very "medico-centric" And often poorly adapted to the needs of
      caregivers of patients suffering from pathologies mental disorders. This step is based on a
      qualitative approach to these caregivers. Focus groups (5 focus of 5 carers) will be led by a
      psychologist in order to understand their experience and identify the resulting needs in
      order to determine the architecture and services offered on the network social. From emerging
      needs, a study based on Delphi method will be conducted with professionals from different
      disciplines psychiatry, public health, communication and information professionals,
      ethicists, health economists and sociologists) to provide a light on the professional
      responses that can be proposed to the needs of carers. The development of the social network
      will be done in close collaboration with a caregiver who will be in charge of the animation
      and moderation of the network 2. Implementation of the randomized trial comparing two groups
      of caregivers (access to the social network vs. lack of access to the social network) over a
      period of 6 month. The same scales will be filled by both groups at T0 and then at 6 months.

      3. Qualitative approach to network perception: semidirective interviews made by a
      psychologist to a panel of caregivers using the network at course of 6 months
