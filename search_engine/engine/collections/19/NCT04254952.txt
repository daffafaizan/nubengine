      and to assess unexplained respiratory symptoms and symptoms of hyperventilation syndrome.
      Determining whether Turkish version of Nijmegen Questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool in
      asthmatic individuals will guide researchers for further studies on identifying appropriate
      treatment approaches for the patient and developing different treatment strategies.
      Hyperventilation syndrome is a recognized form of respiratory dysfunction associated with
      biochemical factors. Hyperventilation syndrome is defined as breathing above the body's
      metabolic requirements. This results in decreased carbon dioxide pressure in the arterial
      blood, respiratory alkalosis, and increased symptoms. Complex symptoms such as shortness of
      breath, chest tightness, paresthesia, anxiety, and dizziness may occur. There is no
      laboratory test which is the gold standard in the diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome. If
      it is concluded that the Turkish version of the Nijmegen Questionnaire is a valid and
      reliable test in individuals with asthma, a new tool will be introduced to the literature for
      the evaluation of pulmonary dysfunction in asthmatic individuals.
