      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to Otezla plus Enstilar foam or Otezla plus vehicle foam and
      all adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded.

      Subjects will attend a screening visit/baseline visit and those with plaque-type psoriasis
      who have been started on commercial Otezla in the last 7 days will be randomized to study
      treatment as outlined above.

      Enstilar or the vehicle will be initiated for the first 4 weeks and then Otezla will be
      continued as monotherapy for the next 8 weeks. Enstilar or the vehicle will be reinitiated
      for the last 4 weeks of the study. Total study period is 16 weeks and study visits will occur
      as follows: screening/baseline, week 1, 2, 3, 4, week 12, and week 16. Study assessments at
      each visit will be PASI, BSA, PGA, Itch VAS, DLQI, and standard medical assessments. There
