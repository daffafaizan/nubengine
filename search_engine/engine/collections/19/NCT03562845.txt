      patients lose their kidney due to rejection, or rejection mechanisms are involved elsewhere.
      One of the presumed key factors that may deliver such bad outcomes is the difficulties to
      personalise immunosuppressive treatment; a medical need that currently relies on
      immunosuppressive levels for some medications (pharmacokinetics), clinical guideline
      recommendations, adverse events profiles and some expensive biomarkers which are not widely
      used. ImmunobiogramÂ® (IMBG) is a tool that evaluates the sensitivity/resistance profile of
      patients to each of the most widely used and representative immunosuppressant drugs (IM).
      Thus, IMBG offers information that could become pivotal in clinical management of renal
      transplanted patients, if its potential benefits are proven. In this clinical study, a
      technology validation will be performed in which the robustness of the bioassay will be
      evaluated; and a correlation between the current clinical prognoses of each patient and
      resistance patterns will be explored.
