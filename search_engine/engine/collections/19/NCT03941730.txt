      I. To assess the anti-tumor activity of estradiol in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that expresses ERbeta (> 25% moderate or
      strong nuclear staining) and who have prior receipt of taxane and anthracycline based
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the safety profile of estradiol when administered at a dose of 2 mg three times
      daily (tid) to women with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC that expresses ERbeta.

      II. To examine the changes in phosphorylated (phospho)-ERbeta, cystatins 1, 2, 4 and 5,
      phospho-Smad2/3 and Ki-67 in tumor biopsies taken before and after the first cycle of
      treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine changes in plasma estradiol, serum cytokine and cystatin levels before/after 1
      cycle of estradiol.

      II. Analyze the global gene expression profiles of paired biopsies prior to and following 1
      cycle of therapy.

      III. To develop patient derived xenografts (PDX) that are ERalpha negative, HER2 negative and
      ERbeta positive (Mayo only).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive estradiol orally (PO) TID for days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 5 years from study
      registration.
