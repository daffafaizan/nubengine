    
      SAINT is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups that evaluates
      the efficacy of ivermectin in reducing nasal viral carriage at seven days after treatment in
      SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who are at low risk of progression to severe disease. The trial
      is currently planned at a single center in Navarra.

      Participants will be randomized to receive a single dose of 400 mcg/kg ivermectin or a
      placebo. The randomization code will be generated by the trial statistician using blocks that
      ensure balance between the groups.

      The allocation will be made by the investigator after obtaining informed consent, and
      confirmation of fulfillment of all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. The
      investigational product will be administered by a researcher not involved in patient care or
      participant follow up.

      Participants will remain in the trial for a period of 28 days.

      In the interests of public health and containing transmission of infection, trial visits will
      be conducted in the participant's home by a clinical trial team comprising nursing and
      medical members.

      Subsequent visits will be to assess clinical and laboratory parameters.

      A final study visit will be made for participants who withdraw prematurely from the study or
      are withdrawn by the investigator.
