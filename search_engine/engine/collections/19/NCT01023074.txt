      National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR). First, a neurologist will
      review the subject's medical history and perform a neurologic exam to confirm MS diagnosis.
      Second, peripheral auditory function will be evaluated using a standard set of routine
      audiometric tests. Additionally, subjects will complete a case history and series of hearing
      handicap inventories. Third, a battery of behavioral procedures will be used to characterize
      central auditory processing. Fourth, auditory evoked potential studies will be performed.
      Emphasis here will be upon evoked potentials whose putative neural generators lie within the
      central auditory nervous system. Fifth, subjects will receive magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) evaluation to determine sites and amount of neural degeneration.
