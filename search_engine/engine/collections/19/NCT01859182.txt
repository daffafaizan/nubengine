    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]),
      as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, in
      patients with refractory advanced biliary cancers receiving the combination of AZD6244
      hydrogen sulfate (selumetinib) and MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK-2206).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall and progression-free survival in patients with refractory
      advanced biliary cancer receiving MK-2206 and AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events and tolerability of AZD6244
      hydrogen sulfate + MK-2206 in patients with advanced refractory biliary cancer receiving this
      regimen.

      III. To evaluate the effects of AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate plus MK-2206 on the inflammatory
      cytokine and immune cell profiles as well as on cancer cachexia.

      IV. To determine the presence of genetic mutations of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
      (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway
      genes (other than v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [BRAF] V600E) relevant to
      biliary cancer and how these correlate with and may predict objective response to treatment
      with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206.

      V. To assess and validate target inhibition in patients with refractory advanced biliary
      cancer receiving the combination of MK-2206 plus AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.

      VI. To determine the pharmacogenetic profile as a way of assessing inter-individual
      variability as well as how these relate to clinical outcomes.

      VII. To determine genetic variants and mutations in genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes
      and transporters, and genes involved in tumor biology, and how these may be related to
      response to treatment.

      VIII. To evaluate the effect of combined MAPK and PI3K/Akt inhibition on skeletal muscle
      anabolism in patients receiving treatment with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate and MK-2206.

      IX. To conduct quality of life analyses in patients receiving the combination of AZD6244
      hydrogen sulfate plus MK-2206.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK-2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (days 8, 15, and
      22 of course 1) and selumetinib PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
