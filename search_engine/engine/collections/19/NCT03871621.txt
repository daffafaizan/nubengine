      concept'single centre study conducted in Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. It is
      designed to clarify the LV remodeling by using Speckle-Tracking echocardiography to measure
      cardiac global longitudinal strain (GLS).

      A cohort of 90 type 2 DM patients with normal LV ejection fraction will be randomized to
      either dapagliflozin 10 mg/die or to standard of care group as an active comparator. The
      study consists of 5 visits (see Table 1) and will last half an year, which has been ongoing
      since February 2019.

      The primary outcome is to detect a change in cardiac GLS from baseline to 6 months after
      treatment initiation. The secondary outcomes include changes from baseline to 6 months in
      anthropometric measures, atrial-ventricular mechanics measurements, HbA1C,Homeostatic Model
      Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), epicardial fat and plasma biomarkers regarding
      cardiomyocyte remodeling and inflammation.
