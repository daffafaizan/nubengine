    
      A randomized controlled double-blind crossover study with a baseline and two interventions.
      On day 1 (baseline), all subjects will have a lactate fingerstick measurement before and
      after the Wingate protocol. A random subsample (1/3 of subjects) will have 10 milliliters (2
      teaspoon) of blood drawn for determination of serum allantoin. Subjects will then be equipped
      with a pulse oximeter and a heart rate monitor after which they will perform the Wingate
      Anaerobic test protocol. The protocol includes: 4 minutes of warm up, 3 seconds of warm up
      sprint with weights, 1-minute relaxed cycling, 2-minute rest, then 10 seconds cycling without
      weights. This will be followed by 30 seconds sprint with weights and end with 2 minutes of
      relaxed cycling. A post-activity blood draw will be performed for another 10 milliliters (2
      teaspoon) of blood from the same one-third of subjects previously sampled. After baseline
      data collection, subjects will undergo a 1-week washout (avoiding high antioxidant foods)
      after which they will be randomized to treatment groups. On day 9, subjects will begin
      supplementation with nitrate from beetroot powder with additional anthocyanins, or nitrate
      from beetroot powder with a placebo for 7 days. On day 15 the subject will again repeat the
      same procedures as day 1, followed by another week of washout. They will supplement again on
      day 23 and repeat the same procedure as the first intervention on day 29.
