      women and women of racial and ethnic minorities. Maternal obesity is linked with adverse
      perinatal outcomes, including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, as well as longer-term
      health problems such as obesity in offspring and maternal cardiovascular disease. Pregnancy
      provides a unique opportunity to engage women in improving their health behaviors because
      women are motivated to protect the health of their babies and have frequent interactions with
      the healthcare system. Advances in behavioral weight management and obesity prevention have
      not yet been translated into real-world prenatal care settings. Our team was recently
      supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
      (NIDDK)-funded Nutrition and Obesity Research Center Pilot and Feasibility program to adapt
      an evidence-based telephonic health coaching program for pregnant women. Investigators
      conducted 20 in-depth interviews with patients and providers to gain valuable feedback to
      inform the intervention design and delivery, and have put together a multi-disciplinary team
      to adapt the intervention. Investiagtors developed the intervention specific for pregnancy
      and postpartum based on this feedback and are testing the intervention, Healthy for Two /
      Healthy for You, to assess feasibility and acceptability.
