      Unique data sets of social, psychological, and behavioral measures were collected at the
      third examination of the Offspring Study from 1984 through 1987 (which results in 14 to 17
      years of follow-up). Hypotheses for this research are focused toward understanding the sex
      and age differences in the effects these variables have on health endpoints. The research
      questions involve the prediction of three separate endpoints: incidence of coronary heart
      disease; the incidence and prognosis of atrial fibrillation; and total mortality. The
      analyses of psychosocial predictors for these outcomes are divided into four conceptual
      areas: 1) occupational status and strain, income, and employment status; 2) type A behavior,
      expressions of anger, hostility, and rate; 3) symptoms of depression, tension, anxiety, and
      feelings of aloneness; and 4) marital relationships and marital strain. These psychosocial
      variables will be analyzed jointly with the physiological risk factors collected at the same
      time to assess independence and interaction of effects. To date these psychosocial data have
      not been analyzed or published.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
