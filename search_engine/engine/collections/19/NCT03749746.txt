      lifestyle intervention and home blood pressure monitoring in the year after delivery among
      overweight and obese women with preeclampsia to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and to
      assess the effect of the intervention. The investigators hypothesize that compared to usual
      care, an internet-based lifestyle intervention implemented in the immediate postpartum period
      in overweight and obese women with preeclampsia improves weight loss at one year postpartum.
      150 overweight or obese women with preeclampsia will be randomized into internet-based
      lifestyle intervention plus home blood pressure monitoring, home blood pressure monitoring
      alone, or usual care groups in the postpartum period. The investigators will assess
      feasibility by the proportions of women who are eligible, enroll, and remain in the study at
      one year. The effect of home blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure and progression to
      sustained hypertension will also be explored. A successful outcome of this study would have a
      direct impact to improve cardiovascular health and future pregnancy health in women who have
      had preeclampsia.
