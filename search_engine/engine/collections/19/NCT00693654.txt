      treatment lotion (1% pramoxine HCl) and the remaining 14 received a bland emollient (Cetaphil
      lotion). A target lesion limited to one anatomic site, excluding face and genitals, was
      selected at baseline. Each subject was instructed to apply lotion twice daily to all affected
      areas of pruritus for four weeks. The use of any other topical or systemic medication to
      treat uremic pruritus was not permitted while participating in the study. Subjects were
      clinically evaluated for erythema, xerosis, lichenification and overall severity at baseline,
      week 1, and week 4 (end of study)
