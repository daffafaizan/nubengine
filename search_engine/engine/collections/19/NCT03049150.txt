      to predict incident acute kidney injury after fractured neck of femur surgery. The study aims
      to validate the findings of a urinary peptide panel previously developed and validated on a
      cohort of septic patients.

      Kidney injury following surgery or as a part of severe illness is an important complication,
      because it can delay and reduce the chances of recovery. A reliable early test for kidney
      injury would be useful so that treatments to prevent or minimise it can be started as early
      as possible. This study, based with a group of medical researchers working with chemists,
      will analyse clinical urine specimens from patients undergoing major orthopaedic (bone)
      surgery. We will explore whether patterns of proteins in the urine could be used as an early
      warning that kidney injury is present before existing tests demonstrate it.
