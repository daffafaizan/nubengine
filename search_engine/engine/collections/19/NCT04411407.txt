    
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate whether electronic reporting of PROMs through the DANBIO
      web application (webapp) is comparable to the outpatient touchscreen among patients with SLE.

      The trial is a randomised, crossover, agreement study where 34 patients with SLE from the
      Department of Rheumatology at Aalborg University Hospital will be included and randomised in
      ratio 1:1 to:

        -  Group 1: PROMs are reported through the DANBIO webapp; thereafter, the touchscreen.

        -  Group 2: PROMs are reported through the touchscreen; thereafter, the DANBIO webapp.

      There will be a wash-out period of 1-2 day between the two registrations to minimise
      carryover bias.
