      respectively in Egyptian Demographic Health Survey 2014.

      The main risk factors for growth restriction in children are maternal under nutrition during
      pregnancy, lack of exclusive breastfeeding, inappropriate complementary feeding and
      micronutrient intake and high prevalence of enteric infections. However, other environmental
      exposures may also play a role in growth restriction .

      High concentrations of Arsenic, lead and cadmium in placenta are associated with poor fetal
      out come and low birth weight. Arsenic crosses the placenta causing suppression of
      insulin-Like Growth Factor 1.

      When breastfeeding is exclusive, infants are unlikely to be exposed to Arsenic by other
      routes of exposure such as external foods, drinking water and foods made at home using
      Arsenic contaminated water.

      Rational of the study. Improvement of under-five nutritional status is a global target.
      Although the exposure to arsenic has increased globally, it's impact on nutritional status
      has seldom been investigated.
