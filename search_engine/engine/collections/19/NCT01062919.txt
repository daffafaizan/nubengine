      of patients will receive thoracic epidural analgesia plus patient controlled analgesia (PCA)
      (epidural analgesia group) and the other group will receive infiltration of local anesthetic
      plus PCA (wound infusion group). Functional restoration, assessed by self-administered
      quality of Life questionnaires (SF-36, CHAMPS, ICFS) and 2 and 6 min walking test will be
      assessed in the two groups at 3 and 8 weeks after the surgery.
