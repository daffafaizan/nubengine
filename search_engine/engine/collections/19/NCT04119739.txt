    
      The present randomized clinical trial will perform a comparison of the pain reduction effects
      produced by the application of median nerve neural mobilization (non invasive and non
      pharmaceutical physiotherapy treatment), to the pain reduction effect produced by an oral
      ibuprofen treatment or the lack of treatment (waiting list control group) in subjects
      diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, effects over the functionality of the
      affected upper limb will be evaluated and compared. Subjects will be invited to participate
      and randomly allocated to 3 different groups.
