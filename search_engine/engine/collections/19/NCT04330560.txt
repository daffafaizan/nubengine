    
      Primary Objective: To determine the exercise capacity among patients with coronary heart
      disease (CHD) that utilising an electronic activity tracker system (EATs) during the cardiac
      rehabilitation phase 2 (CRP2).

      Secondary Objectives: To assess the efficiency of EATs on patient's exercise adherence and
      identify the changes on the patient's cardiovascular risk factors, influence by the EATs
      utilisation.

      Primary Endpoint: The patient's exercise capacity.

      Secondary Endpoints: The patient's weekly exercise adherence; and cardiovascular risk factors
      include the serum lipid, blood pressure, body mass, body mass index (BMI), blood glucose
      level, and quality of life (QOL).

      Phase: 2

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: Patient engagement with the cardiac
      rehabilitation phase 2 (CRP2) at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC).
