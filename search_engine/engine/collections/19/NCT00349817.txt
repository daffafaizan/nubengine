      fundamentals and hereditary colorectal cancer. Sixty four family medicine resident
      participants will take part in this study. Participants will be divided into 4 groups. Group
      1 will be the control and receive no education. Group 2 will be given access to the
      self-study web-based educational module to do on their own time. Group 3 will be given a
      lecture on the material using the educational module, followed by a discussion. Group 4 will
      also be given this lecture and discussion, followed by an interactive standardized patient
      role-play experience.

      Three months later, all participants will complete an simulated oral examination, an written
      knowledge test and an attitude survey. By comparing the results between the 4 groups, the
      best way to teach genetics will be determined. This template can then be used to develop a
      curriculum for teaching clinical genetics to family medicine residents.
