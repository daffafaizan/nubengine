      accompanied by PTRCT (n=44) were randomly assigned to HILT and control groups. Group 1 (HILT
      group, n=22) received 3 sessions of HILT per week for 3 weeks in addition to the exercise
      program which performed 5 sessions per week for 3 weeks. Group 2 (Control group, n=22)
      received an exercise program for HSP of 5 sessions per week for 3 weeks.

      Participants were evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS), passive Range of Motion (ROM),
      Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Functional
      Independence Measure (FIM) and ultrasonographic PTRCT size.
