      Hypoxia Inducible Factor alfa (HIF-1Î±), it increases oxygen pressure in tumoral tissue by
      augmenting tumor blood flow, increases apoptosis, activation of p53, and induces cellular
      growth inhibition. Randomized studies showed that the addition of transdermal nitroglycerin
      to non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with metastasis treated with vinorelbine and
      cisplatin achieved a significantly better global response to treatment than conventional
      treatment
