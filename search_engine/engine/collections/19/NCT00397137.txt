      associated with severe postoperative pain and prolonged recovery period. Methods aiming at
      improving the outcome of excisional surgery included mainly modifications of the existing
      technique. Alternative instruments other than scissors have been used for the actual excision
      of haemorrhoids with a view to reducing the postoperative pain. However, with the wound in
      the sensitive anoderm following excisional haemorrhoidectomy, pain continues to be a major
      problem irrespective of the method of excision or of the instrument employed.

      The new technique of stapled anopexy introduced in 1998 uses a radically different approach
      to treat haemorrhoids. The prolapsed anal cushion is repositioned and fixed without actually
      excising the haemorrhoidal pedicle thereby avoiding an external wound. This should result in
      reduction of the postoperative pain and subsequently should improve the recovery time.
      Further potential advantages of the technique should include a more physiological approach to
      the treatment of the disease.
