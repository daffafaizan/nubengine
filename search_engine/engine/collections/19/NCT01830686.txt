      such that obese, insulin resistant adults will be randomly selected to receive food made with
      1) sugarcane bagasse, 2) non-caloric, non-fermentable fiber, or 3) a similar product with
      minimal fiber for 4 weeks. The intervention will be in the form of brownies and cookies and
      will look and taste nearly identical to each other. Caloric value will be constant with all
      three delivery systems. Subjects will have blood testing and body composition analysis before
      and after the intervention.
