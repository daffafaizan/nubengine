      According to previous research, adults would lose 40% among from aged 20 to 70. If muscle
      mass decline combining with the decline of muscle strength is so called Sarcopenia.When
      muscle mass decline, infectious risk gets higher, and resilience after illness gets lower. In
      addition, activity and life quality are also responsible for falling, cognitive difficulty,
      disability and mortality among seniors. We hope to find out the etiologies of Sarcopenia
      through this program and develop prevention strategy and model to mollify the the negative
      effect of rapid aging society.
