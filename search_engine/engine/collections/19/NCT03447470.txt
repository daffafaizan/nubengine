    
      Part A of the study will consist of an ascending monotherapy dose, the doses are pre-defined.

      The decision to escalate will be made upon the assessment of safety and tolerability data in
      the first cycle of treatment.

      Part A - Module 1 will commence with an accelerated dose escalation schedule and enrol one
      (1) patient into a cohort with follow up for adverse events and dose limiting toxicities.

      Once a Minimal Biologically Active Dose (MBAD) has been found to be tolerated, dose
      escalations will continue in a 3+3 design to further characterise the PK profile, Maximum
      Tolerated Dose and Maximum Feasible Dose.

      Part B study design will be adapted based on the emerging data from Part A
