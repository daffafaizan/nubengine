    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
      for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      The main purpose of this study is to see how effective all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is in
      treating tumor. Other reasons for conducting the study are:

        -  To determine for how long all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) may reduce the size or slow
           down the growth of tumor

        -  To evaluate levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released in the bloodstream as an
           indication of the disease activity

        -  To better understand mechanisms of tumor resistance to ATRA
