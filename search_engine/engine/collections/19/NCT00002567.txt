    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of myeloablative total-body irradiation and etoposide
      followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in prolonging the
      disease-free survival of patients with acute leukemia. II. Investigate the ability of growth
      factor-primed PBSC to provide hematopoietic reconstitution following myeloablative therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are treated on Regimen A, then Regimen B. Regimen A: Stem Cell
      Mobilization. Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF, NSC-614629. Regimen B:
      Radiotherapy and Myeloablative Chemotherapy with Hematopoietic Rescue. Total-Body
      Irradiation, TBI (high-energy electrons used for lung boost); and Etoposide, VP-16,
      NSC-141540; with Peripheral Blood Stem Cells, PBSC; G-CSF.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 45 patients will be studied over approximately 3 years.
