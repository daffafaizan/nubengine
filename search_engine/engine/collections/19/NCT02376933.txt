      vertebral augmentation. This study is conducted in patients with metastatic cancer or
      multiple myeloma involving the spine. This study addresses the value of vertebral
      augmentation in combination with radiotherapy in the setting of cancer to the spine. The
      patient's pain, overall quality of life, and fracture development/avoidance will be compared
      to patients treated only with radiotherapy in the past.
