      years (48 000 deaths a year).

      Severe trauma defined by an Injury Severity Score ( ISS) > 15 implies intensive care.

      Intensive care unit admission induces considerable psychological distress and memory
      troubles, both promoting posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of anxiety and
      depression. A diary written prospectively during the ICU stay by the staff and relatives has
      been suggested as a means of helpÂ¬ing patients to build a more detailed and factual narrative
      of their ICU stay than would be possible based only on their fragmented memories. Garrouste
      et al. have shown that the intensive care unit diary significantly affected posttraumatic
      stress disorders in surviving patients 12 months after intensive care unit discharge.

      Besides, severe trauma by itself may decrease the quality of life (QoL). It is recommended to
      assess QoL on one year after the trauma. In trauma patients, the change in QoL is associated
      with the presence of a PTSD.

      Consequently, severe trauma patients who undergo a double stress, that of the accident and
      that of the intensive care unit stay: they may so even more have a decrease of their QoL by
      developing a PSTD.

      The investigator formulate the hypothesis that a diary, written by the staff and relatives
      from the very acute phase of the ICU stay (first 48 hours) to the discharge of ICU would
      improve the QoL and would decrease the frequency and the intensity of PTSD of the severe
      trauma patients one year after the trauma.
