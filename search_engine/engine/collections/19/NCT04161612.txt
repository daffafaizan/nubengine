      more frequently observed than the general population and have significant impacts on
      mortality, impair long-term quality of life.The aim of the study was to evaluate sleep
      quality in patients with spinal cord injury; to investigate the relationship between sleep
      and spinal cord level, ambulation status, spasticity, quality of life, daily living
      activities, depressive status, neuropathic pain Eighty patients with inpatient rehabilitation
      of spinal cord injury were included in the study.

      Demographic characteristics, duration of spinal cord injury, spinal cord injury level,
      etiology, number of intermittent bladder catheterization (IC), number of night time IC, what
      time they slept, whether they woke up at night, classification of spinal cord injury were
      recorded.

      Ambulation level with Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), spasticity with Modified
      Ashworth Scale (MAS), depressive symptoms with Beck Depression Index (BDI), quality of life
      with short-form health survey (SF-36), sleep quality The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
      (PSQI), daytime sleepiness Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), activity of daily living with
      Barthel Index (BI), neuropathic pain were evaluated with the Douleur Neuropathique 4
      questionnaire (DN4) scale.
