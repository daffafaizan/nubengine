      resistant to scratching, staining, rust or oxidation, as well as "hydrophilic", meaning that
      water or mud doesn't stick to them and so, they become much easier to clean. It was publicly
      commercialized in recent years for use on automobiles to preserve their gloss, protect their
      paint, preserve the clarity of their wind shields and headlights so as to provide better
      lighting and vision.

      On the other hand, lens fogging and other vision-obstructing events during laparoscopic or
      endoscopic operations(e.g. being smeared by blood or other body fluids during operation, or
      having a piece of loose tissue stick to its surface that require manual removal and wiping)
      have been an ever-lasting concern for operators ever since the advent of the respective
      devices. Many techniques and methods have developed, tested and compared regarding their
      effectiveness in protecting the lens from such events and preserving vision clear and
      uninterrupted during operations. Examples of such methods are (scope warmers, FREDTM,
      ResoclearTM, chlorhexidine, betadine and immersion in heated saline.

      In this study the investigator seeks to apply the idea of nano-ceramic coating as a new
      technique for achieving that goal. to the investigator's best knowledge, this idea was never
      conceived or tested in the field before.
