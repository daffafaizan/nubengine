      planned, range 0.1-1.5 milligram [mg]) or placebo. The main purpose is to assess
      dose-dependent effect of this new compound on blood glucose over a period of 12 weeks.
      Therefore, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is chosen as the primary efficacy measure. Several
      other attributes of glycemic control and endocrine function of pancreas will be assessed as
      secondary objectives. These secondary objectives will be used to compare the effect of the
      experimental compound and placebo. Since LY2189265 is in early phase of development,
      comprehensive safety assessment is planned to learn more about possible side-effects and to
      establish benefit/risk profile of individual doses of the drug. The trial is organized in
      four phases: screening, lead-in period to establish baseline status of participants in each
      group, treatment period during which participants will be randomized into 1 of 5 groups (4
      will receive one of the LY2189265 doses, 1 group will receive placebo), and safety follow up.
      Maximum of 9 study visits are planned. Study drug (LY2189265 or placebo) will be administered
      once weekly via subcutaneous (SC) injections. Rescue intervention was allowed after
      randomization for those participants whose hyperglycemia reached pre-defined unacceptable
      high values. Participants on rescue therapy remained in the study and continued to receive
      study drug. Participants who received rescue therapy were included in the analysis
      population, but only measurements obtained prior to the beginning of rescue therapy were
      included in specified efficacy analyses.

      A 3-mg LY2189265 dose was discontinued and replaced with the 1.5 mg dose based on dose
      finding Study H9X-MC-GBCF; NCT00734474. Except where noted, data summaries from the 3
      discontinued 3-mg LY2189265 participants (n=3) are not included due to the small number of
      participants and the short treatment duration.
