      logs for a week, complete the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (measuring "morningness"
      and "eveningness") and determine the time patients want to sleep. Patients then miss a night
      of sleep and subsequently are allowed later and later sleep times until patients are sleeping
      at their desired time. Beginning the morning following their Wake Night, patients sit in
      front of bright lights at their intended wake-up time for the next six weeks and once their
      allowed sleep time is their intended sleep time, patients also continue to only be allowed to
      sleep between those times (e.g., 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.). Daily sleep, energy and mood logs and
      activity monitoring are maintained throughout with weekly clinician ratings. In additional,
      daily telephone check ins occur during the first week following the Wake Night both to be
      sure the patient is following the protocol and to obtain symptom ratings. Saliva to be
      measured for melatonin is collected prior to and following sleep adjustment.
