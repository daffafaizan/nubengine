      evaluated. A dose escalation study will be performed by varying irradiance (mW) and time
      (minutes). Surface temperature will be monitored concurrently. Acute lesions occurring within
      5 minutes of irradiation will be assessed and histological damage will be observed
      microscopically in slice sections of punch biopsies and qualitative assessed. Irradiation
      regimes above the anticipated threshold will be employed to properly titrate the irradiation
      necessary to elicit a thermal damage response.
