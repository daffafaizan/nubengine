      808 nm with its active AsGaAl medium in two points of the vestibular face of the
      hypersensitive teeth. It was applied at each point 60 J / cm², for 16 seconds. The laser was
      applied in 2 sessions with a time interval of 24 hours. GLASERnHAP first received laser
      application and then the application of nanohydroxyapatite according to the manufacturer's
      recommendations. Before initiating laser therapy, the equipment was calibrated with a tester
      (MMOptics Ltda®, São Carlos, SP, Brazil).

      The GnHAP volunteers were submitted to the application of Desensibilize Nano P on the
      vestibular surfaces of hypersensitive teeth with the aid of a Microbrush applicator
      (Microbrush, 3M ESPE, São Paulo, Brazil) for 10 minutes. Then, a rubber cup (Unid Microdont,
      São Paulo, SP, Brazil) mounted on a low speed handpiece (Dabi Atlante, Ribeirão Preto, SO,
      Brazil) was used to scrub the desensitizing gel on teeth for 20 seconds in each tooth,
      according to the manufacturer's specifications. GPLACEBO followed the same protocol used in
      Gn-HAP. In addition to the desensitization treatment, all GnHAP and GPLACEBO volunteers
      received the positioning of the laser tip to mimic the light emission produced in GLASER and
      GLASERnHAP. The noise emitted by the laser device during mimicry was simulated through the
      sound reproduction of a smartphone application (HD Voice Recorder - iPhone 6s, Apple®,
      Cupertino, California, USA).
