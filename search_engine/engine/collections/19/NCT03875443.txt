      population usually occurring in patients older than 60 years of age. Almost all fractures are
      treated operatively with reduction and stabilisation of the fracture using either a dynamic
      hip screw or an intramedullary nail. The reduction of the fracture and positioning of the
      implant are surgeon dependent factors and can be influenced by educational interventions. The
      investigators hypothesized that a structured educational program on the optimal use of
      intraoperative fluoroscopy to control the quality of reduction and the position of the
      implant, as well as the provision of a practical algorithm intraoperatively guiding reduction
      and stabilisation of intertrochanteric fractures would improve the radiologic outcome.
