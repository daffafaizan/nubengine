      which eventually leads to corneal decompensation. In the early stage, some patients develop
      visually significant cataract. During cataract surgery ultrasound (US) power is used to
      emulsify the lens, which leads to endothelial cell loss and tissue damage. The reduction of
      US power has become the primary surgical goal in cataract surgery, which is especially
      important in patients with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy to limit endothelial cell loss.

      In 2006, Alcon Surgical introduced a torsional mode in its phacoemulsification system
      (Infiniti Vision System). It includes a handpiece that produces rotary oscillations of the
      phacoemulsification tip and is suggested to reduce the amount of US power required to remove
      the cataractous nucleus, because it does not produce repulsion and breaks up the cataract by
      shearing and not by the conventional jackhammer effect. This reduction in US power, could
      lead to less endothelial cell damage than the conventional (longitudinal) mode, which is
      reported recently for patients with hard cataract. It is important to investigate patients
      with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, because patients with a compromised endothelial cell layer
      will benefit the most from less endothelial cell damage. Consequently, this lower level of
      endothelial damage may postpone the date of keratoplasty.
