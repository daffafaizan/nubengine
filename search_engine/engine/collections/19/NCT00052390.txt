        -  Determine the response rate (partial and complete) in patients with locally recurrent or
           metastatic soft tissue sarcoma treated with doxorubicin and bevacizumab.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether pre-treatment plasma vascular endothelial growth factor level or
           microvessel density of tumor samples from these patients predicts response to this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5-10 minutes followed by bevacizumab IV over 30-90
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease after reaching the maximum dose of
      doxorubicin may continue bevacizumab alone.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 13.3
      months.
