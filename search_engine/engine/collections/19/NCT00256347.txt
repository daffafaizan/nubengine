      screening/orientation session. The next 5 visits will be (full day) outpatient sessions
      taking place Monday through Friday during one week. All full day visits will be drug
      administration sessions with subjects randomized to one of two groups. Group A will receive
      two daily intramuscular injections of 8 mg morphine on Monday through Thursday and two
      intramuscular injections of placebo on Friday. Group B will receive two daily intramuscular
      injections of placebo on Monday through Thursday and two intramuscular injections of 8 mg
      morphine on Friday. During the Monday through Friday sessions the painfulness of experimental
      heat application and the area of skin tenderness (primary and secondary hyperalgesia) will be
      assessed before and two times after the intramuscular injections. Heat will be applied by
      using a computer controlled probe that applies heat (450 C/1130 F) on the thigh for 3 minutes
      (Brief Thermal Sensitization model.)
