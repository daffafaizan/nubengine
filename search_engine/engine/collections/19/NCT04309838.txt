      the 80's of the last century. Nowadays, specific treatment of PAH can be realized by the huge
      number of substances that are currently available. Still, the time point of starting an
      intravenous medication is not defined yet. By evaluation of data concerning risk strata of
      PAH patients, this issue may be enlightened properly.

      Previously collected data concerning risk-adapted therapy in PAH-patient have shown that the
      mortality is little in the "low-risk-status" patients, only. Thus, all efforts must be
      undertaken to define the patients in this functional class. For most patients this means a
      combined therapy of available substances according to well defined procedures. Patients whose
      status remain as "intermediate-risk-status" after receiving a dual therapy over 3-6 months
      shall undergo a subsequent triple therapy including Selexipag. However, this therapy may not
      lead to an improvement of the risk-status or even worsened. In these cases, a subcutaneous or
      intravenous therapy with prostanoids is indicated.

      Currently, there are no data available for those patients treated with at least three months
      with Selexipag as part of a triple therapy that undergo a subsequent intravenous therapy with
      Treprostinil if there is no change in their risk-status. In the planned study LPS-II,
      patients are specifically selected on being treated in a dual therapy and having a stagnating
      intermediate-risk status. These patients receive an implantation of the medical pump LENUS
      pro, that enables a permanent infusion of Treprostinil.

      The aim of this study is to examine, whether patients can reach an improvement in their
      intermediate-risk-status after six months of treatment.
