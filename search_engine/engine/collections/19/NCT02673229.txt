      receive either Santyl ointment or bacitracin ointment to apply to the burn until it heals.
      Bandages will be used to keep the burn covered while it heals. Second degree burns generally
      leave a scar. Once the burn heals, lotion and an appropriate bandage will be used to try to
      minimize the appearance of a scar.

      The study hypothesis is that burns treated with Santyl will have a better scar appearance
      than burns treated with bacitracin.

      Subjects enrolled in this study will make once a week visits to the University of Kansas
      Medical Center outpatient burn clinic until the burn heals. The burn will be assessed for
      healing at these visits. Once healed, visits to the clinic will be at 60 & 180 days, up to 6
      months. At these visits, the appearance of the scar will be evaluated.

      This study was originally funded by Smith and Nephew, but Smith and Nephew is no longer
      providing support for the study.
