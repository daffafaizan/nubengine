      sites is an important component of surgery induced inflammatory response in patients.
      Postoperative period is associated with an increased production of cytokines, which augment
      pain sensitivity. With adequate perioperative pain control it is possible to control central
      and peripheral inflammatory response to surgery, and influence on patient outcomes. Use of
      analgetics before the pain stimulus (preventive analgesia) prevent development of
      neuroplastic changes in central nervous system, and reduces pain. Clonidine is an
      alpha2-adrenergic agonist with sedative, analgesic and hemodynamic properties. It inhibits
      transmission of nociceptive stimuli in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, acting on the
      inhibitory descending pathways. According to recent experimental investigations clonidine
      lowers proinflammatory cytokine level, and prevents hypersensitization acting through
      adrenoreceptors alpha-2A.

      Levobupivacaine is a long-acting local anesthetic, S-enantiomer of bupivacaine, with
      identical anesthetic potency. When administered intraperitoneally or by local infiltration of
      operation site, levobupivacaine produced analgesia and reduction of proinflammatory
      cytokines. Investigations of epidural and intrathecal levobupivacaine provide evidence for
      improved postoperative analgesia with reduced analgesic consumption. But, it remains unknown
      if that analgesia is sufficient enough to blockade inflammatory stress response during
      perioperative time.We want to investigate and compare analgesic and immunomodulation efficacy
      of this two frequently used analgesics.
