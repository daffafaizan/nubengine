      ESRD subjects. The underlying etiology for dialysis access failure is uniformly due to
      progressive narrowing of the vessel lumen leading to stasis and thrombosis of the access. The
      luminal narrowing of arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) is due to progressive hyperplasia of
      vessel intima and subsequent infiltration of smooth muscle cells into the vessel media. Areas
      of stenosis within AVFs are characterized by dense neointimal hyperplasia, infiltration of
      vascular smooth muscle cells and expansion of extracellular matrix material. Additionally,
      varying types of vascular injury increase the rate of collagen and elastin deposition within
      the medial and serosal areas of the vessel.
