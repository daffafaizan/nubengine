      mixed-methods, observational study enrolled a longitudinal cohort of 155 women, seen during
      pregnancy (6-9 mo), early (0-6 wks) and later (4-6 mo) postpartum, and two cross-sectional
      cohorts (60 early, 56 later postpartum).

      Maternal and infant anthropometry was recorded, maternal fecal, urine and saliva samples were
      collected, and questionnaires were used to explore household factors (socioeconomic status,
      food security), social factors (autonomy, paternal/social support, domestic violence), and
      maternal-level factors (nutrition, infection, emotional distress).

      Analyses focused on (1) characterizing women's exposure to nutrition, infection and
      psychosocial stressors vs. resilience factors, (2) describing the maternal diurnal salivary
      cortisol rhythm in pregnancy and postpartum and explore its association with psychosocial
      variables, (3) assessing the cumulative impact of maternal-level factors (nutritional,
      infectious, psychosocial), social factors (autonomy, social support, domestic violence), and
      household factors (socioeconomic status, food security) on early infant growth, and (4)
      evaluating whether maternal cortisol may be a mediator in the vertical transmission of
      stress.

      In addition, Photovoice activities involved giving a camera to 23 women from study
      communities, who documented sources of stress vs. resilience for local women, and shared
      photo-elicited narratives through six group sessions.
