      pathways and Bregs are involved in the process of chronic HBV infection.

      Here the investigators intended to investigate the regulating role and the mechanism of CD19+
      IL-35+ cells on host T cell immune during chronic HBV infection by using in vitro cell
      sorting, B cell differentiation induction, Transwell cell co-culture system and other
      methods.
