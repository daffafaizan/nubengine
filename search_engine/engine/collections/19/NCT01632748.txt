      strategically positioned in and around the pelvic area of the user. The electrode positions
      and current pathways deliver therapeutic stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles resulting in
      repeated contraction of the intended muscle group. Pilot study data has shown this novel
      approach to produce extremely favorable adaptation and improvement in patient's symptoms
      following intervention. In order to capture the intended electrode position a stand-alone
      garment that will allow the end user to re-position electrodes on multiple re-applications is
      required. The Neurotech Vital Device garment is CE Marked as a Class IIa medical device and
      it is CE Marked, as part of the Neurotech Vital Device, in line with Medical Device Directive
      93/42/EC as amended by 2007/47/EC. The Neurotech Vital Device garment is not cleared by the
      FDA through the 510 (k) pre-market notification process in the USA but would be considered a
      Class II device as part of the Neurotech Vital Device.

      The purpose of this validation study is to establish the suitability of the Neurotech Vital
      device in which the treatment stimulation parameters have been markedly attenuated (defined
      as 'modified Neurotech Vital device') prior to its use as one of the treatments in a
      randomised, controlled, double-blind study to be conducted in patients with stress urinary
      incontinence in Germany (Study No: BMR-11-1002).
