    
      Approximately 400 asthma patients with an increased serum total IgE level(60-1500
      international unit(IU)/ml) and uncontrolled receiving medium to high dose inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) plus long-acting Î²2-agonist(LABA) will be randomised in about 43 sites
      in China. They will be administered CMAB007 or placebo at a ratio of 2:1 for 24 weeks. During
      the whole study, all subjects will be on regularly fixed combination of med/high ICS and LABA
      (budesonide and formoterol fumarate powder for inhalation or salmeterol xinafoate and
      fluticasone propionate powder for inhalation). They should complete PEF measurement and
      patient diary daily and be assessed every 4 weeks. Spirometry, questionnaires, laboratory
      tests and so on will be performed. At selected sites, about 45 patients will be enrolled in a
      sub-study to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characterises of CMAB007.
      Anti-drug antibody (ADA) will be sampled at V1, V2 and V7 too.
