      aphasia, but effect sizes are moderate. This highlights the pressing need to explore adjunct
      strategies, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), to enhance training
      effectiveness. Recently, the investigators provided evidence from a single-center randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) suggesting that anodal-tDCS of the left primary motor cortex (M1)
      improves naming and communication ability in chronic post-stroke aphasia, with
      medium-to-large effect sizes. However, prior to integration into clinical routine, a
      multi-center RCT with adequate power, duration, and outcomes relevant to everyday life is
      required, which is the goal of the present study. After trial completion, a workshop with
      relevant stakeholders will ensure transfer into best-practice guidelines.
