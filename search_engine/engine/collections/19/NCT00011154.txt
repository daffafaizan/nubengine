      factors for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We are addressing this objective by
      conducting a case-control study of ALS in the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Medical
      Care Program (KPMCP). Over a four-year period, approximately 175 persons newly diagnosed with
      ALS will be identified and recruited through physician referrals and computerized mechanisms
      available within the Kaiser system. The patients with ALS will be compared to a sample of 350
      age- and gender-matched persons without ALS from the same membership. Specific study aims are
      as follows: (1) to investigate the association of ALS with exposure to neurotoxicants
      including lead, other heavy metals, solvents and pesticides; (2) to determine whether
      inadequate oxidative defenses for protecting against free-radicals enhance the toxicity of
      exogenous exposures; (3) to examine the evidence for familial aggregation of
      neurodegenerative diseases among first-degree relatives of patients with ALS; and (4) to
      estimate the incidence of ALS in diverse racial and ethnic groups.
