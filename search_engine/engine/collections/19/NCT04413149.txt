    
      ILD patients with serum ANCA-positivity were enrolled in this study.

        1. Baseline data collection:

             1. Demographics information (age, gender)

             2. Clinical course

             3. Clinical symptoms and signs (cough, dyspnea, fever, fatigue, crackling, clubbing
                fingers, mechanics hand)

             4. Laboratory findings (blood and urine routine, liver and renal function tests,
                erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein)

             5. Serologic tests (ANA , Rheumatoid factor , Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP),
                Anti-dsDNA, Anti-Ro (SS-A), Anti-La (SS-B), Anti-Smith, Anti-Scl-70, Anti-Jo-1)

             6. Systemic manifestation if diagnosed as systemic vasculitis

             7. Pulmonary function tests (ventilation and diffusion capacity test)

             8. Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)

        2. Treatment: treatment will be given according to the experience of each pulmonologist.

        3. Follow-up:

             1. Patients were followed up at least once a year and basic laboratory tests,
                serologic autoantibodies, pulmonary function test and chest HRCT were evaluated
                routinely

             2. Follow-up end point was April 2019.

        4. Outcome
