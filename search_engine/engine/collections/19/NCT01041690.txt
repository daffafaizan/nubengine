    
      PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of preoperative intravitreal bevacizumab as an adjunct to
      vitrectomy in the management of severe diabetic eye disease.

      SETTINGS: Kasr El-Aini Teaching Hospital - Cairo University from 2007 to 2008. METHODS:
      Twenty eyes of 19 patients with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy were recruited into
      the study. All eyes underwent a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab 1.25 mg in 0.05
      ml one week prior to vitrectomy for tractional (14), combined tractional/rhegmatogenous
      retinal detachment (4), and fibrovascular tissue covering/distorting the macula (2).
      Exclusion criteria were: previous vitrectomy, neovascular glaucoma, and dense media opacity
      (dense cataract and vitreous hemorrhage) precluding fluorescein angiography (FA) that was
      done pre- and 1 week post injections. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), anterior segment
      with dilated fundus examinations, and intraocular pressures (IOP), were done pre-, 1 week
      post-injections, 1 day, 1 week and monthly for 3 months post-vitrectomy. Intra- and
      post-operative bleedings were recorded.
