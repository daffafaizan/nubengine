      factor concentrates to treat and prevent bleeding. Additionally they typically have at least
      yearly IV laboratory assessments. Pain and anxiety with needle related procedures
      particularly in children with hemophilia can lead to development of needle phobia, treatment
      avoidance and poor adherence to treatment regimens. Conventional virtual reality (VR)
      environments have been shown to reduce pain/anxiety in pediatric populations however in a
      clinical setting children with hemophilia have specific VR design needs that have not been
      addressed. Certain issues related to VR environments are related to the pediatric age range.
      These include the size and weight of VR headsets, the ease of donning and doffing headsets,
      and degree of engagement with VR environments. Hemophilia specific issues include the need
      for the VR experience to limit movement of the hands/arms to facilitate IV procedures,
      customization to prevent boredom/disengagement from repeated use and ability of clinical
      staff to trigger events via an orchestration dashboard that occur for the patients benefit at
      key times during IV procedures. Lastly, there are issues related to integration into a
      clinical setting. These include ability to integrate into clinical care without adversely
      affecting clinic flow, and infection control issues related to headset design.
