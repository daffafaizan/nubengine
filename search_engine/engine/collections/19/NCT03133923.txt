    
      In order to evaluation the safety and immunogenicity of different doses Live Attenuated Mumps
      Vaccine (Human diploid cell).The study will Determine the optimal dose of vaccine and provide
      the clinical trail basis for the phase Ⅲ trail design.

      Primary objective:

      After single dose immunization of low dose(≥3.0but<3.5lgCCID50)、high dose （≥4.5lgCCID50）Live
      Attenuated Mumps Vaccine (Human Diploid Cell) in Chinese healthy Infants volunteer aged from
      8 to 24 months old.the study will evaluate the standardized positive rate of neutralizing
      antibody and the GMT of the hemagglutination inhibition antibody and neutralizing
      antibody,proposing the immune reference dose for phase III clinical trials.

      Secondary objective： Evaluate the safety of low dose(≥3.0but<3.5lgCCID50)、high dose
      （≥4.5lgCCID50）Live Attenuated Mumps Vaccine (Human Diploid Cell) in Chinese healthy Infants
      volunteer aged from 8 to 24 months old.
