      The Odense Child Cohort Study (OCC) is a population-based cohort study, comprising pregnant
      women recruited between January 1st 2010 and December 31st 2012. All women who were pregnant
      in the municipality of Odense during this time were eligible for participation, and 6,707
      women were approached directly with recruitment material.

      The study complied with the Helsinki declaration and was approved by the Regional Scientific
      Ethical Committee for Southern Denmark, no. S-20090130. All participants gave informed
      consent. From a population base of 6,707 pregnant women, 2,874 (42.9%) enrolled in the OCC up
      to December 31st, 2012. The children will be followed until 18 years of age.

      Serum samples were taken in early pregnancy (GA 2-25 weeks), late pregnancy (GA 26-30 weeks),
      maternal serum and cord blood at birth, and from the children along with general examinations
      at ages 3 months, 1 year, 3 years.

      Questionnaires were completed by the families in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, after
      birth, and at the times of clinical examination of the children.

      Register data on health variables were further available from the Danish registries.

      Objective:

      The Vitamin D and bone length Study examines the relationship between the biomarker 25(OH)D
      in maternal serum and the length of the fetal femur and humerus bone at mid term pregnancy.

      Method:

      25(OH)D analysis: Serum was stored at -80º Celsius until analysis, which was performed by
      liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Triple deuterium marked 25(OH)vitamin D3
      was added to serum samples as internal standard and deproteinized with ZnSO4 in methanol,
      centrifuged at 2750 g for 10 minutes, and 100 μl was injected on the TurboFlow column (Thermo
      Scientific) on the LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS consisted of a Thermo Scientific TLX1 system
      connected to a Thermo Scientific Vantage TSQ. 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 were concentrated on a
      Thermo Scientific Cyclone P 50 x 1.0 mm column and back-flushed on the analytical column,
      Phenomenex Gemini C18 50 x 3.0 mm and eluted from the analytical column by a gradient. Mobile
      phases were A: 10 mM NH4Ac in water and B: 10 mM NH4Ac in methanol. Human serum was spiked
      with appropriate amounts of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 in order to produce six point calibration
      curves (weighed 1/x2) and 3 levels of QC samples (low, mid, high). The method was calibrated
      against NIST standard 972.25 The C3 epimer of D3 was detected along with D3 and the two were
      not distinguishable from one another. Lowest detectable concentrations were 0.15 nM for both
      D2 and D3. Values of D2 and D3 were only considered if above 6.5 nM.

      The Vitamin D and bone length study:

      Vitamin D and bone length in mid term pregnancy.

      - In 986 serum samples collected in early pregnancy, the levels of serum 25(OH)D were
      investigated by LC-MS/. Questionnaire and medical file information was used to determine the
      factors which were influential on 25(OH)D levels and bone length in mid term pregnancy by
      multiple linear regression.
