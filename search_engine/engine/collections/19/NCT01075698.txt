    
      Events are defined as follows; Cerebrovascular events: Stroke (cerebral infarction, cerebral
      hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, unknown type of stroke), transient ischemic attack
      Coronary events: Myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia
      Cardiac events: Myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia,
      heart failure Aortic/peripheral arterial events: Aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection,
      arteriosclerotic disease (aorta, carotid artery, renal artery, mesenteric artery, peripheral
      artery, etc.) Complications of diabetes: Diabetic nephropathy*, diabetic retinopathy*,
      diabetic neuropathy* Aggravation of renal function: Doubling of serum creatinine level, ESRD
      (initiation of dialysis, renal transplantation)

      *Newly occurred or aggravated

      The followings will be measured as biomarkers; urinary albumin creatinine rates (UACR),
      plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), urinary 8-hydroxy-deoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG), serum
      adiponectin, serum high-molecular weight adiponectin, high sensitivity c-reactive protein
      (hsCRP), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
