    
      Homocystinuria (MIM 236200) due to CBS deficiency is the most common inborn error of sulfur
      amino acid metabolism with severe clinical manifestations. We propose:

        1. An open-label pilot study of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to lower plasma homocysteine levels
           in those that have not responded to conventional treatment which includes betaine
           (CystadaneÂ®, Orphan Medical Inc.), which while lowering Hcy levels does not normalize
           it, and is very expensive. There are no known contraindications to NAC used for
           nutritional supplementation and it is relatively inexpensive.

           Oral NAC has reduced total plasma homocysteine in healthy subjects in a dose-dependent
           fashion.

        2. Measurement of flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery (endothelial function)
           in response to NAC treatment. Endothelial dysfunction is a precursor of atherogenesis.

        3. Sequencing the CBS gene in these individuals in order to identify novel mutations
           causing homocystinuria and identify polymorphisms in other genes that may affect
           response to treatment.
