      participate. Participating residents were taught esotropia and exotropia topics sequentially,
      randomized by order and classroom style (flipped classroom vs. traditional lecture) one to
      three weeks apart. Participants were assigned a pre-class video lecture prior to the flipped
      classroom in-class case-based activity. The traditional classroom included a preparatory
      reading assignment and an in-person lecture delivered by the same instructor. Participants
      completed three identical 5-question content assessments (pre-test, post-test, and 3-month
      retention) and opinion surveys following each classroom.
