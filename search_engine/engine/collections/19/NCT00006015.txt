        -  Determine the response rate of patients who overexpress HER-2/neu with metastatic
           colorectal adenocarcinoma who have progressed on at least 1 prior, but no more than 2
           prior, chemotherapy regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil,
           leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and trastuzumab (Herceptin).

        -  Determine the time to progression of these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22, followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15, and then followed by leucovorin
      calcium IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Fluorouracil IV is administered at the midpoint
      of the leucovorin calcium infusion on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every 28 days in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-45 patients will be accrued for this study.
