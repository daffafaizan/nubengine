      intensely or for too long a period. This discomfort is often realized as either pain or
      stiffness in the joint that was the focus of the exercise. For example, one's knees will hurt
      after jogging for several miles, particularly if jogging for the first time. This study is
      intended to evaluate whether the combination of NEM® brand eggshell membrane + KD PUR® brand
      fish oil, commercially available as Move3™ can alleviate joint pain or stiffness, either
      directly following exercise or 12 hours post-exercise versus placebo. The study will also
      evaluate Move3's effect, on cartilage turnover via the cartilage degradation biomarker
      c-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II). Participants will perform a
      minimum of 40 steps per leg utilizing an aerobics step at the clinical site. They will follow
      this exercise regimen on alternating days for 2 consecutive weeks. Changes in pain &
      stiffness (immediate & 12-hour) will be compared to both baseline and to the placebo group.
      Urine samples will also be collected at baseline and at the end of Week 1 & Week 2. The
      change in CTX-II from baseline will be compared to the placebo group.
