      hospital care. In addition, it is used as an anesthetic for planned sexual assault.
      Laboratory analyses will help assess whether today's clinical diagnostics of GHB poisoning
      are precise enough, possibly being a supplement to improve it. Can GHB poisoned patients be
      treated safely by emergency medical services or do these patients need hospitalization?

      In case of substance poisoning induced by others, sampling could identify substances that are
      quickly excreted from the body. Today patients are referred to private laboratories the
      following day, delaying the diagnosis and missing short-term drugs.

      Method: Prospective study. Oral fluid and blood samples will be collected from patients over
      16 years of age where there is a clinical suspicion of GHB poisoning on arrival at Oslo
      Accident and Emergency Outpasient Clinic (Oslo Legevakt) or hospital (OUH Ullev√•l,
      Lovisenberg and Diakonhjemmet). Blood and urine samples will be collected from patients over
      the age of 16 who present at the Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpasient clinic (Oslo
      Legevakt) with suspected substance poisoning induced by others. In both pasient groups the
      investigators will also register age, gender, clinically suspected toxic agents, vital signs,
      clinical features and treatment.

      The aims of this study are to see if the clinical diagnosis of GHB poisoning is precise
      enough, and whether more patients can be handled at an emergency outpatient level.
      Furthermore, analysis of blood and urine samples from patients who suspect they have been
      poisoned by substances induced by others, will be done to identify toxic agents.
