      additional subvalvular mitral apparatus intervention versus additional alfieri stich in
      patients scheduled to septal myectomy for symptomatic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

      Patients with proven hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and resting left ventricle outflow tract
      obstruction underwent septal myectomy. If patients were suitable for both surgical
      techniques, they were randomized to alfieri stich or secondary cord cutting. All surgeons
      were experienced at least 50 related procedures.
