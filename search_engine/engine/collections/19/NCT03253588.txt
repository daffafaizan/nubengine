    
      All surgically-treated ectopic pregnancies in women aged 20 and above between 01 January 2009
      and 31 December 2016 were identified. Cases receiving laparoscopic salpingostomy or
      laparoscopic salpingotomy were extracted from the database, patient characteristics and
      surgical outcomes (changes of serumÎ²-hcg, presence of persistent ectopic pregnancy and
      subsequent management, subsequent pregnancy) were reviewed from their medical records.
      Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were employed to predict the
      presence of persistent ectopic pregnancy after laparoscopic tubal preservation surgery.
