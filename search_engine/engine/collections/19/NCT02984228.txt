      classified into primary and secondary forms. Primary glenohumeral OA is caused by
      degenerative joint disease, inflammatory arthropathies, and neuropathic arthropathy secondary
      to syringomyelia or diabetes. Secondary glenohumeral OA is caused by trauma, postoperative
      changes after arthroscopy or capulorraphy, and osteonecrosis. Hyaluronic acid is found in
      synovial joint fluid and has viscoelastic, chondroprotective, and possibly anti-inflammatory
      properties. It has been shown to increase joint lubrication. Platelet-rich plasma contains
      growth factors that have been shown to promote tissue regeneration. The aim of this study is
      to determine whether injections of hyaluronic acid or platelet-rich plasma can be used
      reliably to decrease pain, restore function, and improve quality of life in patients
      suffering from glenohumeral OA. Patients will be randomized to receive either an injection of
      hyaluronic acid or an injection of platelet-rich plasma. Outcomes will be assessed via
      questionnaires for up to 52 weeks post-procedure.
