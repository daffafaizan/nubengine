      ventricular (LV) dysfunction in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). BiVP improves LV function and
      cardiac index (Cl) at no energy cost. In the MIRACLE trial, in patients with DCM, IVCD and LV
      ejection fraction <35%, demonstrated improved subjective and objective measures of exercise
      tolerance and cardiac function with BiVP. BiVP benefits many, but selection criteria are not
      fully developed, and 30% of recipients are "nonresponders," at a cost of more than $2
      billion/year. Preliminary data suggest that BiVP can benefit patients with low output states
      after cardiac surgery. This study will assess surgical application of BiVP while assessing
      mechanisms of action and optimization. 190 cardiac surgery patients will be randomized with
      LV dysfunction preoperatively to paced and standard of care groups. BiVP will be optimized
      and continued postoperatively until patients are stable. BiVP will be assessed transiently in
      all patients at three time points. The primary end point is a 15% improvement in thermal
      dilution Cl measured in the intensive care unit (ICU). Effects of heart rate,
      atrioventricular delay, ventricular pacing site, and interventricular delay on Cl will be
      assessed using a randomized sequence of data collection. Secondary endpoints include
      incidence of arrhythmias, inotropic support, urine output, weight gain, morbidity, mortality,
      and ICU costs. These studies are important because of a high probability of clinical benefit.
      The methods employed will provide precision, breadth of measurement, and range of pacing
      sites superior to any other setting. The protocol will provide new and important scientific
      information that will benefit not only surgical patients but also the general population of
      BiVP recipients.
