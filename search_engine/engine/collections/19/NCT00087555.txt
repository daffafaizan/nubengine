      debilitating condition. Besides causing pain, it also disrupts normal sleep patterns in many
      of its victims. Pain and lack of sleep reinforce each other, making patients progressively
      more miserable. Xyrem is a potent hypnotic that induces and consolidates sleep. In a few
      small studies Xyrem has been reported to offer relief to some fibromyalgia patients. This
      trial is designed to test this hypothesis. Patients who enroll in this study will stop taking
      any prescription medications for fibromyalgia (over-the-counter pain relievers will be
      permitted). They will then take either Xyrem alone or placebo alone. Patients will be
      followed for eight weeks to evaluate any relief of the pain or functional impairment of
      fibromyalgia from their study treatment. Sleep characteristics will also be assessed
      subjectively and by polysomnographic recordings at baseline and twice during the treatment
      phase.
