    
      Study Design:

      Open-label, single dose study to examine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and virologic
      impact of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in HIV-infected viremic adults.

      Study Hypotheses:

      This is the first study of VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS in HIV-infected viremic adults. The primary
      hypothesis is that both VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS will be safe for intravenous administration
      to HIV-1-infected adults. The secondary hypothesis is that VRC01LS and VRC07-523LS will be
      detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.

      Product Description:

      VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) and VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS) are human monoclonal
      antibodies (MAbs) targeted to the CD4+ binding site of HIV-1. Both MAbs are modifications of
      the VRC01 MAb (which has been shown to be safe and to have antiviral activity in human
      studies) with the addition of the "LS", a 2-amino acid mutation designed to improve the
      half-life of the antibody. These MAbs were developed and manufactured by VRC/NIAID/NIH under
      current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operated under
      contract by the Vaccine Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.,
      Frederick, MD. Vials were provided at 100 mg/mL.

      Participants:

      HIV-1-infected viremic adults; 18-70 years of age.

      Study Plan:

      This study assessed VRC01LS or VRC07-523LS administered at 40 mg/kg IV in HIV-infected
      viremic participants. Participants enrolled in one of two parts: Part A (VRC01LS) or Part B
      (VRC07-523LS). A total of 7 participants were enrolled in Part A and received VRC01LS and a
      total of 9 participants were enrolled in Part B and received VRC07-523LS. Safety lab samples,
      HIV viral load, CD4+ lymphocyte count, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples, and blood samples for
      detection of human anti-VRC01LS antibody (Part A) and human anti-VRC07-523LS antibody (Part
      B) were drawn at baseline and intervals throughout the study. Participants recorded in a
      daily diary reactogenicity symptoms for 3 days after study product administration and were
      queried at each study visit for adverse events. Participants were strongly encouraged to
      initiate 3-drug anti-retroviral therapy (ART), prescribed by their primary HIV clinician; not
      study-provided, any time after completing the day 14 study evaluations.

      VRC 607/A5378 Study Schema:

        -  Part: A; Participants: 7; Product: VRC01LS; Administration Schedule (Day 0): 40 mg/kg
           IV.

        -  Part: B; Participants: 9; Product: VRC07-523LS; Administration Schedule (Day 0): 40
           mg/kg IV.

             -  Total Participants: 16

      Study Duration:

      Participants were followed for 48 weeks after study product administration.
