      combination of the approved cardiovascular drugs dapagliflozin and ambrisentan as potential
      treatments for COVID-19 disease against Standard of Care alone. These agents target the
      dysregulated immune response that drive the severe lung, and other organ, damage frequently
      seen during COVID-19 infection, with an aim to promote a positive vascular response to reduce
      end-organ damage.

      Treatment with EDP1815 will be for up to 7 days, with the option of extension to 14 days at
      the discretion of the PI or their delegate, if the patient is felt to be clinically
      responding to treatment, is tolerating treatment, and is judged to be likely to benefit from
      a longer treatment course. Treatment with combination dapagliflozin and ambrisentan will be
      for up to 14 days. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio across treatments.

      TACTIC-E will use a platform design with interim analysis to make efficient decisions about
      efficacy and futility (e.g. lack of efficacy and risk of harm) of the trial treatments. This
      enables the trial to stop recruiting to arms early where a clear efficacy decision can be
      made. It also allows for the addition of further arms.
