    
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder in which the skin becomes
      extremely itchy and is susceptible to recurrent skin infections. AD is thought to occur from
      a combination of immunological, genetic, and environmental factors.

      Those with atopic dermatitis (AD) often have food allergy and Staphylococcus aureus (S.
      aureus) colonization of the skin. There is evidence suggesting that skin barrier dysfunction,
      measurable as increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), is a predisposing factor to food
      sensitization and food allergy from epicutaneous penetration of environmental food allergens.
      Furthermore, the investigators for this study have identified that AD children with food
      allergy, especially peanut allergy, are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. However, only
      half (50%) of children with AD have food allergy or S. aureus colonization, suggesting there
      are other factors accounting for food allergy. There have been no previous studies of TEWL
      or, microbial or molecular profiling of the skin in those with AD prone to food allergy
      versus AD without food allergy.
