    
      The Overture Study (CA-0005) is a Phase I/II randomized, controlled, single-blind
      multi-center clinical trial using the GammaSense Stimulation device to study safety,
      adherence rates and efficacy in subjects with mild to moderate cognitive impairment (MMSE
      14-26) who are age 55 and older.

      Subjects who pass screening will be randomized (ratio 2:1 Treatment to Control). Subjects and
      their caregivers will be blinded to their randomization group, as will key raters at each
      site. The device will be used for 60 minutes daily during the 6-month therapy phase, followed
      by a one month safety follow-up visit.
