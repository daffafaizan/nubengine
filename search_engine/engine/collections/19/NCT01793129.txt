      focused on infants â‰¥36 weeks GA. Although many interventions have been suggested and assessed
      for prevention or palliation of NE, the only one currently supported by rigorous clinical
      evidence to improve outcome in human newborns has been hypothermia implemented at <6 hours of
      postnatal age and maintained for 72 hrs. Data about diagnosis, frequency, severity, and
      outcome of NE in infants 33-35 weeks GA are sparse.

      This trial will assess safety and effectiveness of whole body hypothermia for 72 hours in
      preterm infants 33-35 weeks gestational age (GA) who present at <6 hrs postnatal age with
      moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy. Infants 33 0/7 to 35 6/7 weeks GA (best
      obstetrical estimate) and greater than or equal to 1500 grams birth weight (selected to
      minimize potential difficulties placing esophageal probe) who meet clinical, biochemical and
      neurologic criteria for moderate to severe NE will be randomized to either whole body
      hypothermia or participate in a non-cooled control group. The primary outcome will be death
      or moderate to severe disability at 18-22 months corrected age. The presence or absence of
      disability will be determined by the standard NRN interdisciplinary follow-up exam.

      Secondary Study includes determining an association between MRI detectable injury and
      neurodevelopment at 18-22 months.
