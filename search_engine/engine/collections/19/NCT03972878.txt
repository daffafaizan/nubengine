      transient rise in blood glucose and lipids. The extent of glycemic and lipidemic postprandial
      responses have been linked to the progression of cardiovascular and other chronic
      degenerative diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer through a substantial increase
      in oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. In addition, some
      studies have shown that consuming a high fat meal is associated with a postprandial increase
      in plasma and serum endotoxin concentrations in humans. LPS, lipopolysaccharide, is
      considered a major predisposing factor for inflammation-associated diseases such as
      atherosclerosis, sepsis and obesity. Therefore, following a correct dietary model may be
      beneficial in order to limit postprandial excursion and to modulate hormonal responses
      involved in satiety.

      The physiological postprandial response depends on several factors, both intrinsic, such as
      natural characteristic of food, and extrinsic, such as the way in which food is processed.
      Thus, the present study aims at evaluating if the reformulation of some commercial
      confectionery products can lead to an improvement of the nutritional profile, through a
      decrease of postprandial metabolic and hormonal, oxidative stress, inflammation and
      endotoxaemia responses in comparison with commercial confectionery products (snacks).
