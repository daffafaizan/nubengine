      represents a much debated controversy. Classic teaching was to immobilize the elbow to reduce
      risk of secondary displacement; however, short arm casts are felt to be equally effective
      with less complications and higher patient comfort. There is currently no conclusive evidence
      for or against immobilization of the elbow in patients treated with cast immobilization.
