      Urinary Incontinence. The goal of this technique is increasing the strength and function of
      the pelvic floor which aims to support the pelvic viscera, as well as part of their duties,
      such as locks sphincter muscles.

      Risk factors such as advanced age, obesity, multiple pregnancy, can cause a woman to present
      urinary incontinence (SUI), where the main cause is the dysfunction of the pelvic floor
      muscles and the lack of awareness of these muscles as well as biomechanical problems.

      Some studies describe the use of EMG biofeedback to assess and improve the function of the
      pelvic floor muscles, however, the studies are not yet conclusive about the action of adding
      this equipment in the treatment of SUI.

      In this regard, the EMG Biofeedback has the ability to physiologically evaluate these
      disorders and perform a faster treatment for these patients, improving their quality of life.
      The EMG has the ability to monitor and measure the progression of activation of the pelvic
      floor muscles, giving feedback to the patient and therapist about the actual condition of
      muscle function.
