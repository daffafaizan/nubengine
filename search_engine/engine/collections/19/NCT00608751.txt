      weekly during radiation treatment. We will analyze these measurements in order to evaluate
      whether we need to adjust our treatment procedures for the remainder of the treatments. We
      might adjust the dose of radiation received to specific organs in order to try to minimize
      the amount of radiation the healthy tissue receives.
