      shown to improve the quality of decisions and reduce burden on the decision maker in multiple
      clinical settings, yet almost none have focused on life-sustaining treatments in acute
      critical illness such as stroke. This study proposes a comprehensive frame shift in how the
      health care team and surrogates collaborate on decisions regarding life-sustaining treatments
      for acute illness, by developing a tailored web-based stroke decision support intervention.
      This web-based tool will be developed for use by the surrogate decision maker during the
      acute stroke hospitalization and will be designed to facilitate high quality patient-centered
      decisions and minimize adverse effects on the surrogate.

      The two project phases are: 1) Decision support intervention development; and 2) Pilot
      testing in surrogates of hospitalized stroke patients. A novel ordinal prognostic model will
      be developed and incorporated into the tool.

      The project expects 25 surrogate-patient pairs in the control group, and 25 surrogate-patient
      pairs in the intervention group, which equals a total of 100 subjects.
