      exercise prescriptions for youth who sustain mild traumatic brain injury that can help to
      alleviate mild traumatic brain injury symptoms, reduce the risk of persistent post-concussion
      symptoms, and improve psychosocial outcomes. The overall objectives of this application are
      to prospectively (1) determine if a prescribed exercise program initiated within the first
      week of mild traumatic brain injury can reduce the risk of developing persistent
      post-concussion symptoms and (2) examine the effects of an exercise program on psychosocial,
      sleep, and pain outcomes when initiated within 7 days of injury and continued for two months.
      The investigators will address these objectives by testing the central hypotheses that those
      assigned to an exercise intervention will have lower risk of developing persistent
      post-concussion symptoms and will report lower anxiety, depression, and pain interference
      ratings, higher peer relationship ratings, and better sleep quality ratings compared to usual
      care. In order to achieve this, the investigators will use a block stratified randomized
      intervention design. Block stratified randomization procedures will be conducted according to
      standard procedures so that sample numbers are equally assigned to each group, selected due
      to the relatively small sample size of the proposed study. Participants will be identified,
      enrolled, and assessed within 5 days of mild traumatic brain injury, randomized to an
      exercise intervention or usual care group 3-7 days after mild traumatic brain injury, and
      follow-up with in person assessments at approximately one and two months post-injury.
