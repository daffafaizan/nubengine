      and without contrast) of the brain and neck and who require sedation to perform this
      examination will be asked to participate in the study. These infants represent a potentially
      ideal population in which to study the upper airway. They are already undergoing MR/CT, their
      upper airways images are recorded, are asleep, and do not typically have airway
      abnormalities. In these children, 2 images of the upper airways -one obtained while with and
      one obtained while without a pacifier -will be analyzed and compared. In no case will
      additional sedation be given to obtain the MR/CT images of the airway. If the patient begins
      to wake up during the investigational sequence, the sequence will be aborted.

      To test our hypothesis using the functional method, we will compare LRT aerosol penetration
      with and without a pacifier.

      Infants who are regular pacifier users and are receiving therapeutic aerosols regularly
      (e.g., ventolin, budicort) will be studied. Labeling the aerosol particles with a gamma
      emitting isotope marker and quantifying its deposition scintigraphically by means of a gamma
      camera is a simple, safe and commonly used method to assess aerosol deposition throughout the
      URT and LRT.
