      on postoperative pain was conducted, to date. Therefore, the goal of this study is to
      evaluate whether patients who receive a paracervical block of 5% bupivacaine with epinephrine
      at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy would have lower postoperative pain, with less
      consumption of rescue analgesics than patients who receive a paracervical block of normal
      saline.
