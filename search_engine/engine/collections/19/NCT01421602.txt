      lightweight mesh in open inguinal hernia under both under regional and local anesthesia in
      the Philippines. The primary endpoint of which is to assess the recurrence rate at 2 years
      (with an interim analysis 1 year after the procedure). Secondary endpoints would be to gather
      data with regards to postoperative pain, post operative surgical complications, wound healing
      complications, operating factors (mesh deployment time, total operating time), hernia factors
      (type and size of inguinal hernia).
