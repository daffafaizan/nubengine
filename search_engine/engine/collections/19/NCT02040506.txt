    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of IGN523 administered weekly

        -  Determine the MTD and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of IGN523 when administered weekly
           during the DLT Evaluation Period

        -  Identify a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IGN523 on the basis of safety, PK, and PD
           data

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assess the incidence of antibody formation to IGN523

        -  Characterize the PK of IGN523 in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML

        -  Perform a preliminary assessment of the anti-leukemic activity of IGN523 in subjects
           with relapsed or refractory AML

        -  Perform a preliminary assessment of biologic markers that might predict IGN523
           anti-leukemic activity
