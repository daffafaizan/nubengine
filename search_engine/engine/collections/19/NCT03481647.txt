      duration of mucositis in patients undergoing treatment for cancer in the head and neck
      region. The oral care programme consists of professional oral care and swabbing of the
      mucosal membranes with a saline/bicarbonate solution once a week. The patients are instructed
      to rinse with a saline/bicarbonate solution 5 times per day. They are given an oral care
      diary to help them keep track of their daily oral hygiene measures and rinses. Repeated oral
      hygiene instructions are given if needed.

      Patients in the control group get professional oral care once a week.
