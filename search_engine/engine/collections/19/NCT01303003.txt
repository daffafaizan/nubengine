      receive either 20 cc of 0.125% bupivicaine with or without 2 mg of dexamethasone on each side
      of their abdomen (40 cc and 4 mg in total) and patients who receive the dexamethasone will be
      compared with patients who did not receive it. In the second phase, we will assess whether
      patients can serve as their own controls by adding dexamethasone only to one side of the
      block (one side of the abdomen) and comparing pain relief/efficacy with the contra-lateral
      plain local anesthetic effect. The study will assess pain relief, opioid consumption, level
      of blockade, and operator's prospective assessment of likely efficacy, based on the
      ultrasound visualization of the local anesthetic injection as compared with actual efficacy.
