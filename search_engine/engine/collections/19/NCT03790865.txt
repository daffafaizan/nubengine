        1. The first part is a Phase 2b dose-response study consisting of a 3-month double-blind,
           placebo-controlled Core Period followed by a 9-month Extension Period.

        2. The second part is a Phase 3 study consisting of a 6-month double-blind,
           placebo-controlled Core Period followed by a 6-month Extension Period. Phase 3 may be
           initiated following review of safety and efficacy results at the completion of the Phase
           2b Core Period.

      A total of approximately 50 patients per group (8 to 65 years of age) will be randomized
      (approximately 150 patients in total). In addition to this cohort of 150 patients, a separate
      cohort of patients 4 to 7 years of age will also be randomized.

      Note: The 8-65 year old cohort has been fully enrolled. Enrollment into the 4-7 year age
      cohort remains ongoing.
