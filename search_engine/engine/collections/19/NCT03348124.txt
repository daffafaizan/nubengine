      their process of deciding about parenthood. A feasibility study showed that it is possible to
      evaluate an intervention using the chosen instruments among students with ID in order to
      provide them with further insights about parenthood. Methods: Randomization of eleven
      clusters/schools to intervention and eleven clusters to waiting-list control. Intervention
      includes thirteen educational lessons and a three-day and night caring-session with the RCB
      simulator. Intervention will be given 1-2 lessons/week during 8-14 weeks. Data will be
      collected with questionnaires and interviews before and after intervention. In control group:
      Before and after waiting-list time and after intervention.
