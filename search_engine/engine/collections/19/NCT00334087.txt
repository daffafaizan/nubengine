      caries. The value of a pre- perinatal preventive approach is currently being examined in the
      dental literature. At Hadassah, a Pilot Study is currently underway to test the feasibility
      of a comprehensive Baby Clinic designed to prevent Severe Early Childhood Caries. The pilot
      study in cooperation with the Woman's Health Center and with the midwives and the
      breastfeeding counselors of the maternity unit. Lectures are given by pediatric dentists to
      parents of firstborn children attending Hadassah's Birth Preparation Class, emphasis is given
      to the importance of breastfeeding and other feeding habits in the emotional, physical,
      nutritional and immunological development of the future baby. In addition the effect of these
      feeding habits on the dental/oral aspects, relevant for the developing dentition.

      After birth the parents are invited to come with their babies around 12 months for the first
      dental examination and follow up according to individual risk for caries development. The
      current proposed study will be a control group from offspring of women who have participated
      previous Sessions Hadassah's Birth Preparation Class ("Historical Controls" before the Baby
