      following goals

        -  Ability of participants to utilize a smart phone application for self-monitoring
           behavior change of physical activity, fruit/vegetable consumption, and sleep. This would
           include entering data on fruit/vegetable consumption, hours of sleep and monitoring
           feedback.

        -  Ability of participants to wear Actigraph accelerometer 24 hours/day and complete a
           sleep log for measurement of physical activity and sleep.

        -  Ability of Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) software to collect adequate
           nutrition data.

      The intervention is a unique combination of two individual counseling sessions and the
      utilization of a combination of a smartphone application and the use of a Fitbit physical
      activity monitor. The individual sessions will provide a tailored personalized intervention
      including problem-solving and goal setting for increasing physical activity, consumption of
      more fruits and vegetables, and getting more sleep. Healthy Lifestyle Coaches (RN or Exercise
      Physiologist) will be responsible for conducting the individual sessions for a limited
      caseload of participants.

      Individual sessions will

        -  utilize motivational interviewing techniques to enhance motivation for meeting
           individualized physical activity, dietary/nutritional and sleep goals

        -  identify specific barriers and supports leading to tailored intervention to increase
           program success (The Arthritis Comprehensive Treatment Assessment)

        -  provide emotional support

      Self-monitoring of behavior change

        -  On a daily basis, participants will log fruit/vegetable consumption and hours of sleep
           via a smartphone application and receive feedback

        -  On a daily basis, participants will monitor their physical activity via the Fitbit and
           receive feedback on the smartphone.

      Online activities will include communication between the client and coach in between and
      after scheduled intervention visits.
