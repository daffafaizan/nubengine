      superficial cryotherapy results in improved Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) scores among
      pregnant women with posterior pelvic girdle pain. The investigators hypothesize that
      superficial cryotherapy, in addition to receipt of an educational pamphlet, will result in
      improved NPRS scores compared to receipt of an educational pamphlet alone.

      This study will include English-speaking pregnant women presenting to Loyola University
      Medical Center obstetrics or rehabilitation clinics in their second or third trimester with
      posterior pelvic girdle pain, defined as an NPRS score > 2 onset within the past 3 months and
      pain experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the
      vicinity of the sacroiliac joints (SIJ). The pain may radiate in the posterior thigh and can
      also occur in conjunction with/or separately in the [pubic] symphysis. NPRS scores will be
      measured as a continuous, numerical integer ranging from a value of 0 (No pain) to a value of
      10 (Worst possible pain).
