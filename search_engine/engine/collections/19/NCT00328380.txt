      occurring in 60% or more of international travelers to high-risk areas. It can be quite
      debilitating for the usual 2 to 4 days of the illness and may lead to disruption of travel
      plans. Findings from recent studies have indicated that the chronic post-travel illness may
      prove to be of greater clinical and public health significance than the acute illness.
      Specifically, persistent diarrhea has been reported in 2% to 10% of travelers developing
      diarrhea. Moreover, bacterial enterocolitis, including that associated with TD, leads to
      post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome in 4% to 31% of patients.
