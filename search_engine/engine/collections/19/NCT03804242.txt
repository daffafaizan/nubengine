      finalize the intervention protocol, assess feasibility and acceptability of the intervention,
      and evaluate the potential impact of BYM on pilot participants. The mixed-methods research
      design approach will be used within a single study for the collection, analyzing, and merging
      of qualitative and quantitative data. The purpose of a convergent parallel mixed methods
      research design is to simultaneously collect qualitative and quantitative data for a more
      comprehensive analysis.

      Research Questions: (1) What do Black adolescents and other community stakeholders perceive
      as the most effective approaches for the BYM project? (2) What are BYM participants'
      perceptions of the intervention? (3) Is there a decrease in mental health symptoms (e.g.,
      depression, anxiety, trauma) for BYM participants? (3) Is there an increase in resiliency for
      BYM participants? (4) Is there an increase in positive attitudes toward seeking mental health
      treatment for BYM participants? (5) Is there a difference in motivation to approach
      goal-oriented outcomes for BYM participants? (6) Is there an increase in perceived positive
      self-concept for BYM participants? (7) Is there a decrease in risk behaviors for BYM
      participants? Intervention Description: The session topics are as follows: (1) Debunking the
