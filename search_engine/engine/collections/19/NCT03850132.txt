    
      This clinical trial is part of a broader research study (registered trial intervention
      ISRCTN21786830) which aimed to evaluate a palliative care nurse-led family-oriented
      intervention Family-Strengths Oriented Therapeutic Conversation (FAM-SOTC) to support family
      caregivers of a close relative with advanced/final stage cancer, in the context of the family
      when receiving specialized palliative home-care. The purpose of the current trial is to
      investigate the effects of the FAM-SOTC intervention when additionally delivering the third
      session of the intervention in this trial; an adapted version; FAM-SOTC Post-Loss and
      repeated post-intervention measures at 3, 5 and six months post-loss completed by bereaved
      family caregivers who have prior participated in the FAM-SOTC trial intervention pre-loss are
      compared to measures at 3, 5 and six months post-loss among bereaved family caregivers in a
      control group who received usual care pre- and post-loss from the palliative home-care unit.
      The FAM-SOTC intervention and the FAM-SOTC Post Loss intervention is delivered simultaneously
      in two separate clinical trials, where two sessions were delivered pre-loss (FAM-SOTC) and
      one session delivered post-loss (FAM-SOTC-PL).
