      suppression endorectal coil MRI results predict for biochemical control following
      radiotherapy with androgen suppression in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a baseline endorectal coil MRI, followed by total androgen
      suppression (TAS) with either leuprolide IM or subcutaneous goserelin once a month plus oral
      flutamide 3 times a day for 2 months. Patients then receive a second endorectal coil MRI,
      followed by 2 months of external-beam radiotherapy plus TAS. Patients may receive an
      additional 2 months of TAS at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients are followed
      every 6 months for 3 years, then yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 180 patients (approximately 60 per year) will be accrued for
      this study over a 34 months.
