      I. To evaluate the ability of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition using suberoylanilide
      hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (vorinostat) to induce expression of the estrogen receptor (ER) and
      progesterone receptor (PR) genes in solid human triple negative invasive breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat 400 mg daily orally (PO) on days 1-21 followed by surgery within
      14 days.
