      local health services informed by behavioural science can be used to increase a desired
      behaviour (e.g. uptake of health checks, reducing missed appointments).

      This trial will determine whether an invitation letter, informed by behavioural insights and
      sent through a central system (Child Health Information System, CHIS), can increase uptake of
      childhood flu vaccine in primary care.

      The trial will take place within the existing national childhood immunisation programme in
      the participating area in England. Randomisation will be clustered at the primary care
      practice level. Outcome data will be anonymised, routinely collected, individual-level
      influenza vaccine uptake data extracted from CHIS. For CHIS data validation purposes,
      practice-level vaccine uptake data reported through an alternative, routine system will be
      collected. Data will be collected on additional invitations/communications that primary care
      practices (in both the intervention and control arms) send to their patients. Cost data for
      the centralised letter will also be obtained.

      The analysis will investigate the main effect of the intervention on uptake of the flu
      vaccination for all eligible children included in the trial. The model will include primary
      care practice and Clinical Commissioning Group effects to account for clustering. Secondary
      analysis will investigate the impact of such individual factors as age, immunisation history
      and socioeconomic status and practice-level factors (e.g. direct communication from
      practices) on uptake of the flu vaccination.
