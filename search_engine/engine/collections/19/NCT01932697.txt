      I. To assess the cumulative incidence of local/regional failure at 2 years after study
      registration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the rate of acute grade 3 or higher functional mucosal adverse events (up
      to 1 month post-radiation therapy [XRT]) associated with adjuvant docetaxel +
      hyperfractionated radiotherapy (key secondary endpoint).

      II. To assess changes in overall survival, disease-free survival, distant failure rates, and
      quality of life (QOL) associated with adjuvant docetaxel and hyperfractionated radiation.

      III. To characterize other acute adverse events (up to 1 month post-XRT) and late grade 3 or
      higher non-hematologic adverse events (up to 2 years post-XRT) associated with adjuvant
      docetaxel + hyperfractionated radiotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the genetic alterations of oropharynx tumor specimens and the detection rate
      of corresponding cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) in the pre-surgical, post-surgical,
      and post-radiation blood of oropharynx cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 8 and undergo
      hyperfractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) twice daily (BID) 5 days a
      week on days 1-12 for a total of 20 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days, 1 month, every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for 2 years.
