      education program (IBEP) which incorporates simulation education, mindfulness training,
      professional support targeting the self-efficacy of participants is of vital importance. A
      randomized controlled trial of an integrated breastfeeding education program focusing on
      participants will be designed with two study objectives: 1) to evaluate the effects of IBEP
      on the primary outcome measures of breastfeeding practice as following: a) early initiation
      of breastfeeding, b) exclusive breastfeeding rate, c) predominate breastfeeding rate; 2) to
      examine the effects of IBEP on the secondary outcome measures, psychosocial correlates of
      exclusive breastfeeding including a) breastfeeding self-efficacy, b)anxiety, c) depression,
      d) mindful awareness e) infant feeding attitude. These objectives will be examined among
      participants in six time periods: a) during pregnancy 24 to 32 weeks education program b) 34
      to 40 weeks of pregnancy (after class or third trimester), c)1 week, d) 4weeks, d) 3 months,
      e) 6 months postpartum, while the indicators of breastfeeding practice will be examined at
      the four periods following delivery.

      It is hypothesized that 1) the intervention will result in a better effect on all primary
      outcome measures, as compared to those in the control group. Specifically, participants in
      IBEP group will show 10 % or greater difference in exclusive breastfeeding rates at six
      months than participants in the control group, 2) participants in the IBEP group will
      demonstrate larger effects on breastfeeding self-efficacy and mindfulness, and lower anxiety
      and depression than those in the control group.
