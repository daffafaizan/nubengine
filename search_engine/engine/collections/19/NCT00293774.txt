      health measures for patients that are treated by orthopedic surgeons for degenerative joint
      disease of the hip in Alberta. This study is provincial initiative to determine whether new
      alternative hip bearing surfaces improve patient outcomes and/or decrease health resource
      utilization in patients with degenerative joint disease of the hip in Alberta. The primary
      objective is to compare time to revision for patients receiving alternative hip bearing
      surfaces to patients receiving conventional total hip replacements. Secondary objectives are
      to evaluate long-term safety; to evaluate costs; to determine if alternative hip bearing
      surfaces improve patient function; to develop evidence base guidelines for the implementation
      of alternative hip bearing surfaces in Alberta; do develop a modal to assess other
      technologies and health advances; to develop an Alberta HIP registry
