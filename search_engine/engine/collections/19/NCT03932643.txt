    
      This is a single-center pilot study of 20 patients with AML/MDS. Eligible patients will be
      enrolled following an informed consent between 6-20 weeks after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant. Patients will receive weekly oral ONC 201 for a total of 52 weeks.

      The objectives of the study are: 1. To determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of ONC
      201 maintenance therapy among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS), who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 2. To investigate
      the impact of ONC 201 on reconstitution of NK and other immune cells.

      Patients will be monitored for toxicities (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events, CTCAE version 5.0), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone
      Marrow Transplant, FACT-BMT), and immunologic changes. We will specifically investigate the
      impact of ONC 201 on reconstitution of NK and other immune cells. We will also examine
      changes in functional status (Karnofsky Performance Scale, KPS, instrumental activities of
      daily living and short physical performance battery), rates of disease relapse and mortality.
