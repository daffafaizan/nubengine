      consultation with an orthoptist for measurement of visual acuity, measurement of ocular tone
      by pulsed air tonometer, retinography pictures (9 photographs: one of the posterior pole and
      8 of the retinal periphery) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), results are evaluated
      on-site by an ophthalmologist and then sent through a secure medical online application to an
      ophthalmologist expert in RD for assessment. Each patient is his own control.
