      to the limited availability of existing treatment programs and to a range of societal and
      individual-level barriers, including the stigma associated with identifying oneself as a
      substance user and difficulty attending a treatment program on a regular basis.
      Technology-based interventions have potential to help address these barriers and to expand
      access to evidence-based psychosocial treatment. Automated, computer-based interventions have
      found high user acceptance and utilization and shown promise in treating substance use
      disorders. The current study will evaluate a text-message-based psychosocial program called
      PIER1 (Preventing and Interrupting Early Relapse 1) when delivered to treatment-seeking
      opioid-dependent emergency department (ED) patients. PIER1 is an interactive program based on
      the Relapse Prevention Model. It is also informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and
      motivational interviewing.
