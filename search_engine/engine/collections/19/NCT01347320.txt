      During the last two decades, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the prostate has evolved to
      become a promising tool in preoperative evaluation of prostate cancer. Several studies have
      evaluated the radiological and histopathological correlation. However, the sensitivity and
      specificity in regard to staging have shown wide ranges and poor reproducibility. These
      discrepancies can be explained by difference in patient selection, MRI methods, and criteria
      used for diagnosis. More studies are therefore needed to evaluate the clinical impact of
      preoperative MRI in patients with prostate cancer.

      Aims of the study:

      To evaluate 1) detection rate of tumor 1-3 (tumor 1 = index tumor), size of tumor 1-3,
      possible extraprostatic extension and predict presence of Gleason grade 4 and 5 tumor, 2) the
      influence of preoperative MRI on the surgical decision process with respect to the operative
      procedure for removal of the gland and pelvic lymph node dissection, and 3) the impact of
      preoperative MRI on the rate of positive surgical margins and functional results.

      Material and method:

      A prospective study including 400 consecutive patients referred to robot assisted
      laparoscopic prostatectomy randomised to preoperative MRI (intervention group) and no MRI
      (control group). The prostatectomy specimens will be histopathologically examined, and TNM
      classification will be performed according to 2002 AJCC standard.
