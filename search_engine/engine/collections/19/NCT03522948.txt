      alcohol use and sex risk behavior among among men who have sex with men. The study seeks to
      recruit MSM who are non-monogamous, have engaged in unprotected anal intercourse over the
      past 3 months, and who have engaged in heavy drinking defined as > 14 drinks per week or at
      least 1 heavy drinking episode (5+ drinks on a single occasion) in the past month. All
      participants will complete baseline measures about past month behavior and if eligible will
      be assigned to the intervention condition. This intervention consists of a single brief
      in-person intervention coupled with 4 weeks of text messaging related to individualized goals
      about alcohol use and sexual behavior. Follow-up assessments are scheduled for within 1 week
      of completion of the text messaging component of the intervention. Primary outcomes are
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and message components. Secondary outcomes
      are changes in frequency of unprotected intercourse and heavy drinking episodes.
