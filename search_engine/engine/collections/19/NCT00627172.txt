      widespread diagnostic method to diagnose coronary artery disease. When performed with a
      64-detector (slice) CT, its strength is an excellent negative predictive value, NPV (98%).
      Specificity (86%) is good but the positive predictive value (PPV) is only moderate (70%).
      This is due to the ability of MDCTA to detect even minor vessel wall changes before they are
      functionally significant, and the tendency of CT to overestimate the volume of dense
      calcifications. However, when coupled with a functional or flow-sensitive diagnostic test,
      such as PET perfusion or coronary doppler ultrasonography, one can assume that even the PPV
      may be as high as 95 %. Despite this assumption, there's no scientific evidence to support
      use of such hybrid multi-modality tests at present.

      Our hypothesis is that improving the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive diagnosis of
      coronary artery disease will decrease the proportion of patients that need catheter
      angiographies. The avoidance of these unnecessary invasive procedures will improve patientsÂ´
      quality of life and may even redirect health care resources in a more efficient way.
