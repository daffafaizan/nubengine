      3-nitro-4-hydoxyphenylacetic acid) in blood, sputum, urine and exhaled breath condensate will
      be evaluated. We will also evaluate exhaled and nasal NO in a population of mild asthmatics
      in order to obtain baseline and variability data for future clinical studies involving
      asthmatic subjects.
