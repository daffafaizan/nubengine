      advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma receive 800 mg Pazopanib daily. After 14 days the
      Pazopanib plasma concentration is determined. In patients who show good tolerability and
      plasma trough levels of ≤ 20 µg/mLthe daily dose is increased in 200 mg steps until plasma
      trough levels of > 20 µg/mL are achieved or dose-limiting toxicities occur, a daily dose of
      1600 mg is reached, or there is disease progression.

      After each dose optimization the plasma concentration is determined after 14 days (day
      11-15). If indicated, dose optimization is performed 21 days after the previous dose
      optimization (on day 18-24).
