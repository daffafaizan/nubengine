      survival with a portion of patients proceeding to resection. This trial will incorporate a
      similar trial structure using newer agents in patients who present with locally advanced
      unresectable pancreatic cancer. Specifically oxaliplatin will be used owing to its greater
      activity in comparison to cisplatin and favorable therapeutic index in combination with
      radiation compared to gemcitabine.

      In summary, the primary outcome measure of the phase I portion of the trial is to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose of this combination. Following the determination of this dose, the
      phase II portion of the trial will characterize the toxicity of this regimen as well as
      evaluate for long-term efficacy.
