      into the pleural space to remove the fluid both for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons. In
      this setting, large amounts (often liters) of fluid are removed to palliate the patient's
      symptoms of breathlessness.

      Thoracentesis is the most commonly performed and least invasive method to remove pleural
      fluid. These frequently performed using a catheter drainage system where a small, flexible
      temporary catheter is inserted over a needle into the pleural cavity. After insertion of
      catheter into the pleural space, the operator has two drainage system options: 1. Manual
      drainage via syringe-pump that connects to drainage bag or 2. Drainage into a vacuum bottle.
      Both are routinely performed in almost every hospital in the United States.

      Pleural pressure (Ppl) is determined by the elastic recoil properties of the lung and chest
      wall. Normal pleural pressure is estimated to be -3 to -5 cm H20 at functional residual
      capacity. During drainage of pleural fluid, negative pressure is applied either via syringe
      during manual drainage or via vacuum using vacuum drainage bottle. Hypothetically more
      negative pressure can translate to increased perception of pain or visceral pleural injury.

      Two techniques (manual vs vacuum drainage) are used based on the operator preference and both
      are standard of care. To our knowledge there is no head to head comparison of these two
      available systems of drainages during thoracentesis of pleural effusions. Knowing if one is
      superior to the other will aid future clinicians.
