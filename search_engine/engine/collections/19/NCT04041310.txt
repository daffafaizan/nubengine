      vaccines are administered intramuscularly using 1 prime with the GAd20-209-FSP and 3 boosts
      with MVA-209-FSP in combination with the licensed programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)-blocking
      antibody pembrolizumab in adult patients with unresectable or metastatic dMMR or MSI-H CRC,
      gastric, or G-E junction tumors. GAd20-209-FSP prime will be administered on the day of 2nd
      pembrolizumab infusion (week 4); MVA-209-FSP boosts will be administered on the day of 3rd,
      4th and 5th pembrolizumab infusion (weeks 7 and 10 and 13).

      The study (as per Protocol v4.0 dated 14 April 2020) is composed of a Main Study lasting 26
      weeks and an Extended Follow-up from week 27 to week 106 of anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor
      pembrolizumab SOC treatment and further 4 weeks following cessation of pembrolizumab
      treatment for safety follow-up until week 110.

      Main Study:

      The Main Study (26 weeks duration) is composed of two sequential cohorts. Cohort A (dose
      escalation cohort) will determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for IP in combination
      with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or
      metastatic dMMR or MSI-H CRC, gastric, or G-E junction tumors. Cohort B will expand the
      Cohort A in the same patients' population at the RP2D of IP in combination with
      pembrolizumab.

      Extended Follow-up:

      After week 26, treatment with pembrolizumab will continue up to week 106, unless there is
      documented disease progression (investigators may decide to continue pembrolizumab treatment
      beyond progression in specific circumstances), unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent
      illness that prevents further administration of treatment, Investigator's decision to
      withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with
      trial treatment or procedure requirements, or administrative reasons.

      At the end of Extended Follow-Up (week 106), or before, if pembrolizumab treatment was
      prematurely discontinued, each subject will be followed for 4 additional weeks (up to week
      110) for adverse event monitoring.
