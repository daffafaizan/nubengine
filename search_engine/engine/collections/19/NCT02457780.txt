      for patients with both mental and physical health problems. A leading mind-body treatment is
      the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP) developed at Harvard. This treatment has
      been shown to reduce both mental and physical health symptoms.

      The objective of this study is to adapt the 3RP to WTC responders and test its ability to
      reduce both PTSD and respiratory symptoms. This treatment will be compared to a Health
      Enhancement Program that addresses negative health behaviors. The investigators will randomly
      assign 175 patients with ongoing WTC-related PTSD and respiratory illness to the 3RP or
      Health Enhancement Program and will assess outcomes immediately after the treatment and at 3
      and 6 month follow-ups.
