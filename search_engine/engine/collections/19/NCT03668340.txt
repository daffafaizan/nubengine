    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD1775 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The "investigational drug" AZD1775 is being given alone to patients with this type of cancer.
      AZD1775 is also being studied in lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and other solid tumors
      throughout the world. AZD1775 blocks the activity of Wee1, a protein that helps to regulate
      how cells divide and grow. Certain cancer cells may be more vulnerable to having this process
      blocked. This study is being done to assess the safety and effectiveness of AZD1775 to learn
      if AZD1775 works in treating this type of cancer.
