    
      This program consists of 3 separate studies: a 48-week Phase 2 dose-ranging study (GALAXI 1)
      and two 48-week Phase 3 confirmatory studies (GALAXI 2 and GALAXI 3). In Phase 2, safety and
      efficacy of guselkumab dose regimens will be evaluated to support the selection of induction
      and maintenance dose regimens for confirmatory evaluation in Phase 3. Participants who
      complete the 48-week Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies may be eligible to enter the long term
      extension (LTE). Throughout the 3 studies, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, biomarkers, and safety
      will be assessed.
