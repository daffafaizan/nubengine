      surgical clinics. They will be asked to attend the Greenfield Human Physiology Laboratory
      where they will be asked to complete two questionnaires. In addition, a sample of blood, and
      a small sample of muscle and fat from their thigh will be taken. They will undergo a low dose
      X-ray (DXA scan) and an insulin clamp. The insulin clamp involves being connected to an
      insulin and glucose drip for around four hours during which their blood pressure and pulse is
      monitored and regular blood samples are taken.

      Participants will be allocated randomly to one of two groups. One group will receive a
      carbohydrate (sugar) drink before surgery and the other group will receive a dummy (placebo)
      drink.

      On the day of surgery, pre-operative checks and assessment will proceed as normal. After the
      participant is asleep under anaesthetic, a blood sample and tummy muscle and fat samples will
      be taken by the surgeon through the surgical incision. At the end of surgery, another blood
      sample and muscle and fat samples from the tummy and thigh will be taken while the
      participant is still under anaesthetic.

      On the day after surgery, a further blood test and tummy and thigh muscle and fat sample will
      be taken. Participants will also undergo another insulin clamp.

      The research team will follow participants' progress after surgery, but the decision to allow
      them home will be made by the medical team responsible for their care.
