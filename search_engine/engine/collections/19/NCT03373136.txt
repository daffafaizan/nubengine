      small colorectal polyp, 4 to10 mm in size, from multiple centers in Taiwan. Subjects who are
      less than 40 years old and has contraindication will be excluded from this study. All the
      candidates for enrollment will sign the inform consent at the outpatient clinic. Once the
      candidate has the target lesion, polyp sized 4 to 10 mm, at colonoscopy will be randomized
      into either cold snaring or hot snaring polypectomy group. In the group with cold snaring,
      polypectomy will be done without electrocautery. In the hot snaring group, the polypectomy
      will be performed with electrocautery. The bowel preparation and colonoscopy insertion are
      the same in both groups as conventional colonoscopy method. The colonoscopy will be performed
      by experienced endoscopies who performed more than 100 polypectomies per year.
