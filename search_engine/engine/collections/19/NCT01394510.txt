      can exacerbate beta-cell dysfunction with oxidative stress proposed as a major mediator of
      this "glucotoxic" effect. High glucose levels have also been shown to contribute to vascular
      dysfunction and inflammation and these adverse responses decreased with the use of
      antioxidants. The hypothesis is that antioxidants improve beta-cell function in individuals
      with elevated glucose levels by decreasing oxidative stress. In this study the investigators
      will specifically test whether the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can improve beta-cell
      function in individuals with type 2 diabetes by decreasing oxidative stress.

      This initial study will be a dose finding study to determine the tolerability of 600 mg
      versus 1200 mg twice a day of NAC and the effects of NAC treatment on beta-cell function,
      glucose tolerance and oxidative stress markers in persons with type 2 diabetes. Study
      procedures will include a fasting urine sample and performance of a 2 hour 75 gram oral
      glucose tolerance test at baseline, after 2 weeks on 600 mg twice daily NAC and again after 2
      more weeks on 1200 mg NAC twice a day.
