      and efficacy. The study hypothesis is that mirtazapine could also be used in demented with
      sleep disorders.

      Sleep disorders (SD) affects 35 to 50 percent of patients with Alzheimer Disease (AD). These
      disorders often make caring for patients at home very difficult and It's also associated with
      higher risk of institutionalization and increases health care costs. Treatment of SD in
      people with dementia may benefit both patients and their caregivers. However, little is known
      about the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for treating sleep disturbances in AD.
