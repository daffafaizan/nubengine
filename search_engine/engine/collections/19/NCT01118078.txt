      I. To assess genomic gains and losses in high risk renal tumors, including up to 80 favorable
      histology Wilms tumors that relapse (RFHWT), 50 anaplastic Wilms tumors (UHWT), 15 clear cell
      sarcomas of the kidney (CCSK), and 40 rhabdoid tumors (RT) using a high density genetic
      platform to survey for recurrent copy number variations and allelic imbalances. II. To define
      transcription patterns within 80 RFHWT, 50 UHWT, 15 CCSK, and 40 RT using a high throughput
      platform for global gene expression. III. To define DNA methylation patterns within 80 RFHWT,
      50 UHWT, 15 CCSK, and 40 RT using a high throughput platform. IV. To identify genetic
      mutations involved in the pathogenesis of Wilms tumor, and in the development of relapse and
      anaplasia through the study of 80 RFHWT, 50 UHWT, 15 CCSK, and 40 RT using next generation
      sequencing tools.

      V. To facilitate the integration of the above databases and allow meaningful access by
      investigators through the infrastructure provided by TARGET, including its data portal and
      associated caBIG tool.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for DNA copy number determination, gene
      expression, DNA methylation, and genomic re-sequencing by array-based methods, including PCR
      analysis, methylation-specific reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), and quantitative RT-PCR.
