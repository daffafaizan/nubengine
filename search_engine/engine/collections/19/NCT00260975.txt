      and memory. This has been referred to as chemo fog. The current study will investigate this
      phenomenon by measuring neuropsychological functioning in early stage breast cancer patients
      prior to and after exposure to chemotherapy, and by comparing change in cognitive function in
      patients who receive chemotherapy to similar breast cancer patients receiving hormonal
      therapy only.
