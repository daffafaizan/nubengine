        -  To test the influence of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human lymphocyte
           antigen (HLA) genotype on response to anti-CD20 antibody lymphoma immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE: DNA samples are analyzed for killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human
      lymphocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping with sequence-specific primers (SSP) by real-time PCR.
      KIR and HLA typing are analyzed according to KIR-HLA matched vs mismatched, KIR B haplotype
      content, and the number of inhibitory KIR-HLA pairs. Results are then correlated to each
      patient's overall response and duration of response to rituximab.
