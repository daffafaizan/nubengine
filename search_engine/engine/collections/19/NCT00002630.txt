      with multiple myeloma treated with high-dose melphalan (L-PAM) and total-body irradiation
      (TBI) followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) rescue. II. Assess the efficacy of
      intravenous L-PAM and TBI for treatment of relapsing/refractory myeloma. III. Assess the
      tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in patients with relapsing multiple myeloma. IV.
      Assess response rate and survival of relapsing/refractory patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Prior to entry, patients will have received 3 monthly courses of standard VAD
      followed by PBSC collection on Regimen A; those who responded to VAD continue standard VAD to
      best response and upon relapse (on or off therapy) proceed to Regimen B. Patients with no
      response to 3 courses of VAD and those with no response to an alkylating-based regimen
      proceed immediately to Regimen B following PBSC collection. The following acronyms are used:
      CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen),
      NSC-614629 L-PAM Melphalan, NSC-8806 PBSC Peripheral Blood Stem Cells VAD
      Vincristine/Doxorubicin/Dexamethasone TBI Total Body Irradiation Regimen A: Stem Cell
      Mobilization/Harvest. CTX; G-CSF. Regimen B: Single-Agent Myeloablative Chemoradiotherapy
      with Stem Cell Rescue. L-PAM; TBI (Co60 or linear accelerators of 4 MV or greater); with
      PBSC.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: If 9 or fewer or 20 or more responses are seen in the first 50 patients
      treated, the study will be discontinued.
