      Study 1:

      Analyse the correlation between SMI assessed neovascularization and degree of stenosis in
      symptomatic patients with high-grade (>50%) carotid stenosis versus asymptomatic patients
      with high-grade (>50%) carotid stenosis.

      All patients upon inclusion will undergo:

        -  Clinical, neurological evaluation

        -  Blood tests

        -  SMI, CEUS and SWE ultrasound

        -  Carotid MRI

        -  PET (subgroup)

        -  DW-MRI

        -  Histological assessments after the removal of plaque at carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

      Study 2:

      SMI and vascular events. Asymptomatic patient's follow-up at 12 months:

        -  Clinical neurological evaluation

        -  Blood test

        -  SMI, CEUS, SWE ultrasound

        -  Carotid MRI

        -  PET (subgroup)

      Study 3:

      This study will use the same patient pool described in study 1 undergoing the previously
      described procedural examinations upon inclusion and at one year follow up. Quantification of
      stiffness/elasticity in the artery wall will be performed and compared to plaque echogenicity
      measured as GSM . These results will be correlated to histology of the carotid plaque after
      trombendarterectomy, risk markers in blood (lipids, HbA1c, CRP, leukocytes), other
      cardiovascular risk markers (hypertension, diabetes, nicotine) and cerebrovascular symptoms.
