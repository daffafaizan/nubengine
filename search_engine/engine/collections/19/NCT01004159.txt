      your blood stream. The growth of colorectal cancer may be affected by the interaction of a
      growth factor known as "epidermal growth factor" (EGF) with its receptor.

      Cetuximab is a antibody directed against the receptor for EGF and has been shown to turn off
      the activity of the receptor and to stop the growth of cancer cells in many laboratory tests.
      Cetuximab has been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the treatment of
      patients with advanced colorectal cancer and who failed standard chemotherapy. Cetuximab has
      been shown to delay the progression of colorectal cancer when given alone in patients who
      have failed standard chemotherapy and when given with a chemotherapy drug called irinotecan
      in patients who have failed irinotecan.
