      duration of 6 months. 100-120 boys with ADHD aged 8-16 years and 30 healthy boys will will be
      randomized to 3 months of treatment with a fixed dose of 6 capsules of food supplement "Eye
      q" per day divided in two daily doses (558 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 174 mg
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 60 mg gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) per day) or to placebo (olive
      oil). At 3 months a one-way treatment crossover of the placebo-group to active treatment will
      be made so that both patient groups will receive active treatment for the remaining 3 month
      period. Control group will receive active treatment for 6 month. The assessment of children
      will be made 3 times: at the point of start, after 3 months, and after 6 months. The
      assessments will be made using standardized interviews and questionnaires, neuropsychological
      tests, pediatric and neurological examination and taking a 5 ml sample of blood to assess
      level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in serum and in cell membranes of erythrocytes.
