    
      This study is cross-sectionnal, multicentric national (M3C network), descriptive,
      observational.

      Children ≥ 6 years old and adults with a single ventricle according to the international
      classification ACC-CHD and who had a cardiopulmonary exercise test in the year during usual
      follow-up will be included. Patients refuse the use of medical data will be excluded.

      The main objective of our study is to describe the rate of "great SV" (VO2max ≥ 80%) within
      the general population of SV. The secondary objectives are to compare the two groups: group
      "great SV" with VO2max ≥ 80% versus group SV with VO2max < 80%.

      The following criteria will be collected

      Anatomical : left SV, right SV, undetermined SV, total cavopulmoary shunt, partial
      cavopulmonary shunt

      Clinic: NYHA status, saturation, medical treatment, number of surgery procedure, number of
      catheterization procedure, presence of pacemaker or implantable defibrillator, presence of
      arrythmia.

      Morbidity: number oh hospitalization during the year, presence of arrhythmia, cirrhosis and
      hepatic carcinoma, exudative enteropathy , plastic bronchitis, venous thromboses, stroke.

      Echocardiography: ejection fraction of SV, 2D Strain of SV, atrioventricular valve
      regurgitation, aortic stenosis, aspect of the flow in the cavopulmonary shunt.

      Cardiac MRI: ejection fraction of SV

      Cardiac catheterization: mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial wedge pressure,
      presence of fistulae.

      Cardiopulmonary exercise test : VO2max, anaerobic threesold, VE/VCO2 slope, oxygen uptake
      efficiciency slope, maximal heart rate, oxygene pulse and saturation at exercise.

      Pulmonary functional test : forced expiratory volume in 1 seconde (FEV1), the forced vital
      capacity (FVC), the FEV1/FVC ratio (FEV1/FVC%), DLCO and residual volume.
