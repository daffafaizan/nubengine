        -  Determine the efficacy of erlotinib, in terms of response rate and duration of stable
           disease, in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic carcinoma of the
           endometrium.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Correlate objective tumor response with levels of epidermal growth factor receptor
           expression in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with complete or partial response or stable
      disease are also followed every 3 months until relapse or death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
