      to adjuvant chemotherapy or observation groups.

        1. Histologic type: clear cell adenocarcinoma/mucinous adenocarcinoma vs. serous
           adenocarcinoma/other histologic types

        2. Facility where a subject is enrolled

        3. International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics(FIGO) clinical staging: Stage Ia/
           Ib vs. Stage Ic(b)

      Group A: adjuvant chemotherapy group (standard treatment group):

      While one of the following treatments will be performed, the number of cycles is entrusted to
      the treatment policy of each facility.

      Paclitaxel plus Carboplatin (TC) therapy; Paclitaxel (PTX) 175 mg/m2 + Carboplatin(CBDCA)
      area under curve(AUC) 6 q3weeks day1, 3 to 6 cycles Docetaxel plus Carboplatin (DC) therapy;
      Docetaxel(DTX) 70 mg/m2 + CBDCA AUC 6 q3weeks day1, 3 to 6 cycles

      After the start of TC therapy, switching from PTX to DTX due to an adverse event is
      permitted.

      Group B: observation group (study treatment group): Observation only, no adjuvant
