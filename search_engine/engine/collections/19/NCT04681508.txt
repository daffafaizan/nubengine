    
      The main issues are:

        -  To investigate if coronary calcification predisposes the development of myocardial
           injury and causes an increased mortality rate.

        -  To evaluate the predictive value of NT-pro-BNP in relation to the development of MINS
           and the mortality rate.

        -  To evaluate the predictive value of different biomarkers of AKI in relation to which
           patients develop AKI.

        -  To examine the proteins, exosomes and single cell RNA during acute kidney injury in
           order to describe the molecular processes in the kidney during AKI.

        -  To examine whether a chest CT scan without contrast enhancement will change treatment
           decisions in the acute gastrointestinal patient compared with a chest x-ray.
