      response in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma of the pleura treated with
      gemcitabine plus cisplatin. II. Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this
      regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes, immediately followed by cisplatin
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses are repeated every 28 days. Treatment
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with a
      complete response receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 6
      months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 25 months.
