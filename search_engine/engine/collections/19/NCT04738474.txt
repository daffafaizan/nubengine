      will complete the baseline study measures assessment and be randomized to receive PRISM or
      usual care (anticipated n=86, 43 per group). Patients in the intervention group will
      participate in the six PRISM sessions over 3 months. At 3 months following enrollment,
      patients in both groups will again complete study measures. We will define feasibility as a)
      the proportion of eligible patients who enroll and b) the proportion of patients who complete
      the intervention among those randomized to intervention. We will define preliminary efficacy
      as the change in mean resilience from baseline to 3 months after randomization between those
      randomized to intervention and usual care. Exploratory analyses will examine PRISM's impact
      on patient-centered outcomes of quality of life, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and
      perceived competence for health care.
