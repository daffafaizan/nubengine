      tisotumab vedotin (TV) administered every 3 weeks or on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week
      cycle (3Q4W) for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or
      fallopian tube cancer that has relapsed within 6 months of the completion of platinum-based
      treatment and determined to be platinum resistant. All patients must have PROC and be
      eligible for single agent chemotherapy.

      The safety run-in period will evaluate the safety of a weekly schedule. The highest dose
      level that is considered safe will be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and will be used in
      Part A. In Part A, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive tisotumab
      vedotin intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W regimen) or the safety run-in RP2D on Days 1,
      8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle (weekly regimen; 3Q4W) if a RP2D has been identified.
      Participants who enroll in Part B will receive tisotumab vedotin on Days 1, 8, and 15 of
      every 4-week cycle (weekly regimen) at a pre-specified dose level, if the dose level is
      considered safe and tolerable in the safety run-in period.
