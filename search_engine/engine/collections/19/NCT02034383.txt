      carbohydrate are commonly used to calculate the metabolizable energy of a diet. Atwater
      factors are based on average values of mixed diets and are not exact; thus, using these
      values could introduce an error in the calculated metabolizable energy of a particular food
      due to differences in chemical structure and availability. Studies have demonstrated that
      Atwater general factors overestimate the energy derived from protein and fat, as well as the
      measured metabolizable energy of mixed diets, particularly those that are high in dietary
      fiber. Studies are lacking, however, that examine how different processing methods affect the
      metabolizable energy of a food due to differences in chemical structure and availability.
