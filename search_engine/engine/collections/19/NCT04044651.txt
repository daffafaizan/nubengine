      hepatocellular carcinoma, and nivolumab was effective and tolerable in patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma. No study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus
      nivolumab compared with lenvatinib monotherapy. Thus, the investigators carried out this
      prospective, randomized, phase IIb study to find out it.
