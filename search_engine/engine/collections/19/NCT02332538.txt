      the third generations of the Greenlight XPS, it seems to be a real contender in the world of
      MIS. Contenders of Greenlight laser technology includes bipolar as well as Holmium laser
      technology.

      In this study the investigators planned to test the Greenlight (532-nm) laser Photoselective
      Vapo-Enucleation of the Prostate (PVEP) using (XPS) 180W system compared to bipolar
      transurethral resection of the prostate (TURis) and Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate
      (HOLEP) in reduction of LUTS secondary to BPH in a prospective randomized trial.

      Furthermore, all peri-operative parameters, urinary flow parameters, prostate size changes
      and complications associated with the procedures were compared. The prostate size limitations
      will be assessed in relation to the outcome measures.

      Moderate to large size prostate (80-120 ml TRUS estimated volume) will be randomized to PVEP
      vs. Bipolar TURP vs. HoLEP.
