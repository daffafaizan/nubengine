    
      HFS, also known as Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysethesia, is a common adverse event observed in
      subjects under anti-tumor therapy with conventional chemotherapy or targeted th√©rapies. The
      initial symptoms are dysesthesia and tingling in the palms, fingers and soles of feet and
      erythema, which may progress to burning pain with dryness, cracking, desquamation, ulceration
      and oedema. Sensory impairment, paresthesia and pruritus have also been reported. Palms of
      the hands are more frequently affected than soles of the feet, and might even be the only
      area affected in some subjects.

      Although HFS is rarely life-threatening, the skin changes are often painful and debilitating
      and can impair with the general activities of daily living and quality of life. No standard
      prevention for HFS has not been established yet.

      Onco-Repair is a nourishing and repairing cream specially formulated to treat grade 2 HFS
      which demonstrate skin tolerance, hypoallergenicity and efficacy through several preclinical
      and clinical studies on healthy subjects.

      Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be conducted to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of topical cream 'Onco-Repair' on HFS.
