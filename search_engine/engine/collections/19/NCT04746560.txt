      may result from the systemic activation of the coagulation pathway and the acquired platelet
      dysfunction during the procedure. This study aims to compare the diagnostic performances of
      the TEG®6S device and its Platelet mapping® cartridge to those of the "gold standard" tests
      (light transmittance aggregometry and Multiplate®) for platelet function monitoring in
      patients undergoing CPB for cardiac surgery.
