      arch and in branch pulmonary arteries will be evaluated by physical examination with blood
      pressure values measurement of upper and lower limbs.

      Echo-Doppler cardiography will be performed for flow velocity analysis. Zoomed fluoroscopy
      will be performed and recorded in two orthogonal views to evaluate stent integrity or stent
      fracture.

      It is our intention to include 20 patients in this study from our follow-up clinic.
