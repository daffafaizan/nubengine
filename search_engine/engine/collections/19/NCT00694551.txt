        1. Estimate the frequency of immunological efficacy of the vaccine by comparison of the in
           vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) test results, for each antigen (PSMA,
           TARP) from peripheral blood specimens collected during the periods of time defined as
           "before", "during" and "after" vaccination.

        2. Study the safety and toxicity of varying doses of polypeptide vaccines:
           PSMA27-35-PSMA687-701 (VLAGGFFLLYRHVIYAPSSHNKYA) and TARP13-35 (LQLLKQSSRRLEHTFMFLRNFSL)
           administered with a fixed dose of Poly IC-LC (2 mg total/treatment) as adjuvant.

        3. Describe the impact of the vaccine on the pattern of PSA change in 2 subsets of
           patients: with castrate testosterone; with non-suppressed testosterone level/not on
           hormone therapy.

        4. Identify if there is a basis for selection of a dose of the PSMA and the TARP
           polypeptide vaccines for future phase II development of this vaccination strategy,
           considering the dose range tested.
