      Care plus emotional support, and education/information during the hospital stay) helps
      patients feel better about their physical function and emotional well-being.

      Participants with serious musculoskeletal injury, being treated at to the University of
      Florida's (UF) Orthopaedic Trauma service at UF Health at Shands Hospital, will be randomized
      (like tossing a coin) between the two groups.

      Usual Care will follow all the highest standards for injury treatment.

      Integrated Care will include medical care and emotional support. Study Staff are trained to
      provide emotional support and teach patients the skills for goal setting, taking ownership of
      journey, establishing lifelines, mobilizing resources and reducing stressors.

      In addition, questionnaires and simple functional tests will be collected at the hospital and
      at normal follow-up visits at weeks 2, 6 and 12 and months 6 and 12.
