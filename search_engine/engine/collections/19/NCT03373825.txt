      clinical factors that may be related to non-prescription fentanyl (NPF) exposure among young
      people who use illicit drugs. The researchers will also characterize knowledge of and
      perceptions towards drugs contaminated with NPF, as well as the potential diversion of
      prescription fentanyl formulations (e.g., transdermal patches). After the
      interviewer-administered survey has been completed, participants will provide urine samples
      to determine recent exposure to NPF and other illicit drugs.

      The research team will assess the acceptability and feasibility of "take home rapid drug
      tests" to test for fentanyl exposure among 100 participants from the target population. After
      the enrollment and baseline survey, participants will be provided with rapid drug tests that
      detect the presence or absence of fentanyl in their drug supply. Half the participants will
      be asked to test their urine to see if they have been exposed to a fentanyl-contaminated
      drug. The other half will be asked to test the residue of the drug that they intend to use.
      Study participants will then be asked to return in 2 weeks for a brief follow-up survey that
      will assess whether they used the self-tests, whether the technology was acceptable and easy
      to use, and whether and how a positive test result altered their drug-using and overdose
      prevention behaviors.
