      tolerability of SAN005 when administered to adults for the prevention and treatment of
      radiation induced oral mucositis.

      Subjects will be instructed on the administration of study medication thrice daily till oral
      mucositis resolves. Subjects will return to the clinic once a week while receiving radiation
      and then once every two weeks once their radiation has been completed and then until their
      mucositis has resolved for the Final Study Visit.

      Preliminary Efficacy Evaluation will be the severity of pain rated by the NRPS and mucositis
      grade by RTOG criteria at Visit 7 (Day 36). Additional secondary efficacy evaluations will
      include the severity of pain rated by the NRPS and mucositis grade by RTOG criteria at each
      study visit, frequency of the PEG tube for feeding during the duration of treatment and
      weight loss from baseline through Visit 5 and 7. The time of mucositis onset and duration
      will also be used in assessing efficacy. Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints will
      be outlined in the statistical analysis plan. The overall efficacy is determined by comparing
      the data to historical controls. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs)
      with respect to severity, duration, and relationship to study drug. In addition tolerability
      evaluations will be performed at each study visit.
