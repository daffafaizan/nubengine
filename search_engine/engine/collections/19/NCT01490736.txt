    
      This is a sequentially staged (Stage 1-4), proof of concept study assessing the safety of
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) and lemuteporfin topical solution (LTS) in healthy subjects and
      subjects with mild acne. Approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled in Stage 1 in order to
      determine a maximum tolerated light dose following LTS application. Up to 90 subjects with
      mild acne will be enrolled in Stage 2 in order to assess the safety of PDT following a single
      LTS application. Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled in Stage 3 in order to assess the safety
      of PDT following repeat LTS applications. Up to 40 subjects will be enrolled into Stage 4 to
      assess multiple treatments of LTS-PDT.
