      States health care system currently. This includes the high burden of patients with
      uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes on the system especially given the continued dramatic rise in
      the prevalence of these patients. Innovative ways to better understand and implement diabetes
      management plans to reduce the burden of this disease on our health care system are a
      necessity. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors have already shown benefit
      in better management plans in the outpatient setting. Hence, this study aims to assess the
      use of CGM sensors starting in the inpatient setting and whether they will help provide
      better and quicker understanding of the disease to make expedited changes to management plans
      thereby improving blood glucose control and mitigating some of the health care burden by
      means of reducing E.D visits and hospital re-admission rates.

      Objectives: To determine whether the use of CGM sensors in patients with uncontrolled type 2
      diabetes at the time of hospital discharge leads to improved glucose control and a reduction
      of E.D visits and hospital readmission rates.

      Trial Design: The trial design will be a randomized, non-blinded prospective study; a 1:1
      comparison of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes patients who receive CGM sensors + conventional
      diabetes management at the time of discharge versus uncontrolled type 2 diabetes patients who
      receive only the conventional diabetes management.

      Study Setting: Study setting will be at the Albert Einstein Medical Center (AEMC),
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the inpatient type 2 diabetes population who will be followed
      at the AEMC endocrinology clinics.
