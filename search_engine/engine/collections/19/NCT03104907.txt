    
      This is a prospective study investigating the safety and efficacy of PAE for patients with
      prostate cancer who suffers from acute urinary retention, severe LUTS and/or recurrent
      complications such as haematuria.

      Our hypothesis is that PAE will eliminate the need for indwelling catheter and improve IPSS
      and QoL 12 months post-procedure.

      1, and 6 months follow-up.

      Main outcome Ability to void after removal of indwelling catheter

      Secondary outcomes International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) Quality of Life (QoL)
      International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Prostate volume Peak void flow (Qmax)
      Post-void residual (PVR) Classify complications according to Society of Interventional
      Radiology (SIR) guidelines for reporting Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
