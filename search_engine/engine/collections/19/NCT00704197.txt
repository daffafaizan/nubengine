      and 1 overnight stay) completed during a 2 week period. For the outpatient visits, body
      composition (by DEXA), visceral fat (by CT), ectopic fat (by MRS and CT) and aerobic fitness
      (by VO2max test) will be measured. Women will also have ovarian parameters (follicle size and
      number) measured during the MR scans. Following an overnight stay in the inpatient unit,
      insulin sensitivity (by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), interstitial lipolysis (by
      microdialysis), whole body lipolysis and glycolysis (by stable isotopes), abdominal adipose
      tissue oxygen content (Hunt and Direct Methods) will be measured and a subcutaneous fat
      biopsy of the abdominal and gluteo-femoral tissue will be collected. Women will complete all
      testing in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.
