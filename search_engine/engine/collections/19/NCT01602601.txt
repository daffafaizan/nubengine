    
      Study IDS116406 will be a non-interventional, phlebotomy study in Hunter Syndrome patients
      who are currently being treated with idursulfase, an enzyme replacement therapy, and in at
      least a single patient who is na√Øve to treatment, if possible to recruit. All patients
      enrolled into the study will have a single blood draw for the analysis of antibodies induced
      by this enzyme replacement therapy (idursulfase). Patient samples with positive responses to
      antibodies induced by idursulfase will be used to further evaluate whether the antibodies
      induced by idursulfase bind to GSK2788723 molecules in vitro and if these antibodies
      neutralize the bioactivity of GSK2788723 in vitro. Each subject will have a screening visit,
      which may occur at their regularly scheduled out-patient visit. If the patient consents to
      participate in the study, a blood sample (total volume of approximately 3mL) for
      immunogenicity analysis will be drawn before their current treatment infusion
