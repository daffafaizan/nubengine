    
      Alzheimer's Universe (www.AlzU.org) was created to provide online education about Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), with a focus on family members of people with AD, people with mild cognitive
      impairment due to AD and mild AD, caregivers, healthcare providers, medical students, college
      students and high school students. The website provides evidence-based courses with
      interactive lessons and activities that have been shown to increase knowledge about AD,
      willingness to participate in an AD prevention clinical trial, and intent to make specific
      lifestyle changes in effort to reduce AD risk.
