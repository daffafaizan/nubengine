      arms are based upon whether the patient has previously received Abraxane-Gemcitabine or
      FOLFIRINOX or single-agent Gemcitabine without radiographic evidence of disease progression
      for a minimum of 8 weeks , based on the investigator's opinion, but with a rising CA 19-9
      levels. Rising CA 19-9 is defined as an increased over baseline of > 20% in two consecutive
      time points within 8 days of each other. Study sites will provide all chemotherapy for
      patients participating in the study as a "standard of care". DSF/Cu will be provided by the
      Sponsor and shipped from the Sponsor's central depot to the study sites. Sufficient amounts
      of DSF/Cu will be available at the study site prior to enrolling patients in the study.
