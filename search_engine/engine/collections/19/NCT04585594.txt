    
      The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) consisting of a 4-session educational
      intervention (completed over the course of 4-8 weeks) and a 6-month follow-up period for
      adherence monitoring. Participants will be allocated to one of two educational intervention
      groups following a block randomization schedule, stratified on the hypothesized mediator
      variable of medication-related beliefs (high versus low scores on the BMQ Necessity-Concerns
      subscore) to ensure the groups are balanced on this variable. Primary endpoint is medication
      adherence at 6 month follow-up, defined as the proportion of days that the prescribed number
      of doses was taken by the patient during a 30-day period, measured by a pill bottle cap
      monitor (medication events monitoring device [MEMS]).
