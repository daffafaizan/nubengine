      malignancies and varying degrees of liver dysfunction. II. Determine the effects of hepatic
      dysfunction on the plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxaliplatin in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      liver function as defined by the following: Group A: Normal liver function - Bilirubin, SGOT,
      and alkaline phosphatase no greater than upper limit of normal (ULN) Group B: Mild liver
      dysfunction - Bilirubin no greater than ULN; SGOT greater than ULN to 2.5 times ULN and/or
      alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN to 5 times ULN Group C: Moderate liver function -
      Bilirubin greater than ULN to 3.0 mg/dL and/or SGOT greater than 2.5 times ULN and/or
      alkaline phosphatase greater than 5 times normal Group D: Severe liver dysfunction -
      Bilirubin greater than 3.1 mg/dL and any SGOT or alkaline phosphatase Group E: Patients who
      have received a liver transplant Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients in groups B, C, and D receive escalating doses of
      oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose- limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years.
