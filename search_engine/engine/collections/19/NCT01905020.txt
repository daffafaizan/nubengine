      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings. A dual-hormone closed-loop system would
      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormone: insulin and glucagon.

      We aim to conduct a multicenter study to compare the efficacy of conventional pump therapy,
      single-hormone closed-loop strategy and dual-hormone closed-loop strategy to regulate
      overnight glucose levels, at home, in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes. Each
      intervention will be tested on two nights: 1) After a carbohydrate-rich dinner meal (to
      exaggerate hyperglycemic risk and; 2) After an evening exercise (to exaggerate hypoglycemic
      risk).
