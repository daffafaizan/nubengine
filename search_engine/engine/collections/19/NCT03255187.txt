      Shanghai, China. These students fulfilling the recruitment criteria will be randomly divided
      into two parallel groups to receive either fish oil [marine-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (PUFA)] or sunflower seed oil. Participants in fish oil group receive 2.5 g/day (two
      1.25-g capsules daily) in divided doses. The sunflower seed oil capsules are identical. All
      interventions started at 7:30 a.m.to avoid issues related to diurnal variation. Health
      endpoints, including blood pressure, fractional exhaled nitric oxide and pulmonary function
      were evaluated and biological samples such as morning urine, fast blood, saliva sample,buccal
      cells and skin tape stripping will be collected at week 1 before supplemenatation, and week
      8, week 10, week 12 as well as week 14 during the supplementation phase.The investigators
      measure personal real-time exposure to PM2.5 and personal temperature and relative humidity.
