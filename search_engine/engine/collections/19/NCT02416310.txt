      at acupoints to treat diseases.Clinical evidence supports the efficacy of acupuncture
      treatment in many applications. Some previous studies reported that stimulation at some
      acupoint exerted good effects on the digestive system.Compared with acupuncture,
      transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation(TEAS) is a non-invasive technique that has
      similar effects to acupuncture.We hypothesize that TEAS before anesthesia and during surgery
      would decrease the morbidity and mortality of postoperative complications in 30 days after
      Cesarean section.
