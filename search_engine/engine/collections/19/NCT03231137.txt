      tissue dimensions of the alveolar ridge that are partially lost after tooth extraction as
      part of the natural physiological healing process. There are many techniques in the
      literature used for socket preservation as bone grafts, barrier membranes, immediate implant
      and socket shield. Many other techniques also are used such as bone and tissue healing
      promoting molecules like recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). However
      Autologous blood preparations like platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), and platelet rich in growth
      factors (PRGF) have been also introduced for socket preservation. Moreover, Statins the
      widely used group of cholesterol lowering drugs which also increase normal bone formation by
      promoting osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and protecting the from apoptosis. In
      addition, they reduce osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting osteoclastic differentiation. Statins
      increase BMP-2 gene expression and subsequently promote bone formation. in the emerging area
      of growth factors, there is no high-quality evidence to either support or refuse their use.

      This study hypothesized that use of PRGF fibrin scaffold in socket preservation owing to its
      biocompatibility, ease of use, stimulation of production of growth factors and its effect on
      the already differentiated osteoblasts, when combined with statin with its effect on
      progenitor stem-cells could stimulate the differentiation of stem cells to osteoblasts,
      prevent bone resorption and stimulate bone formation at the extraction socket.
