      program, Vital Recorder. The Vital Recorder program is a WindowsÂ® software and acquires
      time-synced patient monitoring data from the serial ports of multiple anesthesia devices like
      patient monitor, anesthesia machine, bispectral index monitor, cardiac output monitor,
      infusion pumps, etc. The retrieved data are stored on the local or network data storage.

      Variables captured by the Vital Recorder program are as follows: heart rate, blood pressure,
      saturation, temperature, respiratory parameters, bispectral index, infusion history of
      target-controlled infusion pump, cardiac output, cerebral oxygen concentration, etc.

      Time interval of the data is 1-2 sec for numeric variables. Resolution of waves (analog data
      such as ECG, plethysmogram, and pressure waves) is usually 500 Hz. Captured data of a patient
      is stored as a *.vital file.

      A laptop is connected to 4-6 anesthesia devices at the same time via serial connections.
      Patients enrolled (all of the surgical patients who undergo surgery at our hospital) receive
      routine anesthesia and surgery. Due to the program's automatic function, the program
      identifies the start and end of a case then automatically records the vital signs of every
      patient 24/365, once the program starts.

      Patient information is additionally gathered from the electronic medical recording system
      (EMR). Data from the EMR are as follows: sex, age, weight, height, diagnosis, operation,
      anesthesia and surgery times, premedical history, perioperative lab data and medication.

      List of vital files and patient information is integrated in an encrypted spreadsheet file.
