      CF-related symptoms, the investigators propose an explanatory, sequential mixed methods study
      in which 80 menstruating women with CF will be asked to track their daily CF-related symptoms
      for three consecutive cycles. From this cohort, the investigators will ask up to 30 women
      with CF to participate in one semi-structured interview to gather information about the
      impact of cyclical CF symptoms upon women's daily lives and any strategies they use to manage
      them. This study uses innovative technology to track CF-specific symptoms with a smartphone
      app. The investigators' hypothesis is that subjective changes in clinical CF symptoms,
      including pulmonary and sinus (primary outcome), rheumatic, and gastrointestinal (secondary
      outcomes), will map onto the phases of the menstrual cycle and will be cyclical in nature;
      women will report alternative ways in which they manage their cyclical CF symptoms; and the
      period tracker app will be easy for women to use.
