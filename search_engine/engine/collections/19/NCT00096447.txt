      I. Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients with recurrent or persistent
      endometrial carcinoma treated with lapatinib.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this drug. II. Determine
      the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with this
      drug.

      III. Determine the effects of prognostic factors, such as initial performance status and
      tumor grade, in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-82 patients will be accrued for this study within 30-67
      months.
