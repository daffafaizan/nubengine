      of patients recovering from laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The objective is to investigate
      whether the use of virtual reality (VR) during the immediate postoperative period could
      improve patient reported quality of recovery and potentially reduce opioid analgesic
      requirements as compared to an existing ERAS protocol.

      The investigators hypothesize that immersive VR will improve subjective quality of recovery
      scores at time of Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) discharge as compared to standard ERAS.
