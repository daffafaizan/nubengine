      In-Vivo Dosimetry For Gynecologic Brachytherapy". Brachytherapy is an integral part of the
      management of many gynecological cancers, which uses radioactive isotopes to deliver
      radiation treatment in close proximity to the target. The protocol uses the device in the
      setting of gynecologic brachytherapy to monitor real time doses, with a primary endpoint of
      feasibility and accuracy. Accrual is ongoing, however, the device has initially given
      consistent results, within 3% of the expected values. This initial experience is
      intentionally designed with the simplest geometry and positioning. This protocol has a
      similar design to the initial brachytherapy trial, but with the significant difference that
      the monitoring will be performed during external beam radiotherapy. Calibration procedures
      are different in this scenario, and the considerations of when and where dose monitoring will
      be useful are distinct from these considerations in brachytherapy.
