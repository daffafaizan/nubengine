      Primary

        -  Determine the tolerability of CC-5013 in patients with primary systemic (AL)
           amyloidosis.

        -  Determine the objective hematologic response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine amyloid organ disease response in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine hematologic and amyloid organ disease response in patients who do not achieve
           a response to CC-5013 alone and are subsequently treated with CC-5013 and dexamethasone.

        -  Determine the toxicity of CC-5013 in combination with dexamethasone in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral CC-5013 once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not achieving a
      hematologic response continue to receive CC-5013 as before and also receive oral
      dexamethasone twice daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 of every other 28-day course for up to
      6 courses of combination therapy. Patients who maintain a hematologic response after 6
      courses of combination therapy may receive CC-5013 alone in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients not achieving a hematologic response after the
      initiation of dexamethasone are removed from the study.

      Patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12.5
      months.
