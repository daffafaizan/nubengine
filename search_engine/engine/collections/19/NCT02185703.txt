      Chordate System in placebo mode.

      After a screening visit, up to 3 months before treatment, eligible subjects will be asked to
      return to the center at the onset of their next moderate to severe migraine attack. Subjects
      will be re-checked for eligibility, randomized and treated at the center (treatment visit).
      The subjects will record their response over the next 48 hours using a diary card. A
      follow-up visit will be scheduled 3 to 7 days after the treatment. In addition the subjects
      will be contacted within 24 to 48 hours after treatment initiation via a telephone contact to
      discuss their health including new or ongoing AEs.
