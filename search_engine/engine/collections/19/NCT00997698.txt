      the widespread use of high-resolution imaging techniques. They are clinically important
      because of the life-threatening rupture and hemorrhage. Early detection and diagnosis is the
      key of treatment. Contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA), as a simple, sensitivity and
      noninvasive method, is playing an important role in Vascular Imaging. CE-MRA has been an
      accuracy modality for intracranial aneurysm at most centers and proved the high sensitivity
      and accuracy comparing with DSA. Therefore, we use CE-MRA at 1.5T as a tool of
      epidemiological investigation of intracranial aneurysms.

      In retrospective analysis, conventional risk factors for intracranial aneurysms include
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking history, and family history,
      etc. However, retrospective analysis probably gives an underestimation or overestimation of
      the actual results. Prospective analysis will get accurate data on the risk factors relating
      to intracranial aneurysms
