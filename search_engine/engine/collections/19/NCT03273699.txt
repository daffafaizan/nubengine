      EEG-based biofeedback device that allows clients to engage in home based mindfulness
      meditation practices while they are waiting to receive clinical services. Specifically, this
      study will investigate the effects of meditation home practice on symptom alleviation, as
      related to specific OCD related cognitive processes.The study will be a randomized trial
      where subjects (N=100) will be randomly assigned to receive either 1) an eight week
      meditation program involving use of an EEG-based biofeedback device, or 2) wait list as per
      usual. The experimental design is a 2 (treatment condition: Group 1: Mindfulness, Group 2:
      Control) by 3 (assessment phase: baseline (week 0), mid-treatment (week 4), post-treatment
      (week 8)) repeated measures factorial design. Group randomization will be completed by the
      principal investigator, using the "GraphPad Quick Calcs" online calculator which offers
      simple random allocation into equal-sized groups.Outcome measures will involve ratings of OCD
      symptom severity, OCD beliefs, mindfulness, and use of thought control strategies. At
      baseline, mid treatment (session 4), and post intervention, participants will complete the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, Obsessive Compulsive Inventory, Obsessive Beliefs
      Questionnaire, Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire, Thought Control Questionnaire,
      Acceptance and Action Questionnaire, Mind Wandering Scale and the Metacognitions
      Questionnaire. Once per week, participants will complete the YBOCS, TCQ, and MW. This weekly
      data will be collected online using the "Survey Monkey" web portal. Daily practice data from
      the EEG headsets will be automatically uploaded to an encrypted server.
