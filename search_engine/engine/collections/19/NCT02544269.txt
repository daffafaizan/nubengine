      lumbosacral plexus blockade or continuous spinal anesthesia. All patients will receive
      central venous, arterial and spinal catheters. Hemodynamics will be monitored with
      transpulmonary thermodilution and pulse contour analysis. Perineural injection of study
      medicine around the lumbar and sacral plexus will be performed guided by ultrasound and nerve
      stimulation. Study medicine will be injected in divided doses in the spinal catheter.
      Treatment will be blinded using double-dummy technique. After the first intrathecal dose of
      study medicine, the hemodynamic response will be monitored for 60 minutes. Patients will then
      be transferred to the operating room, where total hip replacement will be performed in
      lumbosacral plexus blockade or spinal anesthesia according to randomization.
