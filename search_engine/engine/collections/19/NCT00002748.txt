      subcutaneous injections of autologous, or partially HLA-matched allogeneic, neuroblastoma
      cells that have been modified by insertion of the interleukin-2 gene introduced by a
      retroviral vector. II. Determine whether multiple histocompatibility-restricted or
      unrestricted antitumor immune responses are induced by this treatment and the cell dose
      required to produce these effects. III. Obtain preliminary data on the antitumor effects of
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Autologous or partially HLA-matched allogeneic neuroblastoma cells are transduced
      with a human gene for interleukin-2 production. Patients receive subcutaneous injections of
      the gene-modified cells on days 1 and 8, with the second injection containing 10 times more
      cells than the first injection. After a 3-4 week rest, stable and responding patients may
      receive additional weekly injections at the second dose. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be
      entered at increasing cell doses until the maximum tolerated dose is estimated. Multiple
      injection sites may be used at the higher cell-dose levels. Patients are followed every week
      for 6 weeks, every other week for 6 weeks, and monthly for 1 year. Additional visits may be
      required as clinically indicated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12 patients each will be entered into the autologous and the
      partially HLA-matched allogeneic tumor cell treatment groups. Accrual is expected to require
      4 years for the autologous tumor cell group and 2 years for the partially HLA-matched
      allogenic tumor cell group.
