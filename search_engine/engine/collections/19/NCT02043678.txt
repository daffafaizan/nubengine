    
      This study is a phase III multinational, multicenter,randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled, study with a randomization allocation ratio of 1:1 (radium-223 dichloride plus
      abiraterone acetate plus prednisone/prednisolone: placebo plus abiraterone acetate plus
      prednisone/prednisolone). Until the final overall survival (OS) analysis, the study period
      consisted of screening / randomization, treatment, active follow-up with clinic visits,
      active follow-up without clinic visits, and longterm follow-up phases. Up until this point,
      subjects received study treatment (radium-223 dichloride or placebo in addition to
      abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone for the first 6 cycles followed by
      abiraterone acetate plus prednisone / prednisolone thereafter) until an on-study SSE occurred
      (or other withdrawal criteria were met). After the final OS analysis (after implementation of
      Amendment 7), in order to reduce the burden to study subjects, evaluation of efficacy and
      exploratory endpoints will be discontinued, except for symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) and
      OS. Subjects who are discontinued from study treatment will initiate the long-term follow-up
      period; therefore, active follow-up periods will no longer be applicable. Subjects who are in
      active follow-up at the time of Amendment 7 is implemented should have the end of active
      follow-up completed (protocol driven decision) and should be directly transitioned into the
      extended safety follow-up study. Long term follow-up will continue until the subject dies, is
      lost to follow-up, withdraws informed consent, actively objects to collection of further
      data, or is transitioned to the extended safety follow-up study. Subjects will be followed
      for safety for up to 7 years, which eventually will be completed in the extended safety
      follow-up study.
