    
      This will be a Phase Ib, two-center study in approximately 160 healthy adults aged 18-55
      years

      The study is separated in two parts:

      Part A:

      The study starts with a single center open-label run-in phase of two dose levels (cohort 1
      "low dose": 2x10^7 PFU, cohort 2 "high dose": 2x10^8 PFU) in 10 healthy subjects. 5 subjects
      will be allocated to each dose cohort and will receive immunization on day 0 and day 28.

      Part B:

      Two-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. This part is a
      double-blinded trial in approximately 150 healthy subjects. Subjects will be allocated to two
      different dose cohorts and a placebo cohort; each receiving three vaccine injections.
