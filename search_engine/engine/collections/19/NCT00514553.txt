      choice about invasive prenatal testing: a) deliberation with attention and b) deliberation
      without attention. Deliberation with attention is conscious engagement and deliberation
      without attention is aimed at facilitating unconscious engagement. These will be compared
      with standard counseling for prenatal testing decisions. As a proof of principle study, the
      overall study goal is to demonstrate that the interventions have the desired effect on the
      variables hypothesized to be proximal to the primary endpoint. In this case, we aim to
      demonstrate an effect for both interventions on the outcome of value-behavior consistency and
      to determine effect sizes for estimating the sample size needed for a clinical trial.
