      consists of 3 blocks. During the first block, patients will receive bevacizumab every 2 weeks
      for 2 doses. During block 2, patients will receive vaccine + Poly-ICLC + bevacizumab on weeks
      1, 3, 5 and 7. An MRI will be performed after week 7 therapy. If there is no significant
      progression, then the patients will continue with block 3. During block 3, therapy consists
      of vaccine + Poly-ICLC monthly and bevacizumab every 2 weeks for 10 months. Keyhole limpet
      hemocyanin (KLH) will be given as a positive control with the first vaccine. Immune studies
