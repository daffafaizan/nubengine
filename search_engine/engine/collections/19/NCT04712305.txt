    
      This is a multi-center single-arm translational study where patients with mRCC who are to
      receive pre-determined IO-based therapy will be invited to participate the study. After
      signing the approved informed consent, eligible and consenting subjects will donate their
      fresh urine samples for subsequent untargeted metabolomics and proteomics study via GS-MS/MS
      and/or LC-MS/MS to identify potential metabolite and protein markers that are able to predict
      efficacy and side effects of IO-based therapies. All subjects in the first-line, maintenance
      after 1st line, second-line, or subsequent lines of IO-based therapy will be invited and
      recruited, but those who have received any IO-based therapy before the study can NOT be
      recruited.
