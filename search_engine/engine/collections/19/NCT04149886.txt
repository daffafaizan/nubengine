    
      This is a multicenter,prospective, open, interventional study. All patients will undergo
      permanent pacemaker implantation. The study will involve eight different steps, from the
      screening procedure through study completion: screening, enrollment, pharmacological testing,
      randomization of group allocation, preprocedural assessment, procedure, follow-up, study
      completion. The dedicated study members (cardiac electrophysiologists, statisticians) and the
      PI are responsible for recording all data from the trial on the case report forms (CRFs) and
      completing the study database. The participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to
      either GPs ablation followed by permanent pacemaker implantation or pacemaker alone.
      Randomization will be conducted centrally by an independent statistics department(Oxford
      Medical Center of National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Beijing, China) and stratified
      by center and age(<50 or >=50 years); A dedicated independent physician will be responsible
      for the safety monitoring. The PI will permit inspection of the trial files and the database
      by national or international official controlling scientific authorities, if required. The PI
      will review and monitor completed CRFs and the database at regular intervals throughout the
      trial.
