      which, due to its attributed hepatoprotective properties, is widely used by HIV infected
      patients

      15 patients on stable antiretroviral therapy including darunavir/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice a
      day during four weeks will be enrolled. After their inclusion in the study, patients will
      receive treatment with silimarine (150 mg every 8 hours) from day 1 until two weeks later
      (day 14). On days 0 and 14, blood samples will be drawn immediately before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
      10 and 12 hours after the administration of darunavir/ritonavir, and darunavir and ritonavir
      concentrations in plasma will be determined by high performance liquid chromatography using a
      validated method.
