    
      Elderly patients (65 years or older at the time of first administration) with type 2 diabetes
      who used Suglat Tablets within 3 months from its launch are included in this study.
      Followings are measured with the patients.

        1. Specify incidence rates of adverse drug reactions associated with a decrease in body
           fluids and their risk factors.

        2. Investigate the occurrence of urinary tract infection.

        3. Investigate the occurrence of adverse drug reactions in patients at a high risk (those
           who have poorly controlled blood sugar levels, concurrent organic abnormalities in the
           urinary system, advanced diabetic neuropathy, etc).

        4. Investigate the occurrence of adverse drug reactions other than the above.

        5. Factors that may possibly influence the safety of Suglat Tablets.
