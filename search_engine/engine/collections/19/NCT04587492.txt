      morbidity and mortality of children. Novel disease modifying therapies can alter the natural
      course of the disease. However, many aspects of their action remain unknown. Metabolomics is
      the large-scale study of metabolites, within cells, biofluids, tissues or organisms.
      Collectively, these small molecules and their interactions within a biological system are
      known as the metabolome.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the metabolome of patients with SMA before the
      initiation of disease modifying therapy with nusinersen differs from the metabolome of
      healthy individuals. Next, we would like to asses whether tretament with nusinersen alters
      the metabolome of patients with SMA. Utilizing metabolomics, we would like to assess whether
      we can identify parameters reflecting the state of the disease in a particular patient, and
      parameters with diagnostic and/or prognostic value. Using metabolomics, we will aim to
      identify SMA patients that will positively respond to gene therapy.
