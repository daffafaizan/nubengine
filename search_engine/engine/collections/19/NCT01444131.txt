      South Africa, over 6 months. In a randomized 1:1 allocation varenicline tartrate 1 mg twice
      daily, given in an incremental dosage for the first week before target quit date (TQD), will
      be compared to varenicline tartrate in the same dose combined with a 15mg nicotine patch. The
      nicotine patch (active and placebo) will be provided by McNeil. The patch will be given 2
      weeks prior TQD. Treatment duration from TQD is 12 weeks with varenicline being tapered off
      during week 13.

      A total of 12 clinic visits and 1 telephonic contact is planned for the 6-month study
      duration. The main efficacy outcome will be the 4-week continuous abstinence rate during the
      last four weeks of treatment, i.e. weeks 9 - 12. Efficacy assessments will be based on a
      Nicotine Use Inventory and measurements of end-expiratory exhaled carbon monoxide. Safety
      assessments will be based on adverse events evaluation, with special attention being given to
      the occurrence of nausea during the pretreatment period, as well as neuro-psychiatric
      symptoms such as depression or suicidal ideation. Participants will not be subjected to any
      invasive procedures.

      This protocol is based on current evidence and two further abstracts presented at the
      European Respiratory Society Conference in Vienna, September 2009, that a combination of
      varenicline tartrate and nicotine replacement therapy indicate superior efficacy in cessation
      rate, but also an excellent good safety profile.

      This study relates to the area of pharmacotherapy of smoking cessation, and will answer a
      frequently asked question. Importantly, several leading pulmonologists with experience in
      smoking cessation in South Africa have expressed their keen interest to participate in this
      study.
