      therapy. Whether a serofast state could represent a persistent low-level infection by
      Treponema pallidum is still unknown. The possibility that persistent nontreponemal antibodies
      after treatment represent persistence of Treponema pallidum was raised by some investigators.
      The investigators use the Next-Generation Sequencing to test blood plasma, serum,
      cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous humor, lymph nodes, skin lesion, saliva, semen,milk of serofast
      patient and other positive and negative controls.
