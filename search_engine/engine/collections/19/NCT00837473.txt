    
      This prospective trial is designed to evaluate the ability of the Plexur P device (bone void
      filler) to reconstitute the iliac crest in patients requiring iliac crest bone harvesting
      procedures at one single study site.

      Plexur P Bone Void Filler is:

        -  A biocomposite of mineralized cortical allograft bone fibers and
           polylactide-co-glycolide co-polymer.

        -  Designed to fill bony voids or gaps of the skeletal system that are not intrinsic to the
           stability of the bony structure.

        -  Porosity is introduced into the Plexur P Biocomposites to create a cancellous-like
           structure that provides a scaffold for bone growth.

      In addition:

        -  Patients will be screened for study eligibility based on the need for iliac crest bone
           harvesting.

        -  Fifteen (15) eligible patients will be enrolled and will have an iliac crest harvesting
           defect backfilled with Plexur P to repair the iliac crest defect.

        -  As a part of routine follow up care, patient related outcomes including measurements of
           pain severity and pain relief will be determined using patient (IRB approved)
           questionnaires.

        -  Radiographic analysis will also be used to determine amount of bony ingrowth of the
           Plexur P device.
