    
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), observational (study in which the
      investigators/physicians observe the participant's data and measure their outcomes) study.
      Approximately 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. The study consists of an
      initial observation phase and extended observation period. An initial observation phase
      starting at enrollment and ending when 24 months have elapsed since the date of loss of
      efficacy (LOE), supplemented with retrospective data collection for the period between LOE
      date and date of enrollment in the study. Participants remaining epoetin alfa (EPO-Ab)
      positive 24 months after LOE will enter a 2-year extended observation period. Study visits
      will take place every month during the initial observation phase and data will be collected
      every 6 months during the extended observation phase. Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical
      examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The total study duration for each
      participant will be approximately for 4 years.
