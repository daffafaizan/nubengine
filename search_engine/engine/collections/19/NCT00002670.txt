      and disease-free survival in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck at high risk of locoregional recurrence who are treated postoperatively with concurrent
      cisplatin and radiotherapy. II. Compare the toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy vs.
      radiotherapy alone in the postoperative setting.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Involved-field irradiation using Co60, 1-6 MV
      photons, or electrons. Arm II: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Irradiation as in
      Arm I; plus Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 438 patients will be entered over approximately 5 years.
