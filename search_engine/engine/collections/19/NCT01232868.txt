      responses and lower protection in the elderly. Here we hypothesize that this is due to
      intrinsic defects in innate responses which translates into suboptimal Hemagglutination
      Inhibition Assay (HAI) titers. Therefore, early innate signatures of vaccination should
      correlate with, and predict the immunogenicity of TIV in the young and elderly.

      STUDY DESIGN: Single center, open label study in which adult healthy volunteers with no
      contraindications to immunization will be vaccinated with TIV. Blood samples will be
      collected on Days D0 (at enrollment) and D1, D3, D7, D14, D30, D180 post vaccination to study
      innate and/or adaptive immunity markers. Even though influenza vaccination is considered
      safe, volunteers will be asked to report any local or systemic adverse events (AEs) from Day
      0 (vaccination) to Day 7 in memory aids. Reactogenicity events will also be evaluated by
      injection site examination on visits at D0, D1, D3 and D7. Volunteers will be also asked to
      report local and systemic AEs developing the day of a blood draw.

      Additionally, only AEs considered related (unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely
      related) will be collected and reported in this study from Day 0 (vaccination) to Day 180.
      After Day 30 only related SAEs will be collected and reported.
