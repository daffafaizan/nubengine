      knowledge gap in understanding their behavior and in developing methods to help them quit. No
      efficacy data have been reported for telephone counseling of smokers who prefer to use Asian
      languages, although telephone intervention holds promise for these groups because of its
      convenience and its potential to reach large numbers of smokers. In this two-arm design
      subjects are stratified by language (Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese) and randomized to
      telephone counseling (plus materials) or self-help materials only, which serves as the
      control. The study is significant in several ways. First, it provides timely information on a
      cessation approach for a traditionally under-served population (Asian language speakers).
      Second, effective telephone counseling can be widely applied because of the proliferation of
      quitlines with centralized services in recent years. Third, by targeting Asian language
      speakers this study addresses the issue of ethnic disparities, which has been identified by
      many (including the NCI Bypass Budget) as a research priority.
