      maxillary hypoplasia. The differences between SARME with a tooth-borne or a bone-borne
      distractor have already been extensively investigated, bringing to light that a bone-borne
      distractor has less negative side effects. One of the major concerns with the tooth-borne
      distractor is the tipping of the anchor teeth, which is bypassed by the bone-borne distractor
      which applies its force directly on the bone. One study investigated the tipping of teeth
      with a bone-borne distractor in 10 patients, showing that there was a minor change in the
      tooth axis. The investigator proposes a multi-center study to investigate this tipping
      further, bringing into consideration the height of the osteotomy line and the height and
      placement of the transpalatal distractor as possible factors. If tipping occurs depending on
      these factors, the investigator could identify the situations that cannot be straightened by
      the orthodontist and provide another course of action for these specific patients.
