      through daily activity, which is notably lower in this population and could be beneficial for
      sufferers managing this lifelong disease. With an increase in physical activity, the exergame
      aims to introduce, instill and integrate daily physical activity in the lives of IBD
      sufferers. The Just Dance Kids exergame for Nintendo Wii employs moderate intensity physical
      activity and is well suited for this study. The exergame intervention protocol will comprise
      a ramped duration aerobic exercise training starting with 10 minutes in week 1 and rises to
      30 minutes per session in weeks 5 through 8. Just Dance Kids will be used by participants
      under the age of 11 and Just Dance for participants over the age of 10 due to the age
      appropriate dancing skill required in each game. The aim is to determine if this moderate
      intensity, 5 times per week exercise could decrease IBD flare-ups, improve cardiovascular
      fitness, reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality and quantity of sleep and improve the
      health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with IBD.
