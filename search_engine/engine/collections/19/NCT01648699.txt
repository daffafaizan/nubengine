    
      This is a prospective (study following participants forward in time), open-label (all people
      know the identity of the intervention), single-arm, multi-center (conducted in more than one
      center) study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of stable dose of OROS hydromorphone
      among participants with cancer pain. The duration of this study will be 28 days and will
      include visits at: Day 0 (Baseline), Day 7, 14 and 28. The OROS hydromorphone will be
      administered orally for 28 days and dose titration (incremental increase in drug dosage to a
      level that provides the optimal therapeutic effect) will be done every two days upon
      administration of dose. Rescue medication (a medication intended to relieve symptoms
      immediately) of morphine will be permitted throughout the study duration. Efficacy of the
      participants will primarily be evaluated by Brief Pain Inventory score. Participants' safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
