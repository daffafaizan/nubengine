      surgery. Eligible patients will receive treatment with tumor treating fields therapy using
      the Optune device starting less than 2 weeks prior to start of chemoradiation. Patients will
      receive radiation and temozolomide at a routine treatment dose and schedule.

      The expected toxicity is skin related, and patients will be followed closely with weekly skin
      and neurological examinations during radiation therapy and for 8 weeks afterwards to capture
      any delayed toxicity as they begin adjuvant therapy per routine treatment. As long as study
      treatment is tolerated and their conditions remain stable, patients will continue the
      treatment for up to 24 months.

      Prior to enrollment, an exploratory analysis of radiation dosimetry will be performed by
      phantom modeling incorporating the Optune arrays. The study incorporates three stages of
      recruitment to confirm the safety of combining tumor treating fields therapy with concurrent
      chemoradiation: a safety lead-in cohort of the first 6 patients enrolled, a second safety
      lead-in cohort of 9 patients, and an expansion cohort with 15 additional patients.
