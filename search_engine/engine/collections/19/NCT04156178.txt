      as 90%. However, recent follow-up studies have shown a substantial portion of treated
      patients relapsed due to antigen escape. CD20-CD19 cCAR is a compound Chimeric Antigen
      Receptor (cCAR) immunotherapy with two distinct functional CAR molecules expressed on a
      T-cell, directed against the surface proteins CD20 and CD19. CD20-CD19 cCAR intends to target
      the mechanisms of single-CAR relapse, specifically antigen escape.
