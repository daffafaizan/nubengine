    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1. To determine progression-free survival at 6 months associated with use of RAD001
      (everolimus) in patients initially diagnosed with low-grade glioma who undergo biopsy or
      subtotal resection at the time of recurrence with pathologic evidence of recurrent low-grade
      glioma (LGG).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To further delineate the safety profile of RAD001 in patients with recurrent LGG.

        2. To assess overall survival (OS) in patients treated with RAD001.

        3. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) in patients treated with RAD001.

        4. To assess the correlation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt and phosphatase and tensin
           homolog (PTEN) expression with response, progression status by 6 months, and OS in
           patients treated with RAD001.
