      electrical stimulation to the LES and has completed two clinical feasibility studies using
      the EndoStim stimulation system in fifteen subjects.

      Acute electrical stimulation resulted in significant LES pressure with no adverse effects
      reported.

      Results of these studies are promising and warrant additional clinical study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of EndoStim stimulation system to treat GERD over time.

      In this study, EndoStim proposes using a fully implantable system. Results of this study are
      expected to provide confirmation of safety of long-term LES stimulation and may provide long
      term clinical benefit for GERD patients.
