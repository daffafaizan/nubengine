    
      ICU patients fulfilling the CDC criteria for nosocomial pneumonia and mechanically ventilated
      for no more than 24 hours are included in the study. The material for the diagnostic
      procedure is pulmonal secretion collected by 1. suctioning in the tracheal tube and 2.
      bronchioalveolar lavage. The diagnostic procedures are culturing, 16S and18S gene PCR and
      subsequent sequencing. The 3 diagnostic methods will be compared in order of proper diagnosis
      and the ability to determine a specific antimicrobial treatment.
