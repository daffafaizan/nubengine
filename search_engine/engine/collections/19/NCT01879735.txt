      PET/CT methods developed in the pig studies are translated to studies in healthy humans and
      patients with cholestatic disorders. Dynamic PET/CT scans of the liver and biliary system are
      combined with measurements of tracer concentrations in a radial artery and a liver vein and
      measurements of hepatic blood flow by intravenous infusion of indocyanine green (ICG)/Ficks
      principle. Kinetic parameters from PET/CT measurements and invasive measurements are compared
      for validation of the PET estimated parameters and refinement of the PET modeling, if
      required.
