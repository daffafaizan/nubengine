      cancers with comparable clinical and oncologic outcomes. Laparoscopy may be considered as an
      alternative approach for T4 colon cancers with the advantage of faster recovery. The survival
      outcome of T4 colon cancers still dismays clinicians and patients. Preoperative chemotherapy
      is an attractive concept for locally advanced colon cancer. Optimal systemic therapy at the
      earliest possible opportunity may be more effective at eradicating distant metastases than
      the same treatment given after the delay and immunological stress of surgery. Besides, the
      shrinkage of primary tumor before surgery may reduce the risk of incomplete surgical excision
      and the risk of shedding of tumor cells during surgery. The aim of the present study is to
      compare the short-and long-term survival outcomes between laparoscopic surgery alone and
      laparoscopic surgery with 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for T4 colon cancer as well as
      the mortality and the morbidity.

      The number of patients, which needs to get power of 80%, is 1960. The average numbers of
      patients needs to reach approximately 200, and that of surgical centers needs to reach 10.

      Arrangements in the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative period will be in complete
      accordance with the usual care of the center.

      The baseline demographics and conditions as well as the perioperative items and the
      postoperative occurrences will be recorded through a prior designed e-questionnaire.

      Globally,the disease free survival rate (chemotherapy and surgery), mortality (chemotherapy
      and surgery), the morbidity (chemotherapy and surgery) and the proportion of completion of
      laparoscopic surgery of the two surgical strategies will be analized and compared.
