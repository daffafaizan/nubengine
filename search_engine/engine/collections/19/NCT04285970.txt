      same detection rate of the propulsion cycle as a dynamometric wheel (step 1). In addition,
      the investigator hypothesize that the categorization of the detected propulsion cycle as a
      function of force intensity is similar between the angular deceleration of the wheel during
      propulsion calculated from the inertial unit and the external mechanical power calculated
      from a dynamometric wheel (step 2).
