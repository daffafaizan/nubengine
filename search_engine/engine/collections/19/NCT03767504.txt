    
      This study will be an open label, uncontrolled, ascending dose clinical trial to assess the
      tolerance and effect of orally ingested Musclin, 20 mg thymol per capsule, in healthy adult
      subjects. In addition, this study will evaluate whether Musclin has an effect on creatine
      kinase and myostatin levels. The study will aim to enroll 20 consenting men and women.
      Consented subjects will ingest 2 capsules of Musclin daily for 30 days and increase to 4
      capsules daily for an additional 30 days . Physical assessments and biological samples will
      be collected at baseline (day 0) and at end of treatment (d 60). Surveys to include reported
      stamina and energy levels will be collected at baseline, prior to increased dosage (d 30) and
      end of treatment period. Risk to participants is expected to be minimal and will be outlined
      through an informed consent.
