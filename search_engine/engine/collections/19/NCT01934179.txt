      I. To determine the relationship between pre-treatment telomere length (TL) and rate of grade
      3 or higher adverse events occurring on front line leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and
      oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)-based chemotherapy among patients over the age of 70 with early stage or
      metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of the FOLFOX-based chemotherapy treatment on peripheral blood
      lymphocyte telomere length.

      II. To evaluate the association between pre-treatment geriatric assessment tools scores,
      telomere length, and the incidence of chemotherapy related adverse events among older early
      stage or metastatic CRC patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association between pre-treatment levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6),
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and incidence of chemotherapy related adverse events.

      II. To evaluate the correlation between pre-treatment telomere length, levels of other
      biomarkers of aging (IL6, CRP, D-dimer), and rates of adverse events with FOLFOX-based
      chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo blood sample collection for analysis via real-time polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2 years.
