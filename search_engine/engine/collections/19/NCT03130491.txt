      clinically approved indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The primary
      objective evaluates performance and treatment effect of the use of the EMBLOK. A secondary
      objective of this study is to analyze the safety profile and the type of captured debris from
      the Emblok filter after TAVR. Due to the small sample size, the study is not powered to
      detect a reduction in actual stroke rates. However, the potential risk of stroke will be
      assessed based on neurological evaluations pre and post procedure. In addition, silent
      ischemic damage and cerebral embolic burden will be assessed using DW MRI studies.
