      PET/CT images, including other kinds of CT serials, were transported into a personal
      computer. Using the open source software of 3D-Slicer, volumes of interest (VOIs) for primary
      tumor, or even lymph nodes, was semi-automatically or manually segmented. And then, radiomic
      features were extracted.

      PET Parameters:

      Using combined CT VOIs, corresponding PET standard uptake value (SUV, no unit) were measured.
      For a foci (either tumor, or lymph node), mean, sum and maximum SUV were documented, and were
      used for training and validating models alongside radiomic features.

      Feature Selection:

      Data were analyzed by deep learning or random forests method, and top 20 variables were
      scored by their contribution to the regression (variable importance, VIMP). The generalized
      features were identified as the same ones between two kinds of image serials (for example,
      ordinary and thin-section CT, or PET and CT). Additionally, when three or more features met
      the criterion, a lower value of Akaike information criterion (AIC) which measures the
      relative quality of statistical models was used to find appropriate features with lower
      overfitting possibility.

      Model Validation:

      The developed model was validated internally and externally. The internal indices for
      independent continuous variable were accuracy (bias and absolute bias) and precision
      (correlation coefficient and R square), and that for independent classified or survival
      variable was c-index. The patients enrolled from another medical center were used for
      external validation.
