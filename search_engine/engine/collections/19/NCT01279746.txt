      precedend of pulmonary emboli; an often fatal disease. It is known that DVT (deep vein
      thrombosis is often occult.

      It is also known that pulmonary embolism is often difficult to diagnose and is often missed
      especialy in patients with chronic illnesses such as COPD and CHF.

      Venous compression ultrsound is an exam that can be preformed bedside. It is preformed by
      placing a vascular ultrasound transducer on the femoral vein and popliteal and checking its
      compressibility. If DVT is present in the femoral or popliteal veins the veins will be
      noncompressible. It has been shown that US compression for DVT can be preformed by physicians
      in the ER with accuracy and speed.

      Presently US compression is not a tool used for detection of occult DVT in the ER. I wish to
      explore the usefullness of compression US of the lower extremities as a screening tool for
      DVT In the hypoxic patient.
