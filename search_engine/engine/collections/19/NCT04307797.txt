      designed to understand the role the GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, and glucagon receptor
      co-agonism has on normal cardiac physiology, myocardial energetics and myocardial glucose
      utilisation. Overweight participants with type 2 diabetes will act as their own control and
      will undergo a series of four imaging visits (in a randomised order) as detailed below:

        1. Cardiac positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI) with carbon-11
           acetate (11C-acetate) - placebo infusion

        2. Cardiac PET-MRI with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) - placebo infusion

        3. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) - placebo infusion. Followed by Cardiac PET-MRI
           11C-acetate - exenatide and glucagon infusion. Followed by CMR - exenatide and glucagon
           infusion

        4. Cardiac PET-MRI with 18F-FDG - exenatide and glucagon infusion

      Study outcome measures are detailed below
