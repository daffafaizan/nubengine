      called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is thought to increase the
      brain's ability to change. Participants will be assigned to one of two groups by chance. One
      group will receive tDCS at a level expected to increase the brain's ability to change, while
      the other group will receive tDCS at a level not thought to affect the brain's ability to
      change. All participants will receive intensive therapy of their more impaired arm and hand,
      focusing on exercises that are meaningful to him/her.
