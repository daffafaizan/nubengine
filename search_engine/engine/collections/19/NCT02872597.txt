      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Standard therapies for status asthmaticus include
      corticosteroids and bronchodilators, typically albuterol. Ipratropium bromide is also a
      bronchodilator, but has a different mechanism of action than albuterol. The addition of
      Ipraropium to children in the Emergency Room with severe asthma exacerbations improves
      outcomes, so many PICU doctors treat patients with status asthmaticus with Ipratropium.
      However, two studies of children hospitalized in the general wards of the hospital (not the
      PICU) show that the addition of Ipratropium to standard care does not effect clinical
      outcomes. This study is a first step towards determining in Ipratropium is helpful in PICU
      patients (like it is in ER patients) or if it not helpful (like it is in general ward
      patients).
