    
      The study will consist of 8 dose cohorts:

        1. Previously untreated patients 20 mg/kg TRU-016 + rituximab.

        2. Relapsed patients, 20 mg/kg TRU-016 + rituximab.

        3. Previously untreated patients 10 mg/kg TRU-016 + rituximab.

        4. Previously untreated patients TRU-016 + obinutuzumab.

        5. Relapsed patients, 20 mg/kg TRU-016 + rituximab + idelalisib.

        6. Patients with CLL on ibrutinib or another BTK inhibitor for a total of more than 1 year
           who have not had a complete response (CR) will continue receiving ibrutinib or another
           BTK inhibitor.

        7. Patients with CLL on ibrutinib or another BTK inhibitor with stable disease and in whom
           the cysteine 481 mutant clone is present at a level >1%, will continue receiving
           ibrutinib or the alternative BTK inhibitor.

        8. Patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL will receive TRU-016 dosed 10 mg/kg for the
           first dose and then 20 mg/kg weekly for 2 cycles, followed by dosing every other week
           for an additional 4 cycles (cycle = 28 days) + bendamustine for 2 days every cycle for 6
           cycles.
