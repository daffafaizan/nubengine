      and anxiety control. The use of this technique is interesting considering the negative
      effects of excessive use of medicines and the side effects of medications which are the most
      common treatment used for the control of these complications. However, there are no reports
      in the literature that evaluated the effects of acupuncture on the control of these variables
      following mandibular third molar extraction, using the placebo-needle design and blinding the
      patients, operators, and evaluators. Therefore, the aim of this split-mouth randomized
      triple-blind clinical trial was to compare the efficacy of acupuncture and placebo
      acupuncture for the control of pain, edema, trismus and preoperative anxiety in the
      extraction of third molars.
