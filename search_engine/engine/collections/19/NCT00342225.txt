      mothers and children in the Republic of Congo. One of the most prominent theories in
      evolutionary studies of human behavior is Trivers' (1974) parent-offspring conflict theory,
      which predicts that offspring contrive to maximize investment from their parents, whereas
      parents try to balance the interests of their offspring with the interests of their future
      reproduction. Fouts (2002) and Fouts, Hewlett & Lamb's (2001) research with the Bofi foragers
      indicated that weaning was not a time that elicited overt conflict between mothers and their
      offspring. Instead, transitions in investment appeared to have occurred prior to weaning,
      perhaps when the mothers became pregnant.

      This study proposes to document mother-child interactions when forager mothers are at
      different stages of pregnancy through naturalistic observations of public behavior, as well
      as measures including: the approximate week of pregnancy, maternal beliefs about child-care,
      and demographic features of families. The data will be analyzed statistically and used to
      evaluate Trivers' parent-offspring theory, as well as to evaluate the validity of claims by
      Western scholars about universal features of parent-child relationships. The foragers provide
      an excellent opportunity to examine child developmental theories that have been well studied
      among industrialized Euro-American cultures, but neglected cross-culturally. Furthermore,
      studies among contemporary hunter-gatherer groups, such as the foragers in Congo, provide
      insight into the evolutionary past of humans, as humans have lived as hunter-gatherers for
      approximately 99% of prehistory, and the few remaining groups are disappearing rapidly
      (Phillipson 1993).
