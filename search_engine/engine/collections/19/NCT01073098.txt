      year in Europe. Even after return to spontaneous circulation, survival is poor because of
      complications such as post-anoxic encephalopathy and multi-organ failure. The pathophysiology
      of cardiac arrest implies ischemia-reperfusion and sepsis like syndrome. These conditions are
      frequently associated with microvascular dysfunction that can be the "motor" of multi-organ
      failure. Few means allow the exploration of microvascular function in human. Recently, StO2,
      a non-invasive technique assessing microvascular function has been described. This technique
      measures the tissular saturation of a muscle using the near-infrared spectroscopy technique.
      It has been described to be a good prognostic factor during haemorrhagic shock state. Dynamic
      parameters such as reperfusion slope allow discriminating between survivors and survivors
      after severe sepsis. This dynamic test assesses the microvasculature recruitment that could
      be a marker of better prognosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate muscle StO2 as a
      prognostic factor after out of hospital cardiac arrest.
