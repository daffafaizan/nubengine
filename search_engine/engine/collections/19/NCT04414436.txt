        1. How did the participants use the program?

             1. What are the barriers and facilitators concerning technologies of the
                internet-based self -management intervention?

             2. Number of logins

             3. How much time did the participants spend on the program (per login )

             4. Number of modules completed, number of home-work and mindfulness assignment
                completed

             5. Type of errors made â€¦

             1. How do participants experience the cancer trajectory, their every-day lives and
                health-related QoL post-treatment gynaecological cancer (before the intervention)?

             2. How do the participants experience the internet-based intervention regarding
                content, the home-work assignments, and the mindfulness assignments, the active
                participation?

             3. How do the participants experience the telephone-contact and follow-ups with the

        4. How is the perceived effect on the gynecological cancer survivors' competence, QoL,
           self-care and coping?

      It is hypothesized that an internet-based psycho-social intervention will support women in
      developing self-competence and self-care which could be measured as increased QOL and
      secondarily affect the impact of cancer, distress, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and
      self-reported ability to monitor and respond to symptoms of recurrence.
