      already marketed formulations of acyclovir in dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) in healthy
      volunteers using dOFM. The study will be conducted at the Clinical Research Center at the
      Medical University Graz. dOFM represents the most reliable way to sample interstitial fluid
      from skin, since it provides diluted but otherwise unchanged dermal interstitial fluid. To
      assess BE and non-BE, we have designed the experiments in such a way that each subject can
      serve as its own control. Each subject will have two sets of BE and non-BE pairs in parallel.
      This study is designed to test dOFM, a new sampling method that allows measurement of skin
      penetration. Measurement of skin penetration enables the reduction of the impact of
      inter-subject variability and therefore decreases the number of subjects needed to achieve
      statistical significance.
