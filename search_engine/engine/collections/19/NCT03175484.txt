      and nurses' workload, stress level, and performance on high-fidelity simulation scenarios
      used routinely in the current anesthesiology, nurse and surgical training curriculum. A NASA
      TLX scale, 100 points numeric scale for anxiety (0 - no anxiety; 100 - maximal anxiety),
      automated quantitative pupillometry, Team Emergency Assessment Measure scale will be used to
      evaluate a workload, anxiety, stress, and performance. Age, sex, previous experience of HFS
      will be noted. All data will be anonymized. The participation in this study is voluntary and
      one can withdraw from this study at any time prior to or after the completion of any
      interview without any penalty.

      Two investigators will independently evaluate the performance of HFS by direct observation
      and video record if necessary. NASA TLX questionnaire will be administrated immediately after
      HFS scenario and before the debriefing. Anxiety scale and pupillometry will be administrated
      before the beginning of HFS scenario and upon its completion.
