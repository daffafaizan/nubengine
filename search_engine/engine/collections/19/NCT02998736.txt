      immune suppression, characterized by MDSC mediated inhibition of NK cell killing. In
      preclinical models the causal link between this immune suppression and the formation of
      postoperative metastases is undeniable. Fortunately, this postoperative immune suppression is
      preventable using modulators of MDSC and NK cell function. In this Phase Ib study the
      hypothesis is that simultaneous administration of perioperative tadalafil, to prevent MDSCs
      from suppressing NK cells, and influenza vaccine, to directly activate NK cells will safely
      and effectively reverse the effects of surgical stress on NK cell cytotoxicity. This is a
      necessary first step towards demonstrating that this re-purposed perioperative regimen can
      reduce the formation of postoperative metastatic disease in cancer surgery patients.

      In this proposed Phase I trial a carefully selected promising perioperative immunomodulatory
      regimen, which includes tadalafil and influenza vaccination, for rapid clinical translation.
      The proposal is to re-purpose these drugs, they already have ample safety data associated
      with their use but neither agent has been systematically administered immediately prior to
      surgery. This trial will allow us to not only establish the safety of this regimen but will
      permit a rigorous assessment of its ability to reverse surgery-induced suppression of NK
      cells. If this regimen can effectively prevent postoperative NK cell dysfunction without any
      regimen limiting toxicity then this will provide the necessary data required to undertake a
      randomized efficacy study in a specific cancer subtype, with cancer recurrence as the primary
      endpoint.
