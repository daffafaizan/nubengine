      research simultaneous tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) were measured in both forearms, with a
      blood pressure cuff above the tissue oximetry probe on one side.

      StO2 values were continuously monitored on each side during unilateral blood pressure (BP)
      cuff inflation (to suprasystolic pressure for 3 min), and then during deflation. Despite
      similarity in the forearm StO2 decline observed with cuff inflation in all women, the rise
      following cuff deflation - indicative of reactive hyperemia - appeared reduced in
      hypertensive patients, suggesting a relationship with impaired endothelial reserve.
