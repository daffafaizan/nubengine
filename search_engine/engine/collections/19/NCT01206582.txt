      upregulation of heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) leads to loss of interstitial cells of Cajal and
      delayed gastric emptying in diabetic non-obese diabetic mice.

      HO1 is an enzyme which protects cells from physical, chemical, and biologic stress. In mice
      with diabetes and slow gastric emptying, hemin increases HO-1 activity and improves gastric
      emptying. Hemin is produced from red blood cells and is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for treating acute porphyria, which is an inherited condition caused by an
      enzyme deficiency. Hemin is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating
      gastroparesis.

      In this study subjects were randomized to intravenous hemin, prepared in albumin, or albumin
      alone. After infusions on days 1, 3, and 7, weekly infusions were administered for 7 weeks.
      Assessments included blood tests for HO1 protein and enzyme activity levels, gastric emptying
      with 13^C-spirulina breath test, autonomic functions (baseline and end), and gastrointestinal
      symptoms every 2 weeks.
