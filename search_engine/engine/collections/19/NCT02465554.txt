      cardiovascular risk during deep space missions. In this protocol, two different forms of
      imaging will be used to evaluate coronary plaque development (CT coronary angiography) and
      microvascular function (myocardial contrast echocardiography) to stratify CV risk. Based on
      this stratification, "omic" patterns (targeted metabolomics, lipidomic, and whole genome
      sequencing) will be assessed to determine whether there are any patterns that can add to
      existing predictive models. Outcomes measures will involve correlation of "omic" patterns to
      incremental risk scaling from lowest (no plaque and normal endothelial function) to highest
      (+ plaque and endothelial dysfunction).
