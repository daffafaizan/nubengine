      fingers DIP, PIP and MCP flexion / extension ROM measurements will be made with universal
      goniometer and developed Leap motion sensor (LMC) based measurement method.

      The study consists of two basic steps:

        1. Development of measurement method with LMC Identification of normROM measurement
           procedure Identification of ROM measurement reporting Establishing the precursor version
           of the software of the measurement method Checking ROM measurement performance criteria
           and providing feedback Measuring the movement defined on 5 persons and providing
           feedback Creation of the last available version of the measurement method

        2. Validity and reliability study Measurements of hand and wrist ROM with developed
           measurement method with LMC and universal goniometer for three times and calculation
           mean of three measurement for two methods
