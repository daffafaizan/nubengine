      after randomization. Aim 2 will examine mGlide usability for providers and provider
      experience and satisfaction with mGlide. It will also examine whether medications are managed
      differently for participants in the two groups. Aim 3 will examine whether patients are more
      satisfied with care in the mGlide group, whether they are more "activated" and have a greater
      sense of self-efficacy in managing their HTN. Aim 4 will be a cost-effectiveness analysis of
      providing mGlide care. The long-term goal is to prevent stroke and improve cardiovascular
      health in populations by increasing health system efficiency and effectiveness. The results
      from our mGlide RCT will provide evidence for the use of readily available mHealth technology
      for bridging the guideline-to-practice gap in HTN treatment in low resource health systems
      serving minority groups.
