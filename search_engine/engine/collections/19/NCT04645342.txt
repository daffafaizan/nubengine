      electrophysiology and interventional cardiology laboratories. Indeed, every atrial
      fibrillation ablation, now the predominant electrophysiology procedure performed throughout
      the world, routinely involves two different transseptal puncture procedures. The
      investigators previously performed a randomized, comparative effectiveness trial
      demonstrating the superiority (in both efficacy and safety) of a radiofrequency (RF)
      transseptal needle versus the conventional sharp-tipped mechanical needle. More recently, an
      alternative approach to transseptal puncture has been FDA approved and is already utilized as
      part of standard of care in these procedures. With this new approach, a J-shaped wire that
      can transmit RF energy is advanced inside the transeptal sheath rather than the more stiff RF
      or conventional needle. As advancing a wire is usually a step employed in any transseptal
      procedure (then usually requiring removal of that wire and then placement of the needle),
      this new approach saves a step. In addition once the wire has been advanced across the
      intra-atrial septum into the left atrium, the wire can be used to avoid potentially severe
      complications; specifically, after a transseptal needle is advanced across the left atrium,
      advancing the sheath over the needle can result in a sudden jump of all the equipment,
      risking perforation of the far left atrial wall. With the wire approach, the wire can be
      safely advanced into a pulmonary vein so that even if the sheath and dilator jump suddenly
      across the septum, they will be guided along the wire and thereby avoid perforation. The
      investigators will be studying patients undergoing a catheter ablation procedure at
      University of California, San Francisco.
