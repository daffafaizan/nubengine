      totally explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In a previous double-blind
      study of atorvastatin in SLE, there was no reduction in surrogate measures of coronary artery
      disease (coronary calcium, coronary IMT, carotid plaque) and no effect on inflammatory
      markers such as ICAM, VCAM, IL-6 and CRP. We need to find novel approaches to reduce coronary
      artery disease in SLE. In a preliminary study, omega-3 was shown to improve flow mediated
      dilation of the brachial artery, oxidative stress and disease activity in lupus patients. In
      this study we will determine if omega-3 improves brachial artery flow dilation, disease
      activity and other vascular inflammatory markers (IL-6, s-VCAM-1, s-ICAM-1) in SLE, in a
      double-blind placebo-controlled trial.
