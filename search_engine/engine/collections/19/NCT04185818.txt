    
      The People's Trial seeks to help enhance the public's understanding of randomised trials by
      facilitating the involvement of the public in the trial research process. The public have,
      through an online format, guided the development and design of The People's Trial randomised
      controlled trial. The People's trial is a parallel, online randomised controlled trial to
      determine if reading a book in bed makes a difference to sleep in comparison to not reading a
      book in bed.

      Members of the public will be recruited through online platforms. Informed consent will be
      obtained from all participants prior to trial registration. Consent forms will be provided
      online prior to registration for The People's Trial. Participants will be required to
      acknowledge that they have read the consent form and give consent to proceed with trail
      registration.

      Participants will be randomly allocated into one of two groups:

      Group 1: Reading a book in bed

      Group 2: Not reading a book in bed
