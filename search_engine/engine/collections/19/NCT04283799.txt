      nosocomial infections and feeding intolerance compared to those with formula feeding during
      hospitalization. However, the currently human milk fortifiers (HMF) have some nutritional
      components defects to meet the needs of very preterm infants. New HMF provide higher protein
      and fat, which are safe and well tolerate to use in preterm infants. Study on safety and
      efficacy of the new HMF is insufficient in Chinese preterm infant population. Our aims are to
      compare the safety and efficacy of a new HMF and other HMF used before in very preterm
      infants. Very low preterm infants with birth weights of 1000-1499g and gestational age 28+0
      weeks to 31 + 6 weeks are included. Infants feeding with new HMF are in the experimental
      group. Infants feeding with other HMF are in the control group, a historically control group.
      Physical growth, nutritional indexes, incidence of feeding intolerance, and time to achieve
      full enteral feeding are compared between the two groups.
