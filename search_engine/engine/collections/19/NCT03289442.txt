      has demonstrated its efficacy and advantages. Left lateral position for insertion, which
      results in air rising away from the left colon and producing acute bends in the sigmoid,might
      increase the risk of colonoscopy loop formation.When there is difficulty advancing the
      colonoscope, supine position can be employed to ensure cecal intubation. Therefore, we
      perform a randomized controlled trial to compares supine position with left lateral position
      for the safety and efficacy of colonoscopy insertion.
