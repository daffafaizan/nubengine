      both at initial presentation and at the time of disease progression. Patients with brain
      metastases have often been excluded from large randomized phase III trials due to concerns of
      poorer survival and impaired ability of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. However, as
      survival has improved, some trials have included such patients, often finding similar benefit
      to patients with metastatic disease elsewhere.

      Bevacizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial
      growth factor, has emerged as an important adjunct to platinum-based chemotherapy doublets
      for use in advanced NSCLC. This drug is normally used as a first line chemotherapy.
      Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted anti-folate agent,which is approved for use in first-line
      (with platinum), maintenance, and second-line treatment of advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Based
      on the efficacy of pemetrexed as a second line agent and the safety questions surrounding
      bevacizumab in those with treated brain metastases, a trial was designed to look at the
      combination of both agents as a second line therapy in NSCLC patients with treated stable
      brain metastases
