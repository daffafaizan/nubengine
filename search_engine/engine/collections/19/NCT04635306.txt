      test meals contain 13C-Spirulina that has 7.9% Nitrogen content. On a second occasion, a low
      nitrogen GEBT in which the test meal will contain 13C-Spirulina with a 6.4% Nitrogen content
      will be administered. Both sets of GEBTs have been manufactured under full cGMPs and both
      will be administered to the participants according to the FDA-approved GEBT labeling. The two
      in vivo results of the two independent GEBT test administrations in the study cohort will be
      compared to determine whether there is any significant different in in vivo 13CO2 signaling.
