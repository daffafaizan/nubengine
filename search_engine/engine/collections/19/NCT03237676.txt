    
      General study objective: to measure the effect of cognitive rehabilitation program for
      attention deficit applied in mild traumatic brain injury patients.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To measure the effect of a 12-week cognitive rehabilitation therapy for attention
           deficits in mild traumatic brain injury patients using neuropsychological and functional
           assessments.

        2. To examine the correlation between neurocognitive deficits and structural brain changes
           at baseline and at six months post injury.

      Study type and location: An interventional study conducted in University Malaya Medical
      Centre (UMMC), Malaysia.

      Participants: Patients diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury at Accident & Emergency
      Department in UMMC.

      Outcome measures:

        1. Neuropsychological Assessment Battery-Screening test

        2. Diffusion Tensor Imaging parameters

        3. Goal Attainment Scaling

      Ethics approval: approved MREC ID NO: 2016928-4293

      Consent: informed written consent will be obtained from all participants of research.

      Estimated sample size:

      Based on medium effect size Cohen's d = 0.35 Investigators used G*Power Version 3.1.9.2 for
      sample size calculation. Sample size calculated: 60 Estimating drop out rate of 40%=24.
      Therefore sample size target n= 84 mTBI patients.

      Study design:

      A two arm randomised controlled trial:

        1. Mild traumatic brain injury control group, and

        2. Mild traumatic brain injury intervention group.

      The study protocol is divided into 3 segments:

        1. Neurocognitive evaluation protocol:

           Investigators will perform Neuropsychological Assessment Battery-Screening test on both
           groups at three months and at six months following brain injury.

        2. Imaging protocol:

           Investigators perform Diffusion Tensor Imaging for both groups at three months and at
           six months following brain injury.

        3. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy protocol:

      The focus is on attention deficits. Each study arm will receive different treatment
      approaches.

      Mild traumatic brain injury control group will receive a patient-centred cognitive therapy.
      This is an application of existing cognitive rehabilitation treatment available at UMMC,
      which include therapy session on symptoms management and coping strategies. This is performed
      and monitored by a cognitive therapy trained Occupational Therapist. Clinical and treatment
      review are provided as part of routine outpatient rehabilitation clinic review.

      Mild traumatic brain injury intervention group will receive individualised structured
      cognitive rehabilitation therapy that consist of:

        1. Direct attention training:

           A deficit-oriented evidence-based treatment approach. The therapy for attention is
           computer-based and is divided into focused attention, selective attention, divided
           attention and sustained attention. Each treatment session is conducted by a trained
           Occupational Therapist in cognitive therapy and a rehabilitation medicine physician.

        2. Strategic approach (metacognitive):

      This involves generalisation of tasks to everyday functional skills. This approach is applied
      after each direct attention training session. This approach include review of individualised
      goals, review of cognitive related problem(s) encountered in participants daily activities
      since injury and problem-solving training. This is also performed by similar trained
      Occupational Therapist and reviewed by a rehabilitation medicine physician.

      Randomisation sampling: Investigators apply simple randomisation in selection of mild
      traumatic brain injury control and intervention group participants.
