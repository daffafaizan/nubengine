      who underwent urodynamic studies in a medical center were reviewed. ANOVA test and post-hoc
      testing with bonferroni's correction were used for statistical analysis. USI is noted during
      filling cystometry and is defined as the involuntary leakage of urine during increased
      abdominal pressure, in the absence of a detrusor contraction. The recruited patients with
      cystocele were classified into three groups (i.e.,evident USI, occult USI and no demonstrated
      USI) according to pad weight results before and after prolapse reduction.
