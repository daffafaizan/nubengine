      with significant morbidity and mortality during pregnancy, after birth and throughout the
      child's lifespan. IUGR is caused by the inability of the placental vasculature to provide
      enough oxygen and nutrients to support the fetus; yet, the mechanisms leading to disruption
      of placental vasculature are unknown. The placenta of ~50% of IUGR fetuses are infiltrated
      with inflammatory cells, specifically maternal T cells, which destroy placental blood vessels
      that support the fetus. This infiltration of T cells is known as villitis of unknown etiology
      (VUE). The diagnosis of VUE is problematic because it occurs without clinical signs and
      symptoms of maternal (or fetal) distress and puts the fetus at significant risk of demise.
      Additionally, VUE commonly recurs in subsequent pregnancies putting future offspring at risk.
      Yet, the exact prevalence of VUE and its significance in IUGR pathogenesis and outcomes are
      poorly understood as VUE is only diagnosed after the infant is outside the womb. Therefore,
      the study aims to recognize risk factors and cellular mechanisms associated with VUE and
      develop methods for diagnosing and treating VUE in utero, in order to improve infant health.
