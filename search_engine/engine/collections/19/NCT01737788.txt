      preterm birth. Cervical occlusion could theoretically be used for the treatment of cervical
      weakness and to protect the cervix against infection. A cervical cerclage could be placed to
      increase the cervical resistance, and occlusion of the external os could be performed to
      retain the cervical mucus plug thereby preventing infection. The aim of this multicentre,
      stratified, randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of cervical occlusion
      versus no cervical occlusion in women with prophylactic and therapeutic cervical cerclages.
