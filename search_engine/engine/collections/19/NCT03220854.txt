      weeks. Patients will continue to receive the same FDA-approved programmed death receptor-1
      (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor that they had been receiving at the
      time of disease progression through 52 weeks following completion of SRT.

      Correlative blood samples will be collected at baseline, prior to the second SRT fraction,
      after the last SRT fraction (on the same day), and at 8, 24, and 52 weeks after the last SRT
      fraction. These samples will be used to determine the mechanistic immunologic effects of
      therapy.
