    
      Relacorilant is a small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The goals of
      this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of relacorilant in
      combination with nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma.

      Eligible patients are those with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) who have
      received at least 2 prior lines of therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in any
      setting, including at least 1 prior gemcitabine-based therapy and at least 1 prior
      fluoropyrimidine-based therapy.

      Patients will receive treatment until progressive disease (PD) (per RECIST v1.1) as
      determined by the Investigator, experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment
      discontinuation criteria are met. All patients will be followed for documentation of disease
      progression and survival information (i.e., date and cause of death) and subsequent
      treatment.
