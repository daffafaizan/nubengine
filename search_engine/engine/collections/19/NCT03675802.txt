      angleand an outer sheath diameter 5.5 mm, inner sheath diameter 4.3 mm and scope diameter 2.9
      mmwas used in all procedures.

      A speculum was introduced into the vagina, and the uterine cervixwas visualized. Initially,
      the surgeon attempted to passthrough the cervical canal with the tool directly. When thatwas
      not possible or when the cervical canal was too rigid ortoo tight, the cervix was grasped
      with a tenaculum.
