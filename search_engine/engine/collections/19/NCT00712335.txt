      subpopulation of asthmatics. Cigarette smoking has been shown to stimulate production of
      cysLTs. CysLTs could activate production of IL-8 for neutrophilia as well as cause
      eosinophilia in the airway of asthmatics.

      LTRAs are felt to be less efficacious than ICS in smokers with asthma. However, LTRA's unique
      mechanism of action could be particularly efficacious in preventing worsening symptoms and
      lung function for smokers with asthma. Given this, along with the fact that ICS are less
      effective in smokers, targeting cysLT could lead to significant clinical benefits for
      asthmatic smokers.

      Data from this study may possibly serve as crucial data for the significant clinical benefits
      for asthmatic smokers and determination of the mechanism of corticosteroid resistance in
      smokers with asthma.
