      improved clinical outcomes such as Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, lung function and
      medication adherence compared to participants receiving IP follow-up care. The Investigator
      also hypothesize that TM follow-up will result in higher caregiver satisfaction because
      families will be able to receive quality subspecialty care in their community (TM) compared
      to those who travel a distance to receive care (IP).
