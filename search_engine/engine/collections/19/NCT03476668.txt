      may exploit the network of goal-directed mode of action. The frontostriatal connections
      underline this functioning, that is based on attention. Since the cognitive processes are
      related with dopamine, the asymmetrical degeneration of the dopaminergic system affects
      differently the right side affected (RPD) and the left side affected (LPD) PD patients.

      The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between the asymmetric dopaminergic
      degeneration and the attentional resources in a group of patients with PD.
