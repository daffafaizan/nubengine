    
      In this retrospective and prospective study, clinical and biological data from diagnosis
      until last news will be recorded.

      Clinical data collected: patients and disease characteristics at the time of the diagnosis,
      disease and mutational status, cardio-vascular risk factors, history of thrombosis and
      cancer.

      Biological data collected: hemogram and bone marrow results if available. During the
      follow-up new data will be noted: treatment changes (reasons of change and type of drug),
      thrombotic events (localization, date and hemogram), phenotypic evolutions (type and date),
      death (date and etiology).
