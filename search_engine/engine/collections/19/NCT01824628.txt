    
      Primary objective:

      The primary objective is to compare the QT/QTc intervals of HIV positive subjects treated
      with antiretroviral therapy and followed at the ambulatory HIV clinic and the QT/QTc
      intervals of :

        1. an outpatient HIV negative population from the same health center pre-admission one-day
           surgical clinic.

        2. the large HIV-free korean population studied in the ECG-ViEW database.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Evaluate the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation in the outpatient HIV positive
           population comparatively to the two HIV negative outpatient populations available from
           the one-day surgical clinic and the ECG-ViEW database.

        -  Evaluate risk factors associated with QTc interval prolongation in the outpatient HIV
           positive population compared to the outpatient HIV negative population and the
           population studied in the ECG-ViEW database.

        -  Compare the QT/QTc intervals and the prevalence of QTc interval prolongation of the
           outpatient HIV positive population currently on an antiretroviral regimen including a
           protease inhibitor versus those on an antiretroviral regimen without protease inhibitor.

        -  Compare the QT/QTc intervals among the outpatient HIV positive population treated with a
           protease inhibitor, in regard to the presence or the absence of certain genetic
           polymorphisms that may influence pharmacokinetic aspects of protease inhibitors.
