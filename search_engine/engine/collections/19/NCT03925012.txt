      body image disturbances, unhealthy weight control practices, and fitness levels.

      The investigators hypothesize that at the post-BOUNCE summer intervention, children will
      exhibit significant decreases in adiposity indicators (percent body fat and waist
      circumference), sweetened drinks and fried foods consumption, and an increase in physical
      fitness (aerobic capacity and minutes of moderated-vigorous physical activity) when compared
      to their baseline values after controlling for demographic, acculturation characteristics.
