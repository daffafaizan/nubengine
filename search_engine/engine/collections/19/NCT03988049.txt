      laser to the 755 nanometer picosecond laser using a split-face (Right-Left) comparison. Both
      of these lasers are currently FDA approved for acne scarring.

      Approximately 18 subjects, men and women with Fitzpatrick skin types I through V and facial
      acne scarring of grades III-IV (moderate to severe) will be enrolled. Both sides of the
      participants' face should have similar amount and severity of acne scarring. Participants
      will be over 18 years old. Patients have to be otherwise healthy without a history of skin
      cancer, keloidal scarring, localized or active infection, immunodeficiency disorders, and
      light sensitivity.

      Patients have to be overall healthy without a history of skin cancer, keloidal scarring,
      localized or active infection, immunodeficiency disorders, and light sensitivity. Per PI
      discretion, any serious medical condition that may interfere with the study. In addition,
      patients who have been taking isotretinoin for a period of 6 months before treatment will be
      excluded.

      Patients will have photographs taken at every visit prior to the laser treatments at week 0,
      week 4, and week 8. Photographs will also be taken at the week 24 follow-up visit. Photos
      will then be assessed by qualified blinded reviewers for comparison.
