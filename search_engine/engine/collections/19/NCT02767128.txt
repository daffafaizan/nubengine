    
      This is a Phase 1/2, randomized multiple treatments, single dose study assessing the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and absolute bioavailability of Fer-In-Sol ( Ferrous Sulfate) and
      Triferic (ferric pyrophosphate citrate, or FPC) administered orally with Shohl's solution in
      healthy volunteers.

      Total participation in the study is approximately six weeks and is comprised of a screening
      visit, 6 treatment periods, and a follow-up visit.

      The study will be conducted over a 13 day period:

      Day 1 will used to determine the baseline serum iron profile for each subject.

      Each subject will subsequently receive in a randomized sequence between Day 2 and 10:

        1. A single oral dose of Fer-In-Sol at 3 mg Fe/kg body weight (bw).

        2. A single oral dose of Oracit Shohl's solution 0.67 mEq/L (0.7 ml/kg bw) followed after
           10 minutes by Fer-In-Sol at 3 mg Fe/kg bw

        3. a single oral dose of Triferic PO at 3 mg Fe/kg bw

        4. a single oral dose of Oracit Shohl's solution 0.67 mEq/L (0.7 ml/kg bw) administered 10
           minutes prior to a single oral dose of Triferic at 3 mg Fe/kg bw.

        5. a single oral dose of Oracit Shohl's solution 0.67 mEq/L (0.7 ml/kg bw) followed
           immediately by a single oral dose of Triferic at 3 mg Fe/kg bw.

      All subjects will receive a single dose of 6.6 mg Triferic as a 4 hour IV infusion (to mimic
      the 4 hour iron tolerance test) on Day 12.

      Blood samples will be obtained at various times to analyze for serum iron parameters and for
      safety.
