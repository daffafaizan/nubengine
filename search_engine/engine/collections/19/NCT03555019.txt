      will be enrolled. The intervention group will receive enteral supplementation with essential
      fatty acids, arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The control group will
      receive standard supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT-oil). The main
      hypothesis is that early, enhanced supply of ARA and DHA will improve brain growth and
      maturation, as compared to standard nutrient supply. Secondary hypotheses are that early,
      enhanced supply of ARA and DHA will improve quality of growth and cognitive development as
      well as reduce the frequency of inflammation-related neonatal comorbidities and long-term
      cardiovascular disease risk. Primary endpoint will be assessed by magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) of the brain at term equivalent age.
