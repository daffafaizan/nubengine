      control of postcraniotomy pain may lead to unexpected clinical outcomes. The current
      management for postcraniotomy pain mainly involves systemic intravenous or oral medication
      and regional anaesthetic injection.

      The investigators intend to compare pre-emptive lidocaine 5% plaster incision covering to a
      placebo for prophylaxis of postcraniotomy pain. In the proposed study, the effectiveness and
      safety of lidocaine 5% plaster for postcraniotomy pain control will be examined compared with
      those of placebo. The investigators aim to provide a novel regional non-invasive prophylactic
      strategy for postcraniotomy pain.
