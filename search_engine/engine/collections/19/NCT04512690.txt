      generated by single pulses of electrical stimulation of the spinal cord using FDA-cleared
      devices 2) characterize optimal stimulation parameter ranges to maximize induced arm and hand
      movement, 3) measure neural changes that could be induced by the system, 4) characterize
      potential clinical effects by assessing patient mobility, spasticity, and neurophysiology
      with standard clinical tests and simple motor tasks.
