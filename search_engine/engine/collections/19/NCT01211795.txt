    
      This is a 4 month trial. During the first month, a prospective headache diary is maintained.
      Migraine frequency, severity (1-10), duration, and all headache medications are recorded.

      Patients are then randomized to receive active gel or placebo gel in double blind fashion.

      Gel is applied to the posterior maxilla once daily for 3 months. A daily headache diary, as
      outlined above, is maintained throughout the trial. Patients may continue to take other
      migraine medications, as needed. No other new migraine therapies may be started during the
      trial.
