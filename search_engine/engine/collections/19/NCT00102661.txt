        1. To evaluate the response rate (CR+PR) to CAMPATH-1H given as continuous infusion
           followed by subcutaneous injection in patients with previously treated CLL who have
           failed fludarabine therapy.

        2. To evaluate whether CAMPATH-1H, given as a continuous infusion followed by subcutaneous
           injections to patients with previously treated CLL will improve tolerability of the
           agent and permit higher doses to be delivered through that route.

        3. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CAMPATH-1H when given as a 24 hour continuous
           infusion followed by a subcutaneous injection.
