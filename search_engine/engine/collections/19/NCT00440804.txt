      Early treatment by intravenous ibuprofen L-lysine (IV ibuprofen) has been suggested in
      preliminary studies to close the ductus and shorten hospital stay. This study aims to
      determine the effect of early treatment with IV ibuprofen given to the very low birth weight
      infant with a non-symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) at less than 72 hours of life to
      accelerate and maintain ductal closure, thereby reducing the need for rescue therapy.
