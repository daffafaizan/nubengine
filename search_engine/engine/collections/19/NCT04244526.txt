      third common cause of human infection after respiratory and intestinal infections. The
      infection can be life threatening and associated with serious complications. UTI can be
      associated with defined symptoms'symptomatic' or without symptoms 'asymptomatic'.
      Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of >100000 colony forming units/ml of
      urine of a single pathogen in two consecutive midstream clean catch urine specimen or on
      catheterization specimen from an individual without signs or symptoms associated with urinary
      or genital organs. Asymptomatic bacteriuria can lead to acute pyelonephritis in30%of pregnant
      women and complications such as early delivery, increase risk of hypertension, pre-eclampsia,
      low birth weight and postpartum endometritis. Ecoli accounts for most cases of symptomatic
      and asymptomatic bacteriuria in women, representing70 _90 %of the cases. The important
      virulence factors of uropathogenic ecoli can be broadly divided into two groups :bacterial
      cell surface factors and secreted factors. The emergence of drug resistant microorganism
      among Uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains increases the serious threat to global health.
      Ecoli often acquired genes coding for antibiotic resistance, beta-lactamase enzymes are the
      most frequent and play a key role, conferring resistance of bacteria to beta lactam
      antibiotic group such as penicillin and cephalosporins. Therefore, knowledge regarding local
      prevalence of uropathogenic ecoli and antimicrobial resistance is essential for optimal
      management of UTI.
