      addition to the challenge posed by anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, there are issues
      surrounding previous treatment with anthracyclines which limit its utility in the metastatic
      disease setting. Many patients with advanced disease will have had prior anthracycline-based
      adjuvant therapy, may have reached a maximum cumulative lifetime dose, or developed
      refractory disease, creating an obvious need for non-anthracycline treatment strategies.3
      Platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapies as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer
      have demonstrated significant activity, producing single-agent response rates > 50%; in
      combination these rates increased to > 60% in both previously untreated and in patients who
      previously received anthracyclines.3 However, overall survival has remained relatively
      unchanged.4 As there is currently no standard of care for patients with metastatic breast
      cancer, various physical and psychological factors must be considered when evaluating
      chemotherapy treatment options, including the patient's tumor biology and growth rate,
      presence and extent of metastases, history of prior treatment and response, sensitivity and
      tolerance to therapy, and quality of life.2 Strategies to develop combination, higher dose,
      or sequential regimens using these active agents, while improving response rates and/or time
      to progression, may produce increased toxicity without increased survival.2 Because
      metastatic breast cancer remains essentially incurable using cytotoxic therapy alone, the
      study of targeted biologics offers new opportunities to enhance drug delivery via their
      ability to regulate specific receptors that are associated with clinically aggressive disease
      processes.
