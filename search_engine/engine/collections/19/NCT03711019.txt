      the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto, ON, Parkwood Institute of St.
      Joseph's Healthcare in London, ON and University of British Columbia (UBC) Hospital in
      Vancouver, BC. It will include participants who are classified as responders or remitters in
      the CREST-MST (NCT03191058) trial, the CORRECT-BD (NCT03641300) trial and individuals
      responding to bitemporal ECT after participating in either of the above trials, who qualify
      for a continuation course of convulsive therapy to prevent relapse of depression. Individuals
      blinded to their acute course of treatment will continue to receive the convulsive therapy to
      which they responded in in a blinded fashion. Continuation treatments will be scheduled
      according to a modified version of the Symptom-Titrated Algorithm-based Longitudinal ECT
      (STABLE) algorithm. STABLE includes an initial four week period of ECT delivered on a fixed
      schedule (once or twice per week), and then transitions to a symptom-driven schedule whereby
      ECT is delivered between zero and two times per week based on the patient's weekly Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) outcomes during weeks five to 24.

      Further, this trial will also include non-responders to MST or right unilateral ultrabrief
      pulse ECT (RUL-UB ECT) from CREST-MST or CORRECT-BD, who are switched to bitemporal ECT based
      on their clinical indication. They will receive bitemporal ECT on an acute basis, i.e. 2 - 3
      times per week. If their symptoms respond or remit with bitemporal ECT, they will also be
      offered a continuation course of bitemporal ECT as part of this trial and will be followed in
      the same manner as those receiving MST or RUL-UB ECT.
