      available science or research evidence"1, has been stressed from scientific, ethical, and
      marketing perspectives. While empirical evidence supports both the efficacy and effectiveness
      of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), demand for
      clinicians trained in these approaches far exceeds supply. New technologies provide the
      opportunity to facilitate access to this specialized treatment. A growing body of research
      has found that web-based self-administered psychotherapy is highly effective, cost-efficient,
      and can achieve clinical improvements similar to those obtained with clinician administered
      therapy. The long-term goal of this project is to improve clinical and occupational
      functioning and decrease disability associated with OCD by improving access to effective
      treatments through the use of web-based CBT treatment. The intervention involves a computer
      program (BT STEPS) and human interaction via telephone. The inclusion of human interaction
      for coaching and encouragement has been found to significantly increase compliance and
      success rates in computerized self-help. Whether treatment outcomes differ when this coaching
      is done by a therapist versus when done by a trained non-therapist has not been studied. This
      is the first program to examine a hybrid model involving different levels of remote clinician
      coaching in combination with an on-line self-help tutorial. In Phase I the investigators will
      test the efficacy and feasibility of computer therapy alone (n=35), computer plus
      nontherapist coach (n=35) and computer plus CBT therapist coach. In phase II the
      investigators will do a fully powered study comparing our model to traditional face-to-face
      therapy.
