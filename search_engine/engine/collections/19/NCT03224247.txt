      the first documented cesarean delivery in 1020 AD, various modifications have been made in
      the technique. It was a surgery performed as a last resort, mostly peri- or post-portem.

      Many variations in cesarean section technique have been studied.our study aim is to decrease
      blood loss during cesarean section through decreasing incidence of uterine vessels injury.
      The investigator supposed that applying Vertical pull on a small C-shaped incision in the
      lower uterine segment during cesarean section allows the tissues to split along their natural
      arrangement, decreasing the probability of extension of the wound into the uterine vessels,
      thus; decreasing blood loss; operative time and maternal recovery.
