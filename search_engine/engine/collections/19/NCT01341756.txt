      equates to a BED of 48.6Gy, increases the response rates of symptom relief compared to
      historical controls. (Tey et al.) With this dose fractionation is used for bleeding, there is
      an increase in response rates from 55%(historical) to 75%for pain, there is an increase in
      response rates from 25% (historical) to 45% for obstruction, there is an increase in response
      rates from 25% (historical) to 45%
