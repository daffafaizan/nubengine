      two groups, which are CGMS education group and conventional education group. The study will
      be conducted for 12 weeks for each participants. Intervention group will receive diet
      education based on CGMS data, using post prandial glucose response, calculated by incremental
      area under curve of glucose level. Control group will receive conventional diabetes diet
      education without CGMS data. Primary outcome is change of HbA1c from baseline for 12 weeks,
      and secondary outcomes are changes of fasting blood glucose level, body weight, waist
      circumference, blood lipid level, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance
      (HOMA-IR) , c-peptide, microbiome, 7-point self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and
      compliance/satisfaction questionnaire from baseline for 12 weeks.
