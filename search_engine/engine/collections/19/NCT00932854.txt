      lung cancer, there are very few data available on its role in the diagnosis of isolated
      mediastinal lymphadenopathy due to other causes such as sarcoid, tuberculosis or lymphoma.
      The REMEDY trial aims to evaluate the accuracy of EBUS in this setting and assess any
      reduction in the number of mediastinoscopies and healthcare costs.
