      there is substantial evidence that inflammation is an essential prerequisite for scarring.
      Although scar tissue restores the normal skin barrier, the new tissue is inferior in
      structural, aesthetic, and functional respects. The mammalian wound healing response may have
      originated during the time of high susceptibility to infection. Therefore, we may have
      developed speed optimized wound healing where a multiple redundant compensating rapid
      inflammatory response allows the wound to heal quickly without infection. The scar is then
      the price mammals have to pay for evolutionary survival after being wounded.

      Tocotrienol may be an effective tool to prevent or reduce normal, hypertrophic, or keloid
      scarring by mediating the inflammatory response. Tocotrienol is a safe and convenient
      treatment that could be used by mouth or topically. There has never been a study on the
      effectiveness of tocotrienol in preventing or reducing scar formation.
