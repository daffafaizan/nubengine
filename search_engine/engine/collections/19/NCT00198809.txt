      maintenance (phase 2). Transition into phase 2 will be individually determined by participant
      attainment of a goal 'healthy' weight. During the 52 weeks participants will pick up
      supplemental pills, have weight measured, and meet for educational meeting on an every other
      week basis. Upon entering phase 2, participants will have the option of educational sessions
      on a monthly basis or every other week. Participants will have a goal 'healthy' weight
      determined at baseline by a combination of personal goals, Harris Benedict Equation goals,
      body composition goals, and BMI range. All participants will be put on a weight reduction
      plan to reach these goals and be randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups, Biolean,
      Biolean Free, or Placebo. Since it is expected some participants will reach goal weight
      before others, the 2nd milestone data collection will occur at attainment of goal weight. To
      assure all participants have 3 data collection points, any participant who is not expected to
      reasonably reach their goal weight by 34 weeks will have the 2nd milestone data collection at
      26 weeks. The 3rd milestone data collection for all participants is 52 weeks after initial
      intake of supplement. Upon attainment of goal weight and 2nd data collection point,
      participants will be educated on a weight maintenance plan and given a new meal plan to
      achieve long term healthy weight maintenance.
