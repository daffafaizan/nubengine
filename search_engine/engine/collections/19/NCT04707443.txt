      will be enrolled. They will be randomly divided into donor milk group and extensively
      hydrolyzed formula group. To investigate the effects of different enteral nutrients on the
      growth and development of infants with ileostomy, evaluate and compare the effectiveness of
      extensively hydrolyzed formula and donor human milk, and the effects on postoperative
      intestinal permeability, ostomy fluid volume, intestinal microbiome and metabolites,
      septicemia, colitis and cholestasis.
