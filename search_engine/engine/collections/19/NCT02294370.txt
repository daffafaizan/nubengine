      conditions. The onset of type 2 diabetes is a gradual shift from normal to abnormal, giving
      rarely noticeable symptoms at its early stages or even in later stages when damage has
      already been caused. Due to the gradual onset, the diagnosis is often delayed, and as much as
      half of the asymptomatic patients remain undetected. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes are
      based on artificial boundaries reflecting the risk of complications related to diabetes. The
      golden standard of diagnosis of diabetes is a 2 hours oral glucose tolerance test, which is
      both time consuming and costly. This study aims at improving the prediction of type 2
      diabetes among high-risk individuals by examining glucose excursion patterns in subjects with
      impaired glucose tolerance. In addition, this study will show whether the currently used
      diagnostic test could be replaced by an easier and less expensive method.
