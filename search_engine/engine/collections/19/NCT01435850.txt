    
      This study is a monocentric study, randomized and controlled including two types of hip
      stems: SL PLUS MIA (control group) and SL PLUS (study group).

      Each group will include 45 patients where a number of 5 patients for each group calculated
      extra in case of loss.

      Patients will be followed after

        -  6 weeks

        -  6 months

        -  12 months

        -  24 months. Radiographs are taken in a-p and lateral view using a standard protocol.
           Primary and secondary stability of both hip stems will be analyzed using the EBRA
           software (Ein-Bild-Roentgen-Analyse, University of Innsbruck, Austria) after the
           completion of the two year follow-up.

      Further, we compare all differences in clinical outcome using Harris Hip Score, Oxford hip
      score and radiographic findings such as radiolucent lines.
