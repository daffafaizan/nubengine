        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II study dose of lometrexol
           and paclitaxel when combined with folic acid in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic solid tumors.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the plasma concentrations of lometrexol and paclitaxel and relate their
           pharmacokinetics to toxicity outcome in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of lometrexol and paclitaxel.

      Patients receive lometrexol IV over 30-60 seconds immediately followed by paclitaxel IV over
      3 hours on day 1. Patients also receive oral folic acid beginning 7 days before
      lometrexol/paclitaxel and continuing for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Doses of lometrexol and paclitaxel are escalated sequentially. Cohorts of 3-6 patients
      receive escalating doses of lometrexol and paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Six to twelve additional patients are treated at the recommended
      phase II study dose (dose immediately preceding the MTD).

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study.
