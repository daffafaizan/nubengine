      Longitudinal analyses were conducted on the associations between diet and cardiovascular and
      cardiopulmonary disease risk in approximately 3,800 Offspring men and women over eight years
      of follow-up (from 1984 to present). These analyses considered key nutrients as well as newly
      defined dietary patterns in Framingham men and women. Cross sectional analyses of diet and
      plasma lipoprotein relationships in Offspring men and women at two examinations (Exam 3,
      1984-88; and Exam 5, 1991-94) were also conducted. All analyses evaluated the total (direct
      and indirect) and joint effects of dietary nutrients. Where appropriate, analyses controlled
      for plasma nutrient levels (folacin, vitamins B6 and B12 and homocysteine). The influence of
      potential confounding variables, effect modifiers, and intervening variables that lie in the
      causal pathway were examined, as appropriate to the statistical model, including traditional
      cardiovascular disease risk factors and apoE isoform status.

      Several existing Framingham data sets were utilized, including comprehensive data sets on
      nutrient intake, cardiovascular disease risk factors, clinically verified cardiovascular and
      cardiopulmonary endpoints and other covariates. The Offspring Exam 3 and 5 nutrition data
      sets included multiple day assessments of dietary intake which improved the ability to detect
      relationships of interest. The investigators completed the Framingham Food Habit
      Questionnaire data set for Exam 5; this instrument included important covariates for the
      analyses (including vitamin supplement use).

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
