    
      This randomized clinical trial of consenting nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor
      with a Foley catheter seeks to determine whether use of early amniotomy (defined as amniotomy
      within 1 hour of Foley catheter removal) improves obstetrical outcomes when compared with
      delayed amniotomy (defined as amniotomy at least 4 hours following Foley catheter removal).

      This project will include 110 women recruited from the obstetrical service at Prentice
      Women's Hospital. Women will be included if they are at least 37 weeks gestation, have a
      singleton pregnancy, have intact membranes and are undergoing an induction of labor using a
      Foley catheter. Following removal of Foley catheter, women will be assessed for safety of
      amniotomy and if appropriate, randomized to either early amniotomy or delayed amniotomy.

      Women will be randomized with equal probability to the intervention group using block
      randomization stratified by use of Foley catheter alone or Foley catheter-misoprostol use.

      Women in the early amniotomy group will undergo amniotomy within 1 hour of Foley catheter
      removal. Women in the delayed amniotomy group will undergo amniotomy at least 4 hours
      following Foley removal. The remainder of labor management will be at the discretion of each
      woman's obstetric provider.

      Prior to discharge from the hospital, baseline demographic and clinical data will be obtained
      via chart review
