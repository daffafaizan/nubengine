      4000 lives each day. The unprecedented coronavirus pandemic seriously impacts people with
      pre-existing health conditions. People who have TB are usually more vulnerable to other
      infections, including the novel coronavirus, due to pre-existing lung damage. They are at a
      higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Certain populations are at greater
      risk of TB, because of where they live, where they work or because of other socio-economic
      factors which result in them experiencing barriers to accessing health services.
