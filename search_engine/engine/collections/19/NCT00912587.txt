      pressure, heart rate, muscle sympathetic nervous activity and baroreflex control in lean and
      obese individuals and will investigate whether ghrelin administration can influence the
      response to stress. Both lean and obese individuals will be recruited and will receive an
      intravenous administration of ghrelin at increasing doses for 1 hour. Their blood pressure,
      heart rate and sympathetic activity (small recording electrode in the peroneal nerve) will be
      recorded and subjects will be submitted to a mental arithmetic stress towards the end of the
      infusion. Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals for various metabolic tests. These
      responses will be compared to those when submitted to saline infusion.
