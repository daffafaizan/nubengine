      their heart rate in response to metabolic demand. Previous studies have shown that brief
      increases in pacing rates in patients with biventricular pacemakers can improve cardiac
      contractility. We hypothesize that the benefits of an increased biventricular pacing rate
      could be sustained and would improve cardiovascular and neurohormonal parameters in patients
      suffering from volume overload. We intend to prospectively evaluate this hypothesis in a
      single blind randomized cross-over design trial.

      We will screen 40 patients who have previously implanted biventricular pacemakers (or a
      narrow QRS) and an elevated B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) level. Following enrollment,
      patients will be randomly assigned to have their atrial pacing rate increased to 85 beats per
      minute or to be unchanged during the first of 2 visits. Patients will be unaware of their
      treatment assignment. They will be observed for six hours in a monitored setting. The primary
      outcome will be cardiac output, as measured noninvasively by NICOM (Cheetah Medical Inc.,
      Israel) system before and after the observation period. Secondary outcomes will include
      changes in neurohormonal measures and thoracic impedance. If this proof-of-concept study
      demonstrates a positive effect, future research would evaluate the ability of increased
      pacing rates to prevent or abort decompensation of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).
