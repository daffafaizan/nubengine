      thus being able to increase the hospitalization time and associated with increased
      postoperative mortality. Regional anesthesia through simple or continuous femoral nerve block
      are options for analgesia in patients with femoral fracture, as well as analgesia by venous
      opioids. A potential benefit of regional anesthesia is precisely to avoid the use of opioids
      and other general anesthetics, which in turn are also closely related to postoperative
      delirium. Continuous femoral block, since the preoperative period, is associated with the
      reduction of acute pain and opioid consumption, in patients with femoral neck fractures.
      There are few studies available in the literature comparing analgesic equipotency between
      levobupivacaine and ropivacaine in peripheral nerve blocks. In none of them, the peripheral
      analgesia in the femoral nerve, for proximal femoral fracture was compared.
