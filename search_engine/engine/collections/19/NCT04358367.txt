      anesthesia for cesarean section. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective α 2-adrenergic
      agonist. Its effects entail sympatholytic, sedative, anesthetic, and analgesic actions. The
      present randomized study aimed to evaluate the effect of intravenous DEX administration on
      the hemodynamic parameters and epigastric pain in women subjected to cesarean section.

      Patients and Methods: This study is a randomized double-blinded controlled trial. Seventy
      patients were randomly assigned to one of two interventional groups: one group received
      spinal anesthesia and intravenous DEX (1µg/kg) and the other group received spinal anesthesia
      and placebo (saline). The administrated drugs were slowly injected intravenously over 10
      minutes then intrathecal block was achieved using 2-2.2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine (10
      -12.5 mg) introduced at L3/4 or L4/5 interspace. Primary Outcome parameters included
      frequency of hypotension episodes, frequency of ephedrine doses needed, sedation score and
      epigastric pain episodes. Secondary outcomes included time to onset of sensory and motor
      blocks, duration of sensory and motor blocks, operative duration, time needed to request of
      rescue analgesia, level of intrathecal block, and neonatal Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes.
