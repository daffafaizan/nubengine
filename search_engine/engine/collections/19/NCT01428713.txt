    
      Subjects were randomized to one of two groups (group A or B).

      Group A received oral tranexamic acid at 1300 mg (two 650mg tablets), three times each day on
      days 1 to 5 of menstrual cycle for 3 cycles.

      Group B received combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) with 3 weeks of hormonal pills and 1
      week of placebo for 3 cycles.

      After 3 cycles of therapy, both groups had one cycle without any therapy. Then, the groups
      crossed over. Group A, who first received TA, then received OCP. Group B, who first received
      OCP, then received TA.

      All subjects were to receive both tranexamic acid and oral contraceptive pills.

      There were a total of 3 study-associated visits per patient: 1 at baseline and 2 at the end
      of 3 cycles on each medication. These visits were considered within standard of care, as
      subjects with menorrhagia have frequent monitoring until the effectiveness of the treatment
      is determined.

      At the study visits the following were done:

        1. Assessment of the last menstrual period (amount of blood lost) using the Pictorial Blood
           Assessment Chart (PBAC) score and the number of days the period lasted

        2. Quality of Life evaluation - by the patient completing a standardized pediatric quality
           of life (PedsQL) questionnaire

        3. Detailed history and physical examination to evaluate for drug side effects and to look
           for signs of blood clots.

        4. Blood drawn for a complete blood count.
