      that the quantification methods used will correlate well to commonly used, well-studied TTE
      parameters obtained simultaneously, under the same loading conditions.

      Assessment of RV function is of particular importance in the perioperative period. RV
      dysfunction can be due to a myriad of causes - myocardial ischemia, pulmonary embolism,
      pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart disease, or cardiomyopathy. The presence of RV
      failure can lead to difficulty in separation from cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgical
      patients, and has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in high-risk cardiac
      surgery patients. Additionally, correct identification of RV dysfunction is crucial in order
      for the correct treatment to be administered. RV failure can lead to underfilling of the left
      ventricle, and mimic hypovolaemia with hypotension and an exaggerated stroke volume
      variation. In such a case, failure to diagnose RV dysfunction can wrongly lead to fluid
      loading and further worsening of right ventricular failure.

      While evaluation of right heart function is well described in TTE studies, there is
      insufficient data at present to recommend a reliable method to quantify RV function using
      TTE.

      In addition to traditional measurements of RV function, we hope to study the usefulness of
      speckle tracking and strain imaging in assessment of RV function, modalities of
      echocardiographic image analysis which have garnered increasing interest in recent years.
