      education and motivational-interviewing-based counseling on adherence to glaucoma follow-up
      care compared to standard education delivered by a trained staff member. Participants will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either standard education and care navigation or eHealth
      education, counseling and care navigation.
