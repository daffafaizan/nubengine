    
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms:

      Arm A: Indinavir plus ZDV plus 3TC. Arm B: Indinavir (test dose) plus ZDV plus 3TC. NOTE: d4T
      may be substituted for zidovudine for toxicity management. Patients are stratified based on
      prior use of nucleoside analogs (naive vs experienced to ZDV, dideoxyinosine [ddI],
      dideoxycytidine [ddC], and d4T) and screening viral RNA results (lower than 50,000 copies/mL
      vs more than 50,000 copies/mL).
