      About 10% of significant mitral heart disease complicated by high pulmonary hypertension
      (more than 60 mm Hg). Up to 70% of patients retain this level of pulmonary hypertension after
      successful treatment of heart valve disease.The quality of life of patients with persistent
      high pulmonary hypertension is significantly lower than in patients with mild to moderate
      degree. Risks of recurrent tricuspid insufficiency and right ventricular dysfunction is much
      higher. Despite the use of modern drug therapy of pulmonary hypertension in patients with
      valvular heart disease satisfactory clinical effect is achieved only in a small number of
      patients. Our team proposed a new original method of ablation of the pulmonary artery with
      simultaneous open cardiac surgery correction of mitral heart disease in patients with high
      baseline pulmonary hypertension.
