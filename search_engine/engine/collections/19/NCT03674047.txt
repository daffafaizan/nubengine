      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ruxolitinib for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this study the investigators are assessing the safety and effectiveness of ruxolitinib
      when given to participants who have been diagnosed with BOS after HCT. BOS is a sign/symptom
      of chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease (GVHD), a condition in which cells from the donor's tissue
      attack the organs after HCT occurs.

      Ruxolitinib blocks certain proteins called tyrosine kinases. Specifically, it blocks tyrosine
      kinases called JAK2. The investigators believe that ruxolitinib may lower the rate of GVHD
      through its ability to block the JAK2 pathway since this pathway can lead to inflammation in
      the body.
