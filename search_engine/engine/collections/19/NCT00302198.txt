    
      Any person who has been diagnosed with ALS by a physician can enroll into this registry.

      The information you provide in the ALS registry will be used to evaluate variations in
      patient care, adherence to standards of care and also to help foster ALS research. An
      additional focus of this website will be to educate participating patients and visitors to
      this site about ongoing ALS research.
