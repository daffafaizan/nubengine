      comparing secukinumab 300 mg s.c. versus guselkumab 100 mg s.c. in subjects with plaque
      psoriasis who had an inadequate response to ustekinumab. Forty subjects will be randomized
      1:1 and treated for 16 weeks. In each patient, a target active refractory skin plaque (TCS
      â‰¥6) is described and biopsied at baseline and at study end. The objective of the study was to
      assess the superiority of secukinumab over guselkumab in achieving clear/almost clear status
      (TCS 0-2) of the target plaques; and to describe the molecular mechanisms behind this
      difference
