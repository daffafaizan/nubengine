    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability, and determine the
      maximum tolerated dose of triciribine when combined with carboplatin in women with
      platinum-resistant, recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer. The secondary objectives are to
      evaluate the clinical activity of carboplatin plus triciribine in women with
      recurrent/persistent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer by assessing response rate,
      progression-free survival, and duration of stable disease.
