      intractable epilepsy. Preliminary animal and human data suggest safety and remarkable
      efficacy of Low frequency stimulation (LFS) in epilepsy. In addition, the duty cycle of LFS
      is very low, implying less electric current injection, with less charge density on the target
      tissue and electrodes, and longer battery life. The current project is a classic
      translational, single-blinded, randomized research project, demonstrating a clear path from
      the laboratory to bedside. If successful, this new therapy will be of great value to patients
      with medically and surgically intractable Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE).

      The study is expected to last approximately 5 years, from enrollment of the first patient to
      completion of the final subject, taking into consideration attrition and otherwise-eligible
      subjects who will not elect to participate. Once the study is completed, and enrolled
      participants have completed all required elements of the protocol, a final report will be
      submitted to the FDA. Participants may also discontinue their participation in the study, if
      they wish, at any time.
