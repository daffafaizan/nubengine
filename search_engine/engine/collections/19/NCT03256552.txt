    
      This was a randomized, double-blind, chronic-dosing (7-day), four-period, four-treatment,
      placebo-controlled, crossover, multi-center study to assess the efficacy and safety of 3
      doses of GP MDI (28.8, 14.4, and 7.2 μg ex-actuator, BID) in Japanese subjects with moderate
      to severe COPD.

      Subjects who met the entry criteria had their maintenance therapy for COPD adjusted, as
      specified in the protocol. To allow for an adequate washout of previous maintenance
      medications, subjects underwent a washout period of at least 7 days, but not greater than 28
      days duration prior to returning to the clinic for Visit 2 (Randomization Visit; Day 1 of
      Treatment Period 1).

      The 4 study treatments were GP MDI 28.8, 14.4, and 7.2 μg ex-actuator, and Placebo MDI BID.
      Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 4 treatment sequences (ABCD, BDAC,
      CADB, DCBA) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using an Interactive Web Response System where each letter
      represented 1 of the 4 treatments included in the study by random assignment.

      Subjects were to complete 7 days of dosing in each of the 4 Treatment Periods, with each
      Treatment Period separated by a washout period of 5 to 21 days.
