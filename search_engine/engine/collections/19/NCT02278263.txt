      delays in rehabilitation and is often poorly tolerated in patients with cardiovascular
      disease.(1) Tranexamic acid (TXA) in arthroplasty is used by many orthopaedic surgeons to
      reduce perioperative blood loss and subsequent transfusion of blood products in elective
      total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA). In several reviews, systemic TXA (sTXA)
      significantly reduces blood loss and transfusion rates when compared to placebo, without an
      increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE).(2-4)

      The CRASH-2 study, with over 20,000 randomised trauma patients, has also confirmed the
      efficacy and safety of TXA in this setting, particularly when given early.(5) The evidence
      for its use to date is overwhelming and when not contraindicated, should be employed by all
      arthroplasty units as part of their standard practice. However, despite the vast evidence for
      its use in arthroplasty some surgeons remain cautious over its safety profile when given
      systemically. TXA is a synthetic derivative of lysine which is responsible for binding
      reversibly to plasminogen effectively inhibiting clot degradation.(6) Although, this is not
      clot promoting, inhibiting clot breakdown theoretically may increase the likelihood of clot
      formation. This is of real concern for surgeons in patients who have had previous VTE. For
      this reason, some surgeons have utilised TXA as a topical application directly into the
      surgical field to reduce systemic absorption and avoid VTE.(7, 8)

      TXA administered topically in TKA has also been reported to reduce swelling which may have
      the advantage of earlier mobility and less pain.(9) In cardiac surgery, TXA has been touted
      as not only having blood conserving properties via the coagulation pathway but also reduces
      inflammation via attenuation of the pro-inflammatory cascade.(10, 11)

      Based on this rationale, this appears to be a sensible and reasonable route of administration
      for TXA in this population. However, surgeons should ensure they avoid placing undue risk on
      patients by altering their use of TXA given the strong evidence for sTXA. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to assess whether topical TXA is effective in reducing blood loss in
      knee joint replacement surgery, and is as safe and as effective as systemic TXA.
