    
      Asymptomatic average risk subjects with positive iFOBT (immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood
      Test), participating the regional screening program, were offered to undergo PCC2 (PillCam
      Colon Capsule 2 (R)) followed, 21 days later, by CTC and OC performed on the same day. The
      number, size and location of significant polyps (>6mm) identified by each procedure were
      compared with the reference standard (RS), which was represented by the segmental unblinded
      colonoscopy. The unblinding was based on the integration of CTC and PCC2 results. For the
      PPC2 the quality of the bowel preparation (adequate/inadequate) and the completeness of the
      examination (capsule excreted still working or visualization of the anal verge) were also
      reported. In order to evaluate the tolerability, each subject was asked to identify, among
      the 3 procedures performed, which was the less tolerated one and which one he would be
      willing to repeat.
