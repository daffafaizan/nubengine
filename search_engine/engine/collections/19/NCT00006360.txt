        -  Assess target coverage and major salivary gland sparing in patients with stage II or III
           oropharyngeal cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the nature and prevalence of acute and late side effects of this treatment in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the rate and pattern of locoregional tumor recurrence in these patients after
           this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 3-D conformal radiotherapy and/or intensity-modulated radiotherapy daily 5
      days a week for 6 weeks, in an effort to spare major salivary glands.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 57-64 patients will be accrued for this study over 27
      months.
