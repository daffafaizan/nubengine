      to slow down bone destruction caused by cancer spreading to the bone (bone metastasis).
      Denosumab is used in adults with cancer to prevent serious complications caused by bone
      metastasis (e.g. fracture, pressure on the spinal cord or the need to receive radiation
      therapy or surgery). Results from one study in lung cancer patients with bone metastasis
      suggested that adding denosumab to the standard chemotherapy may lead to a possible survival
      benefit.

      All patients will receive standard chemotherapy consisting of a combination of platinum-based
      doublet agents plus gemcitabine or pemetrexed, depending on the nature of the lung cancer,
      every 3 weeks for about 3-4 months:

      Patients will be assigned to one of two groups, known as 'arms'.

      The treatment for each arm will be as follows:

      Arm A: 4 - 6 cycles of chemotherapy and best supportive care (including any bone protective
      agent except denosumab)

      Arm B: 4 - 6 cycles of chemotherapy + denosumab 120 mg, administered subcutaneously every 3-4
      weeks until unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal or patient's death. After stop of
      first-line chemotherapy, denosumab must be continued every 3-4 weeks lifelong, regardless of
      tumour progression and concomitantly with subsequent lines of systemic treatment, as long as
      tolerable for the patient.

      Beyond primary analysis, all subjects randomised to ARM B and still benefitting from the drug
      will be offered denosumab at a dose of 120 mg s.c. until patient or physician elect to
      discontinue denosumab for any reason, and for a maximum of 2 years after the required number
      of events for the final analysis has been reached.

      A total of 1000 patients from centers in Europe, Switzerland and Israel are expected to be
      enrolled in this study over a period of 37 months.The study will take approximately 56 months
      to be completed
