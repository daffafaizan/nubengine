      therapy of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic, accelerated, or blast
      phase who have failed or are intolerant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Patients will
      be treated with induction course cycles consisting of subcutaneous (SC) HHT 1.25 mg/mÂ² twice
      daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days. Patients will be evaluated every 7 days with
      complete blood and platelet counts while undergoing induction therapy; the number of
      consecutive doses of HHT or intervals between subsequent cycles may be adjusted, as
      clinically indicated, according to guidelines provided in the treatment plan.
