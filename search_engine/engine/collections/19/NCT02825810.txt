      throughout the last years. As a result, this also means that breast cancer survivors suffer
      side effects concerning the disease itself and treatments, as it is the case of certain kinds
      of pain. It is known that 80% of breast cancer survivors suffer this even 5 years after the
      completion of treatment and this impairment can be associated with a high tendency towards
      depression, cardiorespiratory deconditioning and even altered cervical control motor.

      Aim: To determine the effectiveness of a physical therapy program based on cervical motor
      control training in order to improve motor control, mood state and quality of life.

      Methods: Fifty-two long-term breast cancer survivors will be allocated to experimental group
      (n=26) or control group (n=26). The experimental group will receive a nine-week tailored
      exercise training focused on cervical motor control.

      Discussion: There is a lack of knowledge about effective interventions when it comes to deal
      with altered motor control pattern of cervical area in long-term breast cancer survivors.
      Therefore, it is necessary to study the impact of this novel approach to improve quality of
      life in this population.
