      8-10% of births. Since the duration until delivery is important in avoiding the risk of
      complications, several studies have been performed in order to understand what is the
      preferred way to manage this condition of PROM in women that are not in active labor. In the
      largest random study that has been performed 20 years ago, there was found an advantage for
      labor induction with oxytocin over labor induction with Prostaglandin or waiting. However,
      the most important component - the BISHOP score, that affects the decision of the labor
      induction way, was not reported and was not taken into consideration.

      Therefore, the aim of the study is to compare randomly the perinatal outcomes in women with
      PROM and low BISHOP between women who undergo labor induction with Oxytocin and women who
      undergo labor induction with Prostaglandin E2.
