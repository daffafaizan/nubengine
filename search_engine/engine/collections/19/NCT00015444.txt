    
      Objective:

      The objectives of this protocol are:

        -  to develop and maintain a repository of clinically characterized patients with primary
           lateral sclerosis for future research protocols,

        -  to characterize the natural history of neurodegenerative disorders with corticospinal
           neuron degeneration,

        -  to investigate proposed etiologies, risk factors, and biomarkers for the development of
           these disorders and for disease progression

      Study Population:

      240 patients with adult-onset progressive spasticity with a diagnosis of primary lateral
      sclerosis or related upper motor neuron disorder

      Design:

      Patients who have been referred by physicians for primary lateral sclerosis will undergo a
      screening evaluation at the first visit. The screening visit will include review of outside
      medical records, neurological examination, and diagnostic testing to determine possible
      causes of spasticity. Patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for primary lateral sclerosis
      by history or examination will be followed to determine the natural history of this disorder.
      Measures of motor and cognitive function will be made at baseline and follow-up visits to
      follow clinical progression. Magnetic resonance imaging will be carried out to determine if
      imaging changes occur over time. Blood samples may be collected for measurement of potential
      etiologies of PLS, including risk factor genes. Patients identified in this protocol who are
      eligible for other research protocols will be invited to participate in additional protocols.

      Outcome Measures:

      Clinical progression will be documented by measures of finger-tapping, timed gait, speech.
      The association between clinical progression and MRI measures will be assessed as a secondary
      outcome.
