      scheduled decreasing doses or enhanced standard of care lifestyle education program delivered
      via smartphone (SPCTL) for 12 months. Subjects will participate in 5 study visits at
      baseline/enrollment, 1, 3, 6 , and 12 months

      TT subjects will be given the TT app. The app provides instructions on breathing awareness
      meditation (BAM): focusing upon the moment by sustaining one's attention upon diaphragm
      movements and related sensations while breathing in a slow, deep, relaxed manner. One learns
      to passively observe thoughts, images and extraneous sounds without making judgments about
      them. BAM doesn't involve analysis of historical or recent stressful experiences, but instead
      centers upon learning to stay in the present moment while meditating. The app will also
      collect heart rate (HR) values during each session using the phone's camera. The duration of
      the TT sessions will begin at 15 min., decrease to 10 min., and finally decrease to 5 min.
      Adherence will be monitored by the receipt of date-stamped heart rate values collected during
      each meditation session.

      SPCTL subjects will be provided Runkeeper app and taught how to record physical activity they
      perform. Recommended dosage of using SPCTL media and/or app will be that of the TT group.
      Adherence to SPCTL will be assessed using server file analyses of modules used and activity
      recorded in Runkeeper.
