      effective, safe, inexpensive and easily administrable vaccine to protect people from HIV
      and/or AIDS is an absolute priority. Considering the array of functions sequentially exerted
      by the regulatory and the structural gene products in supporting the setting of a primary HIV
      infection, it is expected that vaccines combining early and late viral products (combined
      vaccines) should be superior to the single antigens approaches since they target multiple
      viral proteins which are necessary at different key steps of the virus life cycle, including
      cell-to-cell virus transmission and systemic virus propagation. A combined vaccine strategy
      based on the early regulatory protein Tat in association with the late structural protein Env
      modified to increase its immunogenicity (delta-V2Env) has been evaluated in pre-clinical
      studies in both small animals and monkeys. The results of these studies indicated that the
      combination of Tat with delta-V2Env is superior in inducing specific immune responses against
      both Tat and delta-V2Env antigens and in protecting or containing virus replication more
      efficiently than vaccination with the single antigens alone, confirming that these proteins
      represent optimal co-antigens for a combined vaccine strategy.

      This study was a multicentric, open label, randomized phase I trial, directed to qualify the
      safety and the immunogenicity of the vaccine based on the association of HIV-1 biologically
      active Tat and oligomeric Î”V2 Env proteins in healthy, immunologically competent adult
      volunteers, compared to the single compounds. Tat and delta-V2 Env proteins either in
      association or as single compounds were administered by a prime-boost regimen, consisting of
      3 intradermal priming doses followed by 2 intramuscular boosting injections. Of note, phase I
      trials have already been successfully conducted with the 2 single components, at the doses
      proposed in this trial, in healthy individuals.
