      high-risk trophoblastic tumor (GTN) with relapse or drug resistance after receiving previous
      two-line or above multidrug combination therapy, and the efficacy and safety of the two drugs
      were evaluated.

      Patients who meet the requirements will sign the informed consent and be enrolled
      voluntarily. This project is a single-arm study without a control group. Twenty patients are
      expected to be enrolled, and there are 4 centers competing for enrollment.

      All patients received at least two-line multidrug combination therapy, and some patients may
      have undergone or planned surgery and/or radiation therapy. Through the HCG value and
      measurable changes in the size of the lesions, we can understand the changes of the disease.
      The primary endpoints were PFS and ORR Whenever, for whatever reason, the subject does not
      complete the clinical trial observation, is considered to be an abscission case. When the
      subject falls off, the researcher must fill in the reason for the fall off in the CRF, and
      contact the subject as much as possible, complete the items that can be evaluated, and record
      the time of the last medication to prepare for the analysis of its efficacy and safety. The
      CRF should be kept for future reference
