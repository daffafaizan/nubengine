      criteria for FA in a group behavioral intervention for 16 weeks. Data from the current study
      will be used for the purposes of further exploration of the FACT program in a larger
      randomized controlled trial. We hypothesize the study will demonstrate the feasibility of
      evaluating this treatment in future studies
