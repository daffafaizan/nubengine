      I. Estimate the response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS) with FOLFIRI +
      panitumumab in patients with acquired resistance to panitumumab (or cetuximab) + irinotecan
      (irinotecan hydrochloride)-based therapy after a documented clinical response or prolonged
      PFS and following progression on a subsequent non-anti-EGFR containing regimen in extended
      RAS wild-type and BRAF wild-type patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the overall survival (OS) in the re-challenge populations.

      II. Describe the safety of re-challenge in this population.

      III. Investigate the impact of PFS, RR on prior anti-EGFR + irinotecan-based exposure on the
      response and PFS on the current study.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collect serial plasma samples to investigate the incidence of RAS and BRAF mutation in
      circulating free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at baseline, every 2 months, and at the time to
      progression (and following progression when feasible).

      II. Collect serial plasma samples for future biomarker exploration, including the potential
      investigation of micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes, irinotecan hydrochloride
      IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium orally (PO), and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on day
      1. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
