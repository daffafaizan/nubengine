      desire to improve patient care by decreasing the overall perioperative complication rate of
      the procedure by selectively not shunting those patients who ideally do not require it and
      thus eliminating the attendant morbidity associated with it.

      The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in patient outcomes (death, minor strokes,
      major strokes, transient ischemic attack (TIA)) for patients undergoing a Carotid
      endarterectomy with a SP of > 50 mm Hg using selective shunting.Patients will be randomized
      to Routine shunt vs selective groups. In Selective shunt, there will be subgroup analysis to
      measure % stenosis if the systolic pressure is < 40mmHg calling it as Shunt group. All
      patients in the study, irrespective of treatment group will be followed post-operatively from
      24 hours to 30 days. The patient will be monitored and the following outcomes documented -
      death, minor stroke, major stroke, trans-ischemic attack (TIA).
