      will not apply to the assignment of dose levels (low, middle or high).

      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before vaccination and will be followed for 18
      months after the first vaccination.

      15 volunteers will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio of active vaccine to placebo. Safety and
      tolerability of the ADVAX e/g + ADVAX p/n-t investigational product will be evaluated at
      least 14 days after the tenth volunteer in the lower dosage group receives the second
      injection before proceeding to the nextdosage group.
