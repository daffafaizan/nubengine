      correct dentofacial discrepancies. Post-operative stability is of great concern for CMF
      (Cranio maxillo facial) surgeons as the goal is to achieve optimal functional outcomes, good
      aesthetic results and satisfaction of patients' concerns. Skeletal relapse is a known
      complication of mandibular lengthening surgery and is divided into two groups; short term or
      early relapse and long term or late relapse.

      Short term relapse occurs within the first 6 to 8 weeks post-operatively and is due to
      intersegmental movement at the osteotomy site (osteotomy slippage) and osteosynthesis
      slippage. Late relapse is thought to be caused by progressive condylar resorption, a clinical
      entity affecting the temporomandibular joint.

      The rationale to reconstruct the lateral cortical defect resulting from mandibular
      advancement with BSSO with a bone graft substitute lies in the prevention of an unaesthetic
      notching at the inferior border. The use of a self-hardening, space-occupying paste could add
      mechanical stability, thus increase 3D-stability at the osteotomy site and prevent early
      relapse.

      The use of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the treatment planning and postoperative
      follow-up of orthognathic patients has provided the surgeons with a new three-dimensional
      imaging modality to evaluate the postoperative skeletal relapse and postoperative morphologic
      changes of the condyles. Skeletal relapse, as well as positional and dimensional changes of
      the condyles, can be quantified in three dimensions.
