      they are, what is most important to them and what lessons they have learned through life. For
      patients not receiving chemotherapy, Dignity Therapy gave patients more hope, more meaning in
      their life, and helped their families. Researchers at Northwestern University would like to
      see if it has the same effect in patients getting chemotherapy. We will also see if the
      Dignity Therapy changes patient's understanding of their disease and their medical
      preferences.

      All study procedures will take place when participants come for a scheduled doctor's visit or
      to receive chemotherapy. At the first visit participants will answer a questionnaire taking
      approximately 15-30 minutes. Participants will then have a Dignity Therapy Session
      approximately 1-2 weeks later. A second Dignity Therapy Session will be scheduled again in
      another 1-2 weeks. Each study Dignity Therapy Session will take approximately an hour. One to
      two weeks later a repeat questionnaire will be filled out. Finally, a third and final
      questionnaire will be complete 4 weeks later.
