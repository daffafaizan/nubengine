    
      The following registry procedures and quality factors have been implemented:

        -  Quality assurance plan, including

             -  data validation

             -  proper registration procedures

             -  regular site monitoring

             -  regular auditing

        -  Data checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range
           or consistency with other data fields in the registry.

        -  Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of
           registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (medical records and paper
           case report forms).

        -  Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities,
           such as patient recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting
           for adverse events, and change management.

        -  Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years
           necessary to demonstrate an effect.

        -  Statistical analysis plan describing the analytical principles and statistical
           techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives, as
           specified in the study protocol or plan.

        -  Plan for missing data to address situations where variables are reported as missing,
           unavailable, "non-reported," uninterpretable, or considered missing because of data
           inconsistency or out-of-range results.
