    
      The aim of this study is to assess and compare kinematic and time-space gait parameters in
      patients after total knee arthroplasty, who will undergo the surgery with the use of either
      posterior-stabilized (PS) or dynamic congruence (DC) implants.

      Materials and methods To this study 56 consecutive patients undergoing total knee
      arthroplasty will be recruited. Study protocol is designed as a prospective, blinded,
      parallel-group, superiority trial, with balanced randomization [1:1]. All participants will
      be operated in single clinical orthopedic department, by single high-volume surgeon, who
      performed more than 3000 total knee arthroplasties in his professional career.

      Before the surgery patients will fulfill the author's questionnaire concerning their age,
      height and body mass, level of activity and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale).

      After the surgery 1 to 3 years postoperatively three-dimensional gait analysis will performed
      with use of BTS SMART device. This device uses passive markers technology and registers the
      movement by six cameras. To perform full gait analysis several data concerning patients
      anthropometry will be collected (lower limb length, knee and ankle joint width, width and
      depth of the pelvis). Whole gait analysis will be performed by experienced single clinical
      biomechanist accordingly to the Davis protocol. Markers will be installed on the patients'
      limbs on the following points: base of sacral bone, greater trochanter of the femur, lateral
      femoral condyle, head of the fibula, lateral malleoli, head of the V metatarsal bone).

      Participants will walk barefoot for 10 meters quadruple times. Following time-space and
      kinematic parameters will be assessed:

      Time-space parameters Single stance time (T1) [%] Swing time (T2) [%] Double-stance time (T3)
      [%] Step length (SL) [m] Mean gait velocity (Vm) [m/s] Cadence (C) [number of steps/min]

      Kinematic parameters:

      Operated knee range of flexion during swing phase [Â°]
