    
      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of Marrow Infiltrating Lymphocytes-Non-Small
      Cell Lung Cancer (MILs™ - NSCLC) combined with nivolumab in subjects with locally advanced
      and unresectable and metastatic NSCLC who were refractory to, or have relapsed on, an
      anti-PD-1 containing regimen. MILs™ - NSCLC are an adoptive cell therapy product derived via
      the activation and expansion of bone marrow T cells. Subjects will have bone marrow harvested
      during the Screening Period which will be used to manufacture the MILs™ - NSCLC. The MILs™ -
      NSCLC will then be administered on Day 0. Nivolumab will be administered on Day 1 and will
      continue every four weeks until treatment discontinuation.
