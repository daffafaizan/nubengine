      sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates subsequent to the
      selection of the study group) observational (clinical study in which participants may receive
      diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does not
      assign participants to specific interventions) study of participants treated with BDQ.
      Participants will be enrolled by their healthcare provider once the healthcare provider
      decides to treat with BDQ or after BDQ treatment initiation but prior to observation of any
      participant outcomes. All participants meeting the inclusion criteria and providing informed
      consent for participation in the study will be enrolled in this study. The registry
      enrollment period will be open for 36 months with an additional 24 months BDQ treatment-free
      follow-up for safety assessment for the last participants enrolled during the 36 months
      enrollment period. Participants' follow-up data will be collected at each visit from the
      healthcare provider during the course of BDQ and for an additional 24 months after the last
      BDQ dose or until the participant is lost to follow-up. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
