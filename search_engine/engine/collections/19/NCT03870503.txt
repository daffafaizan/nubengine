      general agreement that active management of the third stage of labor is recommended.

      Oxytocin is the most widely used uterotonic agent but has a half-life of only 4-10 min, that
      is why it is better administered as a continuous intravenous infusion to achieve sustained
      uterotonic activity. Carbetocin is a synthetic long-acting oxytocin agonistic analog with
      prolonged half-life prolonging its pharmacological effects. Its prolonged uterine activity
      may theoretically offer advantages over oxytocin in the management of the third stage of
      labor. The side-effect profile of carbetocin was not found to be different from that of
      Oxytocin but may prove to be advantageous when compared to Syntometrine.
