      chronically ill people. Emotional engagement, cognitive restructuring, and positive future
      directedness are considered core elements to induce change in emotional disclosure
      interventions. The aim of our randomized controlled trial in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis is to examine the psychological, clinical, and physiological effects of an
      emotional disclosure intervention adapted for home application and the modulating role of
      cognitive-emotional change and individual differences in emotion regulation.
