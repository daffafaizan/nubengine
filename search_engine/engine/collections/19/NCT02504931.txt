      stratified, randomized medication treatment trial of male and female veterans who experienced
      "in-theater" trauma and have both a PTSD and Alcohol Use dual diagnosis. All subjects will
      receive 12 weeks of manualized cognitive & behavioral therapy as a standard of care.
      Additionally, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive double-blind treatment with
      Sertraline vs. Placebo as an adjunctive treatment. The manualized therapy provides standard
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) addressing alcohol use and prolonged exposure (PE)
      behavioral therapy targeting PTSD. Sertraline is a common treatment for PTSD and psychiatric
      disturbance but is hypothesized to have differential efficacy in different subtypes of
      alcohol drinking patients. A stratified randomization scheme will balance placebo and
      sertraline assignment to two groups, and a post-hoc clustering approach will be used to
      determine which subgroups of dual diagnosis patients may benefit from sertraline vs. placebo
      treatment.

      Veterans with PTSD who regularly drink more than 5 standard drinks of alcohol in a day (note
      one 12oz beer = one standard drink) may be eligible for the study if they meet criteria.
