      the principal venue for treatment for depression, fewer than 25% of depressed patients
      receive adequate treatment for their depression. These outcomes can be worse when there are
      barriers to treatment such as living in a rural area. Several studies have found that given a
      choice, about two-thirds of depressed primary care patients prefer psychotherapy or
      counseling over antidepressant medication.

      This is a controlled, randomized trial in which subjects meeting criteria for major
      depressive disorder (MDD) from primary care settings in VISN 21 including CBOCs will be
      randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) a 16-session manualized telephone administered
      cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) delivered over 20 weeks or 2) a treatment-as-usual (TAU)
      condition. Telephone-administered cognitive behavioral therapy (T-CBT) is an intervention
      aimed at improving coping skills and social functioning. It is divided into two phases: 1) an
      initial treatment phase consisting of 12 weekly sessions aimed at reducing symptoms of
      depression, and 2) a booster phase in which 4 sessions are provided at increasingly greater
      intervals to target maintenance of treatment gains. T-CBT, administered by doctoral level
      psychologists, will be compared to a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition that controls for the
      natural course of depression during the course of treatment.
