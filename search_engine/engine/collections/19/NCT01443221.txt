      different mechanism of action be combined to the regimen when adequate glycemic control is
      difficult to achieve with an oral hypoglycemic agent accompanied dietary therapy. Therefore,
      a concurrent administration of metformin, a inhibitor of gluconeogenesis, and mitiglinide, an
      insulin secretagogue, could be an effective and ideal regimen for management of diabetes.
