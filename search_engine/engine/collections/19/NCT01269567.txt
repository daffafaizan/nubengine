      surgery. In order to limit and avoid the risk of pelvic sepsis after rectal excision, a
      prophylactic pelvic drainage is usually used. If current data have confirmed the uselessness
      of drainage in colic surgery, the question stay in abeyance in rectal surgery. This practice
      had never been evaluated in patients with rectal excision and low anastomosis (patients with
      a high risk of pelvic sepsis) The aim of the study is to assess the impact of pelvic drainage
      vs. non pelvic drainage on risk of pelvic sepsis after rectal excision for cancer with
      infraperitoneal anastomosis. The principal objective is to compare the rate of pelvic sepsis
      until 30 days between the 2 groups of patients who had a rectal excision with and without
      pelvic drainage. It is a randomized clinical trial of superiority, multicentric, without
      blinding, in 2 parallel groups with ratio (1:1): distribution of the number of patients in
      the groups.
