    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) when given in
      combination with afatinib (afatinib dimaleate) in patients with advanced or metastatic
      non-small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations
      who have progressive disease on erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess in a preliminary manner the efficacy of this combination (response rate, disease
      control rate and progression free survival).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of pembrolizumab. Patients assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I (DOSE DE-ESCALATION COHORT): Patients receive afatinib dimaleate orally (PO) once daily
      (QD) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II (EXPANSION COHORT): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 for 2
      courses. Beginning course 3, patients receive afatinib dimaleate PO and pembrolizumab IV as
      in Arm I.

      In both Arms, courses repeat every 21 days (for up to 2 years for pembrolizumab) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
