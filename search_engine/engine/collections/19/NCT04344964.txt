      interpretation of visual signs such as visualization of skin lesions. However, the need of
      such feedback is almost non-existent for endoscopy-related consultations as their purpose is
      focused. The main foci of endoscopy-related outpatient clinics are two: 1 - inform and
      consent the patient for an endoscopic procedure that is to be done in the near future; 2 -
      explain the results of a recent procedure already performed and which has a copy provided to
      the patient. Therefore, phone consultations might be a good fit for endoscopy-related
      outpatient clinics. The practicalities and indications for the use of phone consults has been
      described by van Galen & Car (2018) and fit the above description.

      Patients will be invited to participate only after the consultation have been finalised and
      all questions regarding the endoscopic procedure to be done/that was done have been
      clarified. Patients and consultants will fill questionnaires to evaluate the phone
      consultation.

      The primary outcome will the the comparison of "failed to attend" (FTA) occurrences compared
      to a similar period of the past year. Secondary outcomes will be patients' and consultants'
      satisfaction with the phone consultation.
