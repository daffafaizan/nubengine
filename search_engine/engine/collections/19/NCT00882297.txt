      under general anesthesia and requiring a central venous catheter. Patients will be randomized
      by an operator experienced in echoguided venous catheterization to be included in the axial
      (50 patients) or the longitudinal (50 patients) approach group. The device used will be a
      vascular probe of 7.5 MHz (Sonosite I Look®). The principal outcome measure will be the time
      from percutaneous puncture to the rise of the metallic guide (seldinger technique). The
      secondary criteria will be the rate of complication and failure. A series of echographic
      (size and depth of the subclavian vein and biometric (BMI, theoretical distance not from
      puncture (way of Aubaniac)/réel) measurements will be done to identify predictive conditions
      of success or failure depending of the echographic approach.
