      disabling disorder.

      Among patients with a chronic course of the disease, 20 to 30% are resistant to
      antidepressant medications. Among those patients not responding favorably to antidepressant
      medications, 50% would not benefit from ECT. For such patients, surgical interventions have
      been proposed in the past.

      Many results support the hypothesis of a dysfunction of the functional loops between cortical
      and subcortical structures underlying the expression of depressive disorders.

      Thus, therapeutic intervention focusing on these loops, in patients with chronic depression
      resistant to treatment, should be an issue and could improve prognosis of these patients.

      As part of a maximal resistance to antidepressant drug, after failure of a series of
      bilateral ECT, a surgical functional intervention using DBS of nucleus accumbens is
      considered.

      This open-label trial proposes to assess feasibility, safety and efficacy of DBS of nucleus
      accumbens in patients with chronic depression.
