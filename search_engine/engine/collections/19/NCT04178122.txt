      controlled trial of immediate vs. delayed (after 6 months) return of medically actionable,
      clinically confirmed genetic testing results. MVP participants with a medically actionable
      variant in their MVP chip genotype data will be contacted and offered the opportunity to
      receive clinical confirmation of this result through a research protocol. First, a
      non-randomized pilot trial will be conducted among 10 eligible MVP participants, followed by
      a randomized controlled trial of immediate vs. delayed clinical confirmation and reporting,
      delivered to participants nationwide via telegenetic counseling.

      Three hypotheses will be tested:

      Hypothesis 1 (LDL-C change): LDL-C reduction after 6 months will be greater in the Immediate
      Results arm compared to the Delayed Results arm (primary outcome) Hypothesis 2 (LDL-C
      target): The proportion of participants meeting clinically significant LDL-C targets
      (<100mg/dL for primary prevention and <70 mg/dL for secondary prevention) at 6 months will be
      greater in the Immediate Results arm than in the Delayed Results arm (secondary outcome)
      Hypothesis 3 (Pharmacotherapy): the proportion of participants with an intensification of
      lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy will be greater in the Immediate Results arm than in the
      Delayed Results arm (secondary outcome)
