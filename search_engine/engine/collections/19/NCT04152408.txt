      CGM system using the interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose as an indicator of blood glucose
      levels.The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of FiberSense system across the
      glucose measurement ranges as compared with a laboratory standard reference method in
      diabetic patients (Type I and II) during in-clinic glucose challenge sessions. At the same
      time the blood glucose values are recorded by comparator continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
      system and self-monitoring blood glucose system (SMBG). The safety aspects are also
      investigated during the wearing time of up to 30 days.
