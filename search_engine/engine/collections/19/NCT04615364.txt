    
      Collection of blood samples from patients with arbovirus infection

      This study is a non-interventional study with retrospective part.

      This study will improve :

        -  the assessment of the molecular evolution of arboviruses in the period preceding the
           implementation of the Wolbachia strategy

        -  the knowledge of the impact of Wolbachia on the diversity and molecular evolution of
           arboviruses

        -  the understanding of arbovirus transmission and replication mechanisms in the presence
           of Wolbachia
