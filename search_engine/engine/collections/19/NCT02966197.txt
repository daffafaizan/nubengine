      even maternal death. Interventional radiological techniques have been developed to limit
      massive hemorrhage during caesarean section. This study investigated the efficacy of
      prophylactic internal iliac artery balloon catheterization in management for placenta previa
      and accreta. Between June 2015 and August 2016,patients were personally recruited and managed
      by the authors,and assigned to either balloon group or control group by their willingness to
      catheterization or not. Both groups benefitted similar management protocol with the exception
      of interventional radiology operation. Intraoperative blood loss, transfusion volume,
      radiation dose, exposure time, surgical duration, procedure complications and neonatal
      outcomes were analyzed.
