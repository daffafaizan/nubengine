      of study drug to see if the tumors absorb the drug. If the patient's tumors absorbed the
      drug, then the patient received one therapeutic dose. In the phase 1 portion, the study
      employed a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Enrollment in the phase 1 portion was to be
      completed once researches believed that they found the highest dose that they could give
      patients without causing unacceptable toxicity. This dose is called the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD). Following discussions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that occurred
      during the dose escalation stage of the study, the protocol was amended to conclude the trial
      upon the identification of the MTD. The Phase 2 safety/ efficacy stage of the study was
      conducted with modifications of the primary endpoint as Protocol MIP IB12B, with Special
      Protocol Assessment Agreement with the FDA in March 2009.
