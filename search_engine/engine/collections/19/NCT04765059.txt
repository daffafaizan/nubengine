    
      This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of platinum plus
      pemetrexed chemotherapy plus osimertinib versus platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy plus
      placebo in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive (EGFRm),
      metastatic NSCLC who responded to first-line osimertinib therapy and subsequently experienced
      radiological, extracranial disease progression. Approximately 204 patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy plus osimertinib
      (Treatment Arm A) or platinum plus pemetrexed chemotherapy plus placebo (Treatment Arm B).
      Patients will be stratified based on the presence of brain metastases (stable brain
      metastases based on central nervous system (CNS) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors, Version 1.1 [RECIST 1.1] assessments versus no brain metastases).

      The 2 randomized treatment regimens are as follows:

        -  Treatment Arm A: Osimertinib 80 mg once daily (QD) with pemetrexed (500 mg/m^2) (with
           pre-treatment) plus either cisplatin (75 mg/m^2) or carboplatin (area under the
           concentration-time curve [AUC] 5), both administered on Day 1 of 21-day cycles for 4
           cycles, followed by osimertinib 80 mg QD plus pemetrexed maintenance (500 mg/m^2) on Day
           1 of 21-day cycles

        -  Treatment Arm B: Placebo QD with pemetrexed (500 mg/m^2) (with pre-treatment) plus
           either cisplatin (75 mg/m^2) or carboplatin (AUC5), both administered on Day 1 of 21-day
           cycles for 4 cycles, followed by placebo QD plus pemetrexed maintenance (500 mg/m^2) on
           Day 1 of 21-day cycles.
