      devices allowing augmentation of the femoral head have recently been developed. Biomechanical
      studies showed that augmentation leads to a better axial stability and pull-out strength. In
      clinical practice, this might facilitate early mobilization and full weight-bearing with less
      pain. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate whether patients with trochanteric
      fractures being treated with a PFNA and augmentation can better be mobilized than patients
      without augmentation. In particular, it will be measured whether patients with a PFNA
      Augmentation can walk faster than the non-augmented patients, measured with the Timed up and
      Go test.
