      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of bortezomib and flavopiridol in patients with
      recurrent or refractory indolent B-cell neoplasms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of this regimen in these
      patients.

      II. To determine disease-related effects of this regimen in these patients. III. To determine
      the pharmacodynamics of this regimen in patients with myeloma.

      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds followed by flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on
      days 1, 4, 8, and 11.

      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
