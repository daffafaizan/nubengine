      growth potential in uterus. The excepted definitions of this condition are fetal weight
      estimation below the 10th percentile per gestational week. Severe growth restriction is
      defined as estimated weight below the 3rd percentile. It is well known that fetuses which are
      growth restricted are subjected to a higher degree of complications during pregnancy and
      delivery such as fetal distress, hypoxic damage, intra uterine fetal demise and complications
      in the neonatal period including prolonged NICU hospitalization, cerebral palsy, hypoxic
      ischemic encephalopathy and also long term affects such as neuro developmental complications.

      Common practice in managing these cases is induction of labor at term around 37 weeks of
      gestations to prevent these complications as it established that during this time there is a
      substantial rise in pregnancy complications including fetal demise.

      There are no clear guide lines how to induce labor in such cases and it is not known what is
      the safest and the most effective way to induce labor in these cases. Prior studies have
      found the rate of successful vaginal birth in these cases vary between 50 and 80%. There are
      a number of methods of labor induction and delivery available including the use of vaginal
      prostaglandins (PGE2) for cervical ripening, intracervical balloon catheter or planned
      cesarean. In most cases when aiming for vaginal delivery the choice is between ripening of
      the cervix with balloon catheter in combination with Pitocin or ripening with prostaglandins.
      It is not known which method is safer and more successful in growth restricted fetuses.
