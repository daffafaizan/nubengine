      cataract. The developmental profile of refraction among patient with congenital catarat is
      has not yet been fully characterized. The investigator recruited a large cohort of Chinese CC
      children.After primary IOL implatation, routine examinations including retinoscopy were
      completed. Data were analysed to to estimate the rate of change in postoperative change after
      primary IOL implantation among children with congenital cataract and to explore key factors
      associated with the rate of change.
