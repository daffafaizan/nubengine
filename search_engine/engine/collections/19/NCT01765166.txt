    
      This Competing Renewal project continues the research and development of a parent-focused
      intervention, Parent Guide to SSGRIN, which parallels an established child-focused
      intervention [Social Skills GRoup INtervention (S.S. GRIN); for children ages 8-12 years], in
      order to teach and reinforce the same social skills and concepts within the home environment.
      A primary goal of this Competing Renewal is to conduct a rigorous, large-scale, longitudinal
      research project that is adequately powered to address questions of relative impact,
      longer-term treatment benefits, and differential treatment effects of the Parent Guide
      training on children's social skill development across settings and populations. Though
      schools often struggle with how to increase parent involvement in school-based programs,
      school officials report that it is infeasible for them to conduct the full series of
      in-person parent training groups as the Parent Guide's current curriculum demands; therefore,
      a second goal of this Competing Renewal is to test a Home-study version of the Parent Guide
      to bridge training into the home environment. The Home-study version of the Parent Guide will
      be included as a separate treatment condition within the effectiveness trial. This clinical
      trial will provide S.S.GRIN treatment for 240 children ages 8-12 and vary the level of parent
      intervention to determine the effectiveness of the two variations of Parent Guide to
      S.S.GRIN. Parents will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) Parent Guide
      treatment; (2) Parent Guide-Home Study treatment; (3) parent attention control; or (4) no
      treatment. Pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6-month post-treatment, and 12 month post-treatment
      data will be collected assessing children's social skill development from children, parents,
      and teachers. Based on past clinical experience, the probability of adverse psychological and
      behavioral effects from behavioral intervention is very low; however, to ensure participants'
      safety, a data and safety monitoring plan will be in place.
