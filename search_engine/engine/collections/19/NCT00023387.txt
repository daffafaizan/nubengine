      Admissions for pharmacokinetic studies will take place during the continuation phase of
      tuberculosis therapy. Patients participating in a double-blinded trial of the tolerability
      and safety of higher doses of rifapentine during continuation phase therapy and consenting to
      participate in the pharmacokinetic study may be admitted to a Clinical Research Center (CRC)
      to allow for frequent blood sampling over a 24-hour period. Otherwise, patients will be
      evaluated in the clinic.
