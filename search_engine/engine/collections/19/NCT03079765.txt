      feedback and modeling to shape behavior. These types of training experiences may not be
      accessible for all educators though. The current study will evaluate delivering behavioral
      skills training (e.g., feedback and error correction) via telehealth for educators conducting
      functional behavior assessments. The components of the functional behavior assessment that
      will be targeted are open-ended interviews, stimulus preference assessments, direct
      observations of problem behavior, and a functional communication training program. With at
      least three different schools, the investigators will introduce training delivered via
      telehealth one at a time to show that increases in acquisition of the various components of
      the functional behavior assessment only occur following telehealth-based training.
