      for each session. It will be done at a single site only, at UTSW. The fMRI tasks will
      consists of subjects grasping and releasing a handgrip.

      The VNS implant will be used in this study to determine if having the implant active during
      physical rehabilitation produces white matter tract changes in the brain visible on fMRI. All
      subjects in the STU 062017-071 study will receive a VNS implant. And all subjects in this
      study are also subjects of the STU 062017-071 study. Therefore participants of this study
      will enroll with the implant already in place.

      Methods: After passing routine MRI screening, patients who are enrolled in the VNS-REHAB
      study and consent to participate in the fMRI study will be scanned on a Phillips 3 Tesla
      Research Magnet (Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands). Patients will be
      scanned before therapy and the week after therapy. A subset of patients will be scanned 3
      times, before therapy, after therapy without activation of the vagal nerve stimulator, and
      after therapy with activation of the vagal nerve stimulator.

      Scan Time:

      Scan time is limited to 15 minutes per session to match manufacture FDA guidelines. Patients
      will receive two, 15 minute MRI scans over 2 days.
