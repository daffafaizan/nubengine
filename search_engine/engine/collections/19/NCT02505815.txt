      function and intellectual skills, which occurs after surgery with and without anesthesia. The
      limiting cognitive ability leads to a lack of quality of life for a lot of patients. The POCD
      strongly depends on patient's age and the surgical operation type. In aged adults the
      incidence of POCD after one week following surgery is 25,8%. Risk factors for the development
      of a POCD is beside age less education and a reduced cognitive reserve. However, the
      anesthesia procedure plays a pivotal role as well and regarding the current knowledge it is
      still uncertain which technique matches the lowest risk. Elevated stress level accompanied
      with regional anesthesia procedures are accused to cause POCD in elderly patients. This fact
      leads to the question if a general anesthesia technique has a lower stress level and
      consequently leads to a reduced risk for a POCD development. Likewise the investigators
      address this hypothesis and analyze cognitive function following both anesthesia techniques
      separately in elderly patients.
