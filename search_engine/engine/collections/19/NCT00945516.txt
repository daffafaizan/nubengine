      uncovered metallic stents has been associated with failure related to mucosal hyperplasia.
      Fully covered self-expanding metal stent(FCSEMS) placement was reported as a useful method
      for BBS. However, stent migration was a frequent complication of CSEMS placement. Recently,
      flared end FCSEMS was developed to decrease stent migration, and anchoring CSEMS was newly
      developed.
