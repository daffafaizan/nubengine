      colon and rectal cancer surgery and their patients. Erectile dysfunction has been recognized
      to develop from damage to pelvic parasympathetic nerve, which are especially vulnerable
      during anterior rectal dissection. There may be also a contribution of psychological factors
      from the presence of stoma and fear of recurrent cancer. Recently, several studies reported
      that erectile dysfunction after rectal excision for rectal cancer was completely reversed or
      satisfactorily improved using oral erectile dysfunction drugs. Udenafil is a new
      phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitor for erectile dysfunction. Prior studies have also
      demonstrated a selectivity profile for udenafil that is similar to Sildenafil (viagra®) and
      tadalafil (Cialis®). But unlike tadalafil (Cialis®), it does not significantly inhibit the
      PDE11 isozyme and not produce significant myalgia. back pain, or leg pain.

      This prospective, randomized study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Udenafil
      treatment in treatment of erectile dysfunction after radical resection for sigmoid colon and
      rectal cancer. In order to conduct this study, enrolled patients will be randomly attributed
      to Udenafil group or placebo group.
