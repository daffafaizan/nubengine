    
      This is a Phase 2, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      design study evaluating up to 4 ascending dose level cohorts, each evaluating a single dose
      of CA-008 vs. placebo injected/instilled during an elective C-ABD. Up to 72 subjects may be
      randomized in 4 cohorts.

      For each subject, postsurgical assessments will be conducted in two parts:

        -  Inpatient period: starts with completion of study treatment injection (T0) and continues
           through 96 hours (T96h).

        -  Outpatient period: begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through various follow up
           visits to day 29 (D29)/week 4 (W4) after surgery. Note that additional follow up visits
           may occur at any time or even after D29/W4 to follow adverse events (AEs) to resolution
           or establishment of a new baseline.
