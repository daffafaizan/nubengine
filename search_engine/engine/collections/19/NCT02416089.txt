    
      This will be a 2-year study having two parts. Part A will be a Proof of Concept (POC) study
      that will be conducted at the Obstetrical Ward of Shaheed Suhrawardi Medical College Hospital
      (ShSMCH) and Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). There is no sample size estimation of
      this POC study that will assess safety, feasibility and applicability of using Tampostat on 5
      consenting women with PPH for each hospital. Part B of the study will be an open label,
      randomized clinical trial that will be conducted at the Obstetrical Ward of Dhaka Medical
      College Hospital (DMCH). In this part, 344 consenting women with primary PPH will be
      enrolled, and allocated to either Tampostat or the control intervention in equal numbers per
      randomization (172 patients in each arm). In both these parts, Tampostat will be used only
      when Active Management of Third Stage of Labour (AMTSL) has failed to prevent PPH within 24
      hours after delivery. All the doctors involved in the provision of care and treatment to PPH
      patients will be trained on the WHO's standard of care; they will also receive training on
      appropriate use of the devices to be used in this trial. An expert committee constituted of
      OBGYN professionals, clinical trial specialists, and statisticians will oversee the technical
      management of patients, data collection and their procedures, and ethical issues in this
      trial.
