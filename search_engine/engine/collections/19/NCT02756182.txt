      in determining equivalency between the two technologies during cystometric assessment.

      A total of 25 patients (9M/16F) were recruited. All patients underwent cough and Valsalva
      manoeuvre pressure tests to measure vesicle pressure (Pves) and abdominal pressure (Pabd). A
      single dual-lumen catheter (T-DOC 7Fr Air-ChargedÂ® catheter) was used to record air and water
      pressures simultaneously.

      The primary outcome was to determine if the maximum pressures during Valsalva manoeuvres, as
      measured with a single dual-lumen water-perfused and air-charged catheter, are equivalent
      when the bladder is filled to 200 cc during a urodynamic evaluation.

      Exploratory endpoints included the following:

        1. To determine if maximum pressures for cough, as measured with a single dual-lumen
           water-perfused and air-charged catheter, are equivalent when the bladder is filled to
           100, 200 and Maximum Bladder Capacity (MBC) cc during a urodynamic evaluation.

        2. To determine if maximum pressures for Valsalva manoeuvres, as measured with a single
           dual-lumen water-perfused and air-charged catheter, are equivalent when the bladder is
           filled to 100 and MBC cc during a urodynamic evaluation (as well as 200 cc which is the
           primary objective).

        3. To determine if the maximum voiding pressure, as measured with a single dual-lumen
           water-perfused and air-charged catheter, are equivalent.

        4. To determine if the clinical impressions of the urodynamic study are equivalent for the
           water-perfused and air-charged catheters.

        5. To determine if the compliance of the bladder is equivalent when measured by air-charged
           catheters as compared to water-perfused catheters.
