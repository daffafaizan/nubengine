      Primary

        -  Compare the percent change in breast density in healthy postmenopausal women with high
           breast density treated with placebo only vs letrozole and placebo vs letrozole and
           zoledronate.

        -  Compare the percent change in biochemical markers of bone turnover in participants
           treated with these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the bone density in participants treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare growth hormone release and insulin-like growth factor levels in participants
           treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence and severity of adverse events in participants treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter, pilot study.
      Participants are stratified according to prior hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use
      (discontinued HRT > 5 years ago or no prior HRT use vs discontinued HRT 1-5 years ago).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral placebo once daily for 12 months and placebo IV over 15
           minutes on day 0 and at 6 months.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral letrozole once daily for 12 months and placebo IV over
           15 minutes on day 0 and at 6 months.

        -  Arm III: Participants receive oral letrozole once daily for 12 months and zoledronate IV
           over 15 minutes on day 0 and at 6 months.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 participants (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
