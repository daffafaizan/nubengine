    
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The QPlus Cartridge can measure
      hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable conditions resulting from the functional interaction of
      the enzymatic and cellular components of coagulation and therefore, can be invaluable for
      longitudinal monitoring of the coagulopathies reported in COVID-19 patients and the response
      to anticoagulants.

      This single-center, prospective, observational pilot study will characterize changes in the
      coagulation status of patients with COVID-19 infection during their hospital stay using the
      Quantra QPlus System.
