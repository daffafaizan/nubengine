      recruitment duration is 1 year. Imatinib will be given in the dose of 400 mg orally each day
      unless disease progression or intolerance. The follow-up is 12 months.

      Forty-eight subjects will be recruited for this study. This sample size is justified by the
      number of patients required to establish an improvement in PFS with statistical significance
      compared to historical control.

      The standardized RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) method of
      unidimensional tumor assessment will be employed to evaluate tumor lesion size per 2 months
      in the determination of response rate and progression free survival. Repeated radiographic
      assessment at 4 week intervals is consistent with general oncological practice associated
      with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan testing. All
      efficacy endpoints will be evaluated by the investigator.

      Safety will be characterized in terms of the incidence, timing, severity, and relatedness of
      adverse events and laboratory abnormalities. Severity will be graded according to the NCI
      CTCAE Version 3.0.
