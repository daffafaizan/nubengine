      well as to promote proper learning, develop memory and preserve cerebral plasticity. Factors
      that hinder sleep patterns can negatively influence the child's growth, neurological and
      motor development.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial within the 2015 Pelotas Birth
      Cohort. At the 3-month follow-up, children who sleep less than 13 hours per 24 hours
      (nighttime sleep and daytime naps) will be eligible for the study. The sample size was
      estimated at 276 children per arm. Nighttime self-regulated sleep duration will be evaluated
      at baseline (age 3 months) and at 6, 12 and 24 months using actigraphy and via a sleep diary
      completed by the mother. Following block randomization, mothers from the intervention group
      will be visited by a trained fieldworker who will deliver counseling on age-appropriate
      normal sleep behaviors, how to facilitate sleep onset and how to manage night awakenings.
