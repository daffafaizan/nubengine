    
      The MONACO Cell Therapy Study is a prospective, non-randomised, open label study phase I/II
      clinical trial with a key objective of evaluating safety of MON002 in 5 adults who have a
      clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis) after recovery from
      acute COVID-19 infection. The main objectives of this study are to: (1) to determine the
      safety profile of MON002 by assessing clinical responses in adults with post-COVID-19
      pulmonary fibrosis and (2) to assess its impact on reducing disease morbidity/severity in
      this population.
