    
      The study is designed as a phase I, randomized, single-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled, multi-cohort, first-in-human dose escalation study of a single IV 3-hour
      administration of Cilastatin as stand-alone in healthy male and female volunteers.

      The study will involve 24 healthy male and female healthy subjects, divided in three study
      cohorts (8 subjects per cohort). The study is a dose escalating study, starting from 3 g of
      Cilastatin administered intravenously in 3 hours.

      Eight subjects will be randomized and assigned to either the study drug or placebo group for
      each study cohort in a 3:1 ratio (6 actives and 2 placebos). Randomization will also be
      gender balanced within each study cohort. The planned dose escalation scheme should not occur
      before participants in the previous dose level have been treated and safety profile of
      Cilastatin from those participants are assessed in accordande with the protocol.
