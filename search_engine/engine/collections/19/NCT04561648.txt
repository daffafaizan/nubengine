    
      Radial artery occlusion (RAO) is one of the most common complications in transradial artery
      interventions (up to 30% of cases if specific measures are not taken to prevent it) and is
      related to the prothrombotic state of the patient, the scarce distal flow to the access site
      and the trauma caused to the artery during the procedure.

      Currently worldwide, the transradial (TRA) access is the most widely used access for coronary
      angiography (in up to 90% of the procedures) because the transradial approach is associated
      with lower rates of vascular complications and event mortality (compared to the femoral
      access).

      Although TRA access is safer, it is not free of complications, being one of the most
      important the RAO.

      There are universal efforts to reduce RAO improving every aspects of the technique, from the
      type of introducer to the hemostasis time to a distal TRA, with evidence suggesting that
      higher doses of UFH can also decrease RAO to a greater extent. The decrease in the incidence
      of RAO have been proposed to be up to 2.8 times with high doses of UFH (single-center,
      retrospective study that compared regular not standard doses of UFH versus higher doses of
      UFH) although no proper prospective clinical trial have been undertaken to prove this.

      The standard dose that has shown a lower rate of RAO is 5000 IU, which will be compared with
      100 IU / Kg of UFH, with a randomized, prospective, double-blind design, with short-term
      (24-hour) follow-up with Doppler ultrasound (DUS) and its correlation with plethysmography to
      document RAO, and in occluded arteries, there will be a 30-day follow-up to determine the
      recanalization (or persistent occlusion) rates by DUS (and plethysmography). In order to
      address safety concerns of higher UFH doses, all the potential hemorrhagic complications will
      be evaluated during the study follow-up time and higher hemorrhagic risk patients are going
      to be excluded.
