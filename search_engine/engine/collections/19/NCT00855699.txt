      To provide a framework for investigating the hypothesis that for those patients undergoing
      alcohol detox in primary care adding acamprosate to a reducing regimen of a benzodiazepine
      (chlordiazepoxide) provides better symptom control during detox compared with benzodiazepine
      alone. In addition we will assess improvement in sleep, drinking outcomes, completion rates
      and cognitive performance.

      Specific primary aim:

      This feasibility study aims to inform a full application for an RCT to compare the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acamprosate as an adjunctive treatment for
      benzodiazepines for alcohol detox in primary care.

      Key objectives are to:

        1. determine the optimal method of recruiting patients in primary care and estimate likely
           recruitment rate

        2. investigate feasibility of completion of and variation in our proposed primary outcome
           measure in the community - Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Scale-Alcohol (symptoms
           during detox), and secondary outcome measures - drinking during first month (via diary
           to derive % days abstinent), completion of detox, sleep and cognitive performance.

        3. investigate patient and GP acceptability of this randomised trial using qualitative
           measures.
