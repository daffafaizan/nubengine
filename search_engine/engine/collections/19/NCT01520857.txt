    
      Anesthesia for laparoscopic procedures, including transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal
      hernia repair(TAPP) is synonymous with general anesthesia because of the adverse effects of
      the CO2 pneumoperitoneum on the awake patient, and regional anesthesia is preferred only in
      patients where general anesthesia is contraindicated. Î‘ pilot study of our hospital has
      recently shown the feasibility to perform successfully and safely transabdominal
      preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair with low pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum under spinal
      anesthesia.After this pilot study and based on previous experience in regional anesthesia for
      laparoscopic procedures, we designed a controlled randomized trial in order to compare spinal
      anesthesia with the standard general anesthesia for patients undergoing transabdominal
      preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP).
