      episodes are the most frequent and also particularly associated with suicide 7. BD treatment
      is controversial, with some stricter guidelines recommending only lithium, lamotrigine and
      quetiapine as a first-treatment, whereas others allow the use of antidepressants (which can
      increase manic switch and should be used in association with mood stabilizers) and other
      anticonvulsants and antipsychotics 8. For refractory BD the available level I evidence is
      very scarce, with only seven studies exploring this issue hitherto 9. Therefore, the
      importance of this study proposal is justified considering the burden of the disease, the
      paucity of current therapeutic studies and the promising results presented for tDCS in
      unipolar disorder.
