      symptomatic atherothrombotic disease . Its use is frequently limited by gastrointestinal side
      effects, ranging from dyspepsia (31%) to life-threatening bleeding or perforation of
      gastroduodenal ulcers (3.1%) over a period of 4 years .

      The best approach for the secondary prevention of low-dose aspirin induced symptomatic peptic
      ulcer or erosions in patients who need to continue aspirin remain uncertain. At present,
      eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection and long-term maintenance with proton pump
      inhibitor PPI appears to be the best options.

      The position of H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) as a step-down therapy after healing of peptic
      ulcer or erosions is unclear.

      The objective of this randomized, double blinded control study was to compare the efficacy of
      high-dose famotidine with pantoprazole in the prevention of recurrent dyspeptic or
      complicated ulcer/ erosions in patients taking low-dose aspirin.
