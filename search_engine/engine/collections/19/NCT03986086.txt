      (RP2D) of MPH966 in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HCT). We will evaluate up to 4 doses: 60 mg po bid, 120 mg po bid, 180 mg po bid, and 240 mg
      po bid. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy will be assessed in real time and pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics after each dose cohort before escalating to the next cohort.

      Phase 2 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the clinical
      efficacy of MPH966 vs. placebo in preventing acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after
      HCT, using the RP2D as determined by the phase 1 trial.
