      disordered eating symptoms (DES). Binge-eating disorder (BED) is defined as recurrent
      episodes of binge eating at least once a week over a three-month time period and it is
      accompanied by feeling the lack of control and marked distress over one's eating behaviour.
      The aim of the present study was to specifically screen obese diabetic adolescent female
      individuals for BED, checking the variants of the GR gene (rs56149945; rs41423247) amongst
      identified individuals, and this led to assessing the impact of binge eating disorders on
      glycaemic control in obese diabetic adolescent females in Pakistan, South Asia.
