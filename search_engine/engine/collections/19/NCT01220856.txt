      offers advantages over whole pancreas transplantation. However to date insulin independence
      can be obtained in most cases only after the patient has received repeated infusions from
      several donors. A non-specific immune response, mediated predominantly by innate inflammatory
      processes, coupled with specific cellular immune responses, possibly promoted by early
      inflammation, play a major role in the loss of transplanted islets from the liver. PMNs have
      been found to be the predominant cell types infiltrating in vitro the islets. In this regard,
      CXCL8 has been shown to be expressed by human islets and could play a crucial role in
      triggering the inflammatory reaction. Thus, CXCL8 might represent a relevant therapeutic
      target to prevent early graft failure. The efficacy of reparixin in improving graft outcome
      in mice models of intrahepatic islet transplantation, as well as the safety shown in human
      phase 1 and 2 studies, provide a rationale for a clinical study aimed at evaluating the
      effect of reparixin in preventing graft dysfunction after islet transplantation in T1D
      patients.
