    
      This is prospective cohort study. Total 400 obese patients will be enrolled(Sleeve
      gastrectomy 200 patients, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 200)

      The principal investigator or another clinical investigator in charge will individually
      inform the patients about the study, before operation at out patient clinic. At that time
      patient is selected to either sleeve gastrectomy group or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass group. All
      investigator report to clinical research center about patients BMI and operation method.

      About 30-35 obesity patients will be enrolled according to their BMI status. Patients' BMI
      status is classified into several parts by 2.5 gap started from 27.5.

      All patients will undergo periodically anthropometry, laboratory tests, bioelectrical
      impedance analysis, gastrofiberscopy, polysomnography and abdomen CT before and after
      surgery.

      Patients with hypertension will undergo echocardiography. Patients with polycystic ovary
      syndrome will be checked hormonal study. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus will be
      performed 75g oral glucose tolerance test test.

      Surgical complication include wound morbidities, gastrointestinal leakage or fistula,
      postoperative bleeding, intra-abdominal abscess, stricture , adhesive ileus, reflux
      esophagitis, marginal ulceration, dumping syndrome and internal hernia.

      Systemic complication which is not associated with the operation field include ling
      morbidities, heart morbidities, urinary morbidities and others.

      Hospital mortality is defined as postoperative death form any cause within 30 days after
      operation.

      All patients will be followed up post operative 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 12 month, 18
      month, 24 month.

      All patients' liver tissue, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat will be harvested during
      operation.

      All patients' blood sample will be collected at out patient clinic visit. All patients' urine
      and face will be collected at out patient clinic visit and will be analyzed to evaluate
      microbial change throughout pre and post operation period.
