      in healthy adults. The posterior tibial tendon stabilizes the hindfoot against valgus and
      eversion forces and acts as a support along the medial longitudinal arch. If the posterior
      tibial tendon loses its functionality, the other ligaments of the foot and the joint capsule
      gradually weaken as the height of the medial longitudinal arch decreases or disappears, and
      it develops with pes planus. The presence of pes planus and spondyloarthropathy are also risk
      factors for the development of posterior tibial tendon dysfunction.

      100 participants aged between 20-70 years with ankylosing spondylitis were planned to be
      included in this investigation. Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction frequency of patients
      with ankylosing spondylitis will be evaluated by both clinical examination and
      musculoskeletal ultrasonography device. The posterior tibial tendon will be evaluated by
      ultrasonography in terms of tendon diameter and fluid presence in 2 different locations in
      the retromalleolar area.

      Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Functional Index (BASFI), Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) Scale, Functional
      reach test, Timed up and go test, Berg Balance Scale, Dynamic and static balance with the
      Sportkat device will be used as evaluation parameters. It was planned that the evaluations
      were made once.
