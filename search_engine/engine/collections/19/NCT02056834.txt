      outcomes of chronOS Inject after having been used as bone void filler in internal fixation of
      proximal tibial fractures. Secondary objectives were to assess the surgeon's satisfaction in
      using chronOS Inject and patient satisfaction post surgery.

      The study was planned to be a multi-center, prospective, observational study. Patients with
      proximal tibial fractures of type Schatzker I - VI, AO-MÃ¼ller-Orthopaedic Trauma Association
      (AO-OTA) 41, AO-OTA 42 with bone defect were assessed for eligibility to enter the study.
      Patients eligible for the study were followed over time to twelve months after surgery.
