      with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Because increased RAS activity
      is associated with cardiovascular disease, interventions to lower RAS will have favorable
      public health impacts.

      This study aims to evaluate whether the supplementation of Vitamin D in obese subjects will
      lower local tissue RAS activity. RAS activity will be evaluated by cross-sectional
      measurement of RAS components and by quantifying the vascular response to an infusion of
      angiotensin II. Subjects will be studied while Vitamin D deficient, and will return for
      repeat study following Vitamin D supplementation, for comparison.
