      basic measure for the treatment of sepsis. It is important to quickly diagnose the severity
      of sepsis and evaluate the effects of fluid resuscitation. Existing monitoring methods such
      as blood pressure, urine volume, blood lactate, central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2),
      cardiac output (CO), stroke volume variability (SVV), etc. have certain limitations or
      invasive disadvantages. Clinically, effective and convenient non-invasive means are needed
      for monitoring. Present research revealed that microcirculatory dysfunction and tissue
      hypoperfusion have a very important role in the pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis, and
      will be associated with severe organ dysfunction, which is closely related to serious adverse
      prognosis. Importantly, tissue hypoperfusion can cause central and peripheral body
      temperature changes. Studies have shown that clinical assessment of peripheral skin
      temperature can identify potential severe organ dysfunction in patients with stable
      hemodynamics. The latest study found that patients with septic shock have greater
      central-peripheral body temperature differences than sepsis patients, and the temperature
      difference between peripheral-room temperature is smaller. That is, the
      central-peripheral-room temperature gradient changes show a reduction of tissue perfusion,
      suggesting microcirculatory disorders and organ dysfunction. In addition, the body
      temperature gradient is simple and non-invasive, and is a bedside indicator that predicts
      tissue perfusion.
