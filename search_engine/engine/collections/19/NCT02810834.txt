    
      The FLEX Study is a three-year, randomized control trial that seeks to understand how two
      different innovative school-based physical activity (PA) programs influence not only
      children's time spent in MVPA but also their cognitive and academic outcomes. The FLEX Study
      will be implemented and evaluated by researchers from Tufts University. The project is funded
      by the National Institutes of Health.

      Schools participating in the study will be randomly assigned to receive a walking/running
      program, a classroom physical activity program, or no program (control) during first year and
      a half of the study. Third and fourth grade children will be enrolled in the study.

      Physical activity will be assessed objectively using accelerometry. Additional measurements
      will include: BMI/BMI-z (measured height and weight), diet and physical activity
      questionnaires, cognitive functioning (tests of working memory and inhibitory control).
