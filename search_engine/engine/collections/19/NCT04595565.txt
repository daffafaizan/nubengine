      pathological complete response (pCR) is associated with superior survival. This association
      is strongest in the most aggressive subtype, i.e. in patients with triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC). Patients with TNBC not achieving a pCR have a 5-year event free survival rate
      of about 50%. , , The association between pCR and prognosis is less pronounced in
      HR-positive/HER2-negative patients. However, the CPS+EG scoring system for prognosis after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, taking into account clinical stage, post treatment pathological
      stage, estrogen receptor status and grade, leads to an improved estimate of prognosis
      allowing to select patients at high risk of relapse for post-neoadjuvant therapy. Patients
      with TNBC not achieving a pCR as well as those with HR-positive/HER2-negative tumors and a
      CPS+EG score of 3 or 2/ypN+ are at high risk of relapse, warranting additional experimental
      therapies after NACT.

      There is proof of concept, that post-neoadjuvant therapy can significantly improve survival.
      First data was provided by the CREATE X trial, randomizing patients with residual tumor after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy to either capecitabine or observation. CREATE X included
      HER2-negative patients and demonstrated a significant improvement in disease-free survival
      (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in the overall population, which was confined to the TNBC
      subgroup.

      Recently, the randomized post-neoadjuvant phase III KATHERINE study demonstrated an improved
      invasive disease-free survival in HER2-positive patients without pCR after trastuzumab +/-
      pertuzumab treated postoperatively with T-DM1, an antibody-drug-conjugate compared to
      trastuzumab.
