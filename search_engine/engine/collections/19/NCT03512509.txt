      two separate intervention days with at least a six-day washout period in between. On the two
      intervention days the subjects will be randomized into receiving a breakfast containing
      isocaloric amounts of either low or high GI potatoes. VAS will be measured 5 minutes before
      the meal, immediately after the meal is consumed and in intervals of 30 minutes thereafter
      until 2,5 hours after the initial meal. After this the subjects will be served a standardized
      homogenous ad libitum meal. The amount of food consumed will be registered. The subjects will
      be asked to fast for 8-10 hours prior to the trial days and abstain from vigorous physical
      activity and alcohol consumption for 2 days prior to each trial day. The trial will be
      conducted over a total of 8 days with 5-6 study subjects pr. trial day. The trial days will
      be spread out over a total of 2 weeks to allow for a 1-week washout period between trial days
      for each subject.
