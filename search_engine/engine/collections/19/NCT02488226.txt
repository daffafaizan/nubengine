      eye-tracking technology to help infants and children with or at high risk for ASD learn to
      direct their attention to people and their actions in a more typical fashion. This study will
      begin with a Normative Collection phase, and will conclude with a Gaze-Shaping phase. In the
      Normative Collection phase, the investigators will examine the gaze behavior of a group of
      typically developing infants and children with typical development (TD), in order to
      establish a normative gaze pattern. In the Gaze-Shaping phase, within the same videos shown
      in the Normative Collection phase, the investigators will highlight selectively targeted
      people, objects, and activities, in an attempt to shape participants' viewing patterns to
      match the normative gaze pattern.

      Manual coding of live-action interaction probes will provide an additional evaluative
      measure, allowing the investigators to track real-world (live-action) correlates alongside
      video-eye-tracking behaviors. In addition, live-action probes may allow the investigators to
      check for generalization to live interaction with another person (as opposed to gaze behavior
      when watching videos). In live-action probes, one or two clinical research staff member(s)
      will interact with each participant (or with each other in front of the participant), in a
      manner analogous to the actions performed in the training videos.

      Please note: The original estimated enrollment as specified to and funded by NIH was 98
      participants, but was incorrectly listed on ClinicalTrials.gov as 220 participants reflecting
      maximal recruitment in this and other ongoing studies.
