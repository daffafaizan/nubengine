      found to be safe and effective compared with other current alternatives, even given the
      exceptionally high difficulty levels and complexity of these cases, in both adult and
      pediatric eyes. One limitation of techniques requiring trans-scleral suturing is that the
      suture cannot always be passed under adequate visualization, and, once the knot is secured,
      the exact position of the Cionni ring cannot always be accurately localized. Analysis of
      Cionni ring position with respect to the IOL and iris is important, as faulty placement of
      the ring or IOL can lead to complications which can threaten vision, especially in children
      with a high predisposition towards postoperative adverse events. Unfortunately, pupillary
      dilatation and slit-lamp examination may not always be adequate to assess the Cionni ring or
      the eyelet position, as it occupies the peripheral section of the capsular bag. UBM has been
      shown to be accurate and reproducible in examining the haptic position in relation to the
      sulcus and ciliary body, anterior chamber depth (ACD), vitreous incarceration, focal iris
      abnormalities, angle anatomy, and relationship of the iris to the lens (straight or tilted).
      This study aims to provide information on UBM findings following Cionni ring implantation in
      pediatric eyes for non-traumatic subluxation of the crystalline lens.
