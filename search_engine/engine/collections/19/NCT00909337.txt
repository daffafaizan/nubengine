      when the mean pulmonary arterial pressure is >25mmHg at rest or >30mmHg at exercise. Bosentan
      has shown efficacy, if mean pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated at rest. However, there
      are no data available of the effects of such a therapy, if the mean pulmonary arterial
      pressure is normal at rest but elevated during exercise. The purpose of this study is to
      provide additional data on this group of patients. Our hypothesis is that patients with
      exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension may show a gradual worsening of pulmonary
      hemodynamics and potentially a development of manifest pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (elevated resting pulmonary arterial pressure values) without treatment, while the
      introduction of Bosentan may improve hemodynamics and exercise capacity in this patient
      group.
