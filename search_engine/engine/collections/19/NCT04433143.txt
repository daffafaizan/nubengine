      light in the 400-600nm band is targeted at the superficial skin inflammation, while
      800-1200nm is targeted at the deep sebaceous gland inflammation. The skin can produce
      oxidation reaction to form singlet oxygen to eliminate propionibacterium acnes after
      absorption of porphyrin at 400nm. The light of 800-1200nm band can penetrate into the deep
      layer of sebaceous glands, and the thermal contraction of sebaceous glands can improve the
      anaerobic environment of bacteria, which is not conducive to the reproduction of bacteria.
      Meanwhile, when the temperature of sebaceous glands reaches 40 degrees Celsius, bacteria can
      be killed directly.
