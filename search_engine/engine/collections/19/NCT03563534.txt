      of carious biofilm development and caries progression. Sealing carious dentine beneath a
      restoration deprives the caries biofilm of nutrients and alters the environment sufficiently
      to slow or arrest lesion progression. This has the added benefit of avoiding pulp exposure
      and subsequent treatment (Santamaria, Innes, Machiulskiene, Evans, & Splieth, 2014).

      There is no clear evidence that leaving soft infected dentine, before sealing the cavity, is
      deleterious. Instead, this may prevent pulp exposure, preserve the pulp vitality, reduce the
      permeability of the remaining dentine by stimulating tertiary dentine formation, and so
      change the environment for the remaining microorganisms and thus arresting caries process.
      Silver diamine fluoride (SDF), Ag(NH3)2F, has been used to arrest caries since 1969.Silver
      Diamine Fluoride is a topical drug that is applied clinically to control active dental caries
      and prevent further progression of disease. Although, the ideal way to treat teeth with decay
      is removal of the decay and placing a restoration, this alternative treatment allows us to
      stop decay with non-invasive methods, especially with young children that have primary teeth.
      Treatment with Silver Diamine Fluoride does not eliminate the need for restorative dentistry
      to repair function or aesthetics, but has been effective at prevention of further decay.
