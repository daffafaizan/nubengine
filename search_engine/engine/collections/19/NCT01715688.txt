      occur. Coughing, hypertension, tachycardia and agitation have been observed during emergence
      of general anesthesia.

      Desflurane is a newer volatile agent allowing early recovery from anesthesia. This agent has
      led to earlier discharge and more rapid resumption of normal activities after surgery.
      However, an incidence of coughing around 70% has been reported after a desflurane-based
      anesthesia. Different techniques and drugs have been studied to reduce coughing during
      emergence.

      Among others, the role of lidocaine given intravenously, topically, or intracuff has been
      studied. Intracuff lidocaine has been shown to increase the tolerance to the endotracheal
      tube without reducing the swallowing reflex. However, lidocaine slowly diffuses across the
      tube's cuff. The addition of bicarbonates is required to increase its diffusion to the
      underlying tracheal tissue. Alkalinization of lidocaine allows the diffusion of 65% of its
      neutral base form over a period of 6 hours.

      In vitro studies have demonstrated that the optimal time for local anesthetic diffusion
      through the cuff may vary from 90 to 180 minutes. Due to its low onset, this technique would
      be appropriate for long-duration surgeries. Pre-filling the endotracheal tube cuffs with
      alkalinized lidocaine at least 90 minutes before intubation could be appropriate for
      surgeries expected to last less than two hours.

      This study will assess the efficacy of pre-filling endotracheal tube cuffs with alkalinized
      lidocaine to prevent coughing during emergence in short-duration surgeries.
