      identical study days. A minimum of 7 days will separate the two study days, thus, the minimum
      length of the study is 7 days, but can be higher.

      The 3 types of pain conditioning consist of 1) Brief thermal sensitisation (BTS), 2) Heat
      pain detection threshold (HPDT), and pain during 1 min. thermal stimulation (p-TS.

      The order of the stimulations (HPDT and BTS) is randomised for each patient and each study
      day, by a random allocation sequence, computer-generated by Copenhagen Trial Unit and stored
      in sealed and opaque envelopes to secure adequate allocation concealment. p-TS is conducted
      subsequent to BTS and HPDT.

      The participants will complete the psychological tests Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in their private home prior to study day 1. The
      completed tests will be placed in opaque sealed envelopes to secure blinding of the
      investigator and outcome assessor.
