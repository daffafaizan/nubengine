    
      In this trial, pregnants who were positivity for serum HBsAg for more than 6 months and HBeAg
      , HBV DNA >106IU/mL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) below 35 IU/mL (ULN=40IU/mL) and no
      received nucleoside analogue antiviral therapy were enrolled into group A, In addition ,the
      CHB infection pregnants with undetectable HBVDNA were enrolled into group B(control group).In
      which, all pregnants were chronic HBV infection without compensated cirrhosis,hepatic adipose
      infiltration,ICP, hypertension ,heart disease, postpartum hemorrhage. None of the mothers
      were co-infected with hepatitis A,C,D,E,or HIV;syphilis, Epstein-Barr virus.Serum HBV DNA
      load(Roche, Pleasanton, CA, USA), HBsAg/anti-HBs level, HBeAg/anti-HBe routine blood test,
      liver function, renal function will be tested piror to delivery and postpartum 2,6,12 weeks.
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells(pDCs) and natural killer(NK)cells,CD4＋T cells and regulatory T
      (Treg) cells were detected by flow cytometry. Plasma cytokines Interferon-alpha 2(IFN-α2) /
      Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) / Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) / Interleukin-2 (IL-2) /
      Interleukin-6 (IL-6)/Interleukin-10(IL-10) / Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) / tumor necrosis
      factor-α1(TNF-α1)were measured by Luminex at the above time point except 2 weeks.
