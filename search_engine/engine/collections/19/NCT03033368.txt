      Participant will be followed with the other 80 adolescents until the end of the study.
      Participant will be asked to provide a small hair sample for RPV concentrations at weeks 4,
      12, 24, and 48 after switching. This is an option therefore participant can refuse to provide
      their hair samples at any visits. HIV RNA levels will be performed at baseline, week 12, 24
      and 48 visits. If the HIV-RNA at any visits is between >50 copies/ml, the HIV-RNA test will
      be repeated within 4-8 weeks with adherence improvement counseling. At any visit, if HIV-RNA
      is â‰¥1000 copies/ml, genotypic resistance testing will be performed. Modification of treatment
