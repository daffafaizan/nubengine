      fitness and physical function in a brief period, the 2-3 weeks available prior to surgical
      resection, using a home-based exercise program with all equipment provided, and following
      nutritional recommendations. Intervention begins when the oncologist determines that the
      patient is a candidate for pancreaticoduodenectomy, and continues until surgery. Participants
      in both arms are asked to perform moderate exercise daily, targeting a total of 60 minutes
      per day by the surgery date, but in bouts as short as a few minutes each, and progressed
      according to tolerance. Initial prescription is individualized according to the patient's
      baseline level of exercise and functional status. Patients record their exercise and wear an
      accelerometer to track activity if willing. All participants receive follow-up phone calls
      from an exercise specialist for adherence and assistance with progression. The intervention
      period ends at the time of surgery, but return to exercise in the post-operative period is
      collected by self-report.

      In this 'quasi-double blinded' randomized trial, participants are not told the difference
      between the two exercise interventions, and randomization to the two treatment arms is
      stratified by baseline functional status, such that patients deemed to be 'borderline' in
      fitness for surgery are distributed across the groups. Prior chemotherapy exposure is allowed
      and recorded.
