      Before the start of the study, nurses on the participating wards will be educated by the
      researcher about skin observation, pressure ulcer classification, risk assessment, risk
      assessment, and use of the Ultracore Repose® mattress (Frontier therapeutics Ltd).

      Skin assessment and risk assessment are performed on a daily basis by the staff nurses.
      Reliability testing will be done by the researcher on a weekly basis and without
      pre-announcement. Reliability checks and compliance with the protocol will be completed by
      the researcher as well as the collection of additional data.

      Qualitative part

      Three focus groups will be set- up at the end of the study to provide insights into how
      caregivers think about the product and to provide a deeper understanding of the difference
      between the use of the Ultracore Repose® mattress (versus the Repose overlay mattress® and an
      alternating air mattress).The researcher will encourage group interactions to capture the
      data and to provide a more comprehensive understanding of experiences and perceptions of
      using the Ultracore Repose® mattress (versus the Repose overlay mattress® and an alternating
      air mattress). Non-verbal communication will also be captured in each focus group.
