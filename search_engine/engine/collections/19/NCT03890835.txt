    
      -  Patients will be clinically and radiographically examined and their eligibility will be
           assessed.

        -  Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: experimental group
           (pulpotomy using Biodentine) and the control group (pulpotomy using MTA).

        -  After adminsrtation of local anesthesia, pulpotomy will be done under rubber dam
           isolation. The pulp tissue will be removed until the level of the orifices of the
           canals. After hemostasis is achieved, the capping material will be placed. In the
           experimental group, the capping material is Biodentine while in the control group, the
           capping material is MTA

        -  The cavities will be sealed with resin-modified glass ionomer. Then the teeth will be
           permanently restored with composite . A post-operative radiograph will be taken.

        -  The patients will be given a pain diary based on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and asked
           to rate their pain level at the specified times.

        -  The patients will be recalled after 6 and 12 months post-operatively.
