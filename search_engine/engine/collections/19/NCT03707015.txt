    
      This retrospective observational case series includes nine patients received surgery for
      retinal detachment due to paracentral retinal breaks developed either from primary
      rhegmatogenous orgin, or secondary iatrogenic retinal breaks after prior membrane peeling or
      during surgery for tractional retinal detachment. Either inverted or free internal limiting
      membrane flaps were inserted in the identified breaks, followed by air fluid exchange and gas
      tamponade. Visual acuity and structural changes were evaluated.
