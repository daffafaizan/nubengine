      intravenous antibiotic(s) or nebulized placebo plus intravenous antibiotic(s). The dose of
      nebulized amikacin is 400 mg every 12 hours for 10 days. The patients are followed up on day
      3, 7, 10, and 28 for safety and efficacy. The estimate sample size is 84 subjects base on
      previous study of cure rate in VAP and the authors expected that nebulized amikacin can
      improve cure rate in VAP subjects for 30% when compared with intravenous antibiotic(s) alone
      with power of 80% at level of significance 0.05.
