      practice patterns while using VeriStrat testing in subjects with NSCLC whose tumors are
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild-type (negative) or have unknown EGFR mutational
      status. This study will also attempt to further validate that VeriStrat test results stratify
      subjects by clinical outcomes in the real world, uncontrolled clinical setting while
      exploring whether certain therapeutic approaches may yield opportunities for further study.

      Predictive tests that aid physician therapeutic decision making are critical for optimizing
      subject outcomes while minimizing toxicity and associated treatment costs. This study will
      provide data for the validation of immunotherapy tests currently being developed.
      Immunotherapy mechanisms are dependent upon the interactions between the tumor, tumor
      microenvironment, and the patient immune system. As such, a successful predictive test will
      reflect the complex interplay between tumor and host. The multivariate tests from Biodesix
      have the advantage of being able to assess this complex biology.

      The information gained from this research will not only guide the adoption of the VeriStrat
      test and inform medical decision making, including treatment choice, but will allow the
      validation of additional mass-spectrometry-based proteomic tests.
