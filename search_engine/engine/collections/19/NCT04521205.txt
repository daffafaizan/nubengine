      through Standardized Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for IBD (UC and CD). We have
      established a standardized isolation, store, and transport steps of fecal bacteria from
      donated fresh stool in the laboratory. Then the bacteria will be transplanted to mid-gut by
      capsule. Patients in this study will be assigned to receive standardized FMT three times or
      not and would be followed up for at least 1 year. The clinical symptoms, sign, blood tests,
      endoscopy and questionnaire will be used to assess the efficiency, durability and safety of
      Standardized FMT at the start and end of the projects. At last, we will use 16S-rDNA to
      estimate the change of intestinal microbiota.
