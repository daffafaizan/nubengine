      three-prong multidimensional evaluation consisting of expert grader, subject discomfort
      assessment, and laboratory assessments was used. One pre-study visit took place up to 7 days
      prior to the start of the study. The study was conducted over two days with one tape sample
      applied and removed. Assessments were taken on the final day. This was to mimic a normal tape
      application in health care practice.
