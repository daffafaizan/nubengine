      After an infection with SARS-CoV-2, some patients still experience hypoxemia even after being
      discharged from the hospital. Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) is then used to increase the
      patients blood oxygen level and prolong the time spent within the SpO2 target range,
      decreasing the probability of severe hypoxemia or at least lowering the time spent in this
      severe hypoxemia and all in all enhance the patient's endurance. A prescription for LTOT is
      usually given for constant flow rates which might vary during day- and night use.

      This study is a randomized, controlled cross-over trial. Its aim is to investigate the
      effects of an automatic oxygen titration in patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection on the blood
      oxygen saturation level during activities of daily life (walking). Secondary, the effects of
      using an automatic titration on endurance, pCO2 blood level as well as heart rate and
      breathing frequency are compared to using the prescribed constant flow oxygen therapy.

      Design:

      Each patient undergoes a series of shuttle walk tests. After an initial incremental shuttle
      walk test (ISWT) to determine the patient's maximum walking speed, the patient undergoes 2
      endurance shuttle walk tests (ESWTs) at 85% of the maximum walking speed. One of these ESWTs
      is performed with the prescribed constant oxygen flow, the other with the O2matic automatic
      oxygen titration in a random order.

      In addition to the shuttle walk tests, patient will perform two stair walking tests, again
      one with the prescribed constant oxygen flow, the other with the O2matic automatic oxygen
      titration in a random order.

      Furthermore, patients will be asked to rate their experienced comfort after each ESWT and to
      name their preferred oxygen titration system.
