      in which responsive patients (partial response and stable disease) are randomized (1: 1: 1)
      and receive icotinib plus concurrent radiotherapy, or chemotherapy plus concurrent
      radiotherapy, or icotinib monotherapy. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, and
      the incidence of radiation-induced lung injury.
