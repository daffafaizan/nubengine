      prevent diabetes in high-risk populations in real world settings. The investigators will
      accomplish this by conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing an enhanced Diabetes
      Prevention Program addressing psychosocial stressors to a standard version in a high-risk
      population of urban American Indian and Alaska Native peoples within a primary care setting.
      Diabetes is disproportionately prevalent among low-socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic
      minority populations in the US. The high prevalence of psychosocial stressors such as
      depression, discrimination, and exposure to trauma among these populations contributes to the
      high prevalence of diabetes and interferes with successful completion of lifestyle
      interventions. The investigators hypothesize that a DPP that directly addresses these
      psychosocial stressors will be superior to the standard DPP in addressing this disparity in
      diabetes.
