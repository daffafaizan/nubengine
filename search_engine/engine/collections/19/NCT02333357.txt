      facilitation toolkit curriculum. Toolkit structure and content is grounded in theory and
      empirical findings, and incorporates feedback from 12-step facilitation experts and
      individuals with a history of substance abuse. Aim 2 consists of implementing the resulting
      five-module Toolkit in a multi-site randomized controlled trial using a pre-/post-Toolkit
      training design that includes 1- and 6-month post-training assessments. Group counselors
      employed at community-based outpatient and inpatient substance abuse treatment programs will
      be randomly assigned to a Toolkit or treatment-as-usual condition. Data obtained from
      audiotaped sessions will identify between group differences in counselor adherence to 12-step
      content and skillfulness. Additional data will be collected on counselor satisfaction,
      12-step attitudes and beliefs, and 12-step knowledge, as well as on Toolkit acceptability,
      feasibility, and short-term sustainability. Aim 3 will determine whether exposure to the
      Toolkit curriculum results in stable 12-step involvement and decreased self-reported
      substance use among clients.
