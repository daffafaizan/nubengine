      carfilzomib in addition to conventional therapy on short-term outcomes after the diagnosis of
      antibody-mediated rejection in lung transplant recipients. In this study, Carfilzomib will be
      administered at a dose of 20 mg/m2 on two consecutive days, each week for three weeks (Days 1
      2, 8, 9, 15, and 16) to constitute one therapeutic cycle. Carfilzomib may be administered for
      1-2 complete cycles in the study. Patients will be followed for the duration of their
      hospital admission after enrollment. Post treatment follow-up will also occur on Days 42 and
      90.
