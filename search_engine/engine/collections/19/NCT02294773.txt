      the procedure the sperm from the male partner are placed directly into the female partner's
      uterus around the time of ovulation (release of oocyte or egg). Ovulation predictor kits,
      available over the counter at pharmacies, test for the presence of luteinizing hormone in the
      urine. When the test result is a positive, it means the hormone is present in the urine. This
      is a sign of ovulation. Physicians typically choose to perform intrauterine insemination
      either the day of a positive ovulation test or the day after a positive ovulation test. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if the day when intrauterine insemination is performed
      influences the chance of becoming pregnant.
