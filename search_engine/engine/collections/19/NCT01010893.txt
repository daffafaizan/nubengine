    
      Primary Objective:

      To assess tolerability/safety (incidence of adverse events) of the study drug. To assess the
      efficacy (immunogenicity) of the study drug by serology testing of blood samples taken at Day
      21-28 after immunization in groups and age groups.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the long-term safety of the study drug 50-60 days after immunization. To determine
      the tolerability of simultaneous administration of FLUVAL P monovalent pandemic influenza
      vaccine and FLUVAL AB trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in case of adults and elderly
      people.

      To assess the efficacy of the study drug by optional epidemiological follow-up of the
      participants until the end of the influenza season.

      To assess the immunogenicity of the study drug by optional cross-reactive immunity tests
      performed with non-homologous influenza A and B virus strains.
