      reconstruction, anterior cruciate ligament revision or meniscus transplantation. These
      patients will undergo an intraoperative kinematic evaluation (pre- and post-ligament
      reconstruction / meniscal transplantation). There is no follow-up because all the data
      necessary to carry out the study are obtained during the operating session. In particular,
      the pre- and post-intervention values (acquired intraoperatively) will be compared using both
      the surgical navigator and the KiRA system in order to evaluate the effect of the surgical
      procedure on the value of both static and dynamic laxity of the knee joint. Moreover, limited
      to the data acquired with the KiRA system, a comparison will be also made with the
      controlateral limb.
