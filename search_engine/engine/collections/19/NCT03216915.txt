    
      Fingolimod (GilenyaÂ®; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA) is a novel
      oral disease-modifying therapy that acts as a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist
      and reduces the recirculation of lymphocytes to blood and peripheral tissues, including
      inflammatory lesions.

      A critical part of fingolimod therapy still remains in the screening and initiation phases
      because of the risk of cardiac events. It is well known that the first dose of fingolimod is
      associated with a decrease in heart rate (HR) and slowing of atrioventricular (AV)
      conduction. Patients were continuously observed for a minimum of 6 hours after taking
      fingolimod. Because resurgence of heart rate began at 6 hours, the actual recommendation for
      observation is only 6 hours. Data about the effect of fingolimod after this time period is
      lacking.
