    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate safety and efficacy of treatment with pazopanib hydrochloride (pazopanib) for 6
      months in patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) who have a measurable VHL related
      lesion.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate rate of growth over time in target lesions before and after pazopanib treatment.

      II. Evaluate need for surgical intervention over time in patients who receive pazopanib and
      compare to rate prior to receipt of drug.

      III. Create an annotated tissue resource from patients with VHL for use in future research
      related to cancer.

      PRECLINICAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate circulating factors in patients with VHL undergoing treatment with pazopanib.

      II. Evaluate relationship between VHL genotype and response to pazopanib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients benefitting from treatment may continue pazopanib
      hydrochloride in the absence of disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 24 weeks.
