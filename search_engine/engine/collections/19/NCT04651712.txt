      methods, poor prognostic tools and waiting time for test results up to several days. A
      patient's length of stay in a Danish Emergency Department rarely exceeds 48 hours. Within
      this period the patient is examined, treated and discharged either home or to another
      department. Therefore, rapid molecular detection of respiratory pathogens is needed to add
      value to the management of the diagnostics of pneumonia and could reduce the initial use of
      antibiotics. Molecular diagnostic tests based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays
      generate high sensitive analyses in one hour from specimen collection. The Biofire®
      FilmArray® Pneumonia Panel plus (Biomérieux) can identify 18 bacterial agents including 3
      atypical pathogens 9 viruses and 7 antimicrobial resistance genes. This point-of-care (POC)
      test is promising, as bacterial pathogens often coexist with viruses or are identified with
      mixed infections. However, the high specificity of molecular diagnostics can challenge the
      interpretation of clinically significant agents and demands interpretation by highly
      qualified specialists. Therefore, the POC-PCR combined with advice from a microbiologist has
      the potential to optimize therapeutic regimens and reduce prescriptions of inappropriate
      broad-spectrum antibiotics in the initial management of pneumonia.

      This study aims to

        -  investigate how effective the addition of POC-PCR analysis of sputum is to the
           diagnostic set-up for community-acquired pneumonia on antibiotic prescription at 4 hours
           after admission without consequent adverse advents

        -  to identify the effect of POC-PCR on prescribed antibiotic treatment 48 hours after
           admission and 24 hours after discharge

        -  to investigate the agreement between POC-PCR and sputum culture on microbiological
           analysis
