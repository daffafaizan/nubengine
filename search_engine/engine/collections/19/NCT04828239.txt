      Laser acupuncture (LA) is defined as the stimulation of traditional acupuncture points by
      using low-level intensity. Its a noninvasive treatment than acupuncture for those patients
      had the potential risk for infection or people involving pain or fear of needles. So far,
      previous studies still lack associated evidence about comparisons between laser acupuncture
      and manual acupuncture to evaluate their efficacy. So the investigators would like to compare
      the efficacy of acupuncture treatment with laser acupuncture (LA) treatment in patients with
      idiopathic, mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)
