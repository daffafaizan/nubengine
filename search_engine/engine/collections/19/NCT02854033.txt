      imaging, genetic and biochemical biomarker characteristics of the entire spectrum of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the pathology evolves from normal aging through very mild
      symptoms, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), to dementia. ADNI3 continues the previously
      funded AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1, ADNI-GO, and ADNI-2), and remains a public/private
      collaboration between academia and industry to study biomarkers of AD. ADNI will continue to
      inform the neuroscience of AD, identify diagnostic and prognostic markers, identify outcome
      measures that can be used in clinical trials, and help develop the most effective clinical
      trial scenarios.

      This is multi-center, a non-randomized, natural history, non-treatment study. 1,070-2,000
      total participants will be enrolled across three cohorts: cognitively normal* (CN), mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia. Participants between
      the ages of 55-90 (inclusive) will be enrolled at 59 sites in the United States and Canada.
      Approximately, 700 - 800 will be rollover participants from previous ADNI studies, and 370 -
      1200 will be newly enrolled. Clinical/cognitive, imaging, biomarker, and genetic
      characteristics will be assessed across the three cohorts.

      Participants will undergo longitudinal clinical and cognitive assessments, computerized
      cognitive batteries, biomarker and genetic tests, PET (FDG, amyloid and tau) and MRI scans
      and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collection for up to 5 years.

      *currently recruiting non-Caucasian participants only for the cognitively normal cohort.
