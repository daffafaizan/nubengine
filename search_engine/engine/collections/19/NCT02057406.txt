      (Hypothesis 1b) the two omega 3 supplements will reduce depressive symptoms in heart failure
      (HF) patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder (MDD).

      Hypothesis 1a: Omega 3 supplements will improve depressive symptoms to a greater extent than
      placebo; Hypothesis 1b: Pure eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) will be superior to the EPA:
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 2:1 in depression improvement.
