      field narrow and blindness. The incidence of adult blindness induced by glaucoma is second in
      the ophthalmologic disease in the world. Many studies report that both blood circulation in
      the eye surroundings and intraocular pressure increase play an important role in glaucoma.
      Several studies show that acupuncture can modulate intraocular pressure and improve activity
      of central visual acuity and also increase blood flow of eye fundus. Jingming (BL1) can
      communicate yi and yang, and nourish and clear eyes, Qiuhou (EX-HN7) can transport qi and
      activate blood, and freely flowing meridian and clear eyes. Therefore, the purpose of the
      present study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of acupuncture at Jinming and Qiuhou
      on intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. The study designed as a single-blinded,
      randomized, controlled clinical trial, a total of45 patients with glaucoma divided into three
      groups, each group was15 subjects as follows: 1) sham group, using the seeds of
      wang-bu-liu-xing applied on the surface of Jinming and Qiuhou acupoints, one times/day, and
      each time was 20 min, twice/week for 2 weeks; 2) acupuncture group, the methods were
      identical to the sham group, but used acupuncture applied to Qingming and Qiuhou with Der-qi;
      3) Electroacupuncture group, the methods were identical to acupuncture, but the needles of
      Qinming and Qiuhou connected to the electroacupuncture machine after Der-qi, the frequencies
      of stimulus were 6 Hz, the intensity of stimulus was minimal visible muscle twitch. Primary
      outcome measure was the changes of intraocular pressure, and the second outcome measure was
      the score changes of WHOQOL-REF (Taiwan version).

      The present study predicts that acupuncture or electroacupuncture can reduce intraocular
      pressure and also can improve quality of life in patients with glaucoma.
