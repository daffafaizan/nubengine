      38 million soft lens wearers and 2 million rigid gas permeable lens wearers. The ocular
      surface has been shown to respond to the introduction of foreign materials with upregulation
      of proinflammatory mediators, leading to an increase in inflammation. The corneal can show a
      foreign body immune response to contact lenses. The purpose of this study is to utilize
      in-vivo confocal microscopy to describe differences in corneal epithelial immune status
      across the three lens care regimens in new contact lens wearers.
