    
      162 fishermen, 162 fish-processing factory workers, and 162 control subjects will be
      consecutively recruited by their occupational doctor during a routine consultation. A
      standardized questionnaire will be used to collect epidemiological and clinical data on
      potential allergic manifestation resulting from digestive, cutaneous, or respiratory contact
      with fish. Domestic and occupational risk factors for fish and Anisakis exposure will also be
      collected for both allergic and non-allergic patients.
