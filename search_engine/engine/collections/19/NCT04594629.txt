      heart disease about 73% of the patients particularly in those posted for mitral valve
      replacement surgery Methods This prospective study was conducted in 120 patients aged from
      54-65 years scheduled for elective valve replacement surgeries. Patients were randomly
      allocated to either nitro glycerine or PGI2 groups. Patients of nitro glycerine group
      received nebulized nitro glycerine (its starting concentration was 200 mcg/ml); nitro
      glycerine was delivered at a rate of 2.5-5 mcg/kg/min (5 mg, 1 mg/ml) over 10 minutes by
      ultrasonic nebuliser connected to the inspiratory limb of the breathing circuit. Patients of
      PGI2 group received nebulized PGI2 (epoprostenol), 20000 ng/ml (20000 ng/ml in 60 ml syringe
      was attached to an intravenous pump which delivers a titrating rate of 8 ml/h to the
      nebulizer compartment. The primary outcome was mean pulmonary artery pressure. The secondary
      outcomes included mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (mmHg), PaO2/FiO2 ratio, cardiac index
      (CI) (l/min/m2) right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), central venous pressure(CVP)
      measured at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass then 30 minutes after start of treatment then 4
      hours after start of treatment, 30-day mortality rate and the incidence of complications such
      as facial flushing, hypotension and re-exploration for bleeding.
