      and trunk muscles are major consequences of SCI and result in the inability to walk or
      difficulty walking. The most commonly stated goal by individuals with SCI during
      rehabilitation is the desire to walk again. Locomotor training (LT) that uses a body-weight
      support system and treadmill (BWST) is a task-specific rehabilitation intervention that
      allows practice of walking at normal speeds while loading the lower extremities, facilitating
      upright posture, and hip extension. Substantial improvement in ambulation can occur following
      locomotor training (LT) in individuals with motor incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI).
      Despite these advances in activity-dependent rehabilitation, a need exists for defining
      complementary strategies that further amplify endogenous neuroplasticity. The proposed study
      will assess the therapeutic potential of (1) a respiratory training intervention (acute
      intermittent hypoxia, or AIH) on breathing function and (2) a combined locomotor (LT) and
      respiratory (AIH) training intervention for enhancing walking recovery.
