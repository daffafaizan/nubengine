      According to the National Center for Health Statistics, approximately 300,000 people with rib
      fractures were treated in emergency and ambulatory care departments in the United States in
      the year 2004. Rib fracture patients are significantly more disabled at 30 days post-injury
      than patients with chronic medical illness and lose an average of 70 days of work or usual
      activity during their acute recovery.

      The rationale for conducting this study is to demonstrate in a prospective study that the
      U-plate repair system is durable and safe. Although this clinical outcome data is not
      required by the FDA to market and implant this prosthesis, the investigators believe that in
      order for the U-plate to be widely accepted, prospectively collected outcome data are
      necessary.

      With the goal of improving the durability of fixation of rib fractures over the techniques
      currently available and with the additional goal of developing a minimally invasive
      technique, a U-shaped plate was developed. The design of the U-plate theoretically overcomes
      the inherent softness of the human rib by grasping the rib over its superior margin and by
      securing the plate with anterior to posterior locking screws that do not rely on screw
      purchase in bone. Thus much of the strength and durability of the fixation is transferred
      from the relatively soft rib to the plate itself.
