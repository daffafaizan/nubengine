      osteoarthritis received combination therapy with two or more drugs. Approximately 1.5% of
      patients with osteoarthritis using three or more drugs are using COX-2(Cyclo-oxygenase-2)
      inhibitors and SYSADOA(Symptomatic slow acting drug), And it has been investigated that much
      more patients are using the two classes of drugs when the range is extended to other oral
      NSAIDs other than COX-2 inhibitors. Therefore, considering the characteristics of patients
      with osteoarthritis, such as basal disease and treatment effects on each type of drug, it is
      important to find the optimal combination of drugs for each patient characteristics.

      There is a previous study using osteoarthritis rat model as a biological basis of diacerein
      and celecoxib administration. Previous studies have shown that the combined use of Diacerein
      and Celecoxib improves osteoarthritis.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pain relief effect of Co-administration of
      Diacerein with Celecoxib in patients with knee osteoarthritis compared with single
      administration of each drug.
