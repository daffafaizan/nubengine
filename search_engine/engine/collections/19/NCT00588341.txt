    
      In this Phase II trial, chemotherapy-na√Øve patients with palpable Stage III or Stage IV M1a
      melanoma scheduled to undergo surgical resection will be treated with TMZ in 8 week cycles
      according to the extended dosing schedule of 75mg/m2/day x 6 weeks with 2 weeks off. Patients
      will be treated until maximal response to TMZ and then undergo resection of residual disease.
      The primary endpoint will be tumor response as measured by the RECIST criteria. Patients will
      be seen monthly.
