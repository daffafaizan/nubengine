    
      Patients with locally advanced melanoma confined to an extremity (Stage IIIA or Stage IIIAB)
      will be treated in a randomized Phase III study with hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion.
      One arm of the study will be a standard 60 minute perfusion with melphalan as a single agent.
      The second arm of the study will combine melphalan, tumor necrosis factor, and
      interferon-gamma in the isolated limb perfusion reproducing a regimen shown to have 100%
      response rates in a Phase II European trial. Patients will be followed for local response
      rates, duration of response, treatment toxicity, and disease-free survival.
