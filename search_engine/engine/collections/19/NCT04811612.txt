    
      Neonatal hypoglycemia is defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics as blood glucose level
      less than 47 mg/dL and is one of the most common diagnoses requiring admission to the
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).1,2 The incidence of hypoglycemia in healthy newborns is
      approximately 5-15%, and as high as 51% in infants with risk factors.3 The cost of
      hospitalization of neonatal hypoglycemia is estimated to range from $2,350-$12,755.4
      Hypoglycemia in the newborn has been associated with permanent brain injury including
      neurodevelopmental delay, learning difficulties and seizures.5 Clinically important
      hypoglycemia is not always associated with clinical exam findings;6 therefore, accurate
      measurement of blood glucose in the newborn is of great importance.

      Laboratory testing of venous blood, typically plasma, is a widely accepted method of
      diagnosing neonatal hypoglycemia.6 However, point of care (POC) testing of capillary blood
      using a bedside glucometer is a common screening tool in newborn nurseries and NICUs. The POC
      testing method provides real time results and is an easier, less invasive sampling
      technique.6 Despite these conveniences, studies have found POC testing to be less accurate
      than venous testing.7-9 POC testing is also less accurate at lower glucose levels and
      readings are affected by polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia, common findings in newborn
      babies.6,7,10 Inaccurate readings may result in unnecessary admissions to the NICU for
      additional testing and management. Therefore, efforts to optimize the accuracy POC glucose
      testing in screening for neonatal hypoglycemia is imperative.

      One common practice thought to increase the accuracy of capillary POC glucose testing is to
      warm the infant's heel before blood sampling. It has been proposed that warming the heel will
      increase blood flow to the capillary bed and improve peripheral blood stasis that may
      otherwise result in a falsely low glucose reading.11,12 Current practice is to warm the heel
      with a gel heat pack designed and marketed specifically for the purpose of warming the
      infant's heel prior to blood collection. These gel heat packs are an additional cost to the
      hospital, and currently it is unclear if there is any significant clinical benefit to warming
      the infant's heel before obtaining capillary blood glucose measurements.

      Various studies utilizing laser Doppler flowmetry have suggested that local warming results
      in increased skin blood flow and perfusion in infants.13-15 This increase in blood flow is
      thought to be reflected in the volume of blood collected and ease of collection. In practice,
      however, the effect of local warming on capillary blood collection in neonates appears to be
      minimal. One study found that heel warming in infants did not improve the volume of blood
      collected or the ease of blood collection.16 A subsequent study found that warming the heel
      decreased the need to squeeze the heel for blood collection, however, there was no difference
      in volume of blood collected or collection time.17 To the best of our knowledge, the only
      study that has directly compared the effect of warming the heel on capillary blood glucose in
      infants was conducted by Russell and McKay in 1966.18 The study compared simultaneously
      collected capillary blood glucose levels from a warmed and un-warmed heel in 57 infants.
      Overall, glucose levels from the warmed and un-warmed heels were highly significantly
      correlated. However, the mean glucose concentration from blood in warmed heels was 2.8 mg/dL
      higher than that from un-warmed heels. Additionally, of the 57 infants, 13 had a
      statistically significant higher glucose level measured in their warmed heel compared to
      their un-warmed heel.

      The Russell and McKay study suggested that the infant's heel must always be warmed before
      collecting capillary blood for glucose measurement. However, the study included only 57
      infants, a subset of which were also assigned to a low calorie, high calorie, or
      hydrocortisone administration groups to determine the outcomes of these interventions on
      blood glucose levels. Additionally, the infant's heels were warmed by soaking in warm water.
      This is no longer the current practice as most institutions use gel heat packs designed
      specifically for warming the heels of infants.

      The goal of this study is to simultaneously compare the capillary blood glucose levels from
      warmed and un-warmed heels in approximately 100 infants who are being breast and/or formula
      fed using the current practice of warming heels with gel heat packs. The null hypothesis is
      that there will be no difference between capillary blood glucose levels sampled from an
      infants warmed and un-warmed heel. It has been proposed that warming the heel will increase
      blood flow to the capillary bed and improve peripheral blood stasis that may otherwise result
      in a falsely low glucose reading. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis is that capillary
      blood glucose levels sampled from warmed heels will be higher than those samples from
      un-warmed heels.

      After admission to the newborn nursery or NICU, the infant's mother will be approached
      regarding her participation and of her newborn baby. If participation is desired, mom will
      sign consent for herself and for the infant; PHI authorization will be obtained. Warmed and
      un-warmed heel capillary blood glucose will be obtained from the infant at the time of a
      clinically indicated point of care glucose check. A heating pad will be placed on one heel
      for 10 minutes. The other heel will not be warmed. A lancet will be used to produce blood at
      both heels, and blood glucose will be measured from both heels using the Nova Stat
      glucometer.

      Data from the hospitalization will be extracted from the Electronic Health Record from both
      mother and baby. Data will include demographic information, medications and health
      conditions, delivery information, and anthropometric data. Data analysis will be done using
      SPSS Statistic software to evaluate for differences between capillary blood glucose levels
      from warmed and unwarmed heels.
