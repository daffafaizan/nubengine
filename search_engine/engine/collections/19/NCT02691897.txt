      The main causes for increase in incidence of DM are inactivity, obesity and changes of
      dietary habits. Investigators think that the changes in the awake-sleep cycle may also
      contribute to higher incidence of DM in recent years. Melatonin is an important component of
      the circadian system. Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that melatonin has many
      beneficial actions.Melatonin is a potent antioxidant, reduces inflammatory process, lowers
      blood pressure, improve lipid profiles. Collectively, these data suggest that melatonin may
      be useful in control of blood sugar in patients with DM.

      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of melatonin in control of blood sugar in
      patients with type 2 DM.
