      proton beam therapy tumor related lipid exudation and exudative retinal detachment often
      increase. Therefore vitreoretinal surgery is sometimes required to reattach the retina to
      protect visual acuity. It is known that intravitreally injected triamcinolone and TTT is
      capable to decrease exudation. If there is any advantage in a combined treatment and if it is
      that effective to possibly avoid vitreoretinal surgery this study will investigate.
