    
      This study consists of two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. The Part 1 is a single-center,
      randomized, 2-way crossover study that investigates the pharmacokinetics, safety, and
      tolerability of teriparatide after a single dose of AK159 (5 levels) and estimates the
      relative bioavailability of AK159 with subcutaneous teriparatide acetate in healthy
      post-menopausal women.

      The Part 2 is a multiple-center, randomized, double-blind, positive- and placebo-controlled,
      parallel study that compares the pharmacokinetics, bone makers, safety, and tolerability of
      teriparatide after a weekly doses of AK159 (4 levels) for 6 weeks with placebo and a weekly
      doses of subcutaneous teriparatide acetate in healthy post-menopausal women.
