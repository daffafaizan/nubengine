      the lymphœdema for the child who is affected. If the psychic and social repercussions of the
      secondary lymphœdema in the breast cancer are well known, very few things are it on those of
      the primary lymphœdema. Some studies estimate globally the quality of life of the patients
      with a lymphœdema whatever is the origin and the etiologie. These studies of money groups
      suggest that the psychic difficulties and of therapeutic care are not identical. A single
      study approaches the specific question of the lymphœdema of the child by focusing on the
      real-life experience of expanding child of a primary lymphœdema.The construction and the
      validation of a tool measuring the quality of life of the children and the young adults
      affected by lymphœdema congenital appears as a starting point. A tool which would first of
      all allow to make the current situation for the regional level, and then can envisage
      national actions common. According to recent studies, the evolution of the lymphoedema is
      different according to the forms of initial clinical expression of the lymphoedema, we wish
      we can thus know during this study the impact of these various clinical forms on the quality
      of life of the patients. A genetic collection will be realized for that purpose (genetic
      research).
