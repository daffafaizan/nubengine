      environment (5% oxygen, 89% nitrogen, 6% carbon dioxide); oocyte pickup will be performed in
      a special workstation with reduced oxygen tension environment while fertilization check and
      embryo grading will be performed in conventional and time lapse embryo culture system. The
      time lapse culture system can provide a constant lower oxygen tension culture environment to
      the embryos. In the control group, oocyte pickup, fertilization check and embryo grading will
      be performed in atmospheric oxygen environment. Under this arrangement, the difference
      between the 2 groups is the oxygen tension during oocyte/embryo manipulation. The
      investigators believe that a solid conclusion can be drawn about whether lower oxygen tension
      environment can benefit IVF outcomes.
