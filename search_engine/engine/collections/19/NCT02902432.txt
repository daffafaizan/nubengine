      one cycles of induction chemotherapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with
      weekly cisplatin and 3 cycles of chemotherapy after IMRT. Treatment cycles will be repeated
      every 21 days for a maximum of 4 cycles. In CRT + Endostar arm, Endostar will be continuously
      intravenous pumped (7.5 mg/m2) for 14 days (d1-d14) during chemotherapy and for 5 days/week
      (d-5-d-1, d3-d7, d10-d14, d17-d21) during IMRT.

      Prior to enrollment in this study and while the patient is receiving the therapy, routine
      tests, ECG, head and neck CT scan and MRI will be performed to check the body's response to
      the treatment. Further more, before and after the treatment, the circulating endothelial
      cells (CECs), endothelial progenitor cells (CEPs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      Cancer embryo antigen (CEA), Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in blood and Microvessel density
      (MVD), hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), P53, VEGF, Survivin in pathological specimens
      will be tested.

      Patients with progressive disease or intolerable side effects will be removed from the study.
      Patients with stable disease or tumor response will continue therapy for a maximum of 4
      cycles.

      Primary outcome: The response rate (RR), the clinical benefit rate (CBR), time of tumor
      progression (TTP).

      Secondary outcomes: The quality of life (QOL)ï¼ŒSafety and Tolerability.
