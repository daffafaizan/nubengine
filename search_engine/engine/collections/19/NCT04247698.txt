      CMR examination on two separate occasions with both stressors; dobutamine and adenosine for
      assessment of myocardial ischemia as result of typical /atypical angina pectoris. The results
      from dobutamine (namely, detection of wall motion abnormalities) and adenosine stress CMR
      (namely, detection of perfusion abnormalities) will be compared with the values obtained from
      the measures of the hemodynamic forces of the LV (i.e., changes in the intraventricular
      pressures during systole and diastole). The dimensionless root mean square (FRMS) is computed
      over the entire heartbeat as a measure of the overall force amplitude. In addition, LV global
      longitudinal strain (GLS) and LV global circumferential strain (GCS) will be measured using a
      CMR feature tracking techniques. The expected results are as follows: Dobutamine wall motion
      analysis in combination with perfusion imaging has the highest diagnostic accuracy for the
      detection of ischemia in patients after bypass surgery and outperforms pure dobutamine wall
      motion or perfusion analysis and adenosine perfusion. Whereas, perfusion imaging with both
      stressors reflects the extent of ischemia more precisely than wall motion analysis.
      Nevertheless, assessment of hemodynamic forces adds to the diagnostic accuracy as well as the
      prognostic value of stress CMR in post-CABG patients, in whom stress testing with either or
      both stressors might fail to precisely define myocardial ischemia or reflect an associated
      subtle cardiac dysfunction.
