        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cisplatin when administered with 3-AP in
           patients with advanced cancer.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor responses in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cisplatin.

      Patients receive 3-AP IV over 2 hours on days 1-4 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 2 and
      3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
