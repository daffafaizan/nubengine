      intervention (i.e. subjects receive part of their physical therapy by playing interactive
      video games). The system is similar to consumer electronics products for interactive gaming
      that track the subject's movements using body-worn sensors. The FDA has determined that the
      Valedo system is a 510(K) exempt device under the product code ION (i.e. exerciser,
      non-measuring device for Physical Medicine). In the study, subjects with non-specific chronic
      low back pain are randomized using a block design to one of two groups: group 1 receives
      usual care alone; group 2 receives an exercise-based rehabilitation intervention using
      interactive gaming in addition to usual care. Clinical assessments are performed at baseline
      and again 4 weeks and 8 weeks after baseline measures are gathered.
