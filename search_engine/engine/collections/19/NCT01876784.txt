      re-consent, to continue on open-label vandetanib if in the opinion of the Investigator the
      participant is still receiving benefit. Placebo participants who experience disease
      progression within 60 days of unblinding may be offered the option of treatment with
      open-label vandetanib if, in the Investigator's opinion, such treatment may be of clinical
      benefit to the participant. Approximately 2 years; duration will vary depending on individual
      participant response.
