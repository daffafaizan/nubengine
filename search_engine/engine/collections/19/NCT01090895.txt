    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized study that will be conducted at up
      to 5 centers in Italy. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to
      receive during surgical procedure an intravenous infusion of Vitamin C or Placebo.

      Patients will have repeat clinical follow-up to 5 days, 3 and 6 months and 1 year.

      The new angiography evaluation will be done if necessary. The study population will consist
      of at least 100 patients who presented within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain, who had
      ST-segment elevation of more than 0.1 mV in two contiguous leads, and for whom the clinical
      decision was made to treat with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Following
      confirmation of eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      prophylactic infusion of Vitamin C or Placebo. The coronary angiograms will be assessed at a
      core laboratory with Quantitative Coronary Angiography.

      The incidence of clinical events, including death, myocardial infarction, target vessel
      revascularization, stent thrombosis, will be evaluated at 1, 3, 6 and, 12 months.
