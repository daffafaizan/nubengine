      electrical stimulation (FES) of the common peroneal nerve, has been proposed as a strategy
      for gait training in people following stroke. Moreover, it has also considered that the
      ground level is the most common locomotion surface, and that there is little information
      about the effects of gait training, on this kind of surface, in people with hemiparesis.
