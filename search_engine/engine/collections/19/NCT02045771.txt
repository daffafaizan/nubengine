    
      This is a pilot study, a mixed-methods design including an open label pragmatic randomized
      trial and a qualitative grounded theory approach. Participants will be randomized to
      Behavioural Activation (BA) (intervention) or support group (control) in addition to
      treatment as usual. The qualitative component will be used to gather participant's
      experiences, beliefs and opinions about two topics: 1) the experience of participating in the
      behavioural activation program and 2) their evolving perceptions of their individual
      depressive illness and quality of life. Based on the analysis of qualitative data pertaining
      to the first topic, the behavioural activation program may be modified for the main trial, to
      respond to patient needs and feedback, in the spirit of delivering truly patient centered
      care. The qualitative study will involve multiple interviews and focus groups which will take
      place before, during, and after the pilot intervention period.
