    
      This is an open label, single-arm, single-institution, Phase I study designed to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of personalized cellular tumor vaccine for patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). Newly diagnosed GBM patients will undergo tumor resection. The
      tumors will be analyzed for the expression of a panel of glioma-associated antigens and
      immune-related genes. Post surgical treatment will be 6 weeks standard chemotherapy with
      temozolomide and concurrent radiotherapy and continue cycles of temozolomide within a 28-day
      window. Patients will undergo leukapheresis either after surgery or after concurrent
      radio/chemotherapy. Based on individual tumor antigen expression, in vitro transcribed mRNA
      will be generated and used to pulse in vitro generated DCs. The patients will be immunized
      i.d. and i.v. biweekly with DC cellular vaccines. Safety and efficacy will be monitored. The
      primary objective is to assess the safety of the personalized cellular vaccines. The
      secondary objective is to assess the specific T cell response to immunized vaccines. In
      addition, the antitumor efficacy of the vaccines will be measured using iRANO criteria,
      progression-free survival and overall survival.
