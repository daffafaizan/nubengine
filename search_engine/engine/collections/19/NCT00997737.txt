      of the left branch of the portal vein using a B-mode ultrasound device (Logic 500, Pro
      SeriesÂ®; General ElectricMedical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). The ultrasound technician will
      use a 3.5 MHz convex transducer positioned in the right subcostal region, with the incidence
      angle perpendicular to the craniocaudal axis, in the direction of the inferior vena cava.
      Next, an intraparenchymal portal branch will be identified in the field of vision and its
      position will be traced with the curser during the forced inspiration and expiration. The
      craniocaudal displacement of these points will be considered to be the amount of right
      diaphragmatic mobility.
