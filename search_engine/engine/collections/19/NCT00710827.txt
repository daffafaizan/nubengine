      experienced in testing muscle function); Change in physical performance test i.e. lower limb
      muscle strength (subgroup only; optional for sites experienced in testing muscle function).
      Please note that the 2 explorative objectives mentioned above must be performed together. All
      measured at baseline, week 30, week 54, no safety measure. Safety parameters Prostate safety:
