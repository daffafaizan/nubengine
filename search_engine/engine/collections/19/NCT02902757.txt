      I. To assess very early response to therapy in glioblastoma patients using 18F-FDG PET/CT.

      II. Evaluate very early changes in FDG uptake within 48 hours of start of therapy and
      correlate them with objective response parameters such as Response Assessment in
      Neuro-Oncology (RANO) and survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard FDG PET/CT scan 6-8 weeks before start of chemotherapy and one
      additional FDG PET/CT scan within 48 hours of the start of chemotherapy.
