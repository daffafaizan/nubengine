      they are referred to the hernia service of the General Surgery and Week Surgery Unit of the
      University Hospital of Catania. After the examination confirming the diagnosis of inguinal
      hernia and once surgery has be indicated, informed consent will be obtained from the patient
      by means of a standardized form. The assignment to group H or group L will be made following
      a simple criterion of alternation that is completely random: i.e. patient 1 (Group H),
      patient 2 (Group L).A total of 60 patients will be recruited and divided into the two groups.
      For group H inguinal hernioplastic surgery will be carried out with the so called
      "heavy-weight" mesh (about 220 g/m2 of polypropylene), for Group L, on the other hand, the
      mesh will be of the "light-weight" type (about 40 g/m2).

      A preoperative blood test will be carried out to determine the basal levels of IL-6,
      TNF-alpha, nitrites, GSH and isoprostanes) and 3 postoperative tests (at 6 h, 3 days and 12
      days), all samples will be frozen for reference.

      All the data from each patient will be collected in a personal file compiled by the surgeon.
      When all the blood samples are collected a laboratory technician and a biochemist will
      determine the levels of the above mentioned substances, these data will then undergo
      statistical evaluation.
