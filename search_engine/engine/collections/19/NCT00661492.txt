    
      This is a nonblinded, randomized phase II study to determine the activity of Novantrone
      (mitoxantrone) with or without Erbitux (cetuximab) in patients with androgen independent
      prostate cancer (AIPC) who have been treated previously with docetaxel chemotherapy. The
      Novantrone (mitoxantrone)-only treatment arm will serve as a concurrent control arm to aid in
      the determination of the benefit of the Novantrone (mitoxantrone)-Erbitux (cetuximab)
      combination in this setting.

      Patients will be randomly assigned 2:1 to 1 of 2 treatment arms; 93 patients in Arm 1 and 47
      patients in Arm 2. A balanced randomization procedure will be performed utilizing a code list
      that will be developed prior to the study opening. Because the patients will be stratified by
      performance status (ECOG 0 and 1 vs. ECOG 2), the list will be developed to ensure a balance
      between the 2 treatment arms.
