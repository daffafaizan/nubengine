    
      This study will be prospective randomized double blind study.

      The forty five COPD patients will be divided into three groups:

      Group 1: 15 patients with COPD who will receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)plus long acting
      B2-agonist (LABA) (Budesonide/Formoterol combination 160/4.5 mcg, 2 inhalations bid ).

      Group 2: 15 patients with COPD who will receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long acting
      anticholinergic (LAAC) (Tiotropium 18 mcg capsule inhaled once daily + Budesonide ).

      Group 3: 15 patients with COPD who will receive long acting B2-agonist (LABA) plus long
      acting anticholinergic (LAAC).

      If any worsening of dyspnea, increase of purulence, or increase of sputum production appear
      plus increase of peak variability more than 35% and FEV1 that necessitate a change of the
      regular drug medication of the patient will be recorded as exacerbation.

      All patients will be submitted to the following analysis at the baseline, during and 12 weeks
      after the assigned treatment:

        1. Full medical history will be taken through clinical assessment of dyspnea, chronic cough
           and sputum production using mMRC or CAT test.

        2. Forced expiratory volume in 1second (FEV1) value measurement using spirometry.

        3. Measurement of the following inflammatory markers in serum and/ or plasma of patients
           under study .

             -  Tumer necrosis factor alpha ( TNF )

             -  Fibrinogen

             -  Interlukin 6 ( IL6 )

      Statistical analysis

      The results will be statistically calculated to evaluate its clinical significance if any
      before ,during and after drug therapy using (ANOVA) system SPSS version 20 (2012) to compare
      between the three groups of patients and paired t-test will be used to compare between
      results before, during and after drug therapy .
