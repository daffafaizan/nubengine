    
      This is a single-center, two-arm , randomized, open-label study intended to compare the
      detection rate obtained by performing G-EYEâ„¢ colonoscopy vs. the detection rate obtained by
      performing standard colonoscopy.

      The study will enroll 350 subjects. Consecutive adult subjects who were referred for elective
      colonoscopy will be asked to enroll in this randomized clinical study if the candidate meets
      the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Subjects will sign an informed consent form and undergo randomization.
