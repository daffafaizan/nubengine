    
      This is a pilot study to determine the safety, toxicity, virologic and immunologic effects of
      combination therapy with hydroxyurea, a cytostatic chemotherapeutic agent, two nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in
      children with HIV infection. We will enroll HIV-infected children who have detectable viral
      loads (greater than 10,000 copies/ml). Patients will be stratified upon enrollment by CD4
      cell count (less than or greater than 200 CD4 cells/mm(3)). Two dose levels of hydroxyurea
      will be utilized (7.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily and 12.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily). It is
      anticipated that 15 patients will be enrolled at the Low Dose Level and 10 patients at the
      High Dose Level of hydroxyurea within each CD4 cohort, for a total of 50 patients on study.
      Within each dose level patients will receive the antiretroviral agents didanosine, stavudine
      and efavirenz beginning on study Day one and will be randomized to receive hydroxyurea either
      on Day 1 or week 6. The cohorts will be escalated and analyzed separately. The study duration
      will be 52 weeks. This study will attempt to define an effective and tolerable dose of
      hydroxyurea.
