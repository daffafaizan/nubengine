      propose to examine the inter- relationships of nutrition, immunology, and epidemiology with
      respect to TB in Tanzania. Given that TB is so much linked with HIV immunologically,
      clinically, and epidemiologically, it is essential to examine how these relationships are
      modified by HIV infection. Published animal and human studies suggest that vitamin deficiency
      is associated with poor immune response in TB. By modulating immune function, nutritional
      supplements may be a useful adjunct to anti-TB drugs, and could lead to the development of
      shorter drug regimens. All patients will receive standard anti-TB therapy. Follow-up visits
      will occur every two weeks for the first 2 months and monthly thereafter till the end of the
      study.
