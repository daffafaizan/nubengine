      of DPT and DF (50:50). Although this is the first clinical trial to date to be performed with
      this vaccine, there have been two clinical trials with the same formulation and DPT 100% as
      active ingredient( NºEudraCT: 2009-016277-15 and NºEudraCT: 2011-004583-30). Given that there
      is a remarkable cross-reactivity between the DPT and DF mites, the results of the two
      clinical trials conducted to date with subcutaneous depot vaccine with Dermatophagoides
      pteronyssinus 100% extract mite, are very significant
