      follow-up period of two years. Eight-four subjects across twelve sites will be randomized 1:1
      to receive either a corneal tissue that have been cross-linked or not cross-linked (No UVA
      light source). Cross-linking is a term that refers to the linking of polymers (long chain)
      molecules by chemical bonds. It is believed that cross-linking the cornea will make the
      cornea stronger and more resistant to degradation.

      CorneaGen (formerly Keralink International) (Baltimore site) will supply the donor tissue and
      Avedro Inc (Waltham MA) will supply the riboflavin and the UV light source. Staff at
      CorneaGenwill administer the riboflavin with dextran solution and perform the cross-linking
      procedure according to one of randomization groups before shipping the masked donor cornea to
      study sites for Boston Keratoprosthesis (B-KPro) implantation.
