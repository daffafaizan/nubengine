      retina. Due to the burden of treatment, patients often experience a decline in vision with
      reduced frequency of treatment over time. RGX-314 is being developed as a potential one-time
      treatment for wet AMD. RGX-314 uses an AAV8 vector that contains a gene that encodes for a
      monoclonal antibody fragment which binds to and neutralizes VEGF activity.

      This phase 2, open label study will explore the pharmacodynamics of two doses in two
      formulations of RGX-314 gene therapy via subretinal delivery in patients with neovascular
      Age-related Macular Degeneration. Approximately 60 patients (15 per cohort) who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in 4 sequential dose cohorts. A dose cohort
      will be comprised of 1 of 2 doses of RGX-314 in 1 of 2 formulations in order to explore the
      pharmacodynamics of RGX-314 based on aqueous humor transgene product (TP) concentrations. If
      the participants meet the study criteria and chooses to participate in the study, their
      participation in the study will last about 6 months.
