      their written informed consent for study participation will be assigned to one of 6 cohorts
      determined by indication:

        -  Cohort 1: Non-clear cell RCC

        -  Cohort 2: Rare head and neck cancer

        -  Cohort 3: Rare skin cancer

        -  Cohort 4: non-colorectal cancers with microsatellite instability (MSI-nonCRC)

        -  Cohort 5: Penile cancer

        -  Cohort 6: POLE exonucleasic domain mutated cancer

      Between 20 and 50 patients will be enrolled in each cohort, with the exception of the cohort
      1 (Non-clear cell RCC) and cohort 3 (Rare skin cancer). Following the amendment 6, up to a
      maximum of 20 additional patients may be included in the cohort 1 (Non-clear cell RCC) or
      cohort 3 (Rare skin cancer), within the limit of 300 patients to be included in total, due to
      potential signals observed in some subsets.

      The study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all
      patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly
      sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in
      the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from
      the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.
