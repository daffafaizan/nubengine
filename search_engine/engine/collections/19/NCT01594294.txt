    
      This study was divided into 2 periods, a Screening Phase and an Investigational Phase. During
      the Screening Phase, subjects were fitted and dispensed with either ACUVUE® 2® (for current
      hydrogel wearers) or AIR OPTIX® AQUA (for current silicone hydrogel wearers) contact lenses
      and used COMPLETE® MPS Easy Rub® Formula to clean and disinfect their lenses. At the
      completion of the Screening Phase, the symptomatic status of the subjects was re-assessed.
      Those subjects who qualified proceeded to the Investigational Phase and were dispensed with
      new pair of study contact lenses identical to the lenses they wore during the Screening Phase
      to use in conjunction with the allocated study care product, CLEAR CARE® /AOSEPT® Plus or
      ReNu MultiPlus®.
