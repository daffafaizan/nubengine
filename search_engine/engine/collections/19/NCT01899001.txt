      conjunction with nutritional/exercise counseling in overweight/obese women with PCOS on
      cardiometabolic risk. The investigators hypothesize that women with PCOS will have greater
      benefit from dual intervention (psychological and nutritional/exercise counseling) for change
      in depressive symptoms and cardiometabolic risk reduction compared to nutritional/exercise
      counseling alone. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that psychological counseling
      may improve cardiometabolic risk by decreasing stress responses and stress associated markers
      of inflammation.
