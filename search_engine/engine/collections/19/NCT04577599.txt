      individuals 40-54 years of age at their first screening (T0) with mobile low-dose CT.
      Secondary objectives include evaluating the lung cancer diagnosis rate in individuals 40-54
      years of age at subsequent screening visits (T1 and T2); evaluating the positive screening
      rate at T0, T1, and T2; evaluating the impact of baseline demographic (including insurance
      status), socioeconomic, and healthcare-related factors on lung cancer rates and positive
      screening rates; and summarizing the incidence rate of all types of cancer found with
      low-dose lung CT during lung cancer screening. Enrollment will continue until 174 subjects
      are identified in the evaluable population with a total of 1160 subjects anticipated to be
      enrolled and screened.
