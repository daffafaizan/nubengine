      as a strategy to improve the quality of life, safety, decrease medication burden, and enhance
      the effectiveness of medications in people with psychiatric illnesses and developmental
      disabilities. Ultimately, this inter-disciplinary service could be developed into a standard
      screening and consultation tool for healthcare providers to utilize when determining the most
      appropriate medication for their patients.
