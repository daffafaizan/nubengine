      radiation and surgery for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities. Similar disease control
      rates following pre- versus postoperative non-intensity modulated radiation therapy
      (non-IMRT) was found, with increased wound complications (17% vs 35%) in the preoperative
      radiation arm, [95% CI 5-30], p=0Â·01).

      The investigators assessed a single center preoperative IMRT (or IMRT-equivalent highly
      conformal three dimensional conventional RT (3DcRT)) cohort with respect to the wound
      complication rate (WCR). The hypothesis was that a lower WCR rate was achieved in the era of
      IMRT as compared to the non-IMRT era when the Canadian Trial was conducted.

      Methods: 67 consecutive patients irradiated with 50Gy in 25 fractions between 3/2008-3/2016
      with preoperative IMRT (n=48, 72%) or highly conformal IMRT-equivalent 3DcRT dose
      distribution (n=19, 28%) were assessed. All patients were previously discussed at the weekly
      interdisciplinary sarcoma board of the Sarcoma Center Zurich.
