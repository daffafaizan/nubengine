    
      The study is done in order to assess the demographic variables such as age, height, weight
      and socio-economic status, BMI, personal habits, waist-hip ratio, lipid profile, use of
      medications, and family history of coronary artery disease in generalised chronic
      periodontitis subjects with and without coronary artery disease. To assess and compare the
      periodontal status of generalised chronic periodontitis subjects with and without coronary
      artery disease. To determine the expression of NLRP3 (rs4612666) and CARD8 gene (rs2043211)
      polymorphisms in subgingival tissue samples of generalised chronic gingivitis periodontitis
      subjects with and without coronary artery disease. To correlate the demographic variables and
      periodontal parameters and the expression of NLRP3 (rs4612666) and CARD8 (rs2043211) gene
      polymorphisms in generalised chronic periodontitis patients with coronary artery disease and
      compare them with systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients
