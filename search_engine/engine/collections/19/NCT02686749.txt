      diagnosed AF: anti-arrhythmic medications and AF ablation. The study will be conducted to
      determine if one treatment is more effective than the other for patients with AF and heart
      failure. About 220 subjects with newly diagnosed AF from hospitals in the United States will
      take part in this study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either AF catheter
      ablation or anti-arrhythmic medication for treatment of AF. Both therapies are considered
      Standard of Care.
