        -  Determine the antitumor activity of thalidomide, in terms of tumor response and duration
           of response, in patients with metastatic follicular, papillary, or medullary thyroid
           carcinoma that is unresponsive to systemic radioiodine.

        -  Compare the differences in antitumor activity of this drug in patients with medullary
           carcinomas vs those with papillary or follicular carcinomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects and duration of toxic effects of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 2 weeks and then twice daily.
      Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
