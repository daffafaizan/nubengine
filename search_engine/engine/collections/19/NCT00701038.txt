      increase in the sympathetic nerve activity and repetitive surges in blood pressure, along
      with episodic hypoxia and hypercapnea (8, 9). These autonomic and respiratory changes may
      increase the cardiac muscle workload, cardiac dysrrhythmia, and exacerbate ischemia
      (10,11,12). Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most successful
      therapeutic modality available for obstructive sleep apnea. It is still not clear whether
      establishing the diagnosis of OSA and initiating treatment with CPAP while still in the
      hospital carries any benefit in the management of patients with acute heart failure. This
      study will evaluate the effect of work up and treatment of OSA on the outcome of patients
      hospitalized with acute congestive heart failure (CHF).
