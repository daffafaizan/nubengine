      by FA become sensitized to food in the first few months of life and spontaneously outgrow the
      disease by 5-6 years of age in about 80% of cases. At the present time, diagnosis of FA is
      made by a combination of history, skin testing and food challenge. The pathogenic mechanisms
      leading to food sensitization and subsequent spontaneous tolerance development are not
      understood.
