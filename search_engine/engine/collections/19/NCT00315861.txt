      none of the additional 3 patients experience DLT. The highest dose level that generates DLT
      in 0/3 or 1/6 patients will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the doses recommended for
      subsequent studies. A total of 10 patients will be treated at the MTD to further assess the
      toxicity of the dosing regimen and its suitability for use in subsequent trials. Patients may
      continue to receive treatment until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression is
      encountered. Treatment cycles will be repeated every 21 days. The protocol is also designed
      to enroll an additional 10 patients at the maximum tolerated dose to increase the confidence
      in the safety and suitability of the doses that are chosen for subsequent studies.
