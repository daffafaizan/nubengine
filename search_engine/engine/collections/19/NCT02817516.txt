    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-828. TAK-828 is being tested to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy non-Japanese and
      Japanese participants in Parts 1 and 2, respectively.

      The study will enroll approximately 56 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive either TAK-828 or matching placebo. This
      assignment will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study
      (unless there is an urgent medical need).

      Proposed doses:

        -  Part 1: TAK-828 15 mg, 45 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, and placebo twice daily

        -  Part 2: TAK-828 45 mg, and 100 mg, and placebo twice daily

      All participants will be asked to take the solution at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States.
