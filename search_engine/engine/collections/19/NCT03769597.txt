      (serum creatinine) during cirrhosis is included in the MELD model. In addition, chronic
      kidney disease (15%) after liver transplantation is also an independent mortality factor.

      The most commonly used methods to estimate GFR are based on creatinine, but in patients
      suffering from advanced hepatic disease, such as cirrhosis, this parameter is incorrect, due
      to the low creatinine production and potentially to elevated serum bilirubin and decreased
      albumin levels. Furthermore, ascites can interfere with serum creatinine concentration. In
      this condition, all creatinine-based evaluations of GFR overestimate gold standard-measured
      GFR. Specific eGFR equations for liver disease or new approaches for estimating GFR may be
      necessary.

      The plasma clearance of iohexol is a recognized technique for the measurement of the
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
