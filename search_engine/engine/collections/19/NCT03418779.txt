      group (YQF compound combined with prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide if necessary) or an
      immunosuppression group (placebo-YQF combined with prednisolone, and cyclophosphamide if
      necessary). The two groups will enter a 48-week in-trial treatment phase and receive
      post-trial follow-up until 50% (30/60) have a composite endpoint or have been followed for 3
      years (study completion). All patients will receive optimal supportive care.
