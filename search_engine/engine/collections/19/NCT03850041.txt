      elective non-cardiac surgery, preferential increase in neck fluid volume following
      intravenous administration during general anesthesia results in worsening apnea-hypopnea
      (AHI) and postoperative respiratory complications.This is a two-center study where the study
      population will be drawn from patients visiting preoperative clinic at University Health
      Network Hospitals, Toronto Western Hospital, and Toronto General Hospital.

      Objectives of the study

        -  Measure the change in the leg, neck and total fluid volume from preoperative baseline,
           postoperative care unit (PACU), first postoperative night (Night 1) and the morning
           after surgery (Day 2)

        -  Assess the impact of the change in neck fluid volume on respiratory mechanics and
           postoperative apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) the first postoperative night (Night 1) In this
           study, the investigators will perform serial measurements of segmental and total body
           water shifts occurring after surgery, at various time-points on the night and the
           morning after surgery. The investigators will monitor indices such as the Apnea Hypopnea
           index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) to examine changes in the severity of
           OSA. Internal validity of this study will be made more robust by use of well-validated
           methods such as Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) for fluid measurements, portable
           Apnea Link for OSA severity and tremflow airway oscillometry for the airway resistance.
