      investigators aimed to identify network abnormalities which remain unchanged throughout the
      longitudinal course of migraine. The investigators also aimed to identify networks which
      change in association with changes in migraine frequency and associated psychiatric
      conditions. The investigators expect these can serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis
      of migraine brain and monitoring of disease severity.
