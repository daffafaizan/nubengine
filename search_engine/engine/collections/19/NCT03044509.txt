           them with the current diagnostic gold standard for TB or for culture/NAAT non-confirmed
           TB cases a consensus case definition is used.

           Currently available immunodiagnostic tests (IGRA/TST) will be compared to novel
           immunodiagnostic tests which will include:

             -  several novel, additional M. tuberculosis-specific Antigens

             -  cytokines that are highly expressed

        2. Since there is no diagnostic gold standard for TB infection we will rely on a clinical
           composite reference standard for diagnosing TB infection. Biomarkers will be determined
           by:

             -  including M. tuberculosis-specific antigens that are specifically expressed in
                either TB infection or disease,

             -  measuring phenotypes and cytokine production of M. tuberculosis-specific cells.
