      the 1% Lidocaine or placebo(normal saline) group. The initial injection of either 1%
      lidocaine or placebo (normal saline) will be administered 2 minutes prior to the
      amniocentesis procedure. 2cc of 1% lidocaine or placebo (normal saline) will be initially
      administered as an intradermal "wheal", followed by a deeper infiltration of the 1% lidocaine
      or placebo (normal saline) to the depth of the peritoneum. All procedures will be performed
      by either the Maternal-Fetal medicine (MFM) or the reproductive geneticist utilizing
      continuous ultrasound guidance under sterile conditions. Each woman will be asked to rate
      their pain perception immediately after the procedure on two pain scales.
