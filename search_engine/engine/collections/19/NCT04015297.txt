      methods are controversial. The diagnosis is still invasive and there are no accepted ways
      which are molecular-based and noninvasive. Raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy
      technique which can analyze specific spectral patterns, substances and molecular changes with
      high specificity. We aimed to use Raman spectroscopy to detect differences between healthy
      controls and patients with surgically proven endometriosis.
