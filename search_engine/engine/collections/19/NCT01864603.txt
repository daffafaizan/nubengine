      lead to the elimination of HIV in rural communities in East Africa using a multi-disease
      approach. The first phase of the study will quantify the health, economic and educational
      impact of early HIV diagnosis using a streamlined and immediate ART (antiretroviral therapy).
      This first phase will be completed in July 2017. The second phase of the study, will quantify
      the impact of targeted Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), and targeted HIV testing in the
      context of universal treatment and streamlined care. This second phase will be completed in
      July 2020. The study intervention is designed to improve the entire continuum of care, to
      reduce structural barriers for all populations including those most "at risk". Primary
      endpoint for the first phase is HIV incidence measured at 3 years follow up.
