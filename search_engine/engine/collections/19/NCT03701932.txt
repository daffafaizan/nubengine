      will complete clinical assessments and participate in cognitive retraining through completion
      of 15 hours of Lumosity gaming cognitive exercises while simultaneously receiving active TMS
      stimulation. Those participants in the control group will complete 15 hours of computer
      gaming activity during the administration of active stimulation. Computer games in the
      control group exercises are elected by the patient from a library of intellectually and
      motivationally engaging games drawn from several gaming software compilations that includes
      Play 101 Games and Hoyle Puzzle and Board Games.
