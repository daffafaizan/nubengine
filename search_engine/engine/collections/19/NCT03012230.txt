    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib phosphate (ruxolitinib) (JAK2
      inhibition) in combination with fixed dosing of pembrolizumab (anti PD-1) in patients with
      advanced/metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with ruxolitinib.

      II. To estimate clinical tumor response in women with TNBC treated with pembrolizumab in
      combination with ruxolitinib as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1.

      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess tumor response with immune related (ir)RECIST and associations with PDJ
      amplification, PD-L1, PD-L2, JAK2 and pSTAT3 expression.

      II. To determine the effect of combination targeted blockade on T- and B- cell immunity to
      breast cancer tumor antigens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib phosphate.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and ruxolitinib
      phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 or 6 months for up to 2 years.
