    
      ESCAPE is a phase 3, randomized, open-label with blinded outcome evaluation, controlled,
      parallel group design.

      The primary objectives of this study are to show that rapid endovascular revascularization
      amongst radiologically selected (small core/proximal occlusion) patients with ischemic stroke
      results in improved outcome compared to patients treated in clinical routine.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled within 12 hours of last seen normal with a baseline NIHSS
      > 5 at the time of randomization. There must be a confirmed symptomatic intracranial
      occlusion, based on single phase, multiphase or dynamic CTA, at one or more of the following
      locations: Carotid T/L, M1 MCA, or M1-MCA equivalent (2 or more M2-MCAs). Anterior temporal
      artery is not considered an M2.

      All patients will receive the best standard of medical care according to modern acute stroke
      care guidelines. Control arm subjects will receive best medical care. In the
      intervention/experimental arm, subjects will be treated with endovascular thrombectomy or
      thrombolysis using currently available technology for use in the ESCAPE site for
      thrombectomy/thrombolysis.

      This study consists of one 90-day study period for each subject. Subjects will be
      hospitalized for care after their acute stroke according to the current standard of care.
      Subjects are required to return to clinic on Days 30 & 90 for end-of-study procedures.
