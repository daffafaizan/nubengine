      significant systemic to pulmonary shunting occurs, which may result in pulmonary
      hyperperfusion and systemic hypoperfusion.

      The evidence on PDA effect on brain and renal tissue oxygenation, measured by Near Infrared
      Spectroscopy is still controversial.

      This study aims to evaluate the brain and renal oxygenation using near infrared spectroscopy
      (NONIN SenSmart model X-100) in 3 groups of preterm infants: 1) closed ductus arteriosus, 2)
      persistent ductus arteriosus, 3) hemodynamicaly significant ductus arteriosus.
