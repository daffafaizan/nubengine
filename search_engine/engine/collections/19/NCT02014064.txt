      for potential associations between outcome variables with demographic variables at baseline.
      In cases of strong deviations from normality, log or power transformations will be used as
      appropriate. For the subjective effects questionnaires, the peak effect will be identified
      for each subject and used as the dependent variable. The primary analytical technique will be
      linear mixed effects regression. The general linear mixed model (GLMM) is equivalent to
      repeated measures ANOVA when all subjects have complete data but automatically handles
      missing observations, producing unbiased estimates as long as the values are missing at
      random. This approach will allow use of the data from subjects who complete only part of the
      protocol or who have invalid measurements on some tests, greatly enhancing our power.

      The sample size is as large or greater than those in the previous human laboratory studies
      assessing safety and initial efficacy of agonist-like pharmacotherapies for stimulant
      dependence. For example, these previous studies used samples of 7 (Herin et al., 2010; Stoops
      et al., 2008; Dackis et al., 2003), and 10 (Sofuoglu et al., 2009) subjects to obtain
      significant reductions in subjective effects of d-amphetamine by atomoxetine and those of
      cocaine by modafinil.

      To be conservative, the investigators base power estimates on completers but will use
      available data from all 30 subjects in GLMM analyses. This should substantially increase
      power (power for GLMM and repeated measures ANOVA are equivalent except that ANOVA cannot
      utilize incomplete data, while a GLMM can).
