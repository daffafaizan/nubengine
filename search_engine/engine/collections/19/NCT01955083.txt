      surgery (MIS) methods of the soft palate including radiofrequency (RF) surgery and pillar
      implant (PI). Despite modest effects in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, patients
      often wish to receive MIS for habitual snoring. However, the efficacy in reducing snoring has
      mainly been determined by self-reported questionnaires in the past. Further, the definition
      of surgical success in snoring treatment has not been universally defined. To date, changes
      in snoring sound characteristics following MIS have not been demonstrated.

      Many cohort studies and a few randomized controlled trials or clinical controlled trials have
      compared MIS with a placebo, different energy generators, different material rigidity, or
      different operative techniques. RF of the soft palate produces volumetric tissue reduction
      and selective scar tissue5 to reduce obstruction and induce stiffness. However, the RF energy
      delivered to the soft palate can be inadequate and may result in residual or recurrent
      snoring. PI can decrease palatal flutter by increasing the rigidity of the soft palate
      through implant identity and tissue fibrosis. In addition, PI can be chronically retained in
      the muscle layer of the soft palate thereby producing a long-term anti-snoring effect.
      Nevertheless, whether PI provides a better efficacy in the treatment of snoring than RF
      surgery is still unknown.

      The primary aim of the current study was to compare the anti-snoring effect between PI and RF
      by subjective assessments in a randomized controlled parallel trial. The secondary aim was to
      explore and compare the acoustic changes in snoring sounds after PI and RF.
