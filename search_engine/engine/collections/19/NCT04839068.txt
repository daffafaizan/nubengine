           single-strand, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus, severe acute respiratory
           syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus (Masters, 2019).

        -  The sex ratio (ratio of boys to girls) at birth (SRB) is about 1.01-1.05 in most
           populations (Abdoli, 2020). Various influencing factors affect the SRB, including
           maternal stress, endocrine disruption, maternal inflammatory responses and maternal
           nutrition (Lipner et al., 2019).

        -  These stressful life events consequently influence on maternal immunological and
           endocrine conditions, and the male fetuses are more vulnerable to be affected by these
           conditions. It is of interest that male fetus is biologically weaker and more
           susceptible to prenatal events and diseases than female fetuses. Hence, premature death
           is higher in boys than girls (Ahrenfeldt et al., 2017).

        -  The recent pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been known to have
           various impacts on pregnant women (Rasmussen et al., 2020). Placentas of infected
           mothers show inflammatory, vascular and thrombotic changes (Prochaska et al., 2020).
           Among the neonates, children and adults (Bjelosevic et al., 2017), higher morbidity and
           mortality of males than females were reported. It is observed that the incidence of
           stillbirth was significantly increased during the pandemic period than during the pre
           pandemic period in London, UK (Khalilet al., 2020).

        -  The start of appearance of Covid 19 cases in Egypt was in March 2020, with subsequent
           increase in cases with its peak in May, June and July 2020, with lockdown and social and
           financial affection with great stress on families
