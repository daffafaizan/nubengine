    
      Microparticle (MPs) levels and subtypes according to endothelial cell, macrophage and
      platelet markers will be measured by flow-cytometry using appropriate fluorochromes. Patient
      baseline (including measures of severity of aortic stenosis and its calcification),
      procedural data, and clinical evolution will be collected. Inflammatory markers will be
      measured, which along with clinical date will be tested for correlation with microparticle
      levels.

      Patients MPs will be measured before and after percutaneous treatment of the severe aortic
      stenosis.
