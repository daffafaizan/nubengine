    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomised, comparative, active-controlled parallel-arm
      phase II study.

      The study will be conducted in Russia. The aim of this study is to explore the safety and
      efficacy of treatment with Myrcludex B used as a monotherapy and in combination with PEG-IFNα
      and Tenofovir compared to monotherapy with PEG-IFNα in patients with chronic viral hepatitis
      B with delta-agent, based on the achievement of undetectable viral load at the end of the
      follow-up period 6 months (24 weeks) after the end of treatment. The study is also aimed at
      investigating immunogenicity of Myrcludex B and the drug pharmacokinetics when used in
      combination with PEG IFN alfa-2a and with Tenofovir.

      It is planned to screen 110 patients, and 90 patients will be randomised in equal numbers
      into six treatment arms.

        -  Arm A (n=15): PEG IFN alfa-2a 180 µg for 48 weeks

        -  Arm B (n=15): Myrcludex B 2 mg + PEG IFN alfa-2a 180 µg for 48 weeks

        -  Arm C (n=15): Myrcludex B 5 mg + PEG IFN alfa-2a 180 µg for 48 weeks

        -  Arm D (n=15): Myrcludex B 2 mg for 48 weeks

        -  Arm E (n=15): Myrcludex B 10 mg (10 mg once a day)+ PEG IFN alfa-2a 180 µg for 48 weeks

        -  Arm F (n=15): Myrcludex B 10 mg (5 mg twice a day)+ Tenofovir for 48 weeks
