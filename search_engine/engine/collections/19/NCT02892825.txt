      under topical anaesthesia. Restlessness and hypertension are the most frequent medical
      complications during surgery, potentially leading to surgical complications. Since the
      surgery is ambulatory and requires the patient's cooperation, heavy intravenous sedation
      should be avoided. However, this procedure is stressful, with patients experiencing high
      anxiety due to being awake and aware of the procedure on their eye and equipment. Music
      therapy may be considered as a non-pharmacologic and non-invasive mean to reduce anxiety and
      therefore intra-operative hypertension. To assess the effect of music therapy on anxiety and
      hypertension during cataract surgery procedures under topical anaesthesia, investigators
      intend to perform a randomized controlled trial. Depending on the results of the study, music
      therapy may subsequently be replacing the usual premedication before surgery.
