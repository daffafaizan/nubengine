      Primary:

        -  Determine the overall objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, locally
           recurrent, or metastatic colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine and irinotecan.

      Secondary:

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure, time to overall response, duration of overall
           response, duration of overall complete response, and time to progression in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the 1-year survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity and safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of predicting responses to this regimen by the molecular
           profile of tumor tissue in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 2-15 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes
      on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients maintaining a response or stable disease after
      12 courses may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.
