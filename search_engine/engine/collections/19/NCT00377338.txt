    
      The study will include 40 healthy smoker or non-smoker volunteers, 20 patients with normal
      Chest CT scan and normal respiratory function tests, and 90 patients with focal or diffuse
      peripheral lung diseases.

      The Alveoscopy will be performed under local anesthesia, in awake patients during a standard
      bronchoscopy. The Alveoscopy will be performed on one side of the bronchial tree (left or
      right lung). Two to ten separate bronchial areas will be explored in each patient, depending
      on the pathology, focal or diffuse, and the underlying respiratory function.

      A continuous monitoring of the Oxygen saturation, blood pressure, EKG will be performed
      during the procedure. A chest X-ray will be performed after the procedure to eliminate a
      pneumothorax.

      The morphometric parameters of the alveolar microstructure and their variability will be
      studied according to the age, gender, lung area explored, smoking status in healthy
      volunteers and "normal CT scan" subjects, as well as in patients with peripheral lung
      diseases.
