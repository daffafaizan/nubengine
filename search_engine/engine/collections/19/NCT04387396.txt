      osteoarthritis (OA) in reducing pain and improving function. Similarly, in individuals with
      knee osteoarthritis, exercise has been reported to be effective in reducing the pain and
      improving physical function of the knee OA patient in the short term, and may be even more
      effective with individual exercise programs. However, there is no study examining the effect
      of PRP and exercise together. PRP and exercise can be more effective together. The aim of our
      study was to investigate the effects of physiotherapy on pain, physical function and quality
      of life in patients with knee OA who underwent PRP injection.
