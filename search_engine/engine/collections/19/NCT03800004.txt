      children with AD. This will be compared with existing normative data. Such an objective
      prospective study, directly looking at bone health in children has not yet been done. This
      will be done using bone densitometry (DXA) and high-resolution peripheral quantitative
      computed tomography (HR-pQCT) for the accurate and precise measurement of bone health status.
      HR-pQCT is a cutting-edge technology available at only at a few academic centers in the
      United States that is used to measure bone strength with minimal doses of radiation. In
      addition, blood and urine metabolic parameters related to bone health will be analyzed, and
      data will be correlated with eczema severity. The results from this study will allow us to
      design large-scale, multi-institutional studies on bone health in this population and
      ultimately to guide decision making in children who may be at risk specifically regarding
      treatment recommendations and supportive care.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. To determine bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical and trabecular bone strength in
           children with atopic dermatitis, using DXA and to compare this with normative data.

        2. HR-pQCT data will be compared with current known data from other diseases

        3. To correlate bone mineral density with eczema severity using Eczema area and severity
           index (EASI) and Scoring atopic dermatitis (SCORAD) scores.

        4. To determine if bone mineral density in children with atopic dermatitis correlates with
           bone age and bone-health specific serum markers.
