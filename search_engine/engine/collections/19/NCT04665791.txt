    
      In this pilot research, the study team will use a methodology of nasal inoculation with
      reconstituted lyophilised N. lactamica (hereafter LyoNlac) developed in a previous, UK-based,
      human challenge study. This methodology and will be developed further and validated in
      healthy Malian adults.

      A dose-ranging strategy will be used, starting with the dose identified as the standard
      inoculum in healthy adults in the UK, which was the dose required to induce colonisation in
      approximately 80% of volunteers. The dose will be escalated to a dose able to induce a
      similar level of colonisation in Malian adults. This study will inform the study team whether
      intranasal inoculation of reconstituted lyophilised Nlac (hereafter, lyoNlac), can result in
      immunising colonisation of adult Malian volunteers and the optimal dose to achieve this. This
      dose and methodology will then be used in future studies looking at the duration and
      immunogenicity of colonisation induced by LyoNlac in Mali.
