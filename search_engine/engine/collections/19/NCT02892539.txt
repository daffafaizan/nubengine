      effects, including an increased risk of developing cancer.Individual justification for the
      procedure and its optimization are the cornerstones of dose-reduction for patients.Radiation
      exposure is influenced by a variety of technical and clinical factors.Few multicenter data
      from large populations exist concerning the radiation doses to which patients are exposed
      during interventional coronary procedures.The aims of this prospective, multicenter survey is
      to: 1) evaluate the radiation exposure in 4000 patients undergoing coronary angiography by
      monitoring the parameters of Air kema,fluoroscopy Dose-area product and total Dose-area
      product; 2) analyze factors associated with variation in radiation dose in everyday clinical
      practice, such as number of frames, body surface area, sex, age, BMI, arterial approach,
      fluoroscopy time and so on.
