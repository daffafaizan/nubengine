      no rationalization of therapeutic interventions. Few researches investigated the contribution
      of the components of a neurorehabilitation program to the clinical outcome in everyday
      clinical practice. Moreover, there is no a standard method to categorize rehabilitative
      interventions, making difficult to explain why subjects improve and which of the various
      treatments is more effective. Thus, it was decided to build a multicentre network to collect
      data using a taxonomy tool developed to provide information on the goals of rehabilitation
      and to categorize rehabilitation interventions
