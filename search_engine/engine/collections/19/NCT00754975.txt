      with the vessel surface, thus potentially reducing the incidence of untoward side effects.
      The Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating Process is capable of exclusive coating on the ablumenal
      side of pre-mounted bare metal stents. Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating is a proprietary
      formulation containing a bioerodable polymer. The combination of the Juxtaposed Ablumenal
      Coating Process and Juxtaposed Ablumenal Coating create a unique microstructure surface, and
      reduces the amount of required polymer.
