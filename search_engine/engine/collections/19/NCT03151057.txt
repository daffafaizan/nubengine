      of anti-neoplastic therapy post transplantation: where the allo BMT serves as a platform to
      allowing a new intolerant immune system to interact with the post allo BMT intervention.

      The importance of post BMT therapy has been made evident with tyrosine kinase inhibition
      (TKI) in Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic
      myeloid leukemia(CML), where patients who had disease progression while on TKI therapy
      pre-allo BMT enjoy marked improvement in overall survival when TKI is part of a maintenance
      program; the use of DNA hypomethylation agents after allo BMT for relapsed myeloid
      malignances; or the use of rituximab after allo BMT in follicular lymphoma.

      Idelalisib, an orally-administered, selective inhibitor of Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K),
      is extremely effective in inducing partial responses to complete responses in many B-cell
      derived malignancies and should be studied in the post alloHSCT setting. Johns Hopkins
      Hospital has one of the world's largest experiences with alloHSCT. This study proposes a
      double blinded randomized phase I placebo trial where all patients who have undergone
      alloHSCT for a B-cell derived hematologic malignancy be offered either idelalisib 100mg or
      placebo twice daily for 180 days starting approximately 90 days after their HSCT.
