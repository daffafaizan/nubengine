      I. Determine the efficacy of BMS-247550 in patients with stage IV melanoma. II. Determine the
      toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to the number of
      prior chemotherapy regimens (0 vs 1-2, including dacarbazine or temozolomide).

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
