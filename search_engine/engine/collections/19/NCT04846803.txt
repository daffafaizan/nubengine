      affects 150 million people annually. Treatment of patients with UTI entails a high
      consumption of antibiotics and large social and health costs. With this protocol, we want to
      elucidate alternative treatment methods for especially recurrent urinary tract infection.
      Bacteria have internal competitiveness (bacterial interference) and it is known that the
      non-pathogenic E.coli can outcompete the pathogenic E.coli in laboratory studies.

      We intend to strengthen the clinical evidence that it can be used as patient treatment
      through a clinical, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial at Odense University Hospital.

      Claim to be investigated:

        -  The non-pathogenic bacterial strain (ABU) E.coli can overcome the most common pathogenic
           E.coli (UPEC) in humans.

        -  ABU can be used for preventive treatment in patients with recurrent urinary tract
           infections.

      Clinical effect of preventive treatment (prophylactic treatment) with the non-pathogenic
      bacterial strain (ABU) in a selected group of patients with recurrent cystitis: A clinical,
      placebo-controlled, double-blind safety study.
