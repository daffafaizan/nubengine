      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (partial and complete response) in patients with
           relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with bortezomib and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate NF-kB inhibition and proteasome activity with response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
