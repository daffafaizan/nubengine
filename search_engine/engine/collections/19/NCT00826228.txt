      chronic SCI and loss of bone mass in their lower extremities. A convenience sample of 12
      people with SCI will be enrolled into a 6 month study assessing the effects of a
      weight-bearing regime plus daily PTH (Forteo 20ug sc) on BMD and bone markers. Subjects will
      be evaluated at 3 and 6 months after initiating treatment with measurement of bone density as
      well as bone markers of formation and resorption. An optional extension to 12 months will be
      offered to all subjects.
