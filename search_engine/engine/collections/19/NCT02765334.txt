      and rehabilitation, 40-50% of stroke survivors are left with permanent neuro-disability and a
      reduced quality of life. The previous 2 decades has seen exponential leaps in the development
      of rehabilitation technologies which enhance neuroplasticity and rehabilitation outcome. One
      of these potentially useful technologies is nBETTER System, was developed by Institute for
      Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). nBETTER is a
      portable, internet-connected device that detects the imagination of movement of
      stroke-affected limb using a Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface
      (BCI) thus delivering visually engaging feedback for directed neurofeedback aimed at
      improving upper limb recovery for subacute to chronic stroke patients. The pilot study aims
      to recruit 13 patients using a multi centre trial design to investigate nBETTER system
      feasibility and safety for rehabilitation of subacute to chronic stroke patients with upper
      limb motor impairment and to determine clinical efficacy, safety and feasibility of such a
      system when it is delivered with standard occupational therapy.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that nBETTER is a feasible and safe prototype in
      stroke survivors (> 3 months) with moderate to severe arm impairment (FMMA 10-50). The
      primary outcome is a gain of 15% in Fugl-Meyer motor scores at 6 weeks after 18 sessions
      (total of 27 hours) of supervised training by occupational therapists and bioengineers.
