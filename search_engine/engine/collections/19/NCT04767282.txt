      provides one $15 prescription for fresh produce to every child at every office visit.
      Prescriptions are redeemable at a local farmers' market and mobile market. To determine
      whether exposure to the FVPP is associated with improvements in dietary intake, food
      security, and health status, we will compare demographically similar pediatric patient groups
      with varying levels of exposure to the FVPP at baseline: high exposure (>24 months), moderate
      exposure (12-24 months), and no previous exposure. We will then introduce the FVPP to never
      exposed patients and collect, record, and compare changes in dietary intake, food security,
      and weight status over time. The central hypothesis is that exposure to the FVPP is
      associated with higher intake of fruits and vegetables, better food security, and lower rates
      of childhood obesity over time.

      We propose the following three specific aims to test our hypothesis:

      Aim 1 - Compare baseline dietary intake, food security, and weight status between pediatric
      patients with varying levels of exposure to the FVPP.

      Aim 2 - Measure changes in diet, food security, and weight status when never exposed children
      are introduced to the FVPP.

      Aim 3 - Compare mean follow-up measures of dietary intake, food security, and weight status
      in the initial no exposure group to baseline measures in the high exposure group.
