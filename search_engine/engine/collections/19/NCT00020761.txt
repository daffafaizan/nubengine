        -  Determine the antitumor activity of irinotecan and paclitaxel in patients with
           metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or stomach.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis
      (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, or gastric cardia vs
      adenocarcinoma of the rest of the stomach).

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-54 patients (13-27 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
