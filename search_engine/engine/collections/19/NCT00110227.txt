    
      HF is a major public health problem in the United States, affecting approximately 5 million
      adults. Despite recent advances in pharmacologic therapy and technologic devices, HF is the
      most common reason for hospitalization among Medicare patients and is reaching epidemic
      proportions as the population ages. New and inexpensive interventions that can improve
      functional capacity and quality of life and can delay disease progression are needed. Tai chi
      is a popular mind-body exercise that is a potential treatment for heart disease. This
      exercise incorporates both gentle physical activity and meditation, and it may be
      particularly suited to frail patients with HF. This study will examine the effects of a
      tailored tai chi program on functional capacity and quality of life in patients with HF.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either a tai chi program or heart health education
      for 12 weeks. Participants in both groups will undergo a bicycle stress test at study entry
      and will receive weekly training sessions of their assigned intervention. Self-report scales
      and questionnaires will be used to assess participants at study start and at the end of 12
      weeks.
