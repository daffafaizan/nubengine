        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated
           with HLA-partially matched related donor lymphocytes.

        -  Determine the rate and kinetics of clinical/radiological response in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rates of graft-vs-host disease in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irradiated donor lymphocytes IV over 1 hour on day 0. Treatment
      repeats every 8-16 weeks for up to 6 donor lymphocyte infusions in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected periodically for research studies, including immunophenotypic analysis of
      cells and assay for cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer-cell activity against target
      cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 60 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
