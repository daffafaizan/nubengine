    
      This study is to prospectively determine whether there is a predictive relationship in RPC
      between pre-operative radiomic imaging features and pathologic tumor heterogeneity,
      delineated by gene-expression-based RSI and histologic measures of hypoxia measured by Glut-1
      and CA-IX as well as the degree of pimonidazole staining.
