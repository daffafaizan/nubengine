      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of magnesium oxide on hot flashes in women with a history of
           breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the side-effect profile of magnesium oxide in this study population.

        -  Evaluate the effect of magnesium oxide on the secondary outcomes hot flash frequencies,
           hot flash severities, toxicities (including diarrhea), and hot flash-related daily
           interference on activities.

        -  Evaluate the effect of magnesium oxide on the change of magnesium level (for the first
           150 patients).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (18-49 years
      vs ≥ 50 years), current tamoxifen and/or selective estrogen receptor modulator (yes vs no),
      current aromatase inhibitor (yes vs no), and daily frequency of hot flashes (4-9 vs ≥ 10).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a low-dose of magnesium oxide orally (PO) daily (QD).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a high-dose of magnesium oxide PO QD.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive a low-dose of placebo PO QD.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive a high-dose of placebo PO QD. In all arms, treatment continues
           for 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients may continue or crossover to receive magnesium for 4 more weeks.

      Patients complete the Hot Flash Diary daily for 9 weeks beginning 1 week before treatment.
      They also complete the Symptom Experience Questionnaire, the Profile of Mood States (POMS),
      and Hot Flash-Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) questionnaires periodically during
      study treatment.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and at the end of weeks 5 and 9 for
      serum magnesium level analysis.
