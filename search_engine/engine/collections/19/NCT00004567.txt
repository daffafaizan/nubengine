    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the comparative efficacy of using methotrexate versus
      mycophenolate mofetil for maintaining remission that has been induced by cyclophosphamide and
      glucocorticoids in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and related vasculitides. In this
      study, all patients will initially receive daily cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids and
      then at disease remission, cyclophosphamide will be discontinued and patients will be
      randomized to receive either methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil for remission maintenance.
      They will continue to receive the agent to which they are randomized for 2 years, after which
      time it will be tapered and discontinued. Patients will be prospectively monitored for
      evidence of disease relapse and drug toxicity. Specific parameters that will be obtained
      include the time to disease remission, the rate and time of disease relapse, and the
      incidence of drug-related adverse events.
