      severe, that the patient cannot produce any words at all, and so the communication ability is
      rather poor. In that case speech therapy is the most common therapy, but the functional
      outcome for the patient is often not sufficiently. The transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) might improve the outcome of speech therapy in patients with severe
      aphasia. The patients will be randomized either to verum stimulation (group A) or sham
      stimulation (group B). In group A they will receive every workday for 6 weeks 20min of tDCS
      with 2 mA in combination with a 30 min speech therapy. In group B they will receive every
      workday for 6 weeks 20min of tDCS with 0 mA in combination with a 30 min speech therapy. The
      anodal electrode will be placed in case of a total anterior circulation stroke on the
      homologous speech area on the right hemisphere and in case of a partial anterior circulation
      stroke perilesional on the left hemisphere. The cathode will be positioned contralateral.
