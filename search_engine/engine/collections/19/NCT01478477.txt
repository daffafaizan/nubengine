      I. To assess the feasibility of evaluating joint symptoms in postmenopausal women with breast
      cancer randomized to n-3 PUFA (omega-3 fatty acid) vs. placebo supplementation using the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and endocrine subscale (FACT-ES),
      Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Stanford's Health Assessment -Disability Index (HAS) during
      the first 6 months of adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy.

      II. To preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of n-3 PUFA vs. placebo supplementation on AI
      induced joint symptoms.

      III. To explore blood and imaging based biomarkers (plasma and red blood cell [RBC] levels of
      n-3 PUFAs, inflammatory cytokines and receptors, and intra-articular tenosynovial
      inflammation by musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] imaging) of AI-induced joint
      symptoms in women on AI therapy randomized to n-3 PUFAs vs. placebo supplementation.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
