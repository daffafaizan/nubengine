      (one group of patients receiving the same treatment), open-label (all people involved know
      the identity of the intervention) study to evaluate tolerability of the combination therapy
      of JNS002 and bortezomib in 3 to 6 patients with multiple myeloma whose disease has either
      progressed after at least 1 line of prior therapy or was refractory to initial treatment.
      Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled and the incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will
      be determined at the end of Cycle 1 to evaluate the study doses against the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD). If the incidence is =2/3, additional 3 patients will be enrolled to define the
      MTD. Safety endpoints include adverse events, laboratory tests (hematology, blood
      biochemistry, and urinalysis), electrocardiogram (ECG), LVEF, chest X-ray, vital signs (body
      temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure), and body weight. Efficacy evaluation will be
      performed in terms of antitumor effect, according to criteria for assessment of antitumor
      effect similar to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.
      Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 by rapid (bolus) intravenous (IV) administration will be given on Days
      1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle. In addition, JNS002 30 mg/m2 by IV infusion will be
      given at a rate of = 1 mg/minute on Day 4 of every 21-day cycle after bortezomib. Treatment
      will continue for a total of 6 cycles of therapy (126 days).
