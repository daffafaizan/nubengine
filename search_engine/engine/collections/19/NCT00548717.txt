      however, our recent experience has demonstrated that the substitution of sirolimus for
      methotrexate provides superior GVHD control with reduced transplant-related toxicity. One
      limitation to the use of calcineurin inhibitors in GVHD prevention is the disruption in Treg
      function and proliferation. Based on our evolving understanding of the role of Treg in the
      development of chronic GVHD, we propose a GVHD prophylactic regimen that is effective in
      prevention of acute GVHD, but by virtue of the maintenance of Treg activity may be able to
      prevent chronic GVHD. We hypothesize that the substitution of mycophenolate mofetil for
      tacrolimus as well as the addition of bortezomib may provide similar protection against acute
      GVHD and prevent chronic GVHD while minimizing renal toxicity after transplantation.
