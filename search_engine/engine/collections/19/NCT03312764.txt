      above normal but below the threshold for diabetes. Previous studies have demonstrated that
      intensive lifestyle interventions targeting changes in diet, physical activity, sleep, and
      stress can reduce the risk of progressing from prediabetes to Type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes
      Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) currently recognizes both in-person and online programs
      that meet requirements to deliver approved curriculum, provide health coaching and group
      support, and equip participants with behavioral skills and self-monitoring tools to support
      behavior change. While non-randomized trial data demonstrate that an online digital program
      was successful for producing meaningful weight loss and improved glucose control, the goal of
      this randomized, controlled trial is to definitively evaluate the efficacy of the program for
      improving weight, glucose control and secondary risk factors compared to current standard
      care for prediabetes. In addition, few trials have examined the implementation factors that
      could speed the uptake of efficacious diabetes prevention interventions for delivery in
      regular clinical practice. Qualitative information on key organizational stakeholders (e.g.,
      physicians, office managers) will be gathered to provide information on perceptions of the
      online program characteristics, outcomes, and resources concurrently with strategies to
      promote adoption and implementation in health care settings.
