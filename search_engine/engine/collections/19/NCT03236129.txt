    
      This clinical trial is designed to demonstrate the benefit of Treg-depleted DLI as compared
      to the reference treatment of relapse in hematological malignancies after allogeneic HSCT
      which is currently based on standard DLI.

      Patients who have never shown any signs of GVHD and for which one (or more) unmanipulated DLI
      have been ineffective. Those patients will receive a subsequent DLI, which will be either
      unmanipulated (control arm) or Treg depleted (experimental arm) after a randomization. In
      both cases, the second DLI will be immediately preceded by a lymphodepleting treatment based
      on cyclophosphamide and fludarabine association.
