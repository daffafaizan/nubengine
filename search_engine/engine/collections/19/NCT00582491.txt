      inadequate sleep is the drug modafinil. Modafinil decreases subjective reports and objective
      measures of daytime sleepiness under conditions of sleep restriction, while enhancing
      cognitive performance. At the same time, sleep quality does not appear to be affected
      significantly. Interestingly, recent clinical trials in cocaine-dependent populations suggest
      that modafinil reduces the relapse to cocaine use, by unknown mechanisms.

      We propose to employ both subjective and objective measures of nocturnal sleep and daytime
      sleepiness, as well as measures of general cognitive performance and sleep-dependent memory
      consolidation, to explore potential mechanistic relationships between cocaine abstinence,
      EDS, and modafinil's efficacy in preventing cocaine relapse.

      The following specific aims are proposed:

      Specific Aim 1: To establish whether objective measures of poor nocturnal sleep (e.g.,
      reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency) that progressively characterize periods of
      sustained cocaine abstinence are also associated with objective evidence of excessive daytime
      sleepiness (EDS).

      Specific Aim 2: To establish the ability of modafinil to reverse the excessive daytime
      sleepiness (EDS) and deficits in cognitive performance that characterize cocaine abstinence.

      Specific Aim 3: To conduct a pilot study to determine whether the observed abnormalities in
      objective sleep, EDS, and/or cognitive function predict relapse to cocaine use and/or whether
      successful abstinence from cocaine is associated with normalization of the same.
