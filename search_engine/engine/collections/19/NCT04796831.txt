      and IV administration will be assessed in healthy male subjects. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the absolute oral bioavailability of quizartinib. Secondary
      objectives will include characterizing the plasma PK of quizartinib and radiolabeled
      quizartinib, major circulating metabolites, and total radioactivity after a single oral dose
      and IV administration. Safety and tolerability of quizartinib will also be assessed.
