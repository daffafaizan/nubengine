      spectral-domain or swept-source optical coherence tomography devices that enables
      non-invasive, dye-free, three dimensional analysis of the retinal vessels.

      Vessel density is a very important parameter almost in all retinal disorders. In the recent
      past, automated quantification software was built into some OCTA devices which can
      automatically calculate the retinal vessel density as well.

      In this study two semi-manual techniques are used in order to analyze the vessel density of
      healthy subjects' OCTA images. Vessel density is also measured with a new automated
      quantification program, and results of the three methods are compared.

      OCT machines are approved in the EU and the US and are not experimental devices.

      The device used in this study is the commercially available Zeiss Cirrus HD OCT Angioplex
      5000 that operates with spectral-domain technology.
