      control) and the capacity to anticipate, respond to, and learn from reward (reward
      processing) are key processes for human behavior. Dysfunction in these processes has been
      hypothesized to contribute to repetitive thoughts and behaviors in many disorders, including
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette Syndrome (TS), and eating disorders. The
      investigators will use multimodal imaging to investigate neural circuits that support
      cognitive control and reward processing, using pediatric OCD as a model system. The
      short-term goal is to clarify how circuit-based abnormalities contribute to repetitive
      thoughts/behaviors; these data will inform future trans-diagnostic studies. The long-term
      goal is to identify control and reward circuit-abnormalities as targets for new
      trans-diagnostic treatments.
