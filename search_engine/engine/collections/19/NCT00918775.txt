      I. To assess the 24-week progression free/relapse free survival rate in patients undergoing
      metastasectomy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS), relapse free survival (RFS) and overall
      survival (OS) in patients undergoing metastasectomy.

      II. To evaluate tissue determinants predictive for resectability, PFS and OS in patients
      undergoing metastasectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      After metastasectomy, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5 years.
