      characterized for inflammatory involvement of salivary and lacrimal glands.

      The xerostomia leads to low quality of life caused by dry sensations that can disturb the
      taste, the speaking, the swallow and chewing functions in the affected patients. The absent
      saliva can cause increase of dental caries and decays.

      Until now, there is no effective treatment that increases the amount of saliva and the
      patients have low improvements with cholinergic drugs such as pilocarpine and cevimeline.
      These drugs can cause unpleasant collateral effects.
