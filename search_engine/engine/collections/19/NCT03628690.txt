      laceration will be consented and randomized to treatment with suture or BandGrip. Subjects
      will be followed for 30 days post treatment to assess cosmetic quality of wound healing,
      evidence of adverse events related to closure method, and speed and completeness of wound
      closure and removal of closure devices.
