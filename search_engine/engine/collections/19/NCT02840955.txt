      randomized design. After standardization of corticosteroid treatment (triamcinolone acetonide
      0.1% cream), patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either treatment with Staphefekt
      SA.100 for 12 weeks or treatment with a placebo for 12 weeks. Topical corticosteroid use will
      be evaluated 2, 6, 12 and 20 weeks after start of the intervention. Swabs of the skin, nose
      and throat will be collected at baseline, week 2, 12 and 20.
