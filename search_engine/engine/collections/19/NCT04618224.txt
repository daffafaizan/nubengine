      (web Democritus Digital Acuity Reading Test - wDDART) based on the validated digital DDART.

      Specifically, present study aims to develop a new online reading test (wDDART) based on the
      corresponding digital DDART reading test for Windows and to evaluate the level of agreement
      between the two reading tests, as well as test-retest reliability of the online wDDART
      reading test.

      The first part of the study is the development of the online reading test, which will include
      the following new smart features:

        1. Automatic calculation of the reading time of each sentence (each logMAR)

        2. Automatic calculation of the basic reading parameters - RA, MRS, CPS, ACC - immediately
           after the completion of the examination

        3. Adjustment of the font size according to the size of the computer screen used for the
           examination

        4. Real time calculation of the patient-screen distance through a face detection system

      The second part of this study is the clinical validation of the online wDDART reading test.
      In this part, four reading parameters measured with the digital and the online version are
      compared. These parameters are the following:

        1. Reading Acuity (RA)

        2. Maximum Reading Speed (MRS)

        3. Critical Print Size (CPS)

        4. Accessibility Index (ACC) All the comparisons take place in two groups: a) a Normal
           Vision Group (NVG), and b) a Low Vision Group (LVG) in order to estimate the reading
           capacity in a population with a wide range of vision.
