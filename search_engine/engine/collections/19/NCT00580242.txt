      transplantation. Both lenalidomide and bortezomib have activity as single agents in patients
      with myelodysplasia. This study proposes using bortezomib in cohorts of 3-6 patients at the
      doses of 0.7, 1, and 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 to determine the MTD in combination
      withlenalidomide 10 mg a day, for 21 days of a 28 day treatment cycle. The planned bortezomib
      doses have been evaluated in previous Phase I clinical studies in similar patient populations
      and have been safe and well tolerated in a twice-weekly schedule of administration.
      Lenalidomide has been shown to have efficacy in myelodysplasia. The combination of
      lenalidomide and bortezomib has been used in patients with multiple myeloma.
