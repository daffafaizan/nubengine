    
      The first 50 patients enrolled into the study will be with investigators having prior ddC
      experience, specifically AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG), or non-ACTG investigators who are
      listed in ddC protocols NIAID ACTG 012, 112, 047, 050, 106 (N3447), 114 (N3300), 119 (N3492),
      N3226, or investigators at any ACTG center or ACTG satellite centers with knowledge of ddC
      therapy.

      Once all 50 patients have been entered and 25 have completed four weeks of treatment the
      study will be dependent upon receipt of completed case forms up to week #4 of treatment for
      the 25 patients who have been reviewed and evaluated for safety.

      Patients 51-200 may then be entered by any physician licensed in his or her state who has
      experience with AIDS patients and agrees to follow the patients as specified in the protocol.
      After all 200 have been entered and week #16 case report forms are returned to the ddC
      Coordinating Center and reviewed for safety for 100 of the 200 patients, the protocol would
      be open without limit on numbers of patients.
