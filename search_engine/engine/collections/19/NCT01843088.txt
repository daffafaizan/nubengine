      vehicle cream alone. In this parallel design, 170 runners who usually experience a pain level
      greater than 5/10 on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10 where zero is no pain and 10 is
      the worst pain ever, will be given a cream containing 25% mannitol to apply on one leg and
      the vehicle cream to apply on the other leg. The cream assignment will be randomized, and the
      runner, the person supplying the cream and the person inputting the data will be blinded as
      to which leg received which cream. Pain levels in each leg following the long run will be
      recorded, via an e-mail questionnaire, or, failing this, by telephone, the day of the run,
      and each day, for five days following the run. Mean and standard deviations for pain levels
      will be calculated for each treatment leg, and a repeated measures ANOVA (Analysis Of
      VAriance) will be done comparing the pain levels in each leg over the six days. Using this
      information, if the NRS (Numeric rating scale) pain levels differ by more than 1/10 between
      the two groups, a larger study will be conducted using the information gathered in this study
      to determine sample size.
