        2. Verify the germline mutation in blood relatives whose proband has known germline
           mutation(s).

        3. Analyze the test data with clinical and family information. Diagnose Lynch syndrome in
           the included population.

        4. Analyze the clinical characteristics and germline mutation of Lynch syndrome in Chinese
