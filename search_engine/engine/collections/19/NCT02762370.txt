      the pharmacodynamic effects on BG levels in type 2 diabetics following IA administration of
      32 mg FX006 compared to 40 mg TCA IR. The study was conducted in male and female patients ≥40
      years of age with OA of the knee and type 2 DM not managed by injectable agents. In order to
      be eligible for study participation, patients were to be treated with 1 or 2 oral agents and
      have hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels between 6.5%-9.0%.

      Approximately 36 patients were planned to be randomized and treated to ensure there were at
      least 30 evaluable patients (15 patients on FX006 and 15 patients on TCA IR). Patients were
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (1:1) and treated with a single IA injection of either:

        -  32 mg FX006 (18 patients) or

        -  40 mg TCA IR (18 patients)

      BG levels in each patient were evaluated for a total of 3 weeks (1 week prior to IA injection
      and 2 weeks post IA injection). After a screening visit, patients' BG levels were measured
      using a Dexcom Z4 Platinum Professional™ continuous glucose monitor (CGM) device, set to
      blinded mode, for up to 1 week pre-injection and for 2 weeks post injection using the same
      blinded CGM device. Patients also were provided with a Bayer Contour™ standard glucose
      measuring meter in order to perform the necessary calibrations per the manufacturer's
      recommendations. A final safety visit was planned at 6 weeks post-injection.
