    
      Objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of blood storage age on resolution of lactic
      acidosis in children with severe malarial anemia.

      Methods:

      Children aged 6 - 59 months admitted to ACU with Severe Malarial Anemia (Hb <5g/dl) and
      Lactic Acidosis (blood lactate >5 mmol /l), will be randomly assigned to receive either blood
      of shorter storage age (<10 days) or longer storage age (21 -35 days) by gravity infusion as
      is the routine practice. 37 patients will be enrolled in each study arm. Physiological
      measurements namely blood lactate, oxygen saturation, Hemoglobin, Blood pressure, respiratory
      rate and pulse rate will be taken at baseline, during and after transfusion. The two groups
      will be compared. The primary outcome variable will be the proportion of children whose
      lactic acidosis resolves after 4 hrs of transfusion. 24hr mortality will be our secondary
      outcome.
