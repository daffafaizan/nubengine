      aggressive form of an Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia (IIP). Within the eurIPFreg we, the
      eurIPFreg steering committee and a growing number of external site investigators, aim to
      describe the natural course of IPF and other IIPs, to identify risk factors that are
      associated with the evolution of the disease and to sample biomaterials that may serve as
      underlying basis for translational research activities.

      IPF and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), as well as the other entities of IIPs
      (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, COP; desquamative interstitial pneumonia, DIP; respiratory
      bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease, RB-ILD; lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, LIP; acute
      interstitial pneumonia, AIP) are frequently progressive, fibroproliferative diseases of
      unknown etiology, affecting the lung parenchyma. Patients with IPF have the most devastating
      prognosis within the group of IIPs, with a median survival rate of 2-3 years.
