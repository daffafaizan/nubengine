      contrasting along with implementation intentions influence intentions and behaviors related
      to weight loss (eating healthy and exercise), actual weight loss, as well as potential
      reasons (i.e., mediators) why these changes may occur (e.g., social support, changes in
      beliefs about weight loss, confidence in being able to eat healthy and diet). In mental
      contrasting procedures, people first imagine a desired future (e.g., eating healthy) and then
      reflect on the current negative reality (e.g., I snack too much). This process makes people
      aware of changes needed in the present to obtain future positive outcomes, and thus aids in
      increasing goal commitment and goal pursuit. In implementation intention procedures,
      individuals form "if-then" statements about how they will enact their goals in their everyday
      lives. Implementation intentions are highly effective at helping individuals achieve health
      behavior change. Recent studies suggest that the combined use of mental contrasting and
      implementation intentions produce more behavior change than either technique alone (e.g.,
      diet) In this study, investigators test whether these procedures vary in their effectiveness
      when couple members are instructed to focus on themselves versus the relationship, the latter
      intended to instill a communal coping mindset (i.e., that losing weight is an issue that
      needs to be addressed as a couple enacted through mutually cooperative behaviors).
