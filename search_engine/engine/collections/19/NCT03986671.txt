      technique for detecting neuromuscular (NM) impairment. This study will assess whether, in
      healthy volunteers and participants with known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other NM
      diseases involving the oropharynx, the same characteristic motor unit potentials obtained on
      conventional needle EMG (NEMG) can be obtained using a TM-EMG sensor. The purpose of this
      study is to demonstrate whether the TM-EMG sensor can provide the same diagnostic accuracy as
      the concentric needle electrode for the diagnosis of NM diseases. Having demonstrated
      diagnostic similarity of TM-EMG to NEMG, the secondary aim of this study is to confirm that
      NM disturbance of oropharyngeal striated muscles in participants with OSA can be elicited
      with the TM-EMG sensor.
