      cycles (duration treatment with ICP-105), and a follow-up period (within 30 days of the last
      dose and post-treatment follow-up 30 days after the last visit). The recruited patients
      receive a single dose on day 1, then after a 3-day washout period, multiple dosing will be
      initiated following dose-escalation schedule. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment
      period consisted of Cycle 0 (single dose and washout period) and Cycle 1 (28-day cycle).
