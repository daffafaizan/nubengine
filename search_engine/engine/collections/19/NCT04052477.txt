        1. 9 subjects were recruited. After patients agreement, computer scientists were accessing
           to patient social network profile. Computer scientists were not able to visualize the
           content of publications, just run the algorithm that will analyse the content of
           messages (text, frequency, emoticonsâ€¦)

           The algorithm defines the 3 most at-risk periods of suicide behaviors, on the next
           month. This result were compared to periods found by psychiatric interview. The
           psychiatrist then confirmed or not to LIRM whether periods found by the algorithm
           conrrespond to those defined by the psychitrist. No data of the social network were
           collected.

        2. the 2nd step aim to improve the algorithm by collecting sociodemographic and clincal
           data related to patients included.
