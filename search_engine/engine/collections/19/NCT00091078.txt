      I. To determine the efficacy of G3139 (bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide) plus imatinib
      mesylate in GIST patients with limited or generalized progression after therapy with
      imatinib.

      II. To assess the safety of G3139 plus imatinib mesylate in GIST patients with limited or
      generalized progression after therapy with imatinib.

      III. To determine whether expression of BCL-2 correlates with survival, time to progression
      or response rate in patients with GIST treated with G3139 plus imatinib.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to extent of disease
      progression (limited vs generalized).

      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-14. Patients also receive oral imatinib
      mesylate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients (48 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
