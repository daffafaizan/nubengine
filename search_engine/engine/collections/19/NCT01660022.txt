    
      Placebo-controlled, double-blind, five-cohort, 2-period (per cohort) dose-escalation study.

      For each subject, the study included a screening evaluation (within 21 days of the 1st dose),
      dosing on 2 separate occasions (Period 1 and Period 2) and a follow-up visit (6 weeks
      following the final dose).

      Within each cohort, subjects were randomised into two sequences to receive OZ439 in Period 1
      and OZ439 plus piperaquine in Period 2 (sequence 1, 8 subjects) or OZ439-matching placebo in
      Period 1 and OZ439/piperaquine matching placebos in Period 2 (sequence 2, 4 subjects).

      Safety and tolerability were evaluated: Physical examination, ECG assessments including a
      full baseline matched profile of ECG tracings, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, in
      particular liver function tests and adverse events.
