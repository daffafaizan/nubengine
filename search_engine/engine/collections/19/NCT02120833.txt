    
      This is a multi-center, two-arm clinical trial in participants aged 2 - 35 months with mild
      to moderate Atopic Dermatitis (AD) as determined by the study physician. A sufficient number
      of participants will be enrolled in this study to yield 40 participants who complete the
      trial, 30 in the investigational product group and 10 in the active control group.

      The investigational and control (EpiCeramÂ®) products will be used topically. Participant
      caregivers will be instructed to gently massage the assigned product into the participant's
      skin. The treatments will be applied at least 2 times per day on all body areas, including
      areas of the body and face affected by AD. No product should be applied within 4 hours of a
      site visit. These treatments will be used in place of the participant's current moisturizers
      and/or emollients.

      Diaries will be completed by the participants' caregivers each day, beginning upon initiation
      of therapy and continuing until trial completion/discontinuation, and will include
      information on product application and use of rescue medication.

      All participants will visit the clinical site for assessments at baseline (Day 0) and on Days
      1, 2, 3, 7 and 14. Clinical assessments include the Eczema Area and Severity index (EASI) and
      Investigator's Global Atopic Dermatitis Assessment (IGADA). Instrumental assessment of
      hydration will be done using a Corneometer (Courage & Khazaka, Germany). Caregivers will also
      complete a questionnaire to assess product experience. The final visit will occur on Day 14
      or on the day of participant withdrawal from the trial.
