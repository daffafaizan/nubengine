      medication Ondansetron is used in the emergency department and after surgery for this
      purpose. Inhaled isopropyl alcohol has been successfully used to decrease nausea and vomiting
      after surgery. No trial has compared inhaled isopropyl alcohol to Ondansetron in a clinical
      trial.

      The author proposes to prospectively investigate extension of the established antiemetic
      efficacy of inhaled isopropyl alcohol for undifferentiated nausea in Emergency Department
      patients to the 30-minute post-intervention point that has been reported to be the frequent
      juncture of symptom relief. By introducing prolonged intervention, and re-dosing of
      established benefit, into this research, the author aims to reproduce the sustained
      antiemetic efficacy of inhaled isopropyl alcohol for undifferentiated nausea as demonstrated
      for post-operative nausea and vomiting.
