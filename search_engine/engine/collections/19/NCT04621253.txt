      enzymes responsible for the metabolism have not been identified yet (except for the
      acetylation of 4-aminoantipyrine). Former investigations delivered mixed results and the
      question of the participation of the hepatic cytochrome p450 enzymes could not been answered.

      Thus, a double-blind randomized cross over clinical phase I study with healthy, male,
      caucasian volunteers was conducted. After giving consent for participation and enrolment, the
      subjects were treated for 3 days with either one inhibitor (either ciprofloxacin, CYP1A2
      inhibitor, or fluconazole, strong CYP2C9 and moderate CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor) or
      placebo. The doses were 750 mg ciprofloxacin twice daily for 3 days and in the morning of the
      study day or 400 mg fluconazole loading dose with consecutive 200 mg fluconazole once daily.
      For the study day, the subject were invited to the study center and a venous access was
      placed on the non-dominant arm. The last dose of either inhibitor or placebo was taken 1h
      prior to a single dose of 1000 mg metamizole. Blood samples were drawn at t: 0h, 0.25h, 0.5h,
      0.75h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h and 24h. The blood samples were centrifuged, the plasma
      was isolated and frozen at -20Â°C. All subjects received both inhibitors and placebo
      treatment, attending to a total of 3 study days. Furthermore, the genotype for CYP1A2,
      CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 was assessed.

      Plasma samples will be analyzed and the concentrations of the main metabolites of metamizole
      and the inhibitors will be measured. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as maximal
      concentration, half life, time to reach maximal concentration and the area under the curve
      will be assessed and compared.
