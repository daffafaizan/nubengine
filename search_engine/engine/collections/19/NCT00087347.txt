      Primary

        -  Determine the range of optimal timing for magnetic resonance imaging of lymph nodes
           after administration of ferumoxytol, in terms of assessing signal intensity using
           pre-defined pulse sequences in regions of interest and visual criteria, in patients with
           primary prostate or breast cancer who are scheduled to undergo surgical lymph node
           dissection or sampling.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate MRI signal intensity with histological findings in patients undergoing this
           procedure.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients undergo a baseline MRI. Within 24 hours after the baseline MRI, patients receive
      ferumoxytol IV over 10-15 seconds (or over 1 hour). Patients then undergo MRI immediately
      after ferumoxytol administration (at the discretion of the principal investigator) and then
      at 24-28 hours.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-14 patients (6-8 with prostate cancer and 4-6 with breast
      cancer) will be accrued for this study.
