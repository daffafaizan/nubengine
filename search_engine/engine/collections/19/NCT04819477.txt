      most frequently diagnosed worldwide and has the highest mortality among malignancies. To
      date, no screening method has been able to establish itself as routinely recommended by the
      guidelines. In the recently published Dutch-Belgian NELSON study on low dose thoracic CT as a
      screening method in high-risk patients (smokers and ex-smokers), an - albeit small -
      reduction in mortality was shown in the screening group vs. the control group).

      A prerequisite for a detailed information of the patient about the implementation as well as
      the advantages and disadvantages of screening is that the physician has risk competence and
      knows and is able to interpret the screening data. The use of a fact box can be used to
      improve knowledge of statistical data.

      In this prospective study with 1:1 randomized questioning using an Internet tool, physicians
      will be asked in 2 phases (before and after intervention with a fact box) about their
      assessment of the benefits and risks of lung cancer screening by thoracic computed tomography
      and about a potential intention to change referral behavior. Randomly assigned, half of the
      participants will receive the same information in addition to the fact box graphically
      presented as a Cates plot.
