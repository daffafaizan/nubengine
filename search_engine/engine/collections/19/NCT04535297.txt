      and rehabilitative care to maintain daily function and health. These are important aspects of
      self-management. However, this was challenged by the social distancing due to COVID-19, which
      limited participation in regular routines.

      The study objectives were: To (1) describe the effects of the COVID-19 social distancing on
      function, health and well-being of patients with Parkinson's disease or post-stroke, and (2)
      test the association between the patient activation level and these effects.

      Community-living patients with Parkinson's disease or post-stroke were invited to answer an
      anonymous survey through social media and patient associations. Part 1 included 27
      multiple-choice questions regarding current status and changes in function, health, medical
      care and well-being. Part 2 consisted of the Patient Activation Measure, describing people's
      knowledge, skill, and confidence in managing their own health.
