      decreased long-term survival.

      Several experimental and animal studies have showed cytoprotective, preconditioning and
      anti-apoptotic effects of high dose erythropoietin. Clinical studies in human have also
      suggested that high dose erythropoietin has preconditioning effects against injury after
      ischemia and reperfusion on different organs in human, such as brain, heart, liver, and
      kidneys.

      Administration of Epo in high doses in conjunction with cardiac surgery has shown to be safe
      with no direct side-effects.

      The investigators therefore hypothesize that a preconditioning effect of erythropoietin
      before cardiac surgery can reduce the level of renal dysfunction after surgery in a group
      with preoperative renal impairment.
