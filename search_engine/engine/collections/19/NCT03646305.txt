      weight. Even in the absence of disordered eating, high levels of body dissatisfaction
      prospectively predict depression and low self-esteem in young women. Common intervention
      strategies, such as challenging the validity of negative body-related thoughts, often have
      limited success. Recent research suggests that accepting, rather than challenging, negative
      body-related thoughts may reduce body image distress by changing the relationship with those
      thoughts. For example, continually repeating or even singing an unwanted thought has been
      shown to reduce the believability and discomfort associated with that thought, through a
      technique known as cognitive defusion. The current study aims to extend the literature on
      cognitive defusion and test its effectiveness in the treatment of body dissatisfaction. In a
      randomized controlled trial design, 122 female restrained eaters were randomly assigned to
      practice either 1) verbally repeating negative body-related thoughts, 2) singing negative
      body-related thoughts, 3) verbally repeating body-unrelated thoughts (control), or 4) singing
      body-unrelated thoughts (control). The goal of this study was to determine whether singing
      one's negative body-related thoughts could lead to greater changes in perception of the
      thought, body image satisfaction, mood, and self-esteem relative to a control condition when
      practiced twice daily for one week.
