      contributes to disability and reduced quality of life, and is insufficiently relived by
      currently available therapies. Adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) is
      increasingly recognized as an easily accessible source of regenerative cells with therapeutic
      potential in ischaemic or autoimmune disease. The investigators aimed to measure for the
      first time the safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy of autologous SVF cells local
      injections in patients with SSc with hand disability.
