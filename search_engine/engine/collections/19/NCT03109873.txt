      I. To assess the capacity of metformin hydrochloride (metformin) to alter the cytokine and
      exosome profiles.

      II. To assess the capacity of metformin to mitigate known side effects of external beam
      radiation therapy including inflammation, mucositis, dysphagia, xerostomia, and fatigue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
