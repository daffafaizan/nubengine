        -  Estimate failure free survival, overall survival, and response in patients with residual
           or recurrent/progressive aggressive meningeal tumors (malignant meningioma,
           hemangiopericytoma, and primary nervous system sarcoma) treated with ifosfamide.

        -  Evaluate toxicities of ifosfamide in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive ifosfamide IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3 of each 21
      day treatment course. Patients are evaluated for response/progression after every 2 courses.
      Patients with stable disease receive up to 8 courses of therapy. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
