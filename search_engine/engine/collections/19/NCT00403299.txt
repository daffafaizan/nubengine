      major cause of graft failure and death in this group of patients. Therefore, heart
      transplanted patients have their coronary arteries examined annually. At present this is
      being done with coronary angiography. Recent development of the computed tomography (CT)
      technology has made it possible to examine the coronary arteries with CT angiography (CTA),
      which is a non-invasive method. The goal of the study is to validate CTA against coronary
      angiography.

      Coronary artery disease lesions in heart transplanted patients differ from CAD lesions in
      native hearts. HTx patients develop diffuse intimal thickening affecting the whole length of
      the vessel starting in the periphery. These lesions specific to HTx patients are not depicted
      on coronary angiography. The second aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of CTA
      depicting such lesions with the gold-standard, intravascular ultrasound.

      The third aim of this study is to study the association between different inflammatory
      markers and the development of CAD specific to heart transplanted patients.
