      preoperative exercise (i.e. prehabilitation) program in 40 up to sedentary older adults (i.e.
      age 60 and over) undergoing abdominal, urologic or gynecologic surgery under the Enhanced
      Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol at Duke, using a variety of techniques to measure the
      possible effect of this intervention. Study patients will undergo a program of
      prehabilitation exercise for 6 days per week prescribed for them by an exercise physiologist,
      for up to 4 weeks prior to surgery. Study participants will undergo four types of
      assessments: Functional/Cognitive testing; Blood/CSF samples and Muscle biopsies; Brain
      Imaging; and Brain Activity Recording. Clinical Outcomes will also be obtained from the Duke
      electronic medical record system. The risks of the exercise intervention are generally mild,
      since moderate exercise in this patient population generally results in improved health
      outcomes. Data from these patients will be analyzed in comparison to propensity matched
      patients from the Duke Markers of Alzheimer's Disease and neurocognitive Outcomes after
      Perioperative Care (MADCO-PC) study who did not undergo this prehabilitation exercise
      intervention. Taken together, the results of this study will allow the investigators to
      estimate the possible effect of prehabilitation exercise on multiple domains of postoperative
      recovery (cognition, brain connectivity, biomarkers, brain activity, etc) and will provide
      important preliminary data and will help design future more definitive studies to test these
      hypotheses.
