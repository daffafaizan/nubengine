      degree of satisfaction of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for managing oral
      self-biting injuries. Thirty-one patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosed in the
      ALS Functional Unit at Bellvitge University Hospital will participate in this randomized
      crossover trial. Two devices will be prepared for each patient, a hard occlusal splint (HOS)
      and a flexible customized mouthguard (FCM). They will wear one type of device for the first
      two weeks, followed by a week off, and the other type of device for the fourth and fifth
      week. The sequence will be randomized to obtain one-half of the participants starting the
      first week wearing the HOS, and the other half wearing the FCM. The participants will rate
      the degree of satisfaction with the device in a 10-point scale, considering 0 extremely
      dissatisfied and 10 completely satisfied, and the degree of improvement or worsening of oral
      self-biting injuries, considering 0 an extreme worsening and 10 completely improved. They
      will also rate the degree of change in their quality of life (nothing, a bit, quite, a lot)
      because of changes in their oral self-biting injuries. Finally they will rate the compliance
      as the percentage of time the device was used with respect to the recommended time and report
      the adverse effects (excessive salivation, dry mouth, tooth pain, mucosal irritation,
      temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, TMJ sounds, bite change, other).
