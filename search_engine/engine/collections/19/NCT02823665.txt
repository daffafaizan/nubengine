    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the weight-independent effects of gastric bypass
      surgery and sleeve gastrectomy surgery on islet cell response after meal ingestion as
      mediated by hormonal and neural components of the gut. It will also address the differences
      between the two procedures.

      Such information will be critical for the development of novel approaches for treatment of
      diabetes as well as improvement of glycemic effects of gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy
      in patients with partial diabetes remission or relapse after complete remission.
