      or no hepatic impairment who have failed other antineoplastic therapies or for whom there is
      no standard therapy. The study will be conducted in two stages. Stage I will include patients
      with moderate hepatic impairment and Stage II will include patients with severe hepatic
      impairment. An analysis of data from the Stage I portion of the study will be performed to
      decide whether to enroll patients in the Stage II portion of the study. Patients with hepatic
      impairment (either moderate or severe) will be paired with matched control patients with
      normal hepatic function, matched on gender, age, and body surface are (BSA). Patients will
      receive a single dose of pixantrone on day 1 of a 21 day cycle. Blood samples will be
      obtained at various time points during the first week of the first cycle for pharmacokinetic
      (PK) analysis. If any patient with hepatic impairment develops a dose limiting toxicity,
      subsequent patients will be administered a lower dose of pixantrone. If any patient with
      hepatic impairment who is receiving the reduced dose of pixantrone experiences a dose
      limiting toxicity, the study will be terminated. Patients who demonstrate any clinical,
      radiologic, or other evidence of response or stabilization after the initial dose of
      pixantrone and who wish to continue treatment may do so at the discretion of the
      Investigator. Patients receiving additional cycles will be treated with pixantrone every 21
      days for up to 5 additional cycles and will be followed for safety only, until 30 days after
      the last dose.
