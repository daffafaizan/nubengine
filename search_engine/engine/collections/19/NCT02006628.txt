    
      This eight-week (six-week treatment period and two-week follow-up), multi-centre,
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study aimed to determine the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of GWP42003 in participants with schizophrenia or a related
      psychotic disorder.

      Eligible participants entered the study at a Screening and Randomization Visit (Day 1), where
      eligibility was established. Once all inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed,
      participants were randomized to receive either GWP42003 or placebo in conjunction with their
      prescribed anti-psychotic medications and began treatment on Day 1 as instructed. Assessments
      were performed on Days 8, 22, and 43. A safety follow-up visit was conducted on Day 57.
