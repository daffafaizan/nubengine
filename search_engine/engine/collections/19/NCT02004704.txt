      first, unless the patient decides to enter another olipudase alfa clinical trial within the
      9-year period prior to marketing approval. If marketing approval was not available, extension
      of follow up beyond 9 years would be considered with sponsor's and health authorities'
      approval.

      This study is an extension study for patients who have completed a previous study with
      olipudase alfa (DFI13803 for pediatric patients and DFI13412 for adult patients).
