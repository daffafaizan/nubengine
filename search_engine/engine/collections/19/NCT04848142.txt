    
      A mixed methods approach, including questionnaires and qualitative interviews with children
      and their parents. Participants ("Primary Strata:" parents (i.e., guardians/caregivers) and
      children age ≥ 8 years, n=132; "Parent Only Strata:" parents of children age < 8 years, n=66)
      will complete questionnaires to examine the impact of germline variant disclosure on parent
      adjustment, parenting, and child adjustment. Optional qualitative interviews may be completed
      individually for participants (age ≥ 12 years, n=30) with P/LP variants (and who are aware of
      their result status) and their parents (n=30) to obtain more open-ended information about the
      impact of genetic testing result disclosure, family communication about testing results, and
      their perception of result implications.
