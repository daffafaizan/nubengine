      States. Because HCC generally develops in patients with underlying liver disease, resection
      is often not possible. Liver transplant improves survival for HCC patients but given the
      national organ donor shortage often patients have to wait a considerable time for transplant.
      Liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) remain important tools to
      control tumor growth and to potentially "bridge" patients to liver transplant. However,
      liver-directed therapies for HCC tumors greater than 3cm in size are suboptimal, leaving a
      critical unmet need.

      Antiangiogenic systemic agents, such as oral sorafenib, reduce tumor blood flow and have been
      shown to improve RFA efficacy in animal and in computer models.
