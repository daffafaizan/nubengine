      outcome of unselected patients in real-life practice, is crucial to evaluate and improve the
      quality of care for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC).

      The purpose of CRISP is to set up a national clinical research platform to document uniform
      data on the molecular testing, treatment, course of disease in patients with NSCLC or SCLC. A
      particular focus is on molecular biomarker testing before the start of first-line treatment
      of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The data shall be used to assess the current
      state of care and to develop recommendations concerning topics that could be improved.

      PRO assessment will provide large-scale data on quality of life and anxiety/depression for
      real-life patients with NSCLC or SCLC in routine practice. In addition, two questionnaires
      (concerning individual quality of life and patient-caregiver communication) will be validated
      in German patients with metastatic NSCLC.

      Furthermore, CRISP will set up a decentralized clinically annotated tissue repository for
      future collaborative, investigational scientific biomarker testing.
