      dysfunction, increased sympathetic activation and increased cardiovascular risk. The standard
      treatment paradigm is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), however, patient adherence
      to CPAP is variable. It is unclear to what extent that poor adherence to CPAP therapy
      augments vascular endothelial function and reduces cardiovascular risk compared to excellent
      adherence. The main aim of this research is to investigate vascular endothelial function in
      OSA patients who are poorly-adherent to CPAP therapy. Nitric oxide (NO)-mediated,
      endothelium-dependent macrovascular and microvascular function (by brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilatation and forearm cutaneous thermal hyperaemia, respectively) and
      generalised microvascular function (by post-occlusion reactive hyperaemia) will be assessed
      in three obese OSA patient populations (high-adherence (n=20); low adherence (n=20); and,
      untreated (n=20)) and age-/BMI-matched OSA-free controls. We will also assess body
      composition, cardiovascular risk, lipid status and functional capacity. This research will
      evaluate treatment efficacy in patients who are poorly-adherent to CPAP treatment and could
      identify whether an alternative approach to their care should be explored.
