      sedative drugs (opioids and benzodiazepines) in children undergoing cardiac surgery, reduces
      the side effects of the drugs themselves, such as respiratory depression (reduction of
      mechanical ventilation) and the onset of withdrawal symptoms while maintaining an adequate
      analgo-sedation.

      The study is an unblinded randomized controlled study. It will involve 60 children aged > 1
      and < 24 months sedated and mechanically ventilated after corrective or palliative surgery of
      congenital heart disease on cardiopulmonary bypass with Aristotle score > 8.

      Dexmedetomidine infusion will be started upon arrival in the CICU and continued until the
      time of discontinuation of morphine.
