    
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled Ⅲ period clinical trials.A
      total of 600 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer assessed by imaging and serum
      CA125≥35 U/mL were randomly assigned according to the ratio of 1:1 (300 cases: 300 cases)
      between the direct surgical resection group and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, to
      observe the efficacy and safety of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer with elevated
      serum CA125 with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant
      chemotherapy can use albumin-binding paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine (AG) regimen or
      mFOLFirinox (5-FU, calcium leucofolate [LV], irinotecan, oxaliplatin) regimen. AG regimen was
      given on day 1, 8, 15, and repeated every 4 weeks.The mFOLFIRINOX regimen was administered on
      days 1 and 15 and repeated every 4 weeks.Patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group were
      treated with 4 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (AG regimen or mFOLFIRINOX regimen)
      immediately after the pathologic diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was confirmed by
      puncture.Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy will undergo surgical exploration to
      assess the resectability of the tumor.Four to eight weeks after radical resection, the
      patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy from the recovery of surgical trauma. The
      choice of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery depended on the response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.If neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective, adjuvant chemotherapy will maintain
      the original regimen;If neoadjuvant chemotherapy is ineffective but radical surgery is still
      feasible, adjuvant chemotherapy will be used with a crossover regimen.Neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy group received adjuvant chemotherapy for 2 courses.In the direct surgical
      resection group, 6 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy were started 4 to 8 weeks after radical
      resection.Relevant examinations should be conducted before and after each course of
      medication to evaluate safety events. Imaging reexaminations should be conducted every 2
      courses of medication, and imaging reexaminations should be conducted every 3 months during
      follow-up to evaluate disease recurrence.
