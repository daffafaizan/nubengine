      1 mm. A level of -450 Hounsfield units and a width of 1000 Hounsfield units were used for
      bronchial window settings.

      The length of right and left main bronchus will be measured from the tracheal bifurcation to
      the point of their first branches, respectively, in both 2D- and 3D-CT images. The
      anteroposterior angulation of right upper lobar bronchus will be measured from the axial
      2D-images by the angle between the horizontal midline of the right main bronchus and the
      center of the RUL orifice which indicates the origin of the RUL bronchus in which the right
      upper lobar bronchus shows maximal diameter.
