    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Investigate the curative potential of high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide,
      and carboplatin followed by autologous stem cell rescue in women with breast cancer
      considered incurable by conventional therapy. II. Observe the overall response rate, survival
      rate, and toxicity associated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Prior to therapy, patients undergo collection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)
      on another protocol; patients with marrow involvement undergo PBSC harvest only, while all
      others may also undergo bone marrow harvest. All patients receive cyclophosphamide,
      etoposide, and carboplatin over 4 consecutive days, followed 3 days later by PBSC or bone
      marrow and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Patients are followed for duration of
      remission and survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 100-200 patients will be entered.
