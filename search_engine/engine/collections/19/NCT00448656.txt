      disease, rhythm control is unsuccessful in almost half of patients, also in patients with
      lone atrial fibrillation.If patients remain highly symptomatic, a non-pharmacological
      approach may be considered including pulmonary vein isolation and Cox maze III surgery. Maze
      III surgery has high succes rates, however it includes major cardiac surgery with substantial
      risk of complications. New surgical strategies for symptomatic lone atrial fibrillation focus
      on minimal invasive off-pump procedures omitting cardiopulmonary bypass (and thus lowering
      the complication rate), while taking advantage of an easier approach to the ablation site and
      a shorter procedure time. Epicardial surgical ablation isolating pulmonary veins by high
      intensity focused ultrasound performed off-pump by Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS)may
      be a promising treatment option. In this pilot study, we aim to study the feasibility of this
      new surgical ablation approach in patients with lone atrial fibrillation.
