      disorder (AUD) and who are enrolled in Aware Recovery Care's In-Home Addiction Treatment
      program where Care Teams will monitor cloud-based breathalyzer results. Soberlink's
      cloud-based breathalyzer system will provide data to Care Team if the Client has relapsed or
      is not compliant with testing through the Soberlink System. Clients will use Soberlink for
      180 days within context of routine alcohol use disorder treatment at Aware Recovery Care.
