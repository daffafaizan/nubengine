      preliminary efficacy of attenuated MV-NIS virus after neoadjuvant intravesical administration
      prior to RC in patients with UC who are ineligible for current neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      We will use a novel adaptive trial design that varies the time between TURBT, virus
      administration and RC. Currently, intravesical administration of BCG is delayed four to six
      weeks after TURBT to reduce the likelihood of systemic BCG absorption and BCG sepsis. Given
      this clinical safety precedent, we propose initial patients be treated within one week of RC
      to maximize the time between TURBT and MV-NIS administration. Subsequent patients will be
      treated earlier before RC (up to 29 days prior), thereby reducing the interval between TURBT
      and virus administration to maximize the treatment duration before RC. An expansion cohort
      will also be used to test the feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of two repeat MV-NIS
      doses prior to RC. MV-NIS has been proven safe at a dose of 1x1011 TCID50 intravenously in
      patients lacking MV immunity (Russell 2014), which allays concern for systemic toxicity after
      intravesical administration even if post-TURBT administration results in systemic MV-NIS
      absorption. Pathologic downstaging and CR (assessed by T0 rate) at surgery are secondary
      endpoints, designed to give an early indication of efficacy potential. This will facilitate
      future virotherapy strategies targeting replicative tumor destruction and stimulation of
      systemic anti-tumor immunity as possible strategies for neoadjuvant and bladder-sparing
      therapy.
