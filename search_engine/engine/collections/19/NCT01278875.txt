      atherosclerosis. These effects include cellular cholesterol efflux, anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant effects, increase in nitric acid (NO) production from vascular endothelial cells
      and differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells for repair at sites of vascular injury.
      The measurement of the cholesterol mass within HDL (HDL-C) does not provide an adequate
      measure of HDL function. The investigators therefore propose to test and validate biomarkers
      of HDL function in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

      Hypothesis: HDL lose their cardiovascular protective functions in ACS. The investigators
      hypothesize that these changes are transient and partly normalize within 12 weeks. In this
      proposal, the investigators will examine the function of HDL in acute coronary syndromes
      (ACS) and 12 weeks later, in the recovery phase. Acute coronary syndromes are characterized
      by an acute inflammatory reaction, a marked decrease in HDL in plasma and a shift of the HDL
      proteome to an inflammatory phenotype.
