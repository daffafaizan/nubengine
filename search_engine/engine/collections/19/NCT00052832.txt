        -  Determine the response rate of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic
           myelomonocytic leukemia treated with doxercalciferol.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral doxercalciferol daily for 12 weeks. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 41 patients will be accrued for this study.
