      help to know if pembrolizumab is working. This CT scan (called Texture Analysis) looks at the
      tumour in fine detail. The use of this type of CT scan has not been studied in patients with
      metastatic melanoma. Investigators want to see if this CT scan will show if some patients
      being treated with pembrolizumab respond better than others.

      One of the other purposes is to compare the costs within this trial to costs of the standard
      of care.
