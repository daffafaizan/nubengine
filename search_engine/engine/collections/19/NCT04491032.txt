      technique that provides excellent peri-operative analgesia in children. Unfused sacral hiatus
      allows for easy and safe access into the epidural space. Anatomically, injection of a certain
      volume of fluid over the dural sac inside the closed spinal canal can push the cerebrospinal
      fluid cranially. This push may lead to increased intracranial pressure. We will measure two
      findings affected by intracranial pressure (optic nerve sheath diameter and cerebral
      oxygenation) and compare the effects of two different volumes of caudal injections on these
      measures.

      Children with closed fontanelles and scheduled to undergo elective surgery, for which caudal
      anesthesia is an effective method for peri-operative analgesia, will be recruited for this
      study. Injection volume will be determined depending on the level of analgesia required for
      the surgical procedure. Ultrasonographic measurements of optic nerve sheath diameter and
      near-infrared spectrometry measurement of cerebral oxygenation will be taken before and after
      caudal anesthesia.
