      bloodless operative field and so less intra-operative blood lossIt has been reported that
      using the lowest effective inflation pressure minimize tourniquet induced nerve injury .).
      Limb occlusion pressure (LOP) and arterial occlusion pressure (AOP) are the terms that mean
      the lowest tourniquet pressure required to stop the arterial blood flow into the limb distal
      to the cuff. LOP can be determined manually or automatically by slow cuff inflation until
      disapper of pulsation with Doppler flowmeter or pulse oximeter .AOP can be estimated by a
      formula (AOP = [SBP + 10]/KTP) using patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) and tissue
      padding coefficient (KTP) values. In both methods, addition of a safety margin to LOP or AOP
      is recommended for potential hemodynamic fluctuations during surgery
