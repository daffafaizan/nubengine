      functional abilities of an individual by causing irreversible brain damage and potentiates
      the risk of mortality. Apart from a number of medical conditions causing brain oedema,
      evidence suggests the association of various drugs with brain oedema. Therefore, this study
      aims to provide a comprehensive disproportionality analysis of the drug-induced brain oedema
      reports in the FAERS database.
