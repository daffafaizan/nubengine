      like Sevoflurane have some muscle relaxation effect by depressing the spinal motor neurons.
      Inhalational anaesthetics also alter the tonic input received from descending modulatory
      systems from the brain. Deep anaesthesia with inhalational agents may cause some degree of
      neuromuscular blockade.
