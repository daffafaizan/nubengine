      approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in chemotherapy
      induced neutropenia in 1991 under the trade name NeupogenÂ®. Filgrastim was first approved in
      the EU in Germany in 2001 under the same trade name. Filgrastim is a non glycosylated
      protein, produced in E. coli bacteria transfected with rhG-CSF copy deoxyribonucleic acid
      (cDNA). Filgrastim differs from native human G CSF only in the addition of an N terminal
      methionine required for expression in a bacterial host. In 2002, a pegylated filgrastim with
      extended duration of action relative to the naked filgrastim was approved by the FDA and the
      EU Commission under the trade name Neulasta.

      AviGenics has generated transgenic hens carrying rhG CSF cDNA, which express a glycosylated
      form of rhG-CSF protein in their egg white. The purified rhG-CSF is biologically active, as
      assessed by its in vitro binding and cell proliferation activities, and has been fully
      characterized by AviGenics. AviGenics intends to develop this product to treat
      chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

      The overall goal of this study is to assess dose response, efficacy, and safety of three
      different dose levels of AVI-014 (G-CSF) in breast cancer patients at high (>20%) risk for
      chemotherapy induced severe neutropenia.
