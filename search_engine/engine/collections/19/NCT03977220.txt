      oxaliplatin with capecitabine or S1 still the standard chemotherapy regimen. Howerver, the
      prognosis of diffuse type gastric cancer patients is still poor even after adjuvant
      chemotherapy of XELOX or S1 regimen. Several retrospective, single institutional studies have
      shown that the addition of Nab-paclitaxel to S1 can prolong the survival of advanced gastric
      cancer with diffuse type.However, the effection of Nab-paclitaxel and S1 is unknown in
      diffuse gastric cancer patients after radical surgery. We assessed the effectiveness of
      radical surgery following docetaxel, nab-pacitaxel and S1 therapy for gastric cancer with
      diffuse type.
