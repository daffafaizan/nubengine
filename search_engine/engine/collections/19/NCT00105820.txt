      increased rates of assessment and appropriate management of depression and decreased
      depressive symptomatology for veterans. Our secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of
      EBQI on organizational outcomes.

      Methods: Three VISNs, 10, 16 and 23, are participating. Three primary care clinics within
      each VISN are randomized, two to the intervention and one to usual care, for a total of nine
      study sites. In the intervention clinics, VA leadership, assisted by study staff, tailor and
      implement a depression care program for patient assessment, patient self-management support,
      provider education, primary and mental health collaboration, and care management. The usual
      care clinics participate only in the evaluation. Patient recruitment is through a telephone
      interview. Patients who are at risk for major depression are recruited, 67 from each site.
      Patient outcomes including depression symptom severity on the PHQ-9 and the VA SF-12 are
      being assessed by telephone at six months post enrollment. Other outcome variables are
      adequacy of antidepressant trials, psychotherapy and specialty care visits, and treatment
      adherence. A utilization and cost analysis will be conducted. VISN and VAMC leadership are
      surveyed to assess organizational outcomes. Data is being collected through VA administrative
      databases, patient and staff interviews, and study records. Power calculations and data
      analysis planning reflect the clustered sample design.
