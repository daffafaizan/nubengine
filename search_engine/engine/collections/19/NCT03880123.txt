      body. There are more than 50 different types of sarcoma. The primary treatment approach for
      most types of advanced sarcoma involves chemotherapy, but newer treatment approaches are
      needed because chemotherapy is not curative, sometimes does not work well, and often has
      significant side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new treatment for certain types of sarcoma. The
      new treatment involves two oral targeted drugs used in combination: selinexor and ixazomib.
      Selinexor inhibits the transport of certain proteins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of
      the cell. Ixazomib is part of a class of drugs called proteasome inhibitors. Currently,
      neither of these drugs is approved for the treatment of sarcoma. The researchers believe this
      combination treatment may work effectively for certain types of sarcoma based on encouraging
      laboratory research results. The types of sarcoma in which the treatment will be tested are:
      dedifferentiated liposarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath
      tumor, and Ewing sarcoma. The purpose of this study is to define doses of selinexor and
      ixazomib that are safe and tolerable for patients.
