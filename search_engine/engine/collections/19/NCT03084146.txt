    
      Purpose: To determine the role of food sensitivity in psoriasis and assess the clinical
      response of an individualized elimination diet on psoriasis.

      Design: Up to 50 volunteers with psoriasis and 20 age- and sex-matched controls will be
      recruited for a 12-week prospective correlational study.

      Methods: Venous blood samples for the detection of antibodies against food antigens will be
      collected and individualized elimination diets will be designed based on the most reactive
      food antigens.

      Assessments: Clinical assessments of objective and subjective parameters will be measured
      using Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA),
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS).

      Objectives: The primary objectives are to determine whether psoriasis patients are more
      likely to have food sensitivities and assess the clinical response of a 12-week elimination
      diet on psoriasis.
