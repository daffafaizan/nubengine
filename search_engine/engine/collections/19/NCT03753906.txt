      the study. A detailed, thorough medical and dental history was obtained and each patient was
      subjected to comprehensive clinical and radiological examination. All patients were informed
      about the nature of the study, surgical procedure involved, potential benefits and risks
      associated with the surgical procedure and a written informed consent was obtained from all
      patients.

      All the patients were implanted with self-inflating hydrogel expander (OsmedÂ®) in
      subperiosteal positions using the pouch technique in the mandibular anterior region. The
      clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, two weeks post expander retrieval, three
      months and six months post-operatively.
