    
      The trial consists of 2 phases:

        -  Phase 1: Dose escalation

        -  Phase 2: Expansion in advanced cervical cancer

      Phase 1: Dose Escalation:

      The enrollment to the Phase 1 portion of the study is completed. The trial will consist of a
      3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different combination dose levels (CDL) of AGEN1884
      and AGEN2034 in subjects with locally advanced, recurrent and/or metastatic solid tumors.

      Subjects may be enrolled to the following CDL cohorts:

        -  CDL1 - AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (starting CDL)

        -  CDL2 - AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (maximum planned
           CDL)

        -  CDL-1 - AGEN1884 0.3 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (potential
           de-escalation CDL)

      Combination Dose Level 1 (CDL1) will be the first to be tested. Dose escalation will continue
      until the maximum planned CDL (CDL2) is shown to be safe or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is reached. The MTD is defined as the CDL below which ≥ 33% of subjects develop dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLT). The decision to escalate to the next cohort will be made by a Safety
      Monitoring Committee (SMC), based on safety assessments after all subjects of a cohort
      reached the end of the DLT observation period of 21 days. Should ≥2 DLTs be observed in CDL1,
      the SMC may open enrollment to CDL-1. The SMC will also select the CDL for Phase 2.

      Each subject will receive the combination treatment for a maximum of 24 months or until
      confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal from
      the trial or the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) occur. Subjects who do not
      complete the DLT observation period of 21 days after the first dose, for reasons other than a
      DLT will be replaced. Additional subjects will be backfilled, concurrently with the 3+3 dose
      escalation schema at the lower cleared CDL, to ensure that each cohort enrolls at least 10
      subjects. These additional subjects at each dose level will have the purpose of generating
      additional safety, PK, and receptor occupancy (RO) data, and will not undergo formal DLT
      observation.

      The SMC selected CDL2 (AGEN1884 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks + AGEN2034 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) as
      the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      Phase 2: Expansion in Select Tumors

      To further characterize safety and efficacy, the following expansion cohort will be enrolled:

      Advanced cervical cancer In Phase 2, the RP2D of AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 will be administered
      for a maximum of 2 years or until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any
      criterion for stopping the study drugs or withdrawal from the trial occurs.

      For the Phase 2 portion of the trial, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be
      established to evaluate safety and efficacy and an IERC will be established to adjudicate
      tumor response.
