      is the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase. The inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase and other
      enzymes leads to the generation of superoxide radicals and cellular peroxides , and
      subsequent cellular injury through lipid peroxidation and other oxidant mechanisms. It
      stimulates the production of hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species, malonyldialdehyde
      (MAD), increases superoxide dismutase and inhibits catalase, peroxidase and glutathione .
      Oxidative stress is one of the main mechanisms of action of aluminium phosphide toxicity
