      or urine or measurable protein by Freelite or measurable disease by plasmacytoma will be
      given a combination of bendamustine and bortezomib each cycle. Response rate (PR or better
      after 2 cycles) and duration of response will be assessed. Therapy will be continued until
      disease progression. The bendamustine would be used in a day 1, day 4 dosing schedule after
      each dose of bortezomib to take advantage of the chemosensitizing properties of bortezomib.
      This minimizes the days of treatment to just the first week and allows rebound of blood
      counts. This will be a phase II trial with dose reduction as necessary.

      Bendamustine is a drug which appears to be non-cross-resistant with other alkylating agents
      in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of bortezomib and
      bendamustine will have activity in relapsed/refractory myeloma.
