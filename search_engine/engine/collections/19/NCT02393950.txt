      subjects with 4 dose levels in each panel. Subjects will be randomised to receive 3 dose
      levels of active treatment (single doses) and 1 dose of placebo. The dose levels will be
      escalated from the smallest dose upwards within the study and within the study subject. A
      third panel of 8 subjects may be included to investigate further dose levels of ODM-106,
      investigate the effect of taking ODM-106 with food or to compare two different formulations
      of ODM-106. For an individual subject, the study will consist of a screening period (maximum
      4 weeks), 4 study treatment periods with a wash-out period between each study treatment
      administration and a post-treatment period of about 2 weeks.

      The study duration for an individual will be approximately 12-16 weeks. Blood samples will be
      collected for the assessment of the concentration of ODM-106 and its metabolite.Plasma
      samples and cumulative urinary samples will be collected for metabolite screening. Safety
      will be assessed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous ECG monitoring, Holter ECG,
      supine and orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, body temperature, physical examination,
      electroencephalogram (EEG), laboratory safety assessments and adverse events. Sedation and
      psychomotor tests and a quantitative EEG will also be performed.
