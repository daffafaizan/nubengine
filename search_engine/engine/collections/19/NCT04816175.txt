      in a burst of intensive neuromotor intervention in the form of Acquire therapy, delivered by
      the treatment team at Virginia Tech's Neuromotor Research Clinic. All children will have a
      diagnosis of Global Developmental Delay, with concomitant microcephaly or hyperkinetic
      movements. The children will be assessed for psychomotor function prior to and after the
      treatment intervention, using a series of standardized and goal specific assessments, with
      the possibility of additional neuroimaging assessments when possible. Acquire therapy is an
      intensive intervention in that it is delivered with high intensity, wherein goal directed
      behaviors are promoted at high levels of repetition and delivered at a high dose (4-6 hours a
      day) in an intensive burst of 3-4 weeks of 5 day a week treatment. Acquire therapy is an
      operant conditioning based intervention delivered in a cycle of refinement, reinforcement and
      repetition. It is play-based with activities selected to drive behavior toward goals that are
      specific to each child and selected based on each child's interests and needs. As such a
      specific protocol cannot be outlined. However, all goal directed activities are designed to
      promote awareness of and engagement with others and the environment.
