      which port place is optimal for the removing of the cholecystectomy material from the
      abdomen. There are different port site infections rates in the literature. The minimal tissue
      damage of laparoscopic cholecystectomy suggests a lower risk of wound infection, but there
      are series with an infection range of 8 %. The investigators are investigating is there any
      difference at the port site infection rates when the cholecystectomy material removed from
      different ports from the abdomen at the laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
