      income countries (LMIC), where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic, is a lack of evidence to support
      their use in patients with TB. Access to optimal protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens for
      patients with and without TB is urgent. Switching rifampicin to rifabutin, a weak inducer
      that does not significantly reduce PI concentrations, is recommended in high income countries
      for patients on boosted PIs who develop TB. However, rifabutin is not available in most LMIC
      where TB is typically treated with fixed dose combination tablets.

      We will enrol virologically suppressed participants on a second-line DRV/r regimen without
      TB. Based on data from a Physiologically-Based PK model, we selected two adjusted doses of
      DRV/r (1600/200 mg daily and 800/100 mg 12 hourly) with RIF for comparison to plasma
      exposures with DRV/r 800/100 mg daily without RIF, in a cross-over design.

      Baseline DRV steady state PK will be determined and RIF added for 7 days, then the dose of
      ritonavir will be increased to 200 mg; 7 days later the dose of DRV will be increased; after
      another 7 days participants will be crossed over to the alternative adjusted DRV dose.

      DRV will be measured in plasma samples after observed doses at baseline and after each dose
      adjustment. Non-compartmental analysis will be used to estimate the PK measures. Clinical
      adverse events, ALT, and bilirubin will be monitored every 2 to 3 days during treatment with
      RIF.
