      after enactment of new regulations. 10 childcare centers licensed in East Baton Rouge Parish
      will be randomly selected and standardized behavioral observation scales will be used to
      objectively quantify the physical activity and screen-time environment of the centers and the
      children's behaviors both in and outside the center. These assessments will be collected
      twice during the 2-year grant period to capture potential changes after the policies are
      implemented.
