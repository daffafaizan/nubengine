      farm workers. The intervention will be delivered to two different treatment groups: 1)
      adolescent only, adolescents receive the adapted adolescent version of La Familia Sana
      program and 2) family enhanced, adolescent and mother both receive the La Familia Sana
      program. In addition, there will be a control group where adolescent farmworkers will not be
      exposed to any pesticide safety program. Our project will:

        1. Determine if a promotora-based intervention targeting pesticide safety in the workplace
           is effective in increasing knowledge about safety behaviors among Latino adolescents
           engaged in farm work.

        2. Delineate variation by group among adolescents' knowledge about safety behaviors.

        3. Delineate variation in adolescents' pesticide safety behaviors and neurological outcomes
           after intervention between all groups.
