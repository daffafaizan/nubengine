      trial to test the influence of statin therapy on the progression of calcified aortic stenosis
      in patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate aortic stenosis. After completion of all
      baseline investigations patients will be randomly assigned to the verum group (fluvastatin
      group) or to the control group (placebo group). Patients in the verum group will receive
      fluvastatin in a starting dose of 40 mg per day. The dose should be increased up to 80 mg per
      day. The treatment should be continued until the study end (24 months). Follow up
      investigations will be performed after 6, 12, and 18 months. After 24 months the final
      investigations will be performed.
