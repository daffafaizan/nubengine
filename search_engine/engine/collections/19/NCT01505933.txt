      configuration at the level of soft palate, base of tongue and tip of the epiglottis in
      children sedated with dexmedetomidine and propofol in children undergoing MRI.

      We hypothesize that the upper airway caliber will be smaller in children receiving propofol
      than with dexmedetomidine.

      Primary Outcome To measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the upper airway at the level of
      soft palate, base of the tongue and epiglottis in both groups of children at high doses of
      propofol and dexmedetomidine and thus compare the decrease in CSA with increasing doses of
      both drugs.

      Secondary Outcomes To measure the

        -  anteroposterior (AP) diameter

        -  transverse (Tr) diameter of the upper airway at the three levels in both groups of
           children at both low and high doses of propofol and dexmedetomidine and compare the
           decrease in AP and Tr diameter at increasing doses of dexmedetomidine.
