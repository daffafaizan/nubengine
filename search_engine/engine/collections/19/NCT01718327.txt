    
      The primary objective is to evaluate the overall survival of patients with advanced and
      unresectable cholangiocarcinoma treated continuously by sunitinib as second line at the dose
      of 37.5 mg per day, after one line of chemotherapy and to determine whether sunitinib
      deserves further studies in this indication.

      The secondary objectives are

        -  To evaluate the criteria of efficacy

        -  To evaluate the effects of sunitinib on tumor angiogenesis

        -  To characterize the safety profile of sunitinib

        -  To identify markers associated with response to sunitinib
