    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, blinded clinical study designed to evaluate clinical
      utility of Nevisense in normal clinical practice, i.e. the potential effect of implementing
      Nevisense in clinical decision making (Human vs Human & Machine) based on Nevisense
      measurement after biopsy decision. The study enrollment will continue until minimum of 180
      subjects are enrolled in the study. Up to 3 US university/hospital investigational sites will
      participate in this study. Biopsying clinician or the investigators from the clinical
      practices of physicians participating in the study will perform the patient and lesion
      assessment for biopsy as standard of care at the clinic.

      Study subjects will be recruited from the clinical practices of physicians participating as
      investigators in this study. Biopsying clinicians provide their assessment to whether s/he
      would have sent the lesion(s) for biopsy had s/he known the EIS information beforehand .
      Thereafter an evaluation of the suspicious lesion with the Nevisense will be performed
      followed by a biopsy of the lesion. The biopsied lesion will be subjected to histological
      analysis.
