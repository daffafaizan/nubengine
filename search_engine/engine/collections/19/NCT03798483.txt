      kneecap dislocation, from an acute hospital. Participants will receive up to 6 physiotherapy
      sessions over 3 months. The investigator's exercise programme aims to improve leg muscle
      strength and facilitate a return to the participant's usual activities. This may include
      activities such as hopping and changing direction which differentiates it from other
      programmes. Participants will be required to perform the exercise programme 3 times a week
      independently. Strategies to increase adherence to the exercise programme will also be used.
      This study is part of a Masters in Clinical Research funded by the National Institute for
