    
      This study will be a single-centre controlled human malaria infection study using adults with
      varying degrees of prior exposure to P. falciparum. The study will take place at Bagamoyo
      Clinical Trail Facility of the Ifakara Health Institute, located in Bagamoyo town (about 60
      km north of Dar es Salaam).

      Twelve healthy male adults aged 18 to 35 years will be recruited into two cohorts of high and
      low previous exposure consisting of 6 volunteers each as determined by anti-schizont antibody
      levels. Up to 5 back-up volunteers will be also be recruited and may take the place of
      another volunteer should they withdraw or become ineligible prior to challenge.

      Participants will be infected via IV administration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human
      erythrocytes of the chloroquine-susceptible 3D7 strain. Participants will then be closely
      monitored in a clinical trial facility for a maximum of 31 (28 days plus 3 days of treatment
      with anti-malarial drugs) days while undergoing frequent clinical and laboratory assessment.
      Volunteers who do not reach malaria treatment criteria as per protocol at day 28 (C+28) will
      be treated presumptively with antimalarial medications (ALU + a single low dose primaquine)
      under direct observation and will be discharged upon completion of treatment and on
      discretion of the study clinician.
