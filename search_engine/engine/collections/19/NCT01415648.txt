    
      After consent, patients will be randomized in two groups: one group with continuous per
      operative cerebral oximetry monitoring associated with hemodynamic optimisation algorithm
      (excluding norepinephrine) if cerebral oximetry decrease more than 15% under the preoperative
      baseline; the second group is continuously monitored with cerebral oximeter but this latter
      is blinded to the medical team, the alarm switch off , and patients are managed with the
      standard care of the centre.

      All patients have a preoperative and a postoperative diffusion cerebral MRI to detect new
      onset of cerebral ischemic lesion. The amount and the volume of cerebral ischemic lesions
      will be scored to compare groups.

      Quality of life as well as direct (medical and nonmedical) and indirect costs were collected
      using questionnaires during the 120 postoperative days.

      A substudy including 200 patients will be conducted to compare the two groups concerning
      postoperative protein S-100B level and a composite score of neurocognitive tests (measured
      pre- and postoperatively) The trial will be conducted according to GCP
