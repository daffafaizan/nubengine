      (at least 30min, 5 days / week) have been widely promulgated by the government, most people
      are physically inactive. Sedentary behaviors, like time spent sitting, are associated with
      serious implications on metabolic health, indicating that even in individuals who regularly
      exercise a reduction in time spent sitting can confer health benefits. Encouraging recent
      evidence shows that walking breaks throughout the day are an effective strategy to offset the
      deleterious effects of prolonged uninterrupted sitting. Further data however are needed to
      better understand the effect of these microbursts of activity along the day. The
      investigators propose in this project to determine the effect of 3 days of frequent
      interruption of prolonged sitting on metabolic health in healthy overweight sedentary adults
      (n=24), as compared to 3 days including a single long bout of isocaloric exercise or a
      control condition where subjects do not exercise but are subjected to prolonged sitting.
      Plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides and free fatty acids concentrations and the use of
      substrate (glucose, fat or protein) to provide energy to the body in response to meals
      consumption will be measured on day 3 of each of these three conditions. The investigators
      will furthermore assess the ability of the participants to perform the interventions on
      physical activity at the end of each day over the three days of intervention (2 days in
      free-living conditions and one day in a controlled environment). The investigators believe
      that this proposed project will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of
      breaking up prolonged sitting with short bursts of moderate-intensity activity, like walking.
      This innovative strategy may be more effective at combating the adverse effects of sedentary
      behaviors than more traditional approaches like structured exercise.
