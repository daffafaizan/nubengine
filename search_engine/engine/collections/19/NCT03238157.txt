        1. To study the natural history of radiation retinopathy using advanced imaging techniques.
           A combination of macular OCT to evaluate for edema, OCT angiography to evaluate for
           macular and peri-papillary ischemia and wide-field angiography for peripheral ischemia
           and leakage. Potential role of OCT angiography in radiation retinopathy will be
           evaluated by comparison to other eye (control) and FA.

        2. Currently there is no consensus on effective management strategy for radiation
           retinopathy. Patients in the interventional will be prospectively followed to study
           efficacy of steroids for early treatment of radiation retinopathy while comparing the
           multimodal therapeutic approach in a randomized trial.

        3. Patients in the observational arm will be prospectively followed while comparing the
           multimodal therapeutic approach in a randomized trial.
