      helpful tool for enhancing thermal acclimation, physical tolerance and endurance, improving
      cardiovascular dysfunctions, normalizing metabolic status and body weight in patients with
      chronic non-infectious diseases and in aged healthy individuals. Clinical effects of
      hyperthermia acclimation or repeated sauna's sessions were investigated in series of
      well-designed placebo-controlled studies at different cohorts of Bronchial Asthma (BA),
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Metabolic Syndrome
      and Obesity (MS-O) patients, qualified professional sportsmen and healthy volunteers.

      Effects of sauna bathing and hyperthermic treatments (acclimation to systemic, whole body
      dosed hyperthermia, which leads to core temperature increase on 2,0-2,5oC) are accurately
      described in well-controlled medical studies, performed by experienced researchers imposing
      different protocols (from 1 session lasting 15-20 min, daily 1 week up to 2 sessions per day,
      3 weeks).

      The generalized result of the most trials suggests adaptation to hyperthermia (sauna bathing
      sessions) is accompanied by a multi-faceted molecular, cellular, organic and systemic,
      organismic responses - by progressively increased resistance to thermal stressors, increased
      bronchial conductivity and pulmonary ventilation, sweating; stimulated activation of
      neuro-humoral and cardiovascular systems, boosted microcirculation and, as a consequence,
      providing more efficient transport and utilization of O2 by body tissues, resulting in
      increase of exercise tolerance, physical activity, normalization of appetite, balancing
      thermogenesis and heat release.

      Mechanisms underlying the described clinical effects are partially connected with increased
      production of some neurotransmitters, hormones and peptides, among them - Brain derived
      neurotropic factor (BDNF), Somatotropin (Human Growth Hormone - HGH), Heat Shock Proteins
      family as cell signaling pathways inducers etc.

      In spite of difference in study design, protocols, and hyperthermic mashines - devices, it is
      safe to make the conclusion that periodic individually adapted hyperthermic sessions are
      capable to induce haematological, neuro-humoral, cardiorespiratory and antioxidant adaptation
      to provide pathogenetic treatment and rehabilitation of patients with chronic non-infectious
      diseases.

      Enhanced stress resistance and improved oxygen transfer/utilization are basic mechanisms
      whereby the organism increases its resistance to any physical and environmental stressors and
      to variety of pathogenic factors.

      The described Hyperthermic Fitness Treatment (HFT) method is safe, has no significant
      complications or adverse side effects and is generally very well tolerated by sportsmen,
      healthy persons and different clinical patients' groups.
