      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A consequence of airflow limitation is gas
      trapping as expiration becomes flow limited. This may occur at rest with more severe airway
      obstruction and is most evident during exercise as lung emptying is reduced and increased
      ventilation does not allow full expiration. This increased gas trapping or hyperinflation is
      the cause of much of the increased work of breathing, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance in
      subjects with COPD (O'Donnell 1997; O'Donnell, 1993). Spirometric measurement of airflow
      limitation, particularly as assessed by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), is
      commonly used for the diagnosis of and assessment of response to pharmacotherapeutic
      intervention in COPD. However, changes in FEV1 may not fully predict symptomatic responses
      and alternative measures of lung hyperinflation such as exercise tolerance and exertional
      dyspnea may be more sensitive to therapeutic intervention and/or more clinically relevant
      than FEV1 [O'Donnell1999; Bauerle, 1998; O'Donnell, 1998; Officer, 1998]. GSK573719/GW642444
      Inhalation Powder, a combination of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)
      bronchodilator GSK573719 and the long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) bronchodilator GW642444, is
      in development for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction associated with COPD.
      Development of this product is supported by studies showing improvement in lung function with
      similar safety when use of combinations of long-acting bronchodilators with different
      mechanisms of action are compared with single bronchodilator therapy [van Noord 2005; van
      Noord van Noord 2006; Tashkin 2008]. Previous studies have demonstrated that treatment with
      short- and long-acting bronchodilators including ipratropium, tiotropium, and salmeterol
      reduces resting lung hyperinflation as measured by functional residual capacity (FRC),
      residual volume (RV), and inspiratory capacity (IC), with associated improvements in exercise
      endurance time and exertional dyspnoea in subjects with COPD [Ayers, 2001; O'Donnell 1998;
      O'Donnell 2004; Pepin 2005; Pepin 2007; Ramirez-Venegas 1997]. However, the effect of
      combined LAMA/LABA therapy on these measures is not well characterized.

      This is a phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, combination
      and component, two-period, incomplete block design cross-over study using GSK573719/GW642444.
      The primary objective is to evaluate lung function and exercise endurance time after 12 weeks
      of once-daily administration of GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder (125/25mcg and
      62.5/25mcg), GSK573719 Inhalation Powder (125mcg and 62.5mcg), GW642444 Inhalation Powder 25
      mcg and placebo delivered by a Novel dry powder inhaler (Novel DPI) Approximately 312
      subjects with moderate/severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be randomised
      in order to achieve 208 subjects completing both treatment periods of 3 months.. There will
      be a total of 12 study clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis. Subjects who meet the
      eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will complete a 12 to 21 day run-in period
      followed by two 12-week treatment periods that are separated by a 14 day wash-out. Clinic
      visits will be conducted at Screening (Visit 1), twice during the run-in period (Visits 2 and
      3), at randomization (Visit 4) and three times during the first treatment period, on
      Treatment Day 2 (Visit 5) and at 6 and 12 weeks (Visits 6 and 7 respectively). During the
      washout period of 14 days there will be 2 clinic visits (Visits 8 and 9). During the second
      treatment period there will be 3 clinic visits, on Treatment Day 2 (Visit 10) and at 6 and 12
      weeks (Visits 11 and 12 respectively). A Safety Follow-Up assessment (Visit 13) to record
      adverse events will be conducted by telephone 7 days after the end of the second treatment
      period or early withdrawal. Efficacy measurements will include pre and post dose FEV1, lung
      volume measurements and exercise endurance time measured using the endurance shuttle walking
      test (ESWT). Safety and tolerability will be assessed by collection of adverse events (AEs),
      vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests and incidence of
      COPD exacerbations. Dyspnea will be assessed using the Exercise Dyspnea Scale (EDS), a
      patient-reported outcome. Blood samples will also be collected for potential pharmacogenetics
      analysis
