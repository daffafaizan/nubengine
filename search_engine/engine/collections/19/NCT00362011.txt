      developing diabetes and heart disease. Grain of the plant Salvia hispanica alba (Salba)
      contain a high concentration of Ï‰-3 fatty acids in addition to being a rich source of
      vegetable protein, fiber, calcium and antioxidants which have cardiovascular protective
      effect. To address the paucity of randomized, well-controlled clinical studies supporting the
      long-term cardioprotective benefits of whole grain we investigated the effects of a novel
      grain Salba in type 2 diabetes.

      Comparison(s): Participants on a conventional diabetes diet (50% carbohydrate, 20% protein,
      30% fat) receive either addition of Salba or matched control supplement for 12 weeks
      separated by a 4-week washout period.
