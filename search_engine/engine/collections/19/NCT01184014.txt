      safety of achieving glycemic control in hospitalized patients who receive greater than
      physiologic doses of steroids. This study will compare 2 methods of achieving glycemic
      control in hospitalized patients who develop steroid-induced hyperglycemia (blood glucose
      (BG) >180 mg/dL): 1) a study-specific steroid NPH dosing algorithm plus standard recommended
      care (Experimental group) vs. 2) the standard recommended care (Methodist Hospital Complete
      Insulin Orders (Control group).
