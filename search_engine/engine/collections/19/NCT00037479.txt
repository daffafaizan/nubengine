      "textbook duration" antibiotic therapy. When memory, attention, or thinking problems persist,
      the syndrome is called persistent Lyme disease (PLD). This study seeks to answer critical
      scientific questions about the treatment and cause of PLD symptoms.

      This 24-week treatment study will evaluate each patient's response to treatment using
      neuropsychological testing and state-of-the-art brain imaging. The brain tests include
      neuropsychological testing of memory and attention, brain imaging (MRI and PET scans) to look
      at blood flow in the brain and nerve cell structure and metabolism, a neurological exam, and
      studies of the fluid that surrounds the brain (cerebrospinal fluid). The treatment involves
      10 weeks of either intravenous antibiotic called ceftriaxone (also known as Rocephin) or
      intravenous placebo (inactive substance). After the first visit to Columbia Presbyterian
      Medical Center, the remaining treatments will be done in the patient's home. Patients will be
      screened over the phone and in person to confirm study eligibility.
