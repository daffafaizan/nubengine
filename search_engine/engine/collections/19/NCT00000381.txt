      with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

      Anxiety disorders are among the most common childhood and adolescent psychiatric disorders
      and are often associated with academic, social, and family morbidity. These disorders
      frequently increase the risk for developing other psychiatric disorders (e.g., depression,
      substance abuse), aggregate in families, and appear to continue into adulthood. Except for
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, there are very few pharmacological treatment studies for
      childhood anxiety disorders. Given the sparsity and methodological problems of previous
      anxiety pharmacological studies, it is clear that further investigation of the use of
      pharmacological treatment of children and adolescents with these disorders is needed.

      Patients are randomized to receive either fixed-dose fluoxetine or placebo for 12 weeks.
      Patients are assessed for psychiatric symptomatology, functional status, and side effects. In
      addition, to assess attainment of steady state and compliance with treatment, plasma levels
      of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine are measured at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. To standardize the
      treatment protocol and to assure that both groups (fluoxetine and placebo) receive equivalent
      nonpharmacological treatment, a manual is used. Potential predictors of clinical response
      (such as age, sex, duration and severity of anxiety, school absenteeism, sub-syndromal
      depressive symptoms, family history of anxiety or mood disorders) are explored.
