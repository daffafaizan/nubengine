      foods and nutrients on cardiac risk and can provide a direct measurement of the effect of
      cocoa powder consumption on vascular physiology in healthy adults with BMI between 25-35
      kg/m2.

      To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine the dose response effects of sugar free,
      liquid, cocoa and solid, dark chocolate with sugar consumption on FMD, concentrating on
      individuals with elevated BMI. Given the current epidemic of obesity in the United States;
      its role as a risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease; and the fact that
      cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in this country, examination of the
      cardio-protective effects of cocoa or dark chocolate in an at risk population is of
      considerable potential interest. Demonstrating that ingestion of cocoa may reverse damage
      caused to the endothelium may lead to new dietary recommendations that may help curb the
      prevalence of heart disease in the U.S.
