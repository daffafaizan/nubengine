      a blend in humans. In previous clinical studies conducted in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD) patients, GSK961081 has been administered on a background of fluticasone
      propionate without any observed systemic pharmacodynamic interaction. In this study GSK961081
      and fluticasone propionate will be administered in a blended formulation from a single device
      and compared with GSK961081 and fluticasone propionate administered alone and concurrently.
      The aim of the study will be to investigate any differences in pharmacodynamics and/or
      pharmacokinetics for GSK961081 and fluticasone propionate when administered as the blend,
      concurrently or alone.

      Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety information will be gathered to assess the
      suitability of the GSK9610981/fluticasone propionate blend for further development.Each
      subject will receive four treatments (GSK961081 alone, fluticasone propionate alone,
      GSK961081 and fluticasone propionate concurrently, and GSK961081/fluticasone propionate
      blend) in randomized order, in four treatment periods, each separated by a washout period of
      at least a week. All treatments will be administered via a DISKUS inhaler.

      Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety will be assessed by measurement of plasma
      GSK961081, plasma fluticasone propionate, serum cortisol, urine cortisol, blood glucose,
      serum potassium, Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), heart rate, 12-lead
      Electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests and collection of adverse events (AEs).
