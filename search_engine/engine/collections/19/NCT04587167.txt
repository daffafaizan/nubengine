      Pennsylvania. Eligible clinics will have at least 100 active patients, ages 11-14, in their
      electronic health record systems. Recruitment will target clinics in Central Pennsylvania,
      where most counties are designated as rural. Clinics will be randomized to one of three arms:
      ECHO-delivered HPV vaccine communication training using the Announcement Approach (HPV ECHO);
      HPV ECHO plus systems follow-up communication for parents who initially decline vaccination
      (HPV ECHO+); or control. Covariate-constrained randomization will be used to ensure balance
      among the three arms with respect to clinic size (adolescent patient population), clinic type
      (academic vs. non-academic), rurality, and historic adolescent HPV vaccination rates.
