      I. Compare the objective response rate in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the
      pancreas treated with bevacizumab and gemcitabine with cetuximab vs erlotinib.

      II. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients. III. Compare median
      progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center (University of Chicago vs other) and ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; gemcitabine IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15; and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine and bevacizumab as in arm I. Patients also receive oral
      erlotinib once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-26.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54-126 patients (27-63 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 16 months.
