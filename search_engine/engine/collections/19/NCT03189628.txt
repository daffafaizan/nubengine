    
      This is a randomized controlled single blind clinal trial that designed to observe whether
      the transplantation of autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in adipose tissue is safe
      and its effect on improving skin regeneration.

      The clinical trial will concentrate on the therapeutic effect of SVF after facial injection.
      After 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, a comprehensive examination of the facial
      skin was performed to assess the effect of the SVF. Skin texture, thickness and colour will
      be observed to evaluate the effect of SVF on skin regeneration
