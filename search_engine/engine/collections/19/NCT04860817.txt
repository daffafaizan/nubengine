    
      Who can participate? Patients diagnosed with relapsed/refractory T cell leukaemia or
      lymphoma. Both genders, aged 2-25 years old.

      What does the study involve? Enrolled participants are randomly chosen to receive one of
      three different dose levels of CAR-T cells called GC027.

        1. Dose level one: 0.6×10^7 cells/kg;

        2. Dose level two: 1×10^7 cells/kg;

        3. Dose level three: 1.5×10^7 cells/kg. Before CAR-T infusion, all participants will
           receive a preconditioning therapy including several chemotherapy agents or other
           interventions that are required to help the effect of the CAR-T cells. After completion
           of preconditioning therapy, infusion of the CAR-T cells via a tube into the vein needs
           to start within 1 week. Participants will receive one infusion of CAR-T cells which will
           take between 15 and 30 mins. All participants will have a blood test before infusion and
           at 4, 7, 10 and 14 days following infusion to measure their response to the treatment
           and some further tests will be required in some participants.

      What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? The universal CAR-T cells
      targeting CD7 may lead to durable disease control and long term survival. The main risks of
      participating include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and Immune effector cell-associated
      neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).

      Where is the study run from? Haematology department of 920th Hospital of Joint Logistics
      Support Force of People's Liberation Army of China (China).
