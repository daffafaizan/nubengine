      for Service Education and Research at the University of Regina. Using a patient preference
      randomized control trial (RCT) design, participants (n = 120) will be enrolled in either the
      online group or workbook group, or to a wait list control group. The content of both programs
      will be identical and contain 5 core lessons, which participants will be encouraged to work
      through over an 8-week period. By exploring the efficacy of an online vs. workbook group, the
      results from this study may serve as a stepping-stone for improved self-management of chronic
      pain in older adults.

      A patient preference randomized controlled trial (RCT) was chosen for this study. The goal is
      to have most participants accept randomization by emphasizing they are equally acceptable, so
      only those with a very strong preference or no access to Internet aren't randomized.
      According to the preliminary power analysis, a total of 120 participants will be randomly
      assigned to be enrolled in the online group or workbook group, or be placed on a twelve-week
      wait list control, which will serve as a control group to control for the influence of time
      on symptom change between groups.
