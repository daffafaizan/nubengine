      wore AIR OPTIX® AQUA contact lenses bilaterally (same product in both eyes) on a daily wear
      basis for 1 week. In Phase 2, participants wore AIR OPTIX® COLORS and FRESHLOOK® COLORBLENDS
      contact lenses contralaterally (different product in each eye) on a daily wear basis for 4
      weeks.
