    
      Betaglucin soluble gel at 0.2% is produced in Costa Rica by a biochemical researcher.
      Obtained by chemical process improves the immune response by increasing 80 times the number
      of macrophages and Natural Killer cells. Specifically in human papillomavirus-related
      anogenital warts.

      As clinical researchers, the investigators pretend to determine the therapeutic efficacy of
      betaglucin 0.2 % gel compared with Imiquimod 5% cream in two groups of individuals from 18 to
      50 years old males and females.

      Based in mathematics and biostatistics formula used by Professor Roman Fentin, French
      academic working in the University of Costa Rica. Medicine Faculty in San Jose the number of
      participants should be 102.

      Divided into two arms. Arm betaglucin 0.2% 51 individuals treated with betaglucin soluble gel
      at 0.2% Arm imiquimod 5% 51 individuals treated with imiquimod cream at 5 % After three
      months of follow-up of all individuals, will be classified as clearance, partially cured and
      not cured.

      The plan of analysis will be:

        -  Chi-square test between the two groups (depending on the treatment) and the success or
           not of the treatment.

        -  Logistic model with a dependent variable the success or not of the treatment and with
           independent variables the treatment, sex, age. It will make it possible to verify that
           the differences observed in 1 are not due to another factor.

        -  Logistic model with a dependent variable the success or not of the treatment and with
           independent variables the treatment, the sex, the age, and an interaction sex-age. It
           will allow us to observe if there is a difference in the result according to the
           patient's sex.
