      sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, preventing them from moving and going out, resulting in
      an alteration of social life. Multiple drugs treatment is frequently used but is burdensome
      and poorly effective. However, thermal cure proved efficacious to improve quality of life
      during the cure and beyond. This study aims at demonstrating the added value of a patient's
      therapeutic education program provided during a thermal cure, a moment where patients are
      available and receptive to guidance.
