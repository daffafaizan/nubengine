      enrolled after signing the study-specific informed consent form. Subjects meeting all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be scheduled for 3 treatment visits, which must occur at
      least 2 days, but no more than 7 days apart. At each treatment visit, baseline measurements
      will be taken, then 1 of the 3 study drugs will be administered to both eyes. Afterwards,
      efficacy and safety assessments will be performed at specific time intervals. Study drug
      administration for each subject will be equally randomized to 1 of 6 possible sequences of
      study drugs.
