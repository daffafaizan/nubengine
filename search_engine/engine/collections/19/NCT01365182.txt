    
      This is a randomized, controlled longitudinal study. Patients with early-stage prostate
      cancer and UI for more than six months were randomly assigned to one of three study arms: (1)
      biofeedback PFME plus a support group (BF+SUPPORT); (2) biofeedback PFME plus telephone
      (BF+PHONE); and (3) usual care (UC). The BF+SUPPORT and BF+PHONE participants learned PFME
      through computerized biofeedback. Thereafter, the BF+SUPPORT participants attended six group
      meetings and the BF+PHONE participants had six phone contacts every other week for three
      months. The UC participants did not receive biofeedback PFME or telephone/group intervention
      but continued receiving usual medical care. All subjects were assessed blind at baseline, 3
      months (post intervention) and 6 months (follow-up). In addition, 49 moderately to severely
      incontinent patients were recruited from the three study groups to undergo urodynamic testing
      at baseline and 3 months for the evaluation of physiological changes. Data of the costs for
      the interventions and the participants' medical care were collected for a cost-effectiveness
      analysis.
