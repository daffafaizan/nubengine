      supplements(ONS) during concurrent chemoradiotherapy for local advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer, and discuss when to deliver ONS and which indicator should be the goal of ONS.

      Patients were randomly assigned to arm A, B, C, D. In arm A, ONS is given from start of CCRT,
      based on the daily total nutritional intake of 30-35kcal/kg. Patients in arm B are given ONS
      when they have grade 2 radiation esophagitis, based on the daily total nutritional intake of
      30-35kcal/kg. For arm C, ONS is given from start of CCRT, with the goal to keep prealbumin
      normal. Patients in arm D are given ONS when they have grade 2 radiation esophagitis, with
      the goal to keep prealbumin normal. All patients received definitive thoracic radiotherapy
      with total radiation doses of 60-70 Gy, concurrent with weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and
      nedaplatin(25mg/㎡).
