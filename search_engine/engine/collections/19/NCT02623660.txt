      generating device to reduce post-operative edema, shorten the time to heal and regain maximum
      function in total knee replacement patients. Changes in swelling will be documented by
      utilizing a 3D scanning device (Perometer) and a Bio-Impedance Spectroscopy (BIS) device
      (Impedimed SFB7). These instruments quantitate limb volume and inter and intra-cellular fluid
      respectively with a high degree of accuracy. Measurements will be made from the first
      post-operative day until the completion of rehabilitation therapy several months later.

      Edema volume and fluid distribution data collected from both control and experimental groups
      will be compared to determine the statistical significance of the difference between these
      groups. An additional analysis will be performed on data collected from the non-operated
      lower limb of each patient.

      The second primary objective is to determine the time to complete post-op rehabilitation.
      Completion will be determined by the ability of the patient to experience an optimal outcome
      by utilizing performance based measurements of knee function including quadriceps strength
      and range of motion. The time from surgery to optimal post-op rehabilitation will be
      recorded.

      The determinations of statistical significance between the electrically treated and
      non-electrically treated groups will be made by analysts on a blind basis. They will not know
      whether a sample data set is from an experimental or control patient. The codes that document
      which group the set belongs to will be opened after all analysis is completed by an
      independent analyst.
