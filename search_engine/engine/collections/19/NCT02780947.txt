      Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), provides a significant protection against the
      risk of sudden death, however it does not prevent arrhythmia recurrences [1-7]. ICD
      therapies, especially shocks, pose several risks, including decreased quality of life,
      increased mortality among patients who suffer ICD shock compared with patients who do not and
      clinically significant anxiety and depression as a result of recurrent ICD shocks, which has
      been found to occur in more than 50% of patients [8-12]. Furthermore, ICD implantation has
      been found not to protect against sudden cardiac death in 3-7% of patients [13].

      The benefit of novel ICD programming in reducing inappropriate ICD therapy and mortality was
      demonstrated in Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Reduce Inappropriate
      Therapy (MADIT-RIT) [14]. Catheter ablation has been considered a plausible curative therapy
      for VT prevention, especially in patients with VT episodes [15]. The Substrate Mapping and
      Ablation in Sinus Rhythm to Halt Ventricular Tachycardia (SMASH-VT) and the Ventricular
      Tachycardia Ablation in Coronary Heart Disease (VTACH) found that prophylactic catheter
      ablation reduces the incidence of appropriate ICD therapy in patients who had undergone ICD
      implantation as a means of secondary prevention and had a history of myocardial infarction
      (MI) [16,17]. It was also shown in a small retrospective study that prophylactic catheter
      ablation for induced VT reduced the incidence of appropriate ICD therapy in primary
      prevention post-MI patients [18].

      Aim of the study - Statement of Hypothesis Prophylactic substrate ablation in post-MI
      patients undergoing defibrillator implantation reduces appropriate defibrillator therapies.
