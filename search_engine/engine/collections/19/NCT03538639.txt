      bench-to-bedside process, which is essential for the full implementation of translational
      medicine programs. The study of rare monogenetic and undiagnosed diseases is a complex
      bedside-to-bench-to-bedside endeavor. Recent studies show that rare genetic variants are more
      likely than common variants to have deleterious effects on protein structure, function,
      and/or expression, possibly leading to clinically relevant events. Studies of large patient
      populations offer the opportunity to identify rare genetic variants underlying human disease
      and will have impactful implications for human health. We propose to characterize the
      etiology and natural history of rare and orphan diseases with vascular phenotypes. We will
      also study rare genetic modifiers and identify novel disease mechanisms contributing to
      common vascular diseases. Subsequent disease-related protocols may be developed based on
      findings from subjects enrolled in this protocol for further intensive natural history
      studies and potential innovative therapeutic studies. In addition to its role in
      investigating individuals who are of interest to the Translational Vascular Medicine Branch
      (TVMB) of the NHLBI, this protocol can provide a possible avenue for admitting subjects from
      other NIH programs, such as the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the Center for Human
      Immunology Trans-institute program or other NIH protocols where subjects exhibit vascular
      phenotypes.
