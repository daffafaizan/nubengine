      of up to 96 weeks, an open-label period which included the remainder of the initial 96 weeks,
      where applicable, and a 96-week extension, i.e., up to a maximum of 192 weeks after
      randomization. There was a follow-up period of 4 weeks for participants discontinuing
      treatment.

      Within the 96 weeks double-blind treatment period, the first 4 weeks were PK run-in phase in
      which PK samples (blood samples) were collected from participants and then 4 weeks of
      analysis (no samples drawn). The PK run-in phase (total 8 weeks) was intended to provide
      individual PK parameters to allow the dose adjustment to the 14 milligrams (mg)
      adult-equivalent dose for the rest of the study.

      Participants who experienced a relapse after the PK run-in phase (8 weeks) and confirmed by
      the Relapse Adjudication Panel and participants who fulfilled MRI criteria (high number of
      new lesions at weeks 36, 48 or 72 compared to previous images) had the option to continue in
      an open-label teriflunomide treatment arm up to 192 weeks from randomization.

      An optional additional extension period is available for young participants with
      teriflunomide until the participants are 18 years old and/or able to switch to commercial
      product, whichever comes first.
