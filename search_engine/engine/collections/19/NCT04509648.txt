    
      Eligible breast cancer patients will receive hypofractionated radiotherapy of 5.2 Gy in 5
      fractions within one week and a sequential tumor bed boost of 5.2 Gy in 2 fractions to the
      conserved breast. The dose is prescribed to ipsilateral chest wall or whole breast and
      regional lymph regions (including supraclavicular/infraclavicular region, internal mammary
      nodes, and any part of the axillary bed at risk). All patients are treated with intensity
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique. The primary endpoint is â‰¥2 grade any acute
      radiation induced toxicity event. patients will be followed for at least 1 years to evaluate
      the acute and late radiation-induced toxicity, locoregional recurrence, over survival,
      distant metastasis, and quality of life.

      Calculation of the required number of cases based on an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% with
      a maximal tolerable toxicity difference of 10% during and within 6 months after RNI comparing
      to conventional radiotherapy and lost rate of follow up of 10%. In total 197 patients are
      needed to be recruited.
