      routinely (bronchial secretion, stomach content, oropharyngeal smear) for determination of
      etiological agent responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in critically ill
      patients to bronchoscopy-assisted protected brush method. Obtained results of different
      methods will enable to determine if the bronchial secretion sample, stomach content sample or
      oropharyngeal smear are comparable to precise but technically difficult protected brush.
      Evaluation of the present clinical praxis using bronchial secretion sampling in HAP
      diagnostics and detection of the most common etiological agents in patients with HAP will be
      other priorities of the project. The role of atypical and fungal pathogens in HAP initiation
      will be discovered as well. Aiming to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of HAP, determine the
      sources and possible routes of bacterial pathogens transmission molecular biology analysis of
      etiological agents will be performed. Finally, percentage of HAP etiological agents resistant
      to initial empiric antibiotic therapy will be observed.

      Project fulfills program objectives of molecular-biologic approaches and research support in
      infectious diseases domain. It will make contribution to faster and more precise HAP
      diagnosis and adequate antibiotic therapy.
