      and flexibility exercise, usual care) and a total of 60 men and women who have completed
      therapy (> 6 months post primary or adjuvant therapy) to accomplish the specific aims. Equal
      numbers of men and women will be randomized into each arm of the study. Participants will be
      tested before, immediately after, and 3-months after treatment or similar time points for the
      usual care group. After data has been collected, participants who were randomized to the
      resistance and flexibility exercise group (active control group) or to the usual care group
      will be provided with the opportunity to participate in the yoga intervention.
