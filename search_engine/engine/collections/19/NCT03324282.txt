      control of immune response and provide access to molecules interfering with the inhibited
      immune response during the development of cancer. Drugs targeted against CTLA-4, PD-1 or
      PD-L1 have shown efficacy in various tumor types. In locally advanced or metastatic
      urothelial bladder cancer (MBC), the standard first-line treatment is the association of
      Gemcitabine and Cisplatin (GC). Objective responses and prolonged objective responses have
      been reported with monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 or PD-L1 in MBC patients after failure
      of chemotherapy. Avelumab is an investigational fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal
      antibody. Avelumab treatment did not show unexpected cross-toxicity with chemotherapy when
      studied in phase I / II in patients with different tumor types. So the combination at full
      doses of GC and avelumab seems appropriate.

      The experimental treatment is a combination of GC and avelumab given for 6 cycles. The
      duration of each cycle is 3 weeks (Gemcitabine: dose of 1000 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion
      over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle; Cisplatin: dose of 70 mg/m2 as a slow
      intravenous infusion over 2 to 4 hours on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; Avelumab: 10 mg/kg body
      weight administered Iv once every 3 weeks).

      Patients who have received all scheduled treatments and whose disease has not progressed at
      the end of treatment will enter into disease follow-up. During this follow-up period,
      patients will have disease and safety assessments performed every 3 months. Patients will
      remain in follow-up for up to 1 year from last dose of treatment and will have survival
      follow-up.
