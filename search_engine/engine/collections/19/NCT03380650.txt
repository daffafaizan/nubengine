      Endovascular treatment has been the first-line treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive
      disease. However, the in-stent re-stenosis has been a major limitation of well long-term
      patency rate after stent implantation. The chronic inflammation induced by stenting could be
      a main reason of re-stenosis. Then the concept "leave nothing behind" is proposed, and some
      novel treatment methods and devices, such as paclitaxel-coated balloon dilation, directional
      atherectomy, are developed. Directional atherectomy can effectively remove the
      atherosclerosis plaque but leave the inflammatory reaction along the atherectomy route. Here,
      we propose the hypothesis that using local drug delivery with balloon system can relieve the
      inflammation induced by atherectomy. Therefore, 40 patients of femoropopliteal occlusive
      disease will be randomly allocated into the group "directional atherectomy+local drug
      delivery with balloon system" or "drug-coated balloon only". The 1-year patency rate,
      incidence of complications, imaging parameters will be compared between groups.
