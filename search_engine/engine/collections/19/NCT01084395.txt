      Mexico. Given the high mortality rate associated with AIDS, the lack of available treatment,
      and the social stigma associated with the disease, prevention is the key to reducing the
      threat of AIDS among this important subgroup in Mexico. The study has four specific aims
      including 1) to determine whether the HIV risk-reduction intervention causes a greater
      increase in adolescents' intentions to abstain from intercourse and/or avoid unprotected
      intercourse at post-intervention and decreased self-reported intercourse and unprotected
      intercourse at 3, 6, 12, and 48 month follow-ups, compared with the general health promotion
      control intervention; 2) to determine whether the effects of the intervention are moderated
      by individual, microsystem, and macrosystem variables; 3) to identify theory-based variables
      that mediate effects of the HIV intervention on adolescents' self-reported behavior; and 4)
      to determine whether the HIV risk-reduction intervention causes a greater increase in
      parents' comfort with, and quantity of communication (general and HIV specific) with
      adolescents at post-intervention, 3, 6, 12, and 48 month follow-up compared with the general
      health promotion control intervention.
