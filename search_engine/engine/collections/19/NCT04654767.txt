      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are often complicated by the presence of pulmonary
      hypertension (PH), where even a mild elevation of blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is
      associated with an even poorer prognosis. In this study, we will investigate whether
      similarities exist in the inflammatory profile that could potentially underlie all forms of
      pulmonary hypertension. Inflammatory data will be generated using flow cytometry, expression
      profiling and histological analysis and compared to the associated clinical data.
