    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase 1b/2 study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of tabelecleucel in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of subjects
      with platinum-pretreated, recurrent/metastatic EBV+ NPC.

      Tabelecleucel will be selected for each subject from the bank of available tabelecleucel cell
      products based on matching â‰¥ 2 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, at least one of which
      is a restricting HLA allele, shared between the tabelecleucel donor and the subject's EBV+
      NPC. Sites will provide high resolution HLA typing of the subject and other information as
      required by the protocol.

      Phase 1b will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterize the dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) for tabelecleucel in combination with pembrolizumab in up to 24 subjects. In
      the absence of an MTD, the recommended Phase 2 dose will be identified. Phase 2 will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the combination in 36 subjects at the recommended dose level from
      Phase 1b.
