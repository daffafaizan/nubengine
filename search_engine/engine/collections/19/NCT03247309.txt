    
      SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) screening
      and the main biomarkers screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be
      taken during leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA201 product.

      MANUFACTURING: IMA201 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

      TREATMENT: Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will occur in the days
      before the IMA201 infusion to improve the duration of time that IMA201 stays in the body.

      After IMA201 infusion, a low dose of IL-2 will be given twice daily for a period of time.

      Patients will be closely monitored for safety and for a total of 3 years post IMA201
      infusion.
