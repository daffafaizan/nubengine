      very early preterm birth in patients who are scheduled to have an exam indicated cerclage for
      severe cervical shortening.

      Prior to participants undergoing a scheduled amniocentesis, an ultrasound will be done to
      confirm cervical length and dilation. During a separate sterile speculum exam, the physician
      will use two swabs to collect vaginal secretions for the VF test. During the amniocentesis
      the doctor will remove approximately 2 teaspoon of amniotic fluid as part of your standard
      clinical care. From that fluid sample, the study will use less than a quarter teaspoon for a
      amniotic fluid study test (AF test). Data regarding maternal and birth outcomes will be
      collected by medical record review.

      The vaginal fluid (VF) sample collection will take approximately 15 minutes to do. The total
      time in the study is about seven and a half months (from the time the patient consents until
      4 weeks after delivery). The only study procedure the patient will experience during her
      study participation is the collection of the vaginal fluid specimens.
