      enrollment per protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Enrolled patients will then undergo
      ablation using the FARAPULSE Endocardial Ablation System. Subjects will be followed at 7
      days, 30 days, 75 days, 6 months, and 12 months with a blanking period for recurrent atrial
      fibrillation or atrial tachycardia of 3 months following the PEF (pulsed electric field)
      catheter ablation procedure.
