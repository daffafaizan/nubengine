           upper limb function of children with cerebral palsy compared to conventional
           occupational therapy

        -  Subjects: total 30 children with cerebral palsy whose upper limb functions are impaired
           (all 30 children will receive the conventional occupational therapy, but 15 of these
           children will receive the additional video-game based rehabilitation therapy)

        -  Intervention: 4 weeks of therapy (6 days per week)

        -  Studies: functional MRI, computerized motion analysis, upper limb functional assessment
           (MUUL, ULPRS), ADL evaluation, cognitive evaluation

        -  Evaluation plan: 1) pre-intervention, 2) post-4 weeks of intervention, 3) 8 weeks after
           end of intervention
