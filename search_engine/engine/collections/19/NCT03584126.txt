      and mortality in humans. Histopathological studies of persistent AF have reported
      extracellular matrix remodeling with fibrotic infiltration which may cause atrial dilation.
      The degree of the fibrosis might have a significant impact on wave propagation during AF. The
      main objective of the present project is to develop an imaging-based tool to determine the
      origin and cause of persistent AF. The obtained clinical parameters of patients and controls
      (electrocardiography, ecocardiography and MR imaging data) will be correlated with known
      markers in order to identify novel markers for AF diagnosis.
