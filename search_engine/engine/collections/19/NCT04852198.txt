    
      Rationale: to compare two different types of gastric bypass operations on surgical outcome.

      Objective: to compare two established procedures in order to find the optimal procedure in
      terms of weight loss and metabolic control that is associated with the fewest side-effects
      and complications, and decreased invasiveness.

      Study design: A multicentre, open label, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial Study
      population: Patients are eligible for inclusion if their body-mass index (BMI) was 40 kg/m2
      or higher, or 35 kg/m2 or higher with the presence of at least one comorbidity (type 2
      diabetes, high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnoea, dyslipidaemia, osteoarthritis of the
      hip or knee) and a positive evaluation by our bariatric multidisciplinary team (BMDT) and are
      aged 18-65.

      Intervention: Group 1: One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass with 150cm biliopancreatic limb. Group
      2: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with biliopancreatic limb of 150cm and 75cm alimentary limb.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary endpoint:

      % Excess BMI loss at two years

      Secondary endpoints:

      Metabolic status Nutritional status Comorbidity remission QOL Complications or serious
      adverse events (SAE's)
