      B94 plus inulin addition to the standard triple therapy on the eradication rates of
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in children. The subjects are children between 6 to
      16 years old who had biopsy proven H. pylori infection. The subjects will be randomly
      classified into two groups. The first group will receive the standard triple therapy
      consisting of amoxicillin oral tablet (50 mg/kg/day) + clarithromycin oral tablet (15
      mg/kg/day) + omeprazole oral capsule (1mg/kg/day). The second group will receive the standard
      triple therapy and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis B94 (5000000000 colony forming
      units/dose) plus inulin (900 mg) containing sachet for 14 days, concurrently. Eradication
      will be determined by 14-Carbon-urea breath test 4-6 weeks after therapy discontinuation. The
      eradication rates, the occurrence of side effects and the alterations of initial symptoms
      will be compared between the groups.
