      and 29 will be randomized to either receive the same-day treatment initiation of the
      FDA-approved fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir 400mg and velpatasvir 100mg (SOF/VEL) with
      follow up and medical monitoring at a community site (Intervention arm) or to receive
      referral to an HCV treatment provider's office (Usual Care Arm).
