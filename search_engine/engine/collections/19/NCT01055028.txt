      analyzed together as far as outcome.

      Patients were to receive paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 intravenously over 3 hours every 21 days
      (Regimen A) or pactlitaxel 90 mg/m2 weekly x 3 of a 28 day cycle (Regimen B) followed by
      bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously over (cycle 1: 90 min; cycle 2: 60 min; cycles 3-6: 30
      min) every 21 days x 6 cycles. Maintenance bevacizumab (MB) started after the completion of
      combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab and it was given at a dose of 15 mg/kg
      intravenously once every 21 days for a maximum of 8 cycles. Patients were allowed to receive
      growth factors. Dose reductions were done based on hematologic and non-hematologic
      toxicities.
