      Measurement of colloid osmotic pressure (COP) both in plasma and in interstitial fluid can be
      utilised in planing of fluid therapy in patients with oedema. Different methods of sampling
      interstitial fluid are well validated in animal models, but not in human. Sampling of
      interstitial fluid by subcutaneous sewn wicks is a well-known method and can be painful.
      Local anaesthetics can reduce pain. By comparing interstitial fluid taken from areas with or
      without application of local anaesthetics, a possible influence in COP values can be
      detected.
