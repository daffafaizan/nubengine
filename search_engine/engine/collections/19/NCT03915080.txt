      according to ethics approval, report bleeding events during previous 6 months. Blood samples
      are taken, FVIII analyzed (Advate patients) and the individual PK curve determined using
      MyPKFit. The curve will be discussed together with the patient and levels related to bleed
      events determined. If needed dose adjustment is done based on the curve. After a further 6
      month follow-up bleeds will again be evaluated as well as factor consumption. In this way a
      better personalized treatment based on PK and clinical phenotype will hopefully be achieved.
