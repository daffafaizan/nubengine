      pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight and cesarean section. To against these adverse
      events, vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and lactation is recommended, but dose ranges
      are varied. Then, this study is carried out in lactating mothers and their breastfed infants
      with maternal 25 Hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) levels of 10-30 ng/ml in third trimester. Subjects
      are divided into 2 groups, one is randomly assigned to 1,800 IU/d compared with maternal and
      infant controls receiving placebo. Maternal serum 25OHD and milk VitD will be measured by
      LC-MS/MS during lactation, and on cord blood at 6 weeks breastfed infants. This study is
      submitted for ethical consideration by relevant Ethics committee.
