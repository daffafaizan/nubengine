      therapy on weight loss and improvement of vascular function compared to phentermine
      monotherapy in obese patients (BMI 27 kg/m2) with metabolic risk and back pain.

      Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (12 weeks), Patients: Obese patients (BMI 27
      kg/m2) with metabolic risk and back pain

      The patients were divided into two groups: orlistat (120mg, three times a day), phentermine
      (37.5 mg, once a day) combined Group (N = 57), placebo (placebo, three times a day) and
      phentermine (37.5 mg, once a day) Group (N=57).

      Randomly assigned to each group at 1: 1, and allocation codes are generated using SAS (Ver.
      9.2). The investigators provide orlistat and phentermine or placebo and phentermine. The
      investigators check physical measurement, blood test, questionnaire, blood pressure and
      pulse, body composition, FMD, heart rate variability test, in the first visit. The
      investigators check for changes in body weight, compliance, and side effects after 4 weeks
      and 8 weeks, respectively. After 12 weeks, the investigators re-check physical measurement,
      blood test, questionnaire, blood pressure and pulse, body composition, FMD, heart rate
      variability test.
