      different areas of Taiwan. We will do

        1. Comparison of gene variants in EV71 cases with different severity and normal children in
           different areas of Taiwan to find susceptible genes and genetic polymorphism related to
           the clinical outcomes

        2. Social, behavioral and environmental factors related to EV71 infections in different
           areas of Taiwan
