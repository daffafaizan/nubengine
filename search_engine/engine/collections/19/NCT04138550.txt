      Globally, there is substantial evidence indicating that low household income, lack of
      education, poor living conditions and inadequate psychosocial social support are potential
      risk factors for morbidity and premature death. Despite that, worldwide, there is scarcity in
      evidence on potential social determinants of oral health among different population groups.

      Aim of study

      To identify the potential social determinants with an influence on oral health status of
      Egyptian women.

      Materials and methods

      A total of 300 Egyptian women in childbearing age (18-49 years) will be recruited from 4
      Primary healthcare units in Qalyubia governorate in Egypt. Four trained investigators will
      conduct a face-to face interview with study participants to gather data on potential
      structural and intermediary social determinants of health using a questionnaire. The
      questionnaire is based upon The Commission on Social Determinants of Health (CSDH) conceptual
      framework which was set up by the World Health Organization in 2005. This tool includes
      questions on socioeconomic position, material factors and living conditions, psychosocial
      factors and behavioral factors. Caries experience and gingival health of participants will be
      determined using DMFT, DMFS and CPITN indices respectively.
