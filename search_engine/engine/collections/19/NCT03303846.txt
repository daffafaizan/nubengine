      I. To determine the number of high risk women with abnormal screening breast MRI and
      morphologically normal biopsy over 7 years.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if WNT10B/mutant p53 expression as measured in the 0-month biopsy predicts
      women with an abnormal MRI/non-cancerous biopsy who will progress to cancer over 7 years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the predictive accuracy of WNT10B with MRI, of which will be compared with
      MRI alone using the C-index.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo standard of care high risk breast cancer screening MRIs at baseline and
      follow-up and blood sample collection at baseline. Participants undergo collection of breast
      tissue samples at any breast biopsy or breast surgery.
