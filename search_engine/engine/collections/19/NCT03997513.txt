      rate and lead to improvement in exercise capacity and quality of life in stable COPD.
      However, data regarding the feasibility and impact of pulmonary telerehabilitation following
      hospitalization for an Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD)
      on physical activity levels, muscle function, exercise capacity, and health-related quality
      of life are lacking. The primary hypothesis is that a home-based pulmonary telerehabilitation
      program initiated at hospital discharge following an AECOPD is feasible in the Veteran
      population and will result in increased physical activity and greater improvement in muscle
      function, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life compared to usual care. This
      hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims: (1) To determine the feasibility
      of an eight-week home-based pulmonary telerehabilitation program in Veterans with moderate to
      severe COPD initiated in the immediate post-hospitalization period following an AECOPD. (2)
      To determine physical activity levels and the magnitude and variability in changes of
      measurements of muscle strength, functional exercise performance, and health-related quality
      of life following an eight-week home-based pulmonary telerehabilitation program versus usual
      care initiated in Veterans with moderate to severe COPD immediately following hospitalization
      for an AECOPD. The study will randomize (1:1 allocation) 30 male and female Veterans
      hospitalized with an AECOPD to either an eight-week, three sessions per week, home-based
      pulmonary telerehabilitation program that includes lower extremity endurance exercises with a
      cycle ergometer and upper and lower extremity strength training with 1:1 supervision via
      video conferencing with an exercise physiologist as well as a twice-monthly online support
      group via video conferencing versus usual care. Changes from baseline in physical activity
      levels, handgrip and quadriceps muscle strength, exercise endurance, and health-related
      quality of life will be assessed following the pulmonary telerehabilitation program versus
      usual care. Findings from this project will contribute to the growing field of pulmonary
      telerehabilitation and will provide critical preliminary data for the design and
      implementation of a larger, randomized control trial assessing the impact of pulmonary
      telerehabilitation on long-term clinical outcomes following AECOPD.
