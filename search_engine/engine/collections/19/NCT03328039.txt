      risk prediction to become logistically easier, cost effective and used more broadly. It will
      use low cost wearable technology to complement or act as a surrogate to complex CPET testing
      performed for perioperative risk stratification. The data gained from a Garmin Vivosmart HR+
      wearable device, will be used in the community by patients awaiting surgery, and will be
      correlated with key CPET indices including anaerobic threshold and peak VO2. Ultimately, this
      study aims to assess whether wearable technology can provide the data needed for the
      formation of prediction models to risk assess perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing
      high-risk elective surgery. In addition, an International Physical Activity Questionnaire
      (IPAQ) will be completed to compare the activity captured with self-reported activity. This
      will be combined with frailty scores and handgrip strength as is routinely collected during
      CPET. Finally, a saliva based genetic analysis will be conducted on genetic variations known
      to be of significance in critical illness and response to physical stress. This will be
      delivered by a laboratory (Fitness Genes) that has developed a bespoke panel of genetic
      markers ideally suited to this patient cohort.
