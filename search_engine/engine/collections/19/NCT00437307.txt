      combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel as well as the combination of carboplatin with
      gemcitabine. Choice of therapy is individual due to missing randomized comparisons between
      the regimes. Topotecan has shown good efficacy in second-line therapy of ovarian cancer as
      well as a good, especially, non-hematoxic toxicity profile. Several phase II-studies have
      demonstrated a synergistic effect of topotecan in combination with carboplatin exhibiting
      good efficacy and tolerability.

      It shall be tested in this randomized phase III-study if the combination of topotecan and
      carboplatin shows improvement of progression-free survival in comparison to the standard
      regimes.
