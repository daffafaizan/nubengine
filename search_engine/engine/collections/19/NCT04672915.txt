      aspartate aminotransferase（AST）, and albumin, etc. using a Hitachi 7600 automatic analyzer
      and reagent system (Hitachi, Tokyo, japan). HBsAg quantification was performed using
      automated electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) manufactured by Roche. HBsAb, HBeAg,
      HBeAb and HBcAb were measured semi-quantitatively using Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA)
      manufactured by Abbott Diagnostics (USA). Serum HBV DNA levels were measured using the COBAS
      TaqMan HBV Monitor Test, with a lower limit of detection of 20 IU/mL (100 copies/mL).

      The false negative result excluding OBI due to Real time PCR (lower limit of 20 IU/ml)
      technically may exist. The study group plan to carry out nested PCR (specifically target the
      HBV Pre-S, S, Pre-C/Core, and X open reading frames) on subjects with HBsAg (-) HBV DNA (-)
      and HBcAb(+) to double check the potential false negative result in HBV DNA from Real time
      PCR. Quantitation of intrahepatic HBV cccDNA by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).
