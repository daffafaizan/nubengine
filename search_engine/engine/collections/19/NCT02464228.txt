    
      This Phase II study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory PTCL. The first 18 subjects may be of the following PTCL
      sub-types: PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
      (AITL), ALK-positive and negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), hepatosplenic T-cell
      lymphoma, enteropathy-associate T-cell lymphoma (EATL), extranodal natural killer (NK) T-cell
      lymphoma, nasal type and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. The AITL expansion
      cohort (N=32) will enroll only subjects with AITL. An additional cohort of patients (N=12)
      expressing the wild type CXCL12 3' UTR will be enrolled in order to explore the benefits of
      tipifarnib treatment observed in patients having an absence of this gene variation or single
      nucleotide variation (SNV).

      Tumor response assessments will be conducted according to Lugano Classification and/or mSWAT
      criteria.

      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 8 weeks (cycles 2-6) and at least
      once approximately every 12 weeks thereafter (Cycles 9, 12, 15, etc.), and will continue
      until disease progression. Subjects experiencing a complete response may be considered for
      bone marrow transplantation. Upon disease progression, all subjects will be followed for
      survival and the use of subsequent therapy. All subjects will be followed for safety during
      treatment and up to approximately 30 days after treatment discontinuation or until before the
      initiation of another anti-cancer therapy. Additional follow up may be implemented until the
      subject recovers from any emergent treatment related toxicity or the adverse event is
      considered irreversible by the investigator.
