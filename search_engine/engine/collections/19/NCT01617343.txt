      hemifield eye patches over a period of 1 week in combination with daily sessions of
      optokinetic stimulation lead to a significant reduction of neglect behaviour as measured by
      total scores in a paper-and-pencil neglect test battery and/or an improvement in functional
      independence scores (Catherine-Bergego-Scale, Barthel Index) in a cohort of stroke patients
      with acute hemispatial neglect as compared to the spontaneous course of the disease in a
      control patient group without a neglect-specific treatment?
