      factors and to develop Patients Safety Checklists. Development will follow the steps in the
      Healthcare Failure Mode and Effects Analysis.

      The checklist intervention will be pilot tested and validated before is is rolled out.
      Patients safety checklists for patients to use are intended to enhance and increase patient
      involvement in surgical treatment. Further, using the checklists could contribute to reduced
      complications associated to surgery.
