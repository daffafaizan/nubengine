    
      Total 168 patients were recruited and randomized to receive either real or sham-LED-T. Real
      experimental groups were divided into three groups; CA group, VA group, CA+VA dual group.
      Each group received LED-T (30 min) once a day for 30 days. Each groups LED-T positioned at
      following locations;

        -  CA group on the superior border of the thyroid cartilage, and anterior to the
           sternocleidomastoid muscle based on Korea traditional therapy called Inyoung(ST9)

        -  VA group on the upper abdomen, spinous process of the 2nd cervical vertebra upper margin
           based on Korea traditional therapy called CunChu

        -  CA+VA dual group on the CA position (ST9), and VA position (BL10) The patients were
           initially evaluated at baseline, immediately, 4wks after intervention.

      Intervention :

        -  Low-level light therapy device (Peak wavelength:610nm, Power intensity: 1.7mW/cm2,
           Energy density: 2.0J/cm2, Skin-adhesive light-emitting probes: spot size, 1cm diameter),

           K-MBI, K-ADL, GDS, EQ-5D, Neurophysiological assessment: MEP, Motor evoked potential,
           Gene test(BNDF, ApoE)

      Study Arms

        -  Experimental : Sham control group and real stimulation group.

        -  In each group, total sessions of the Low-level light therapy (LED-T) was done for
           intervention was followed after that.

        -  Subjects received LED-T (30 min) once a day for 30 days.

        -  The sham control group was kept without LED-T
