      endpoint scan in 15 BPD patients who have been treated with olanzapine. The comparison of the
      scans will be done through a statistical image analysis, using a pixel-by-pixel group mean
      subtraction strategy with appropriate correction for multiple comparisons. In an exploratory
      fashion we will compare frontal and temporal regions of interest to address hypotheses of
      which areas of the brain might show changes with olanzapine treatment.

      A secondary objective is to use a normal database to compare the baseline PET scan of the 15
      patients in a medication free state to normal subjects. The advantage of this strategy is the
      ability to closely match subjects by gender and age. As noted earlier, Dr. Pardo has data on
      35 control subjects studied on the same scanner we plan to use for this study.
