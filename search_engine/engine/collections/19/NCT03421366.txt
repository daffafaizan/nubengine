      fungal pathogen in this patient population and thus far, voriconazole has been used first
      line. Apart from recurrent and chronic lung infections, people with cystic fibrosis can also
      have problems with their gastrointestinal tract and absorption, and can develop chronic liver
      disease. As a consequence, they are at high-risk for not achieving adequate antifungal
      levels, which may be due to altered oral bioavailability, and they may be more susceptible to
      hepatic toxicities.

      This study will evaluate the use of the newer modified release, once daily formulation of
      posaconazole in people with cystic fibrosis to identify if there is any difference in the
      bioavailability of the drug due to the effect of cystic fibrosis on the gastrointestinal
      tract. This newer formulation of once daily posaconazole is approved by the Therapeutic Goods
      Administration (TGA) and available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) since March
      2015. The newer formulation has the potential to overcome one of the major challenges with
      antifungals in cystic fibrosis; oral bioavailability. Posaconazole also appears to have
      reduced hepatotoxicity. This study will focus on the safety and tolerability of the drug, as
      well as pharmacological and microbiological endpoints.

      20 eligible participants will be enrolled and have a

        -  Pre-treatment sputum will be collected as standard of care.

        -  Posaconazole serum levels will be taken at days 2, 5 and 7. (Day 5 and 7 as standard of
           care).

        -  renal and liver function assessed whilst on treatment as standard of care.

        -  followed up for 30 days to assess tolerability and monitor for the development of liver
           toxicity
