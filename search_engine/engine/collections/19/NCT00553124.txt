        -  To assess the effect of lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, dietary habits, fluid intake,
           or environmental exposures) on the recurrence and progression of bladder cancer.

        -  To assess the impact of selenium and/or vitamin E on the progression and recurrence of
           bladder cancer.

        -  To study health-related quality of life and its association with recurrence and
           progression of bladder cancer.

        -  To establish a bladder cancer tissue bank that will comprise blood, urine, and bladder
           tissue.

        -  To study the predictive effect of molecular markers on the recurrence and progression of
           bladder cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      The study will be based on a cohort of patients with newly detected bladder cancer in all 16
      urological centres within the West Midlands, commencing in late 2005 for a period of 5 years.
      This research project consists of 5 individual studies: CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-COHORT,
      CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-MARKERS, CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-QOL, CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-TISSUE-BANK, and
      CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-TREATMENT. Patients may participate in all or only some of these individual
      studies.
