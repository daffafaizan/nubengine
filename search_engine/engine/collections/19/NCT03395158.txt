      registered patients. In order to evaluate trauma alert criteria implemented during 2017, we
      plan a prospective stepped wedge trial at six hospitals in the Uppsala/Ã–rebro region. These
      hospitals register in SweTrau and all had the same alert criteria prior to the implementation
      of new alert criteria.

      A power estimation show the need for 588 patients in each group in order to show a
      statistical difference between 2-5% undertriage at a 95% CI.

      The including hospitals has a population base of 1.300.000 inhabitants, and the annual number
      of trauma alerts has been about 3.000.

      The registry has information about time of trauma, initiated alerts, Injury Severity Score
      and mechanism of injury suitable for analysis for our hypothesis.
