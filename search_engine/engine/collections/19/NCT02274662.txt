      transplant because of lack of thymus function. As there are many types of patients who may be
      enrolled, study results will not have statistical significance. The study objective is to
      make thymus transplantation available on an expanded access basis. Data will be collected on
      survival, na√Øve T cell development, T cell chimerism, and transplant related toxicities, as
      well as any unexpected study related serious adverse events. Patients undergo thymus
      transplantation and may undergo allograft biopsy. Immune suppression may be given depending
      on the immune status and clinical condition. Protocol specified studies continue until
      approximately one year post-transplantation. Study participation lasts approximately two
      years or until asked to participate in a long-term follow-up protocol.
