    
      MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-Like Episodes), a
      progressive and often devastating multisystem disorder, is most commonly associated with
      mitochondrial Deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) point mutation at nucleotide 3243. Seizures,
      cognitive deterioration, and neurobehavioral abnormalities are frequent features of this
      disease which typically shortens life expectancy. Idebenone, an ATP production modulator and
      antioxidant, improves neurological function in Friedreich's ataxia, a disease also associated
      with mitochondrial dysfunction.

      Given that there is no effective treatment for MELAS, the investigators propose a Phase II
      proof of concept trial of idebenone to study its preliminary efficacy in patients with MELAS
      and the A3243G mtDNA mutation, and to study its safety and tolerability in this patient
      group.

      The investigators propose to evaluate 21 patients with the A3243G mitochondrial DNA mutation
      and MELAS (defined by a history of either seizures or stroke). Patients will receive
      idebenone (900 mg/day or 2250 mg/day) or matching placebo for one month. The primary outcome
      measure is cerebral lactate levels measured by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), a
      biomarker associated with disease worsening. This study will help the investigators to
      determine if there is sufficient signal to proceed to efficacy studies. Also it will provide
      additional information on the safety and tolerability of two different doses of idebenone in
      MELAS.
