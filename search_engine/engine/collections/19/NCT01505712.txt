        -  To explore the predictive power of a gene expression-based multi-gene predictor in
           classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) with the potential to change clinical practice by
           basing treatment decisions on biological markers.

      OUTLINE: Archived tissue samples are analyzed for gene expression profile using NanoString
      technology. Results are then compared with patients' treatment outcomes, including
      failure-free survival and overall survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 306 patients from ECOG-2496 (training cohort) and 87 patients
      treated with ABVD in other trials (validation cohort) will be accrued for this study.
