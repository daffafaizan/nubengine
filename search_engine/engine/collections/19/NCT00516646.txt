      100 patients (2x50) with stable CHF. Patients will be randomized to either 200 mg Alagebrium
      twice daily or placebo for a period of 9 months. Efficacy measurements will be performed at
      baseline, and at the end of the study, and include aerobic capacity (VO2max) exercise
      testing, echocardiography, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure score, AGEs measurements in
      blood and skin, NYHA heart failure class, patient's and physician's global assessment, and
      levels of NT-pro-BNP. Safety visits are performed at 3 months intervals. In addition, one
      safety visit will be performed 2 weeks after the randomization visit and 1 month after the
      last treatment visit. A total of 8 visits will be performed during the entire study.
