      to conventional ventilators, the Trilogy device achieves comparable level of gas exchange
      (measured as partial pressure of CO2 in arterial or venous blood)and SpO2 levels during
      various modes of ventilation.

      B. Secondary Hypothesis and end-points In patients with respiratory insufficiency, when
      compared to conventional ventilators, the Trilogy device achieves comparable breathing
      pattern (tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation), hemodynamics (heart rate), and
      subjective measures of breathing comfort (measured by modified Borg dyspnea scale).
