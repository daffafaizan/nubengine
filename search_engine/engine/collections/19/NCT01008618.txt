    
      This is a multi-center (conducted in more than one center), double-blind (neither the
      participant nor the physician knows the assigned study drug), randomized (participants
      assigned study drug by chance), withdrawal study in opioid-naive participants with
      osteoarthritis or low back pain. The study will consist of titration period (10-29 days) and
      double-blind period (12 weeks) and the visits will include Day 5-7, 8, 15, 29 in titration
      period and Day 2-4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71 and 85 in double-blind period. All the eligible
      participants will receive one-day adhesive transdermal patch (patch containing a drug that is
      put on the skin so the drug will enter the body through the skin) of either fentanyl at the
      dose ranging from 12.5 to 50 microgram per hour (mcg/hr) or matching placebo. Efficacy will
      be evaluated primarily by time to withdrawal due to insufficient analgesic efficacy.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
