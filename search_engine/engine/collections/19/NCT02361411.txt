    
      We recruited consecutive patients with intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH). Clinical data and the
      results of laboratory tests and CT will be assessed and recorded. All the subjects will get
      gene tests including many genes related with Aβ and small vessel disease (Next-generation
      sequencing and target enrichment system) .

      The result of the MRI Scans including cerebral microbleeds(CMBs)、Cortical superficial
      siderosis（cSS）, white matter change(WMC) and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) will be
      assessed using scales. Ocular fundus exams such as funduscopy and imaging will be used to
      assess multiple dot and blot hemorrhages and microaneurysms by ophthalmologist. Mini-mental
      state examination(MMSE) will be used to assess the cognitive function.

      Patients who need operation on the hematoma for the treatment will accept a brain tissue
      pathological exams According to this, a prospective cohort of CAA patients based on clinical
      manifestation, imaging, gene and histology will be built, and diagnostic tools such as gene
      and MRI results, etc will be explored. And we will get gene repertoire of Chinese patient
      with ICH.

      Then, the subjects will be followed up on 30-day, 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year.The patients'
      clinical outcome will be assessed , and the results of laboratory tests and therapy will be
      recorded. Prognostic factors of patients with CAA related ICH will be explored.
