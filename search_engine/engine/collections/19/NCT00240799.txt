      extended release 3900 mg/day compared with placebo in the relief of signs and symptoms of
      osteoarthritis of the hip or knee over 12 weeks. The hypothesis is that 3900 mg/day
      acetaminophen extended release is superior to placebo in the relief of signs and symptoms of
      osteoarthritis of the hip or knee with respect to the three primary effectiveness endpoints.
      Propoxyphene Hydrochloride Capsules, 65 mg, are used as rescue medication if subjects
      experience inadequate pain relief. The primary efficacy assessments are the average change
      from baseline through Week 12 for the WOMAC pain subscale score and the WOMAC physical
      function subscale score, and the subject's average global assessment of their response to
      therapy through Week 12. Safety assessments at study visits consist of monitoring adverse
      events, vital signs, study joint assessments and clinical laboratory determinations.
      Treatment consists of two acetaminophen 650 mg extended release caplets or two placebo
      caplets, administered orally every 8 hours for 12 weeks.
