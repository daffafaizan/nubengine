    
      This pilot RCT aims to evaluate the feasibility of a theory-based, tailored Mediterranean
      lifestyle education intervention (THINK-MED) to encourage behaviour change among participants
      who have subjective cognitive impairment.

      This study will be a 6 month randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a total of 30
      participants who will be randomised to 1 of 3 groups:

        1. Group 1 will receive the "THINK-MED" Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory
           resource on one occasion at baseline (n=10)

        2. Group 2 will receive the "THINK-MED" Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory
           resource at monthly intervals for 5 months, with an initial face-to-face visit from the
           research dietitian (month 1) and accompanied by telephone feedback (month 2-5) (n=10)

        3. Group 3 is a control group. Participants in this group will receive the "THINK-MED"
           Mediterranean Lifestyle Education for Memory resource after completing the 6 month study
           (n=10)
