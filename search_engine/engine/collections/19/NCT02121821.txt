      Uganda's National Health Record Program (NHRP) in order to inform strategic targeting of
      eHealth and future investments after the pilot phase of the NHRP mobile platform "SMS Mother
      Reminder". This impact evaluation will be designed to answer the following questions:

      Primary evaluation question:

      â€¢ What is the effect on maternal health outcomes (ANC4 and IPTP2) of the village health
      teams' use of the SMS Mother Reminder system?

      Secondary evaluation questions:

        -  What factors most influence changes in health workers, village health teams and
           expectant women's knowledge, attitudes and practices in maternal health?

        -  To what extent is using the SMS Mother Reminder application to track and inform pregnant
           women a cost-effective intervention from the perspectives of USAID?

        -  To what extent can users easily carry out specific tasks (e.g. entering the information
           of pregnant women) of the SMS Mother Reminder application on mobile devices?

      This study is funded by USAID through the African Strategies for Health project.
