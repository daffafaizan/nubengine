      Then the anesthesiologist will administer a bolus of 5mg ICG intravenously (2.5mg/ml, 2ml),
      followed by 10ml normal saline flush. The perfusion of colon will be assessed via
      fluorescence angiography. The actual bowel transection, after ICG fluorescence study, would
      be compared with the intended bowel transection site. The difference in terms of distance and
      either more proximal or distal is recorded. Then bowel anastomosis is completed in the usual
      manner.
