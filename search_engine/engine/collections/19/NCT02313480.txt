      massage or non-massage group in a primary care setting in the Dublin region. One therapist
      administered all treatments. Randomisation was carried out by the use of sequential sampling,
      utilising permuted blocks. Patients were excluded from the study if they had severe
      co-existing disease, had neck pain due to fracture, tumour, infection or other non-mechanical
      causes, or if the patient had a diagnosis of osteoporosis anywhere in the body.

      Both groups underwent up to eight weekly physiotherapy sessions. The non-massage group
      received exercise, manual therapy and advice over the 30 minute intervention period, in
      conjunction with an exercise program to perform at home. The massage group received all of
      the above as well as Swedish massage. Follow up was for the duration of treatment only.

      A number of T-tests and non-parametric tests were conducted to establish if the two groups
      were comparable at baseline.

      A mixed ANOVA was then used to analyse between-group and within-group data simultaneously. No
      blinding was possible, although the questionnaires were self-administered which may have
      limited bias.
