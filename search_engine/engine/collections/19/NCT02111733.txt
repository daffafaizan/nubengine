      Sherbrooke University Hospital Center to measure three blood level of high-sensibility
      troponins before and after standard dialysis. Verification on the variation of these levels
      after dialysis. Follow-up at 6 and 12 months of the patient for Cardiovascular events and
      death and verification of a possible predictive value of troponin blood levels for these
      events.
