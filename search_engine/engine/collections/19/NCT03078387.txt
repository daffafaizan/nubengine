      was asymptomatic and routine ophthalmic examination showed bilateral retinal hemorrhages and
      exudates close to both optic discs. This patient was on anti-coagulant treatment for atrial
      fibrillation. The finding of bilateral signs of retinal emboli necessitated immediate blood
      tests and dose adjustments of her medication.

      The second case did not have general symptoms other than mild evening chills and her eye
      examination again was the start point of intensive investigation to find the reason of her
      bilateral retinal emboli. Ultrasound studies revealed a life threatening reason that was
      urgently treated.
