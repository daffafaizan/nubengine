      safety of the combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel following treatment with
      cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin for the treatment of neoadjuvant breast cancer.

      Patients will receive standard doses of AC every 21 days for 4 cycles. This will be followed
      by weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days for 4 cycles given
      concurrently with pazopanib 800 mg PO daily starting with the first paclitaxel dose and
      continuing until 7 days before surgery. Clinical complete response rate will be determined by
      tumor assessments performed by palpation at two time points: following AC (before
      paclitaxel/pazopanib begins) and 2-4 weeks following the last dose of paclitaxel (before
      surgery). Following recovery from preoperative therapy, patients will undergo the
      clinically-indicated surgery. Pazopanib will resume 4-6 weeks after surgery and continue
      daily for 6 months of postoperative pazopanib therapy.
