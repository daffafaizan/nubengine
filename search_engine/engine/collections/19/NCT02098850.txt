    
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most common causes of bloodstream infections.
      Associated mortality has been reported to vary widely (4%-40%) although no obvious
      explanation for such variation has been identified.

      Despite the existence of clinical guidelines, there is considerable variation in the
      management of S.aureus bacteraemia (SAB) between centres. Part of the variation in clinical
      management is due to the limited evidence base defining optimal therapy. Fewer than 1500
      patients have been recruited to randomised controlled trials in the past 40 years; practice
      is therefore based largely on experience and observational studies.

      The purpose of this evaluation is to record the management and outcome of adults with SAB
      across multiple European, Asian and North American sites. We aim to establish a broader
      knowledge base, identify key quality indicators associated with improved outcomes, and to
      provide comparator data to ensure that patients enrolled in randomized controlled trials are
      representative of bacteraemic S. aureus patients as a whole. All participating centres are
      experienced in the management of S. aureus bacteraemia and in conducting evaluations of
      current management practice and outcomes from S. aureus bacteraemia. Data is checked for
      plausibility by a centralized data quality control group.
