      system connected wirelessly. The device provides real time adherence aids to the patient and
      this information is relayed to the provider. The device can sense the amount of pills
      remaining inside the bottle. This information is measured periodically and concurrently sent
      to a secure database using cellular data technology. Thus, AdhereTech bottles can be used to
      determine whether medication was removed from the bottle, the amount of medication removed,
      and the timing of removal.

      Participants ages 12.0-17.99 who are receiving HU prescribed in pill form will use the
      AdhereTech smart bottle for a two-month period. Participants and their caregivers will
      complete self-report measures of adherence at the baseline, 1 month and 2 month clinic
      visits, a Demographic questionnaire at the baseline clinic visit and an Acceptability
      questionnaire at the 1 month and 2 month clinic visits using Audio Computer-Assisted
      Self-Interviews (ACASI) on a password protected laptop.

      Lab values and clinical information will be obtained through medical records review and
      adherence information from pill counts and pharmacy records.
