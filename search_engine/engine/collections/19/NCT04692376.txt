      diseases. Although great progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side
      effects associated with transplantation,chronic graft-versus-host disease(cGVHD) remains an
      important complication that occurs in about 50% patients. The mortality of cGVHD and its
      complication could reach up to 50%,and cGVHD seriously influence the quality of life. At
      present, the first line treatment of cGVHD remains in discussion.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated
      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs
      are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and
      treating GVHD after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of treatment of cGVHD remains
      undetermined.

      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of ex-vivo-expanded MSCs in treating patients with cGVHD.
