      A clearer understanding of this role and its magnitude, and a means of controlling the
      effects of outdoor allergen exposures is needed. We propose Poisson time-series and
      conditional panel studies to test these hypotheses: 1) The incidence of acute asthma attacks,
      as measured by urgent care inhalation treatments and hospitalizations for asthma, has a
      dose-dependent relationship with exposure to specific outdoor allergens; 2) Specific
      sensitization to outdoor allergens is a risk factor for having an acute attack; and 3)
      Exposure conditions that lead to acute asthma attacks can be forecast, creating an
      opportunity to reduce asthma morbidity and mortality ny targeting pretreatment and/or
      exposure controls.
