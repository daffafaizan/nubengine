      state of knowledge there is no strong evidence that its use could lower incidence of chronic
      pain compared to general anesthesia alone.

      Moreover for its use an adequate skill with ultrasound machine is required. For this reason
      only some anesthesiologists in our reality use this technique it in clinical practice.
