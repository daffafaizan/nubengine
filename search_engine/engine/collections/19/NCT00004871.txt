        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of azacitidine in combination with phenylbutyrate in
           patients with recurrent, refractory, or untreated acute myeloid leukemia or
           myelodysplastic syndrome.

        -  Determine the minimal effective pharmacologic dose of azacitidine required to
           consistently inhibit DNA methyltransferase in this patient population.

        -  Obtain preliminary clinical and/or laboratory data suggesting potential therapeutic
           activity of this combination regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose deescalation study of azacitidine.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously daily on days 1-5 and 29-33 followed by
      phenylbutyrate IV continuously on days 5-12 and 33-40. Treatment continues for at least 2
      courses in the absence of disease progression. Patients with responsive disease may receive
      an additional 2 months of therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive deescalating doses of azacitidine until the minimal effective
      pharmacologic dose (MEPD) is determined. The MEPD is defined as the dose above the dose at
      which more than 1 of 6 patients do not meet the target enzyme inhibition of greater than 90%.

      Once the MEPD and toxicity have been established for a 5 day schedule, daily dose schedule of
      azacitidine is increased to 10, 14, and 21 days, followed by phenylbutyrate for 7 days.
      Courses are repeated every 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
