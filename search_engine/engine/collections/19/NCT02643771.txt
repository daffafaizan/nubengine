      (full-mouth scaling and root planing). Clinical parameters will be assessed in all teeth
      (except third molars) by one experienced and trained examiner before treatment and every 3
      months for 2 years. Visible plaque index (VPI) will be represented a mean percentage of sites
      with visible plaque calculated for all teeth analyzed (four sites per tooth). Others
      parameters will be assessed at six sites per tooth using a manual periodontal probe (15mm).
      Bleeding on probing (BOP) will be represented the mean percentage of sites with bleeding (up
      to 15 seconds after probing) calculated for all teeth analyzed. Probing depth (PD - distance
      between the gingival margin and the bottom of the sulcus/pocket), gingival recession (GR -
      distance between the cementoenamel junction and gingival margin) and clinical attachment
      level (CAL - distance between the cementoenamel junction and the bottom of the sulcus/pocket)
      will be represented a mean distance calculated per site for all teeth analyzed. For blood
      parameters, an outside laboratory will perform all blood analysis. It will be requested for
      each subject with diabetes (DG) at baseline, each 3 months post-treatment. Fasting plasma
      glucose (FPG) will be expressed in milligrams per deciliter and HbA1c will be expressed as a
      percentage. Statistical analysis will be performed using an available software program and
      the patient will be considered as the unit of analysis.The data will be processed and
      analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics, probably nonparametric.
