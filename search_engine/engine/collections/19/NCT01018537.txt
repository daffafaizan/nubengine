      largest voluntary, patient driven MS registry. The registry involves personnel from at least
      three other sites in the US and Canada (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University of Alabama at
      Birmingham, and the University of Manitoba in Canada). Over the past 20 years more than
      38,000 people with MS across the U.S., Canada and over 50 other countries, including over
      4,000 Veterans, have participated in the registry by submitting their health-related data by
      mail or online. Registry data have been featured in over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles,
      scientific posters and presentations. These reports have provided information to guide new
      research. They also provide evidence supporting the approval of new drugs in the fight
      against MS.

      The North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) is supported in part by
      the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), a not-for-profit professional
      organization for multiple sclerosis (MS) healthcare providers and researchers involving 198
      participating centers of the MS treatment and research community.
