      our current NSC project (NSC95-2320-B-039-037-MY3) and found that patients who later
      developed IFN-α-induced depression (case group, 21/63) had lower PUFA levels before starting
      IFN-α therapy than control group (p=0.024). In addition, there was a trend for a negative
      correlation (r=-0.224; p=0.078) between baseline DHA levels and the highest scores of BDI
      during IFN therapy in the whole group. These findings indicate that n-3 PUFAs might play a
      protective factor.

      This 3-year proposal is divided into 2 clinical studies. In study 1, we aim to test the
      prophylactic effect of n-3 PUFAs (EPA: 3.5 g/d and DHA: 1.75 g/d versus placebo: high oleic
      oil) for IFN-α-induced sickness behaviour and depressive symptoms, in a two-week,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 152 patients with HCV starting IFN-α therapy. In
      study 2, we will test the antidepressant effect of n-3 PUFAs (EPA: 3.5 g/d and DHA: 1.75 g/d
      versus placebo: high oleic oil) on IFN-α-induced depression during IFN-α therapy, in an
      eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 80 HCV patients who have already
      developed depression.
