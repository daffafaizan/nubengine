      and liver failure. The treatment for end stage liver disease is hepatic transplantation. It
      is therefore important the patients with chronic HCV infection be recognized and treated
      before they develop advanced disease. The most effective therapy for patients with chronic
      HCV appears to be the combination of peginterferon-alpha-2b (PEG-Intron) plus ribavirin.
      Overall, 54% of patients treated with these medications achieve sustained virologic response.
      Response to therapy is greatly enhanced in those patients who can tolerate this therapy and
      remain on treatment without the need for dose reduction. The single most common reason for
      reducing the dose of ribavirin is anemia. Ribavirin causes a dose dependent hemolytic anemia
      and this side effect is believed to be exacerbated by the marrow suppressive effects of
      interferon. Preliminary studies have suggested that anemia can be overcome with the use of
      erythropoetin. The present pilot study will test the hypothesis that treatment with
      Epoetin-alph will allow patients with chronic HCV to utilize higher doses of ribavirin along
      with PEG-Intron therapy and that this will lead to a more rapid decline in HCV RNA titer and
      an increase in sustained virologic response.
