      acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) and a NMDA receptor
      antagonist (memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease). These medications have
      shown to have an effect on some cognitive and non cognitive symptoms of the pathology.
      However, their efficacy remains limited and may decrease with time. There is an unmet medical
      need in this pathology. Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to
      exert a neuroprotective effect through its activity on mast cells and other non-neuronal
      cells of the central nervous system, with subsequent modulation of inflammatory and
      neurodegenerative processes, as well as possibly disruption of the AÎ² signaling cascade via
      inhibition of the Fyn signaling pathway. This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of oral masitinib. The objective of this study is to
      compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib at various doses versus matched placebo in the
      treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. Masitinib will be
      administered as add-on therapy in patients who have been treated for a minimum of 6 months
      with a stable dose of cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine)
      and/or memantine. Approximately 675 patients will be randomized into 5 treatment groups. The
      co-primary outcome measures are the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily
      Living score (ADCS-ADL), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale score
      (ADAS-Cog) after 24 weeks of treatment.
