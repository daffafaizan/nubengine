      demonstrating hand washing. The initial study demonstrated improvement in hand washing
      technique with a verbal explanation of hand washing technique using an Illinois Department of
      Public Health handout and viewing one of the handwashing videos one time. The study
      demonstrated a statistical significant difference between learning by viewing the handout and
      a video of an adult with DS washing his hands vs just viewing the handout.viewing a handout
      Likely due to small sample size, the study did not demonstrate statistical significance
      between watching the video of a person with DS washing his hands vs watching the other videos
      but the trend for the best improvement in handwashing technique was for the group viewing
      another person with DS demonstrating the handwashing. The hypothesis of this study is that
      repeated viewing of a video and practicing hand washing will lead to even greater improvement
      in hand washing technique.
