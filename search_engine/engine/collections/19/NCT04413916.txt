      expression mainly by inhibition of messenger RNAs translation. Recent studies have indicated
      association of miRNAs with pathological processes following kidney transplantation.

      The aim of the study is to determine whether selected miRNAs are related to specific disease
      process or only reflect kidney graft function.

      The study enrolled 100 Caucasian KTRs, who presented with stable renal function (as indicated
      by stable serum creatinine (Cr) for 3 months and whose kidney graft function was thereafter
      estimated with various methods, including: cystatin C concentration, three different CKD EPI
      equations and measured with chromium-51 ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid clearance.

      Expression of 6 selected miRNAs (miR-29c, miR-126, miR-146a, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-223)
      was determined by qPCR using miRNA-103a, miR-191, and miR-423 as reference genes.
