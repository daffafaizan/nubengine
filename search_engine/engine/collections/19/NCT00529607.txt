      injury). Various contributing mechanisms have been discussed in experimental studies, e.g.
      disturbances in coronary microcirculation and consecutive induction of inflammatory cascades
      involving formation of reactive oxygen species. The ischemia / reperfusion injury causes
      diastolic and regional as well as global systolic dysfunction. The time course of the
      reperfusion injury within the first hours after reperfusion and its effects on the global
      geometry of the left ventricle have not been investigated so far. In the present study a
      comprehensive morphological and functional characterisation of the ischemia / reperfusion
      injury in the acute phase is performed. New cardiac imaging modalities (2D, 3D
      echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, strain analysis and cardiac MRI)and biochemical
      parameters including the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway and inflammatory cascades are
      applied. Hereby morphological and biochemical markers for the functional recovery of
      myocardial function should be identified.
