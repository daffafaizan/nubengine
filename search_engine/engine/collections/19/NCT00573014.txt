    
      All OBTPs with gross movement of all four extremities admitted to MetroHealth Medical Center
      (MHMC), the regional Level I Trauma Center in Cleveland OH, who underwent a CT CS at MHMC
      between October 2006 and September 2008 will be included. Prospective data will be collected
      on these patients including age, gender, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on
      admission, results of CT CS, GCS at the time of collar clearance, day of collar clearance,
      collar complications, date of reexamination, and results of reexamination. We will define an
      obtunded patient as a patient who was unable to reliably describe the presence or absence of
      CS symptoms in the opinion of the examining physician. Patients needed to have gross movement
      of all four extremities to be included in the study; if they did not, they were excluded. The
      presence or lack of sensory examination was not evaluated for the purposes of this study. We
      will define cervical collar complications as skin breakdown identified either by the skin
      care team during weekly rounds in the intensive care unit or by the treating physician at any
      time.
