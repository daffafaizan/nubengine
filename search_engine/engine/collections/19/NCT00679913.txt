      extensive surgery may improve outcome for patients with localized, operable pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. Initial retrospective reports from centers in Japan suggested that 5-year
      overall survival rates in patients treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy plus extended
      lymphadenectomy were higher than those in patients treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy with
      standard lymphadenectomy. Subsequent prospective randomized trials performed in Europe and
      the United States failed to confirm a survival benefit from extended lymphadenectomy.
      Although they failed to confirm a survival benefit from extended lymphadenectomy, the studies
      had a few pitfalls. The need for Well-designed randomised controlled study is the starting
      point of our study. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that more extensive nodal
      and soft-tissue clearance in patients with adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas would
      improve survival without an increase in morbidity and mortality.
