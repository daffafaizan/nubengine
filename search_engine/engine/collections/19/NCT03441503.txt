      has proven promising. Specifically, a pilot of administration on the day of discharge using
      tablet computers increased response rates, especially among hard to reach groups.

      To further explore modes of Child HCAHPS day of discharge administration, the Center of
      Excellence for Pediatric Quality Measurement (CEPQM) at BCH is collaborating with
      GetWellNetwork (GetWell), a company that provides interactive education material for patient
      televisions, to enable parents and guardians to complete Child HCAHPS on the day of discharge
      from the inpatient television. For this multisite study, parents of hospitalized children
      from BCH and participating sites will be randomized at the time of discharge to either
      receiving Child HCAHPS on the day of discharge on the inpatient television or standard Child
      HCAHPS administration via mail or email. The study will continue for up to six months at each
      participating site.
