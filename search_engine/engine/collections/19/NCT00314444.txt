    
      Objective:

      To apply respiratory biofeedback to patients with Psychogenic Movement Disorders (PMD) with a
      goal of decreasing involuntary movements.

      Study Population:

      Patients diagnosed with "clinically definite" PMD based on the Fahn-Williams scale

      Design: Open-label pilot study

      Outcome measures:

        -  To evaluate a possible decrease or resolution in involuntary movements caused by PMD as
           measured by the Psychogenic Movement Disorder Scale. Videotaping will be performed pre-
           and post-treatment and the videos will be evaluated by movement disorder specialists who
           are blinded to the pre-treatment or post-treatment condition.

        -  To evaluate if respiratory biofeedback is an effective treatment for patients with PMD.

        -  To retrospectively evaluate the components of anxiety and depression with responders
           versus non-responders.
