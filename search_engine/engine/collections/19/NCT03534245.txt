      particularly in Southeast Asia. When mosquitoes deliver the virus into the skin of humans
      while probing for a blood meal, they deposit also saliva, which contains a myriad of
      pharmacologically active compounds that modulate the host immune system. Most vaccines
      against vector-borne diseases under development ignore the importance of the complex
      infectious inoculum delivered by the mosquito vector and the subsequent host immune response
      to mosquito salivary proteins. Many studies of vector-borne disease do not evaluate what role
      vector-derived factors play in the host immune response of these infections. A cumulative
      body of evidence from animal models and limited retrospective human data demonstrates that a
      variety of vector-derived components, including salivary components, are codelivered with the
      pathogen and may play an important role in the establishment and dissemination of arboviral
      infection. Knowledge of the effect of these vector-derived factors on the development of
      arboviruses in the human is limited. Here, we will establish and follow a longitudinal
      pediatric cohort study to describe the burden of dengue virus and to carefully examine the
      immune response to exposure of the salivary proteins of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of
      dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. This study will serve as a foundation so that future
      studies may contribute to further understanding how saliva immunity impacts arboviral disease
      development i Cambodia, a country endemic to these viruses.
