      from moderate to severe troubles. In case of voiding dysfunction, the reference treatment is
      based on intermittent self catheterisation (ISC). UD in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients
      have been widely studied. They are very common, and are life-threatening in the absence of
      appropriate care. Management of neurological UD (as those occurring in MS) are well defined.
      ISC is the gold standard of bladder emptying method in this pathological context, and has
      been the subject of numerous studies. In SCI, the ISC discontinuation rate varies from 52 to
      80% according to the published studies, the main factors of continuation being the autonomy
      to perform the technique, and the continence rate. However, the results are variable. In case
      of MS, the studies are lacking, the results concerning the discontinuation rate and factors
      associated with discontinuation are poor. Our main objective within the French speaking
      neurology study group (GENULF), is to prospectively assessed factors associated with ISC
      discontinuation 2 years after having introduced this technique.

      This predictive study will be multicenter, observational, analytical, and prospective and
      will not modify current clinical practice.

      We will record clinical and urinary data at each visit (inclusion, 6 weeks, 6 months, 12
      months, and 24 months). We will note also if the patient practice ISC as prescribed in order
      to identify discontinuation of the ISC.
