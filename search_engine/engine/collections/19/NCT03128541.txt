      blocks) to patients during childbirth to provide pain relief and anaesthesia. A spinal
      anaesthetic involves the injection of pain relieving medicines directly into the sac of fluid
      that surrounds the spinal cord. An epidural uses a different technique to place a thin
      plastic tube into the fatty tissues that surround this sac. Spinal anaesthesia must be placed
      below where the spinal cord ends to avoid nerve trauma. Doctors have traditionally been
      taught to identify a safe level, by feeling the top of a patients hips and drawing an
      imaginary line between these two points across the patients back known as Tuffier's line.
      This identifies L4/5 interspace, below which anaesthetists avoids the termination of the
      spinal cord. The same blind "anatomical rule" is used throughout anaesthetics, whether the
      patient is male or female, young or old, pregnant or non-pregnant, supine or lateral, an
      approach that is clearly far from robust. The physiological changes of pregnancy such as
      fluid retention and weight gain can further make identification of the standard landmarks
      challenging. Advances in ultrasound technology have allowed direct visualisation of the bones
      in the back. Studies have shown that the conventional anatomical based method for locating
      the point of needle insertion is unreliable even amongst experienced anaesthetists.

      Spinal or epidural anaesthesia can be performed with the patient either sitting or lying on
      their side. The investigators aim to determine whether a difference exists between the
      perceived mid-point of the L4/L5 intervertebral space, identified using manual demarcation of
      Tuffier's line, in these two positions. Ultrasound will then be used to ascertain the
      distance from the "true" midpoint.
