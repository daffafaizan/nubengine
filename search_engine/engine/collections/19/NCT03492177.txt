      (PK) extrapolation from adults, taking into account the children body weight category, in
      order to lead to an exposure similar to that in adult PAH patients at a starting dose of 200
      microgram (μg). As in adults, selexipag will be up-titrated to the individual maximum
      tolerated dose (iMTD) during the first 12 weeks.

      Approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled in 3 different age cohorts to obtain at least 40
      subjects with evaluable PK profiles: Cohort 1: ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age, Cohort 2: ≥ 6 to <
      12 years of age, Cohort 3: ≥ 2 to < 6 years of age. In each age cohort the starting dose will
      depend on the body weight. Enrollment will start with both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. After
      completion of PK assessments in at least 15 subjects from Cohort 1 at Week 12, a first
      interim analysis will be conducted to establish the dose-exposure relationship using a
      population PK model.

      Results of this model-based analysis will be used to confirm or adjust the selexipag doses
      initially selected. Enrollment of Cohort 3 (children ≥ 2 to < 6 years of age) will start once
      the appropriate doses have been confirmed in a second interim analysis of PK data from
      Cohorts 1 and 2, and if there is no safety concern based on review by an Independent Data
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC).
