    
      This will be a non-randomized phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of weekly
      nab-paclitaxel for second-line treatment in 42 elderly patients, who are 70 years of age or
      greater with non-small cell lung cancer (NSLC). Patients will be required to have progressed
      on a single prior regimen. Nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 will be administered intravenously, weekly
      for 3 weeks of every 4-week cycle. After every two cycles of therapy, imaging will be
      performed to assess for response. Patients will be eligible to continue receiving therapy
      until the time of disease progression.

      Primary Objectives To evaluate the tolerability of weekly nab-paclitaxel in older adults with
      advanced lung cancer who have progressed on at least 1 prior regimen after 6 cycles or 3
      weeks after discontinuation of treatment, for those who come off treatment earlier.

      Secondary Objectives To estimate overall survival To estimate progression-free survival To
      estimate the response rate

      Correlative Objectives To explore baseline components of the Geriatric Assessment (GA) as
      predictors of chemotherapy tolerance and overall survival To explore the use of p16
      measurements in the elderly as predictors of chemotherapy tolerance and overall survival To
      explore the impact of weekly nab-paclitaxel treatment on quality of life, as measured by Lung
      Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L).
