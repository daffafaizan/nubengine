      first 6 months after the primary VIH infection, thus increasing the likelihood of observing a
      certain rate of post-treatment controls (PTC), regardless of treatment efficacy. Although the
      kinetics of HIV rebound should allow observing differences between placebo and control
      regarding the post treatment controls rate in case of efficacy of the IMPs, assessing the
      length and determinants of a post-intervention control (PIC) (i.e., associated with
      vaccination) beyond 24 weeks is crucial for developing a curative approach to HIV infection.
      In this regard, an extension of the ATI phase for those individuals with pVL less than 2,000
      copies/mL after 24 weeks of ATI in the AELIX-002 offers an unique research opportunity to
      better understand relevant aspects of the mechanisms involved in the different phenotypes of
      a PIC and PTC.

      This trial will enrol participants of the AELIX-002 clinical trial regardless of whether they
      received vaccines or placebo, who reach 24 weeks of ATI with pVL <2,000 cop/ml and are
      willing to remain off cART. After accepting participation, subjects will undergo a one-year
      extension [48 weeks] of ATI monitoring (total duration of ATI envisioned will be of 72 weeks
      [24 weeks in AELIX-002 study + 48 weeks in current study]), followed by 24 weeks of safety
      follow-up after cART is resumed.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and durability of viral control
      after AELIX-002 clinical trial intervention beyond 6 months of ATI. Furthermore, the study
      will collect biological samples to be stored for further investigational studies.
