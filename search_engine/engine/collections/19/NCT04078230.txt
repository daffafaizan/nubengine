      Obtaining enough lymph nodes can improve the accuracy of AJCC staging and accurately
      determine prognosis. However, it is unclear whether it will improve the prognosis of patients
      with lymph node dissection. According to literature reports and related studies, expanded
      lymph node dissection for right liver tumors included stations 12, 8, and 13, and left
      lymphoma expanded lymph node dissection includedstations 12, 1, 3, 7, and 8.

      In summary, standardize the extent of lymph node dissection in intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma, and obtain enough lymph node dissection under the premise of controlling
      the complication rate, which is helpful for accurate TNM staging, accurate judgment of
      prognosis and improvement of survival time. Improve prognosis.
