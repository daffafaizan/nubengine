      treatment resistant OCD undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS). This stereotactical method
      involves surgically implanted electrodes and previously has been used primarily for the
      treatment of Parkinson's disease and tremor.

      In almost all reported cases, a bilateral stimulation in the anterior limb of the internal
      capsule (ALIC was applied. However, the electrode designs between the groups varied and in
      some cases the stimulation area was extended to the adjacent ventral striatal regions
      including the nucleus accumbens (NAC).

      Cortical-striate-thalami-cortical (CSTC) circuits are supported to be implicated in the
      pathogenesis underlying OCD caused by a failure of inhibition of the ventral striatum.
      Together with other structures the nucleus accumbens forms the ventral striatum. Because of
      the predominant role of the NAC to exert modulatory effects within these circuits we
      considered it to provide a promising target location for DBS.

      Moreover the NAC ventrally borders with the anterior limb of the internal capsule and the
      subventricular lateral fundus of the nucleus accumbens is even permeated in rostral sections
      by numerous internal capsule fiber bundles. It was therefore to be expected that the
      electrode trajectories and stimulation target selected by us additionally would have an
      effect on the fibre systems of the internal capsule.

      The NAC had been introduced as primary target for DBS in treatment resistant OCD by our
      group. Pilot series showed that the right stimulation of the NAC yielded the best results,
      whereas bilateral stimulation showed no additional benefit.
