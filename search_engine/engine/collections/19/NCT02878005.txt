    
      The intubating Laryngeal Tube Suction-Disposable (iLTS-D) (VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz,
      Germany) is a new updated version of the Laryngeal Tube-Suction Disposable (LTS-D) It has a
      ventilator channel with a 13.5mm internal diameter, which enables the passage of an
      Endotracheal Tube (ETT) either blindly or with fiberoptic guidance. Similarly As in to the
      LTS-D, the iLTS-D also has a separate channel for the purpose of placement of gastric tubes
      placement up to a size of 18 Fr.

      The iLTS-D comes in one size. According to the depth of insertion, this device is equivalent
      to size 4 for patients 175patients 175 to 190 cm tall, or size 5 for patients taller than 190
      cm. The iLTS-D is provided by the manufacturer with a compatible 7.5mm ETT and with a plastic
      stabilizer for removal of the device.

      The current randomized study was designed to assess the success rate of blind and fiberoptic
      endotracheal intubation using iLTS-D, in comparison with the and Ambu® AuraGain™ in adult
      patients under general anesthesia
