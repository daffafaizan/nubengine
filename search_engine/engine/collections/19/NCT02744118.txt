      brief counseling intervention for adolescents, based on expert input, current literature, and
      themes gathered from focus groups with adolescents and clinicians; (2) Pilot test the
      acceptability of the 5As marijuana intervention in 2 pediatric primary care practices, where
      researchers will test the intervention and determine acceptability via in-depth interviews
      with clinicians, office staff, adolescents and parents; and (3) Pilot test the feasibility of
      the 5As marijuana intervention in 8 practices (4 intervention/4 comparable control), wherein
      each practice will enroll 100 adolescents and conduct baseline/exit interviews with all of
      them. Twenty percent of adolescents/practice (including identified marijuana users) will
      complete one follow-up interview 3-6 weeks after their practice visit. These interviews will
      assess physician-delivery of the intervention and any change in use, attitude or behavioral
      intentions toward marijuana since their clinical visit. Findings will inform the development
      of a future large-scale trial of adolescent marijuana use, screening and cessation counseling
      in pediatric primary care. The long-term goal is to improve clinical preventive services for
      adolescent marijuana cessation. Conducting this work within the AAP PROS network will lead to
      rapid dissemination of effective interventions.
