      area for a period of 30 minutes, 5 days out of 7, for 12 weeks. During this treatment,
      electrical stimulation is passed through skin contact electrodes (large sticky black pads)
      which causes the pelvic floor to contract and relax, without you having to do anything. This
      treatment is not painful and is very similar to the workout you would get from relaxing and
      contracting your pelvic floor muscles yourself, however the device produces a much stronger
      contraction.

      The study is open to females who have failed a 6 week exercise programme and have been
      diagnosed with Stress Urinary Incontinence. It will take place at hospital uro-gynaecology
      clinics/continence clinics across the United Kingdom. The study could last up to 16 months.

      This study is being carried out to further prove that the Neurotech Vital device is an
      effective way of treating stress urinary incontinence in female participants.The study will
      look at the results of a 12 week treatment programme with the Neurotech Vital device compared
      to the modified Neurotech Vital device. It will compare the following:

        1. how much urine is lost in a standard 1 minute stress test carried out at the baseline
           visit (start of the treatment) right through to visit 5 (end of the treatment - 12
           weeks).

        2. How much improvement is shown in the quality of life questionnaire (this is measured by
           ticking questions which have scores attached to them and adding up the total score for
           the questionnaire). This questionnaire asks questions on quality of life which is
           affected by stress urinary incontinence.
