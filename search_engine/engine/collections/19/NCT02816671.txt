      enrollment of patients requiring surgical stapling during a lobectomy or segmentectomy.
      Patients will be treated per the clinicians standard of care with medical history and
      demographic data collected pre-procedure, operative data including clinician's objective and
      subjective evaluation of the stapler and confirmation of any complications via query and data
      collection at hospital discharge and each clinician's standard post-operative contact.
