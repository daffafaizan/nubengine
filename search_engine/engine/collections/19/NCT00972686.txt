    
      This study is a Phase I, first-time-in-human dose escalation study in subjects with
      refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      recommended Phase II dose of GSK2126458 based on safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and preliminary evidence of clinical activity. Secondary objectives are to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of GSK2126458; and to explore relationships between
      GSK2126458 pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, response prediction biomarkers and clinical
      endpoints.

      Subjects with solid tumors or lymphoma will initially receive oral GSK2126458 daily for 28
      consecutive days in each 28 day cycle. Subjects may be dosed once or twice a day or may be
      dosed on an intermittent schedule depending on the safety, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic results that become available as the study progresses. The starting dose will
      be 0.1 mg once a day. Expansion of some cohorts will be conducted to test tumor
      pharmacodynamics, further explore the toxicity profile and to look for preliminary evidence
      of activity in subjects with tumors with PIK3CA mutations. The recommended Phase II dose will
      be the lowest dose explored (at or below MTD) that maintains biologic activity with an
      acceptable tolerability profile.
