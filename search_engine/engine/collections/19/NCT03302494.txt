    
      The WAVECREST 2 trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, active controlled, clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Coherex WaveCrest Left Atrial Appendage
      (LAA) Occlusion System. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Treatment Arm
      (Coherex WaveCrest LAA occlusion system) or the Control Arm (Boston Scientific's Watchman LAA
      occlusion system). The trial is designed to demonstrate that safety and effectiveness of the
      WaveCrest device are non-inferior to the Watchman device.
