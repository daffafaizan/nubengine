      procedure. One is the number of attempts of selective biliary cannulation. Our hypothesis is
      that double guide wire placement could be a useful technique for selective biliary
      cannulation in those cases of difficult ERCP procedures, reducing the number of cannulation
      attempts and the complication associated with the procedure.

      We are conducting a controlled prospective multicentre randomized study to compare the double
      guide wire technique with the conventional method in two groups previously randomized after
      presenting a difficult selective biliary cannulation under the conventional method. The study
      is carried out in six public Hospitals from Spain. Assignation is concealed to both groups,
      and the expected study period is 18 months for a number of randomized patients equal or over
      262 (statistical power of 90% with an Î±-error of 0.05, to detect a success rate of 74% in the
      group undergoing double guide wire technique against a success rate of 60% in the control
      group). The main outcome variables are successful selective biliary cannulation (primary
      outcome variable), number of attempts and morbimortality associated in both groups (secondary
      outcome variables).
