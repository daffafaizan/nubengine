      consistency of chest compressions during CPR, as well as lessening the pauses in active
      compressions.12,19,20 The LDB device has been shown to improve hemodynamics both in a porcine
      model and in humans, but also lower and higher survival to hospital discharge rates using
      LDB-CPR compared to M-CPR.21 It is important to emphasize the benefit for early use of the
      device (within 8 minutes of a cardiac arrest). Analysis also showed an improvement in the
      benefit ratio for centers which used A-CPR over a prolonged period of time.22 Previous
      clinical hemodynamic studies have demonstrated increased CPP (20 ± 12 mmHg versus 15 ± 11
      mmHg, p < 0.015), peak right atrial pressure (129 ± 32 mmHg versus 83 ± 40 mmHg, p < 0.0001),
      peak aortic pressure (153 ± 28 mmHg versus 115 ± 42 mmHg, p < 0.0001) when comparing A-CPR to
      MCPR, respectively.20 Research indicates that increased coronary perfusion pressure improves
      survival.32 One retrospective review of OOHCA patients found a statistically significant
      increase in ROSC with LDB-CPR (39%) as compared to M-CPR (29%, p < 0.003)21 and another OOHCA
      trial documented increased survival to ED when patients were treated with LDB-CPR (29%)
      compared to M-CPR (19%, p < 0.02).22 In another retrospective historically controlled trial,
      survival rates were significantly better for patients treated with LDB-CPR compared to M-CPR
      in episodes of OOHCA when used by rapid response EMS personnel. Overall ROSC was 34.5% for
      LDB-CPR compared to 20.2% for M-CPR. Survival to hospital admission was improved 20.9% vs.
      11.1%, and finally, survival to hospital discharge was improved 9.7% compared to 2.9% for
      M-CPR. However, no difference was found between the survivors of the two groups with respect
      to cerebral performance or overall performance categories.23,24 A randomized, controlled
      trial (RCT) compared LDB-CPR to M-CPR with respect to 4 hour survival following the first
      recorded emergency call (911). This trial was terminated when no difference was found between
      the two groups in survival to 4 hours. Worse cerebral performance at hospital discharge was
      found in the A-CPR group.10 However, it may be the case that this trial had a suboptimal
      design and significant methodological problems.25,27,28 Finally, the largest RCT, CIRC
      compared integrated LDB-CPR with high quality M-CPR and found that of 4753 randomized
      patients, 522 (11.0%) met post enrollment exclusion criteria. Therefore, 2099 (49.6%)
      received integrated LDB (iLDB)-CPR and 2132 (50.4%) M-CPR. Sustained ROSC (emergency
      department admittance), 24h survival and hospital discharge (unknown for 12 cases) for
      iLDB-CPR compared to M-CPR were 600 (28.6%) vs. 689 (32.3%), 456 (21.8%) vs. 532 (25.0%), 196
      (9.4%) vs. 233 (11.0%) patients, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio of survival to
      hospital discharge for iLDB-CPR compared to M-CPR, was 1.06 (95% CI 0.83-1.37), meeting the
      criteria for equivalence. The 20 min CPR fraction was 80.4% for iLDB-CPR and 80.2% for M-CPR.
      The authors conclude that compared to high-quality M-CPR, iLDB-CPR resulted in statistically
      equivalent survival to hospital discharge.

      In the present study investigators explore both positive and negative effects of LDB- and
      M-CPR in standard daily EMS treatment of OOHCA patients.

      Knowledge is limited as to the best way to optimize resuscitation of patients with OOHCA.
      This is evidenced by the low survival rates currently being achieved.2,3,4 As is well
      evidenced, the early onset of improved circulation during resuscitation results in improved
      survival rates.32,33,34 Experimental animal studies have indicated improved myocardial blood
      flow and showed improvement in key pressure measurements including aortic and right atrial
      peak over M-CPR.12 Upon the addition of epinephrine, LDB-CPR also showed increased cerebral
      blood flow, a key factor in preserving neurological intactness, as well as improving CPP.12
      Experimental animal studies also show improvement in survival to neurological intactness of
      ACPR over M-CPR.19 It appears that the use of the LDB has been associated with increased
      end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2, versus M-CPR).38,39,40 In one of the studies, there was also a
      significant increase in short-term survival over that of M-CPR.39 None of these studies were
      definitive and did not follow the patients for long term survival but they indicated that LDB
      may be capable of a real contribution to resuscitative medicine and merited a further, more
      thorough investigation.38,39,40 Several studies have indicated that higher levels of ETCO2
      appeared to be prognostic of ROSC.35,36,37 One trial concluded that monitoring of ETCO2 had
      potential as a noninvasive indicator of cardiac output during resuscitations attempts and
      could also serve as a prognostic indicator. This same trial reported that if a patient had
      initial, average and final ETCO2 readings of 10mmHg, they were able to correctly identify
      100% of those patients achieving ROSC with specificities of 74.1%, 90% and 81.4%
      respectively.36 Another trial concluded that ETCO2 may also have value in determining when to
      terminate resuscitative efforts.37 Although an RCT was inconclusive as to the benefits of use
      of the LDB-CPR10; a later trial, a non-randomized, phased observational cohort evaluation,
      resulted in an increase of survival to hospital discharge from 3% to nearly 10%.23,24
      Therefore, it has been hypothesized that timely use of an LDB-CPR to assist in improved
      circulation could significantly increase survival rates. In 2006, Drs. Lewis and Niemann
      published an editorial in JAMA, further analyzing the outcomes of these seemingly
      contradictory studies. While indicating that M-CPR may be better than generally recognized,
      they also state that there are numerous reasons for conflicting results. They agree that it
      is not possible to reach any definitive conclusions as to the value of LDB-CPR without
      further investigation. They advocate a well-controlled trial with clearly defined endpoints,
      with particular mention made of ensuring the quality of M-CPR used as a comparison. Several
      sources have discussed the many factors that could have influenced outcome, including strong
      preconceived notions regarding effective therapies as well as factors such as the Hawthorne
      Effect.25,27,28,41 Drs. Lewis and Niemann said it best when they conclude that "only by
      aggressively identifying and rigorously testing promising new therapies will the outcome
      improve for patients who experience sudden cardiac death."25 The CIRC trial was designed with
      the goal of being such a trial. The goal of that trial was to test the positive results of
      the non-randomized trial in the context of an RCT, utilizing a protocol designed to determine
      whether LDB-CPR was superior, or equivalent to M-CPR using evidence-based medical
      methodologies. The Circulation-Improving Resuscitation Care (CIRC) trial, an international,
      multi-center trial, was designed to compare the effectiveness of integrated resuscitation
      (iLDB-CPR) protocol, to conventional M-CPR for the treatment of OOHCA-PCE. Compared to
      high-quality M-CPR, iLDB-CPR resulted in statistically equivalent survival to hospital
      discharge.

      The investigators are not aware of any previous publication comparing LDB- with M-CPR in a
      standard OOHCA situation between two different EMS's in respect to outcome and CPR process.
