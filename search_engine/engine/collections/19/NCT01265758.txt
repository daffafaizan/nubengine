      individuals without heart disease and the reasons for their palpitations are unknown.
      Together with heart palpitations silent arrhythmia may be present that could lead to serious
      complications (eg. stroke). In others, palpitations result from heart rhythm disturbances,
      sometimes life threatening. Standard diagnostic methods such as 24 hours Holter ECG
      monitoring or Event Holter do not guarantee early diagnosis of the arrhythmia. Prolonged
      heart rhythm recording and analysis using an automatic full disclosure telemetric device
      increase probability of arrhythmia diagnosis and early administration of applicable
      treatment. Study patients will be diagnosed using standard Holter ECG monitoring and 14 days
      telemetric full disclosure ECG monitoring. The full disclosure signal will be subsequently
      analyzed in the Event Monitoring mode by an independent consultant. Efficacy of Telemetric
      Monitoring in diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia will be assessed in comparison with the
      standard Holter monitoring and Event Monitoring.
