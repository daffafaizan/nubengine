      nevirapine; and 3.) standard dose and 4.) high dose efavirenz. Subjects in all 4 arms will
      also receive 2 nucleoside analog drugs. Patients will have routine monitoring for the
      treatment of TB and HIV, as well as some additional blood samples to follow the virus in the
      blood and to determine the effect of the TB therapy on the amounts of anti-HIV drugs that are
      in the body.
