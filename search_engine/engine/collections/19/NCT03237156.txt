      participants in order to evaluate safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses
      of TAK-906 in Japanese healthy male participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups in Cohort 1 or Cohort 3.
      Study drug will be administered in a double-blind manner which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need),
      orally, once daily on Day 1 as Single Dose Period and twice daily from Day 3 to 7 as Multiple
      Dose Period:

        -  TAK-906 50 mg (Cohort 1)

        -  TAK-906 100 mg (Cohort 2)

        -  TAK-906 10 mg (Cohort 3)

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      Cohort 2 will be conducted after the completion of Cohort 1. This will be conducted in Japan.
