      will be enrolled. The AVERT PLUS is a system which is external to the patient and connected
      to the control syringe that the physician uses to deliver the contrast dye to the patient.
      For each injection that the physician performs, the starting syringe volume, the ending
      syringe volume, and the net contrast delivered to the patient will be recorded. At the same
      time, the net volume delivered to the patient will also be recorded from the AVERT PLUS
      console. For each injection, these two sets of variables will be compared to determine
      accuracy of the AVERT PLUS to quantify net contrast volume used.
