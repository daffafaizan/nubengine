      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in preventing acute
           graft-vs-host disease in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies undergoing
           allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

      Patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or orally twice daily on days -1 to 60 followed
      by a taper to day 180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV over 2 hours or orally
      twice daily on days 0-60 followed by a taper to day 180. Treatment is discontinued at day 180
      in the absence of graft-vs-host disease.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
