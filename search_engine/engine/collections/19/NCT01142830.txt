      pain, and effectiveness of different post-neurosurgical analgesic regimens. Several small
      studies report the prevalence of some period of moderate to severe pain in the first 24
      postoperative hours to be from 41 to 84 % of patients. In a prospective single academic
      medical institution study, adult patients treated with only acetaminophen and modest amounts
      of opioids on an as needed basis reported moderate to severe pain for the first 2 days after
      surgery. These findings have supported a growing consensus that perioperative pain associated
      with intracranial surgery may be more significant than initially appreciated. Factors that
      have been associated with increased pain after intracranial surgery include sex, younger age,
      surgical site, and surgical approach to the site. Pain may also be a significant factor in
      the quality of recovery from intracranial surgery. In contrast there are few studies
      describing the incidence or management of pain after neurosurgery in children.
