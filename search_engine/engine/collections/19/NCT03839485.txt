      12-month follow-up, will be performed. The experimental group will be PGP formulated without
      the antibiotic, while the control group is the conventional PGP, containing rifamycin. The
      conventional pulpectomy will be performed using manual files, performing the instrumentation
      aided by Endo-PTC and 1% sodium hypochlorite. At the end of the instrumentation, just before
      the obturation, the groups will be drawn, with the strategy of randomization in permuted
      blocks and stratified by the initial condition of the tooth (with or without periapical
      lesion). The main outcome will be the clinical and radiographic success of endodontic
      treatment after 12 months.Patients who seek the dental service of the municipality and
      require endodontic treatment will be invited to participate in the study. The data will be
      statistically analyzed using the statistical package Stata 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College
      Station, TX, USA). The longevity of the treatments will be evaluated by estimating survival
      rates using the Kaplan-Meier method. The differences between survival rates according to the
      type of endodontic treatment proposed will be analyzed through the Log-rank test.
