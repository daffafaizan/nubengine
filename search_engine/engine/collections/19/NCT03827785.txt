      recruited patients will be randomized assigned to the intervention group and the control
      group, receiving either 4-week of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      treatment or 4-week of sham rTMS treatment. Both groups will receive 12-week urine drug test
      follow-up (1 time per week). Negative rate of urine test during the follow-up period is set
      as primary outcome. Cognitive function, craving, depression are also evaluated before and
      after the intervention.

      Secondly, another 40 patients will be recruited from these 100 patients (20 subjects each
      group). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) test is applied to investigate the potential
      neurobiological mechanism of rTMS treatment. This study will be very helpful to develop an
      evidence-based rTMS treatment protocols for MA dependent patients and decrease risk of
      relapse for both the patients and their families.
