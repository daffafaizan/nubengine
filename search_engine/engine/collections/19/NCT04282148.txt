      outside of US) clinical investigation to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ABT
      Next Generation Drug Eluting Stent 48 mm everolimus-eluting coronary stent system (EECSS)
      (called "ABT NG DES 48") in up to 107 subjects at up to 33 sites globally. The clinical
      outcomes from the SPIRIT 48 study will be compared to a performance goal (PG) established
      using historical control data from the SPIRIT Prime Long Lesion Registry. This clinical
      investigation will be conducted under an investigational device exemption (IDE) and is
      intended to support market approval of the ABT NG DES 48 in the United States.
