      to 12 participants each.

      The dose escalation portion of the trial will incorporate a modified accelerated titration
      design. Therefore, the trial will enroll 3 participants per dose level with a doubling of the
      dose at each level during the accelerated stage of the study (skipping every other dose
      level). Once the first instance of any Grade 3 or higher treatment related toxicity (with
      some notable exceptions) is observed on the first cycle, the accelerated stage will end and
      the trial will revert to a conventional design using cohorts of 3 or 6 participants (standard
      3+3 design), with single step 2 milligrams (mg)/square meter (m^2) increments.

      To further explore the clinical efficacy, additional participants (up to 12 per cohort) may
      be enrolled at the optimal biologic dose (OBD) or maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      At the end of the study, participants may be enrolled into an open-label extension study
      (AO-101-EXT [NCT02151903]), at the discretion of the investigator.
