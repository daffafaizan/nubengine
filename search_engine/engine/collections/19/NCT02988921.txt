           fractions. Also MRI will be performed after treatment. The investigators will contour
           based on the MRI image and compare this with the standard CT plan before and during
           treatment.

        2. The predictive potential of initial tumor ADC, and change in ADC during and after
           treatment for tumor response will be assessed.

        3. The average CT texture features not only in the present study but also of those who
           treated previously in our department (since 2014) will be extracted before and during
           chemoradiotherapy to establish a model to predict the prognosis of patients.
