      airway in subjects undergoing an EP, cardiac catheterization or device procedure. (Measured
      as changes in the anteroposterior dimensions (2-dimensional) of the retropalatal and
      retrolingual airway spaces.) This will be an acute study lasting no more than 45 min during a
      standard new device implant, cardiac catheterization and/or EP procedure. The hypoglossal
      nerve will be stimulated from the lingual vein using various stimulation parameters. Tongue
      motion, upper airway opening or any side effects will be recorded. At the end of the test
      procedure all hardware - the catheters, lead and/or guide wire will be removed.
