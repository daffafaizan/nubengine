      with toothpaste and toothbrushes for the whole family together with oral hygiene instructions
      in English and Spanish will be mailed every 3 months. Half of the population will be randomly
      assigned to also receive telephone support (Short message service and one-to-one calls).
      Families will receive biweekly messages with oral hygiene tips. Bilingual culturally
      competent staff will be available by telephone to support families in overcoming barriers.
