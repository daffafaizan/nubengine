      bypass grafting using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). It avoids adverse effects of CPB such as
      systemic inflammatory response, impaired myocardial protection, and air or plaque embolism.
      However, OPCAB surgery involves displacement and manipulation of the heart to expose target
      coronary arteries. These manipulations cause hemodynamic instability as a result of transient
      annulo-mitral distortion and acute mitral regurgitation, compression of the right ventricle,
      and impaired cardiac contractility due to epicardial stabilizers. signs of impaired perfusion
      such as metabolic acidosis, increased serum lactate and decreased urine output are commonly
      seen intraoperatively

      Excessive surgical bleeding causes hypovolemia and hemodynamic instability, anemia, and
      reduced oxygen delivery to tissues

      Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is an alternative method of management of
      intraoperative blood loss, in which a certain volume of blood is collected from the patient,
      stored at room temperature and replaced by an equal volume of colloid solution. By the end of
      surgery, this blood is returned to the patient, usually within eight hours of collection,
      with little deterioration of platelets or coagulation factors

      This work aims to study the effects of Acute normovolemic hemodilution on central and
      peripheral perfusion in patients Undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery
