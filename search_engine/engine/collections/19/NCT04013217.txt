      Eligible subjects will be adults with advanced solid tumors.

      Groups of 3 to 6 subjects will receive a single dose of Eribulin ORA on Day 1 and Day 8 of a
      21 day cycle and will be followed for toxicity. If non linearity in PK is observed,
      additional subjects will be added with study drug administered on Day 1 and 8 once every
