        1. to evaluate congruity between palpatory technique and ultrasound lumbar evaluation to
           identify the correct spinal space;

        2. to compare between ultrasound evaluation and needle measure of skin-epidural space
           depth;

        3. to compare between longitudinal and transverse ultrasound epidural space depth in obese
           and normal parturients;

        4. to check the reduction of complications and failure rates of epidural analgesia with
           ultrasound assistance.
