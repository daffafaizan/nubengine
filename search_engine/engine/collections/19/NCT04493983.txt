      skin incision was performed. Pneumoperitoneum was established using dry, nonheated CO2
      insufflation through a Veress needle. A 10-mm trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity
      through the umbilical incision for the laparoscope. Subsequently, three 5-mm ancillary
      trocars, 2 on the lower abdominal quadrants and 1 on the left upper quadrant, were introduced
      to the abdominal space under direct optic visualization. IAP was set at 14 mm Hg and
      maintained with a gas insufflator (Endoflator; Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen,
      Germany)Immediately after the port placement, unilateral oophorectomy was performed, and
      ovarian biopsies were obtained. The operation continued with ligation and transection of the
      contralateral utero-ovarian ligament and the bilateral round ligaments. The contralateral
      infundibulopelvic ligament, which contains the main vascular supply for the contralateral
      ovary, remained intact. Subsequently, anterior and posterior leaflets of the broad ligament
      were identified and dissected, and the bladder was placed away from the lower uterine
      segment. The uterus removed from vaginal way after necessary steps. After desufflation, the
      cuff closure procedure was performed vaginally. At the end of the closure, pneumoperitoneum
      was reestablished, the remaining contralateral ovary was removed immediately, and biopsies
      were obtained for histologic analyses.
