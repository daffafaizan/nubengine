      method is trans-rectal needle biopsy of the prostate (TR-Bx) with a needle inserted through a
      probe in the rectum to reach the prostate.

      TR-Bx is usually performed in the office, using local anesthesia, and often using a targeted
      biopsy approach using MRI/ultrasound fusion technique.

      Trans-perineal biopsy (TP-Bx) with a needle inserted directly through the skin to reach the
      prostate.

      Typically, TP-BX is performed in the outpatient surgical setting due significant pain
      associated with the procedure, requiring the use anesthesia and/or sedation.

      TP-Bx. procedure is very uncommon in the USA and is often performed using ultrasound alone
      (less accurate), without the benefit of MRI guided targeted biopsy.

      Now, with the availability of new devices, we are able to perform both TR-Bx and TP-Bx using
      MRI/ultrasound fusion guided targeted approach, in the office setting, using local anesthesia
      alone.

      With the TR-Bx, there has been increasing risk of infection related complications, sepsis and
      hospital admissions.

      The newer approach of biopsy TP-Bx may cause fewer infections and may have a higher accuracy
      of finding cancer.

      This randomized study of TR-BX and TP-Bx will address these questions:

        -  Differences in the risk of infectious complications

        -  Differences in the hemorrhagic and urinary side effects

        -  Tolerability of both techniques with local anesthesia alone

        -  Difference in the results of of MRI/US fusion targeted biopsy

        -  Differences in the overall cancer detection rate and the high-grade cancer detection
           rate

        -  Differences in the cost of the procedures
