      the long term (2007 ESH-ESC Guidelines on the Management of Hypertension; VALUE study).
      However, in spite of education efforts and antihypertensive drugs, blood pressure control
      rates remain low. The most common cause of uncontrolled BP is inadequate pharmacological
      treatment, because the selection of antihypertensive agents is often done independently of
      the hemodynamic status of the patient (volemia, peripheral resistance, cardiac inotropy,
      heart rate).

      Several studies confirmed the value of using impedance cardiography (ICG)-derived hemodynamic
      data as an adjunct to therapeutic decision-making in the treatment of hypertension.

      Working hypothesis: when it is possible to assess the hemodynamic status, and select
      accordingly the most appropriate pharmacological class of antihypertensive treatment, BP
      reduction occurs to a greater extent and more rapidly.

      In the present study an integrated therapeutic approach (IHM-Integrated Hemodynamic
      Management)was applied, aiming at detecting permanent vasoconstriction and/or hypervolemia
      and/or hyperinotropy through the HOTMAN System, in order to select the most appropriate
      antihypertensive drugs.
