      Diastolic dysfunction (DD) accounts for >50% of all heart failure (DHF) hospitalizations and
      this number is increasing with age, obesity and diabetes.

      There are no proven treatments for DHF apart from blood pressure control.

      Aim:

      If diagnosed early, is this reversible with lifestyle changes; namely, aerobic exercise and
      weight reduction?

      Methods:

      We will screen veterans presenting to the medicine, cardiology and pulmonary services with
      dyspnea. We will perform echocardiography with Doppler which non-invasively measures cardiac
      filling and diastolic dysfunction. Treadmill exercise echo will be performed to quantify DD.

      Bruce treadmill protocol description/ procedure: Exercise is performed on a treadmill. The
      test starts at 2.74 km/hr (1.7 mph) and at a gradient (or incline) of 10%. At three minute
      intervals the incline of the treadmill increases by 2%, and the speed increases as shown in
      the table below.

      Stage Speed (mph) Gradient:

        1. 1.7 10

        2. 2.5 12

        3. 3.4 14

        4. 4.2 16

        5. 5.0 18

        6. 5.5 20

        7. 6.0 22

        8. 6.5 24

        9. 7.0 26

       10. 7.5 28

      Subject exercise study:

      For physical exercise to have a beneficial effect on cardiac function, we suggest the
      following:

        -  Type of Exercise

        -  Walking - outdoors or treadmill

        -  Running or jogging

        -  Cycling - outdoors or stationary

      Duration of Exercise:

      Initial 2-3 minute gradual warm-up period. Roughly 30 minutes of continuous exercise 5 times
      a week.

      Finally a few minutes of gradual cool-down before terminating exercise.

      Intensity of Exercise:

      Target exercise at a "moderately significant exertion".

      We will demonstrate what is adequate in the beginning and periodically throughout the 6
      months of the study.

      "Maximum age predicted heart rate (MPHR)" is calculated as 220 minus subject's age. Then we
      would like to sustain roughly about 70 to 85% of MPHR for 25-30 minutes.

      "Successful" Exerciser: Subjects who are able to adhere to the required intensity and
      duration of exercise for the majority (about 75% or more) of the time; averaging 150 minutes/
      week on self reporting.
