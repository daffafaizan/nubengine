      safety of durvalumab in combination with novel oncology therapies (i.e. therapies designed
      for immune modulation) with or without paclitaxel and durvalumab + paclitaxel as first-line
      treatment in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The study is
      designed to concurrently evaluate potential novel treatment combinations with clinical
      promise using a 2-stage approach. The study will use a Simon 2-Stage design to evaluate which
      cohorts may proceed to expansion.

      Part 1 is a Phase IB study of safety and initial efficacy, and Part 2 may expand patient
      enrollment if adequate efficacy signal is observed in Part 1. The treatment regimens
      evaluated in Part 2 will depend on the evaluation of safety and efficacy outcomes in Part 1.
