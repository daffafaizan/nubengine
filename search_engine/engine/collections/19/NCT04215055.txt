      from child for any further appointments, that's why we aim to manage a successful dental
      procedure keeping a stress free situation. Conventional local anesthetic technique is the
      most commonly used technique for anesthetizing teeth but in turn it has shown the highest
      levels of discomfort in comparison with other techniques. VibraJect is vibration associated
      syringe device, it is simple and cost effective solution to alleviate injection discomfort.
      It works because the light pressure of a Vibraject injection is carried rapidly to the brain
      by thicker insulated nerve tissues. In contrast, the needle prick travels on thinner nerve
      tissues, arriving too late for the brain to register the sensation. Vibraject is good news
      for the patient, because the anesthetic itself causes virtually no discomfort and good news
      for the dentist, who can work easily knowing that patient, is comfortable.
