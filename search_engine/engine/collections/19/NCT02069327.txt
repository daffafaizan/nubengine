      will take samples for this study from bone marrow that has already been removed as part of
      this procedure. No additional marrow samples will be taken as part of this research study.
      Also, researchers will collect blood (about 4 teaspoons) for testing inflammatory response
      and coagulation. Researchers may need to insert an additional line to collect your blood.
