      axillary lymphadenectomy followed by radiation therapy. This increases the risk of lymphedema
      development which occurs in up to 30% of such cases. The present treatment paradigm is
      conservative with compression garments. There is a need for more effective treatment options
      and regenerative medicine offers hope for a change to a more curative approach. This Phase 2
      trial will examine the efficacy and safety of treatment with freshly isolated adipose-deried
      stromal cells administered as a cell-assisted lipotransfer to the affected axillary region.

      Investigators plan to include 10 patients with unilateral lymphedema after previous breast
      cancer treatment
