      (EF), obesity, and other markers for disease risk. It has been suggested that consumption of
      several small, frequent meals may influence physiological mechanisms, reducing the risk for
      disease and lowering appetite. Participants in this randomized crossover study completed two
      intervention phases lasting three weeks each: one of low eating frequency ("low-EF"; 3 eating
      occasions/day) and one of high eating frequency ("high-EF"; 8 eating occasions/day). Fasting
      C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor, and leptin were measured at baseline and
      endpoint of each phase and an optional subjective appetite testing session lasting four hours
      was offered at the endpoint of each phase. During appetite testing sessions, participants
      consumed an amount of food equal in total energy and macronutrient content at either one
      occasion at 8:00 am ("low-EF" condition) or spread evenly over two smaller eating occasions
      at 8:00 am and 10:30 am ("high-EF" condition). Ratings of hunger, desire to eat, fullness,
      thirst, and nausea were made every 30 minutes using paper-and-pencil semi-anchored 100-mm
      Visual Analog Scales. A composite appetite score was calculated as the mean of hunger, desire
      to eat, and 100-fullness. The generalized estimating equation modification of linear
      regression was used to compare fasting plasma biomarkers and mean ratings of subjective
      appetite.
