      consisted of a 4-week screening period during which participants' genotype was assessed for
      α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in response to migalastat via an in vitro assay.
      Participants were required to have α-Gal A activity responsive to migalastat. The study
      consisted of a 12-week treatment period, followed by an optional 36-week extension period.
      Participants received migalastat 150 milligrams (mg) once every other day (QOD) for 12 weeks
      during the treatment period. Participants could then opt to participate in the extension
      period.
