    
      Prospective, multicentre, randomised, parallel group, open, phase III clinical trial, for
      patients with confirmed diagnosis of untreated multiple myeloma requiring systemic therapy.

      Investigational Medicinal Products: Isatuximab, Lenalidomide

        1. Randomization: Patients are randomized in one of 2 study arms (IA or IB) before
           induction therapy. Patients randomized in arm IA will receive 3 cycles RVd (Bortezomib
           (Velcade®), Lenalidomide (Revlimid®, each cycle is 42 days), Dexamethasone). Patients in
           arm IB will additionally receive the monoclonal antibody Isatuximab in the 3 cycles RVd.
           After induction therapy patients undergo intensifying therapy according to GMMG standard
           (usually mobilization therapy followed by stem cell collection and autologous stem cell
           transplantation).

        2. Randomization: Before maintenance treatment patients are randomized in one of 2 study
           arms (IIA and IIB): Patients in arm IIA receive Lenalidomide maintenance therapy for
           three years, patients in arm IIB receive additional Isatuximab.

      There are two primary objectives:

        1. to compare the induction regimen (IA vs IB) regarding minimal residual disease (MRD)
           negativity after induction (assessed by flow cytometry; sensitivity at least 1e-5)

        2. to compare the maintenance strategies (arms IIA vs IIB) regarding progression-free
           survival (PFS), defined as time from 2nd randomization (prior to maintenance therapy) to
           progression or death from any cause whichever occurs first.

      The duration of the trial for each patients is expected to be 45-48 months (induction and
      intensification treatment: 6-9 months, 3 months rest between intensification and start of
      maintenance phase 36 months).
