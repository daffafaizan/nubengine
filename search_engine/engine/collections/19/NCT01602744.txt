      effects,hospitalization and falls. In this trial we want to check the efficacy of the
      screening tools STOPP/START which were developed and validated in order to reduce
      inappropriate prescribing. STOPP comprises of 65 indicators of drug-drug, drug-disease
      interactions and therapeutic duplication. START incorporates 22 evidence based indicators of
      common prescribing omissions. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the
      hypothesis that screening the medications of older patients living permanently in a geriatric
      hospital will improve their quality of life. The compliance of the doctor working in the
      geriatric hospital to the recommendations of the screening tools will also be checked.
