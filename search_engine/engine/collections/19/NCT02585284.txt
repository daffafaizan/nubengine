      index (BIS) value of 46 before anesthesia induction, and a 91-yr-old nonagenarian fully
      conscious at BIS value of 52 after propofol anesthesia recovery. BIS algorithm was
      heuristically derived from a database of mostly "relatively fit, young healthy" volunteers.
      To date there are no studies precisely quantifying BIS response to propofol concentrations
      among different age groups.

      Methods: Investigators set Propofol estimated plasma concentrations (Cp) to gradually reach
      3.5 microgÂ·mL-1 over 3.5 min in 80 patients, five male and five female, divided by age
      decades from vicenarian (20-29 yr) to nonagenarians (90-99 yr). BIS values were fitted
      against Cp in our newly devised logistic model and traditional sigmoid Emax model. Raw BIS
      electroencephalography and measured propofol arterial samples determined whether changes are
      pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic asserted.
