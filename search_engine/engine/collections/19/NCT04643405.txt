      therapy. IAPs are an important class of apoptosis-regulating proteins. APG-1387, a potent
      bivalent SMAC mimetic, small molecule of IAP inhibitor, which could inhibit pancreatic cancer
      proliferation as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy through apoptosis pathway.

      It's an open label, multiple centers phase Ib/II Study. Safety and tolerability of APG1387
      combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be evaluated in phase Ib in
      previously-treated, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Efficacy and tolerability
      will be evaluated in phase II study in first line standard treatment failed metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients.
