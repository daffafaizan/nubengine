      this pilot feasibility study. Following completion of informed consent, patients will
      complete a baseline assessment consisting of various QoL/distress assessments including the
      Trail Making Test, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog),
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
      Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), the
      Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - short form (FFMQ-SF), the Functional Assessment of
      Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp12), the NCCN Distress Thermometer with
      Symptom Inventory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). They will then begin
      the mindfulness intervention, consisting of six weekly telephone-based mindfulness sessions
      followed by one in-person mindfulness session. Post-treatment measures and an Exit Survey
      will be administered following the one in-person mindfulness session. Two months later, the
      QoL, cognition and distress assessments will be repeated and a Final Exit Survey will be
      administered. The Exit Survey will ask the patient about their individual mindfulness
      practice during the intervention, their intention to continue the practice beyond
      participation in this study, their satisfaction with the services received, and their
      perception of the effectiveness of the program. The Final Exit Survey will ask the patient
      about their mindfulness practice since the Exit Survey, and their intention to continue with
      the mindfulness practice. The investigators will also collect demographic data such as age,
      marital status, education, employment, date of diagnosis and death, tumor grade, histology,
      and type of treatment from the patient.
