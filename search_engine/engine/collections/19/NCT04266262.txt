      The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a three-armed
      randomized controlled trial comparing high-intensity interval training (HIIT), high-intensity
      resistance training (HIRT), and usual care (UC) in men with PCa on AS.

      The secondary exploratory objective of this study is to assess changes in cardiorespiratory
      fitness, musculoskeletal strength, body composition, circulating blood markers, and
      participant-self-reported outcomes (e.g., quality of life, anxiety, fear of disease
      progression) after 8 weeks of HIIT, HIRT, or UC.

      Methods:

      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to HIIT, HIRT or UC group.

      Participants in the HIIT and HIRT group will undergo training 3 times per week (two
      supervised and one home-based/unsupervised training session) for 8 weeks.

      The UC group will be directed towards publicly available literature on physical activity
      (e.g., Cancer Care Ontario's physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors) and will
      receive an individualized exercise program upon completion of their final fitness assessment.
