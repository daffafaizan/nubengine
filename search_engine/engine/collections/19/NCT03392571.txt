    
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the study drugs nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and
      gemcitabine given together are safe and effective. The combination of nab-paclitaxel plus
      gemcitabine has been studied in treating patients with pancreatic cancer, and as of
      September, 2013 is approved for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. In this study,
      cisplatin will be added to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine, and tested in people who have not
      yet had any cancer therapy for the diagnosis of localized pancreatic cancer, as treatment
      prior to surgery, with the goal of improving response.

      Another name for nab-paclitaxel is Abraxane®. Nab-paclitaxel contains the same medication as
      the prescription chemotherapy drug Abraxane®. Nab-paclitaxel is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of advanced breast cancer, and in September, 2013 nab-paclitaxel, combined with
      gemcitabine, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Cisplatin is approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced bladder cancer, advanced
      ovarian cancer, and advanced testicular cancer and other childhood cancers. However,
      cisplatin is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Gemcitabine was approved by the FDA in 1996 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. It is
      also an approved treatment for ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer.

      Nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine will be given weekly for 2 weeks followed by a
      week of rest, for a total of 3 cycles. A cycle is defined as one set of 3 weeks of
      chemotherapy treatment. Patients will undergo surgery after a minimum of 3 weeks after Cycle
      3 of chemotherapy. Following surgery, patients mayl be treated for up to 3 cycles of this
      same chemotherapy combination.
