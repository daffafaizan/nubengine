      the hospital as well as the incidence of new wound healing disorders during hospital stay
      with specific focus on malnutrition and other important nutritional parameters in geriatric
      patients. Therefore the investigators intend to study consecutively admitted patients both at
      admission and at discharge and monitor them during hospital stay.

      The investigators will investigate the associations between the individual nutritional status
      and body composition parameters (such as sarcopenia) and WHD in geriatric patients, taking
      both medical variables and the frailty syndrome into account.
