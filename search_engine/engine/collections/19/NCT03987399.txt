    
      This study will be conducted on four surgical wards in one university hospital in Norway.
      There will be used different methodological approaches for data collections (interviews,
      questionnaire, observational study) with four measurement points; baseline (T1), and one
      month (T2), six months (T3) and 12 months (T4) after intervention.

      To get a broader view of barriers and facilitators for effective pediatric postoperative pain
      management, there will be carried out focus group interviews with healthcare providers.
      Further, data about healthcare providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding pediatric pain
      will be collected using a questionnaire. Data about nurses' pediatric postoperative pain
      management will be collected using non-participant observational study and data about
      children's experience about pain and pain management will be collected using face-to-face
      interviews with children. This study will have different phases:

      Phase 1 Explore healthcare providers' knowledge, clinical practice children's experiences of
      pain and pain management, and healthcare providers' experiences of barriers and facilitators
      for effective pain management

        -  Questionnaire PNKAS-N

        -  Observation of clinical practice

        -  Face-to-face interviews with children

        -  Focus group interviews with healthcare providers (barriers and facilitators)

      Phase 2 Develop and implement a tailored educational intervention

      Develop tailored educational intervention based on:

        -  Available research

        -  Results from baseline

        -  Feedback from head of the relevant units

        -  Staff views about the facilitators and barriers to optimized pediatric pain management

      Implementation of the intervention

        -  Seminar (lecture and workshop)

        -  Clinical supervision

        -  Reminders

      Phase 3 Evaluation of the intervention

        -  Questionnaire PNKAS-N

        -  Observation of clinical practice
