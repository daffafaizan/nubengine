    
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a chronic, progressive, pulmonary vascular disease with a
      multifactorial etiology and a not fully elucidated pathophysiological background. There is a
      complex and not adequately understood association between PH and the coagulation process.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate hemostasis in patients with PH classified as
      category 1 of the World Health Organization Pulmonary Hypertension Group (Pulmonary Arterial
      Hypertension, PAH) and 4 (Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension, CTEPH). Patients
      with CTEPH are diagnosed as inoperable. The investigators perform diagnostic tests on blood
      samples collected directly from the pulmonary artery during the right heart catheterization
      performed as part of the patients' routine medical care for the diagnosis of the disease or
      for follow-up 6 months after the initiation of PH-specific treatment. All blood samples are
      processed by platelet function analyzer-100 (PFA-100), light transmission aggregometry (LTA),
      rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP).The primary
      objective of the study is to assess platelet function, coagulation and anti-coagulation
      pathways and fibrinolysis in PAH and inoperable CTEPH patients and to investigate the
      possible effects of PH- specific therapy on hemostasis.
