      active antiretroviral treatment over long periods, which may lead to the development of
      antiretroviral-associated toxicities. The current standard-of-care HAART regimens include a
      backbone of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Many studies have
      demonstrated that NRTIs particularly thymidine analogue nucleosides are important
      contributors to the development of lipoatrophy. This antiretroviral family inhibits also the
      mitochondrial gamma-DNA polymerase, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and side effects
      such as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis and liver dysfunction.
