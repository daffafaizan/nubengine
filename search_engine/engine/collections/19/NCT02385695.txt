        1. To evaluate superiority of Surgical treatment with posterior dynamic stabilization
           compared to Surgical treatment with internal fixation and fusion in lumbar range of
           motion;

        2. To compare Surgical treatment with posterior dynamic stabilization compared to Surgical
           treatment with internal fixation and fusion in functional outcomes as measured by change
           in Oswestry Disability Index;

        3. To compare radiological, clinical, patient-reported and, safety outcomes between the two
           surgical approaches.
