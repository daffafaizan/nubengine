      been extensively documented in patients undergoing spine surgery. However, we have no reason
      to believe that patients with hip pathology are uniquely exempt from the influence of
      psychosocial factors. To our knowledge, no study has been done to evaluate the effect of
      pre-operative psychological distress on outcomes after hip preservation surgery. We therefore
      propose to use the DRAM to measure pre-operative distress in patients undergoing open or
      arthroscopic hip preservation surgery and to compare these pre-operative distress scores with
      post-operative outcomes. We hope the information we gain will allow clinicians to
      comprehensively evaluate the patient with hip pain and to make more informed choices about
      operative treatment.
