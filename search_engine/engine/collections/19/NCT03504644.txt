      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of venetoclax in combination with vincristine
      liposomal (liposomal vincristine) in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell and B-cell
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). (Phase I) II. Safety assessment and toxicity
      characterization after treatment of venetoclax in combination with liposomal vincristine in
      patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell and B-cell ALL. (Phase I) III. To determine the
      preliminary efficacy of venetoclax in combination with liposomal vincristine to induce
      complete remission (CR) by day 70 in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell and B-cell
      ALL. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival, overall survival and toxicity after the
      combination treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory T-cell and B-cell ALL. (Phase
      II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if genetic signature as determined by next generation sequencing can predict
      response to combination. (Phase II) II. To determine if immunophenotype of ALL is associated
      with response to combination. (Phase II) III. To determine if the BH3 profile is associated
      with response to combination. (Phase II) IV. To determine if relative expression of BCL-2
      measure by flow cytometry is associated with response to combination. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of venetoclax, followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-42 of course 1 and days
      43-70 of course 2. Patients also receive vincristine liposomal intravenously (IV) weekly for
      4 weeks starting on day 14 of course 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
