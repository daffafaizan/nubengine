      will determine eligibility. All eligible subjects will be invited back for a third visit, and
      only subjects with mild allergic asthma will be invited back for a fourth visit.

      Screening Period (Visits 1 and 2) - For All Subjects Eligible subjects will be identified
      during the initial screening procedures with measures of spirometry, hyperresponsiveness to
      methacholine, complete history, physical examination, allergen skin test, and mannitol cough
      challenge. The screening procedures will be conducted over 2 separate visits.

      Reproducibility (Visit 3) - For Healthy Controls Ten normal healthy controls meeting study
      eligibility will return for visit 3. This visit must be at least 24h after the mannitol test
      at visit 1. These data will be used for assessing reproducibility of the mannitol induced
      coughs; Emax and the median effective dose (ED50).

      Effects of Salbutamol (Visit 3 and 4) - For Mild Allergic Asthma Subjects Ten subjects with
      mild allergic asthma will return for visit 3 and 4. These visits must be at least 24h apart
      and no longer than 7 days. Mild allergic asthmatics will first receive salbutamol 2.5mg or
      saline placebo via a nebuliser and 15 mins later the forced expiratory volume at one second
      (FEV1) measured. Subjects will then undergo a mannitol cough challenge exactly like the
      previous mannitol cough challenges. These data will be used for determining the effects of
      salbutamol on mannitol-induced bronchoconstriction and cough.

      Visit Windows Each visit must be separated by a minimum of 24 hours, and a maximum of 7 days.
      Study visits can be performed in the morning or afternoon, however for each subject the
      timing should be consistent with Visits 2 at the same time of day Â± 2 hours
