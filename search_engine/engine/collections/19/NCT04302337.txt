      observed frequently after conventional cold curettage adenoidectomy. New techniques to better
      visualize or excise the tissue in order to prevent this situation are being developed. This
      study aims to compare transoral endoscopic controlled adenoidectomy with conventional blind
      curettage adenoidectomy in terms of recurrent adenoid hypertrophy. Although there are other
      studies comparing the results of the two techniques in terms of early residual adenoid tissue
      and bleeding, no studies comparing the long term results were found in literature. This
      prospective study is planned to focus on both early examination of residual tissue and long
      term recurrence.
