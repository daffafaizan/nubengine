      prehabilitation interventions for abdominal cancer patients may be found in the field of
      sport science. The investigators have identified two primary strategies to improve and
      optimize prehabilitation in patients with abdominal cancer: exercise and nutritional
      supplementation. A home-based exercise program incorporating both walking and resistance
      training will be performed with blood flow restriction training (BFR). BFR is a cutting-edge
      training modality that works by restricting blood flow out of the veins by using compression
      devices similar to traditional blood pressure cuffs (1). This training modality is frequently
      used by injured athletes for enhanced recovery (2). Muscle hypertrophy and increased muscle
      strength are more robust and achievable with BFR, even if exercises are performed at low to
      moderate intensities (2). Additionally, the implementation of a sports nutrition supplement
      cocktail, which will be provided simultaneously with the 4-week BFR exercise intervention,
      was developed to augment the effects of resistance exercise by increasing overall anabolism
      (3) and to remedy the catabolic state that cancer patients often experience (4). The
      nutrition supplement cocktail will include whey protein, creatine monohydrate, and
      L-citrulline.
