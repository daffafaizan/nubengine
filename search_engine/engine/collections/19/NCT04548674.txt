      allocated into five groups (n = 6): CN (negative control): without intervention; CP (Positive
      control): PH; PMB: PH + photobiomodulation with low power laser; CPP: PH + casein
      phosphopeptide phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACPF); NANO: PH +
      nanohydroxyapatite. The office whitening was performed in two sessions with a single
      application of 45 min and an interval of 48 hours between them. Pulp tissues were removed for
      immunohistochemical analysis. Immunostaining was performed for Caspase 3 using an Axio
      Scope.A1 microscope.
