      taking into account a device previously used in telehealth studies in Saskatchewan. The scale
      was initially used as part of a national study to evaluate the use of telehealth practices in
      improving professional access by residents of isolated Northern First Nations communities.The
      scale designed for telehealth services has been developed in English. Validity and
      reliability studies have been carried out by being translated into various languages. The
      Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale, originally in English, has not been
      conducted before.
