      will consist of the development, application, modification, and repeated practice of
      individualized withdrawal regulation for behavioral and cognitive strategies. the RT
      condition will control for the therapeutic contact received by those in the E+WT condition
      and will consist of the development, application, modification, and repeated practice of
      individualized relaxation techniques (e.g. breathing exercises, imagery).
