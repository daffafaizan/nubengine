      of cancer. The rising incidence of brain metastasis is most likely due to recent advances in
      systemic therapy, and use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most common primary site
      is the lung followed by breast. One of the standard treatments is whole brain radiotherapy;
      it can prolong the decline of neurocognitive function and improve quality of life. However,
      it can also cause decline in neurocognitive function as a late sequela. Memory impairment is
      the main cognitive function that affected by radiotherapy, and the neuronal stem cells
      located at hippocampal subgranular zone are highly sensitive to radiotherapy. There have been
      large randomized trials confirming that by HA-WBRT, the neurocognitive function decline can
      be reclaimed. In Taiwan, HA-WBRT is a popular and emerging treatment. However, not much study
      focused on its effects on neurocognitive function. The study is aimed to objectively
      investigate the memory preservation and neurocognitive function protection of HA-WBRT in
      people speaking Mandarin Chinese or Taiwanese by utilizing neurocognitive function test and
      QoL questionnaire.
