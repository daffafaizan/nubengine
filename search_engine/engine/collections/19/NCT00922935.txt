      placed in the edentulous upper jaw supporting a 10-12 unit screw-retained fixed partial
      denture (FPD). The main objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of Straumann
      implants supporting a FPD using Straumann Implants and Cresco restorative components in early
      and delayed loading protocols at one year post-loading. The treatment groups consist of an
      early loading and delayed loading arm using Cresco restorative components loading time 10
      days post surgery and at 6-8 weeks respectively. The control group comprise the standard
      delayed loading protocol (healing period 6-8 weeks) and Straumann restorative components. The
      primary objective is to compare changes in crestal bone levels on radiographs between
      implants in the control group and test groups at 1 year.The patients will be followed for 3
      years.
