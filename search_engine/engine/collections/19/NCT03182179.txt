    
      This is a multi-centre randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study aimed
      at testing the efficacy of Ondansetron in the low anterior resection syndrome (LARS)
      occurring as a consequence of surgery for rectal cancer.

      Patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive either 4 weeks of Ondansetron followed by
      4 weeks of placebo (O-P sequence) or 4 weeks of placebo followed by 4 weeks of Ondansetron
      (P-O sequence). Neither the investigator nor the patient will be aware of the sequence (O-P
      or P-O) assigned to the patient. One week will elapse between the end of the first treatment
      and start of the second treatment.

      The hypothesis to be tested is that 4 weeks of oral Ondansetron at the dose of 4mg BID induce
      a variation of the LARS Score at least 7 points (20%) greater than the variation occurring
      after 4 weeks of placebo.

      The sample size calculated for the primary analysis is 38 evaluable patients. Considering an
      expected attrition rate of about 20%, it is expected to enrol approximately 46 patients in
      total.
