      paradigm in colorectal cancer screening termed "resect and discard". This new paradigm
      challenges the current practice of sending all colorectal polyps, regardless of appearance or
      size, to pathology for analysis. "Resect and Discard" describes a new approach in which small
      polyps could be removed, but be discarded instead of sent for pathology analysis. This is
      based on data showing that gastroenterologists can predict the pathology of small colorectal
      polyps with 80-90% accuracy, and that discarding small polyps would not alter surveillance
      recommendations.

      Neither the ASGE document nor published research, however, assessed patient attitudes toward
      this approach. This study surveyed patients prior to first time screening colonoscopy, in
      order to determine their preferences about the resect and discard approach; specifically
      would patients be willing to pay for pathology analysis of small colorectal polyps with their
      own money, and what factors influence their decision. We also inquired about factors that
      would influence their decision to pay/not pay pathology costs themselves.
