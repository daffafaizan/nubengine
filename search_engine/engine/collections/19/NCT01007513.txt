      birth has risen worldwide over the past decades. Preterm birth is, all over the world, the
      first cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity. Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) groups
      premature births with intact and ruptured membranes and represents 70% of preterm delivery.
      The two conditions associated with sPTB share a common physiopathology and a progressive
      cascade of events. Extensive evidence supports a central role for the production of
      prostaglandins, inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in the cervix and
      decidua to promote cervical ripening and decidual and fetal membrane activation but, the
      exact progression of events remains unclear. Several factors were described as risk factor
      for sPTB like bacterial vaginosis, inflammatory cytokines and fetal fibronectin in vaginal
      secretions. The transvaginal ultrasound of the cervix (TVUS), which estimates the length and
      the aspect of the cervix, can be used as predictive factor of preterm birth. To date, no
      study has addressed the supra-cervical region by transvaginal ultrasound. This region may be
      an important key of the inflammatory process leading to sPTB. The assessment of this region
      by ultrasound can be a predictive marker of sPTB. We want to prove the feasibility of this
      new approach of sPTB prediction : the transvaginal ultrasound assessment of the supracervical
      and cervical region associated with detection of vaginal inflammation.
