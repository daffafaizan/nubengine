      I. To estimate the disease control rate of AZD0530 (saracatinib) in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy of AZD0530 in terms of overall response rate (complete and
      partial response) and progression free survival.

      II. To describe the toxicity profile of AZD0530 in this patient population. III. To
      prospectively explore changes in circulating tumor cells from pre-treatment levels in
      patients receiving AZD0530.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive saracatinib orally (PO) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
