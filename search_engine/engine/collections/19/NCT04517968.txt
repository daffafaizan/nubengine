      and eliminates the need of second surgery. The problem is that the jummping gap between the
      implant and the bone that needs bone graft, this increase the cost on the patient. In this
      experiment we tend to evaluate this technique which may help us in growing autogenous bone
      and stop the need for bone grafting.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate clinically and radiographically the effect of customized
      healing abutment on peri-implant osteogenesis following immediate implant placement.

      A clinical trial was carried out on 8 patients (20-40 years old) with freshly extracted
      mandibular molars. Implants were placed immediately after extraction and a customized healing
      abutment will be fabricated. Patients were followed up clinically and radio graphically for 6
      months.
