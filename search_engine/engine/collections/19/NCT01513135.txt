      randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity
      (as a primary end-point) and the safety (as a secondary end-point), of a therapeutic,
      recombinant, biologically active HIV-1 Tat vaccine in HIV-1 infected, anti-Tat antibody
      negative, ARV-treated adult volunteers with chronically suppressed HIV-1 infection as
      indicated by a HIV-1 plasma viraemia < 400 copies/ml, and a CD4+ T cell count ≥ 200 cells/μl,
      at screening and documented at least once during the 12 month period prior to screening,
      irrespective of the pre-ARV CD4 nadir.

      After a screening period of up to 21 days, the study duration will be 48 weeks, including an
      8 week treatment phase (during which 3 vaccinations will be administered at 4-week intervals)
      and a 40 week follow-up phase.

      This study will be conducted at 1 clinical site in South Africa. 200 Subjects were randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups (Tat 30 mcg or placebo administered
      intradermally, 3 times).
