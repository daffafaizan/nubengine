      precision while the substudy (Helios) investigated potential haematocrit interference of
      sanofi-aventis BGMSs BGStar® and iBGStar® and partly of competitor BGMSs according to ISO
      15197 [1] and TNO 2001 Quality Guideline [2], respectively.

      The primary objective of the system accuracy evaluation is to identify the number of blood
      glucose readings of both sanofi-aventis devices within the ISO 15197 area of acceptable
      accuracy of ± 20% [DEV%] for blood samples with glucose concentration > 75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L)
      and within the ISO 15197 area of acceptable accuracy of ± 15 mg/dL (± 0.83 mmol/L) for blood
      samples with glucose concentration < 75 mg/dL (4.2 mmol/L) as compared to the StatStrip®
      Connectivity reference method. The primary objective of the haematocrit interference
      evaluation is to demonstrate that the BGStar® and iBGStar® devices meet the Hct interference
      requirements according to TNO 2001 Quality Guideline when used to measure BG of venous whole
      blood as compared to a venous plasma reference method (YSI 2300 STAT Plus™) at Hct levels
      between 35 - 55% in terms of:(1) a mean deviation not exceeding ± 10% [DEV%] for
      hyperglycaemic glucose concentrations (150 - 180, 250 - 280, 320 - 350 mg/dL) and (2)a mean
      deviation not exceeding ± 18 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) [DEVtotal] for hypo- and normoglycaemic
      glucose values (50 - 60, 100 - 120 mg/dL) compared to the reference method at Hct levels
      between 35 - 55%.
