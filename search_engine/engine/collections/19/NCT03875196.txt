    
      Introduction and hypothesis: This research was made in order to analyze the impact of the
      with with Electromyelographic-Biyofeedback added Extracorporeal Magnetic Innervation
      technique performed on the urinary symptoms, quality of life and sexual function of women
      with stress urinary incontinence.

      Methods: The research type is a pre-test and post-test randomized controlled with
      experimental nature. The research sample consists of 26 patients in the Biyofeedback group
      and 25 patients in the with Electromyelographic-Biyofeedback added Extracorporeal Magnetic
      Innervation group who were examined in the urogynecology policlinics and diagnosed with
      stress urinary incontinence. between September 2015 and September 2016. At the first meeting,

      volume, one-hour pad test, perineometer, muscle force measurement with Modified Oxford Scale
      and a three-day bladder diary. Moreover, the Electromyelographic-Biyofeedback was applied to
      the first group in the clinic for 20 minutes two days a week for eight weeks. The
      Electromyelographic-Biyofeedback following with 20 minutes Extracorporeal Magnetic
      Innervation was applied to the second group in the clinic for 20 minutes two days a week for
      eight weeks. The list applied at the first meeting were repeated after eight weeks.
