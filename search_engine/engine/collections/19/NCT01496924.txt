      hospital Inclusion criteria are: patients under mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy for
      at least 48 hours, appropriate level of consciousness (Glasgow coma scale ≥ 11), hemodynamic
      stability without need for vasoactive drugs; minimum mechanical ventilation parameters
      characterized by: pressure support ventilation (PSV) ≤ 20 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) ≤ 8 cm H2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 50 and respiratory rate ≤ 30
      inspirations per minute. Primary exclusion criteria are: patients who underwent surgery with
      resection of structures of oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and/or esophagus; nasal fracture or
      skull base fracture preventing otorhinolaryngological exam; possible surgical treatment after
      ICU admission with no reasonable time for carrying out the planned intervention; degenerative
      diseases characterized by outbreaks and remissions; past history of oropharyngeal dysphagia,
      previous speech therapy, excessive amount of thick tracheal secretion requiring frequent
      tracheal suctioning, end-stage of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tracheoesophageal
      fistula, allergy to dyes, and low survival expectancy.

      The study consist of three stages: (1) sample selection with a test of the speaking valve and
      initial assessments, (2) swallowing rehabilitation and (3) post-treatment reassessments.
      Clinical assessments will be performed by speech-pathologists and otorhinolaryngologists with
      patients under mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, patients with dysphagia will be
      submitted to a rehabilitation program with standardized intervention, followed by a new
      assessment of abnormalities. The efficacy of swallowing treatment will be assessed by
      comparing the scores before and after treatment. Paired Student's test or Wilcoxon-test will
      be applied, according to data distribution. Categorical variables will be expressed as number
      and percentage and analyzed through McNemar test. All p-values will be two-sided and a
      p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
