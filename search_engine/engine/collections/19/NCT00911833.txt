      hypothetical behavioral responses to randomized hypothetical vignettes illustrating the
      prescription of conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized medicine for a common
      chronic condition. This study is theoretically guided by conceptualizations of
      relationship-centered care and the risk information seeking and processing model. These
      theories recognize the importance of interpersonal influence within health care interactions,
      underscore the moral dimensions of patient-physician relationships, and describe the
      predictors of how information is attended to and processed. An experimental, mixed methods
      design will be used to randomly assign 357 patients at the Johns Hopkins clinics to one of
      three vignettes illustrating conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized
      medication offers. This study aims to examine the effects of the type of medication offer
      (conventional, race-based, and genetically personalized) and certain participant
      characteristics (race, literacy, background healthcare trust/experience with discrimination)
      on attitudinal, emotional, cognitive, and hypothetical behavioral responses; to determine if
      the relationships among the type of medication offer and the four categories of outcomes are
      moderated by race and mediated by trust; and to describe the participants' perspective on the
      vignette, through targeted open-ended questions.
