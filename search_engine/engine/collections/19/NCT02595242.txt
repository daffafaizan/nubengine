      antineoplastic effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The investigator´s phaseⅠstudy
      has shown that the drug´s toxicity is manageable and the tolerable does is 20 mg/m2. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection
      plus Cyclophosphamide,Vincristine and Prednison(CNOP)is safe and effective in the treatment
      of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.Patients physical state, symptoms, changes in the size of
      the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide
      if Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection plus Cyclophosphamide,Vincristine and
      Prednison(CNOP)is safe and effective in the treatment of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma.
