      participate in future research) and 10 participants from a community settings. Those with low
      mood and poor glycemic control were offered a 12-week intervention combining cognitive
      behavioral therapy mood management techniques and diabetes self-care into one seamless
      intervention. Drs. Mangione and Miranda supervised and reviewed (through audiotapes)
      well-trained health educators conducting the intervention sessions. The study manuals were
      modified following this Phase I pilot intervention.

      The final intervention manual was tested in a randomized trial in Phase II, compared the Mood
      and Diabetes Empowerment and Improvement Training intervention with enhanced care as usual
      (providing participants with a letter regarding their mood and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c with
      recommendations for improving care for their provider). The target population was low-income
      Latinos with depression and poor glycemic control. Both mood and diabetes outcomes are
      evaluated.
