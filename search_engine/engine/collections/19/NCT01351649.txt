      efficacy for a 6-month "Girls on the Move" intervention (guided by the Health Promotion Model
      and Social Cognitive Theory). The intervention involves motivational, individually tailored
      counseling plus after-school physical activity (PA) to increase moderate to vigorous physical
      activity (MVPA) and cardiovascular (CV) fitness, as well as improve body composition and
      cognition and affective responses related to MVPA among 6th-grade girls. Specifically, it
      consists of a 90-minute after-school PA Club that includes MVPA and 6 one-on-one monthly
      motivational, individually tailored counseling sessions with a registered (school) nurse
      during the school day to support each girl's continued MVPA. Applying the motivational
      interviewing communication style, the school nurse will individually tailor the counseling
      based upon each girl's key responses gleaned from computerized questionnaires assessing
      cognitive and affective variables related to MVPA. One middle school will be randomly
      assigned to receive the intervention and another to serve as attention control.
