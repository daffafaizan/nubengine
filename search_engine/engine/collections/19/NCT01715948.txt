    
      Users of the BAHD will be given a 2-week trial period with the Unitron Tandem CROS hearing
      aid. Participants will be randomly assigned to wear either their BAHD for two weeks or the
      trial CROS for two weeks. There will be a total of three visits made to the clinic.

      During each visit:

        -  Participants' hearing will be tested (either with the BAHD, the CROS, or without wearing
           any device).

        -  Speech perception ability will be tested in quiet and in noise conditions (either while
           wearing the BAHD, the CROS, or no device).

        -  Participants will be asked to complete two standardized questionnaires on the perceived
           benefits that the BAHD or the CROS provides.

      In addition, participants will be asked to fill out a short diary form every day, for a
      two-week period, to report the situations in which they wore the device.
