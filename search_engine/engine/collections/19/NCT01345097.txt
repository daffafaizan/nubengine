      new short, metaphyseal-fitting cementless anatomical femoral stem was developed. The question
      arises as to whether it is possible to obtain rigid fixation of the stem without diaphyseal
      fixation in the young as well as in the elderly patients. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the clinical and radiographic results of the new short, metaphyseal-fitting
      cementless anatomical femoral stem in the young as well as in the elderly patients.
