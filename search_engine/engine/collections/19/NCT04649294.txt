      participate in this study. The minimal total intravenous dose was 375 mg prednisone, and the
      daily steroids were divided into 2-3 doses. To determine the steroids' effect on myocardial
      function the echocardiographic studies included estimation of global and segmental
      longitudinal strain. Each patient had a baseline echocardiographic study performed before
      high-dose steroid therapy was initiated and again immediately after it. A follow-up echo
      study was performed after completion of a 3-month low-dose steroid therapy period. The paired
      2-tailed t-test was used to compare group means
