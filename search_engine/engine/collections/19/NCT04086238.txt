      tetrahydrouridine (THU) after a high-fat, high-calorie (FDA standard) meal as compared to
      decitabine and THU under fasting conditions in healthy adult male and female subjects. In
      addition, this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters between male and female
      subjects, and also to capture safety information for the decitabine and THU combination in
      healthy subjects after oral dosing.
