      product is taken as supportive care for 23 consecutive days during chemotherapy treatment.
      Hematologic and safety parameters as well as actual begin and doses of following chemotherapy
      cycles will be assessed. A single primary variable will be analyzed with test statistics
      based on frequent absolute neutrophil measurements. Additionally, in a subgroup of patients
      biomarkers and pharmacokinetics of Myelo001 will be investigated.
