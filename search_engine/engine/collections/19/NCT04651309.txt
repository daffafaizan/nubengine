      numbers can be as high as 25%. Most infections are a result of an ascending infection of the
      normal vaginal flora. Among risk factors are nulliparity, rupture of membranes, an extended
      duration of labor, multiple vaginal examinations and GBS colonization.

      The digital vaginal examination remains to this day the standard method for evaluating the
      patient's cervical status. However, this method is both highly subjective as well as painful
      and stressogenic for the patients.

      In recent years there has been great progress in the field of translabial/transperineal
      sonography. There have been several studies which showed that this technique could be as
      useful as digital examinations in helping clinicians predict the course of labor. Recent
      studies demonstrate that using transperineal sonography can reduce the perception of pain
      compared with routine digital vaginal examinations. Even so, there has been little evidence
      as to whether using perineal ultrasound may also reduce peripartum and puerperal infections
      and if using sonography and refraining from digital examinations affects the course and
      duration of labor.

      Our objective is to evaluate whether the incidence of chorioamnionitis or fever can be
      decreased. This goal would hopefully be achieved by assessing the progression of labor using
      mostly transperineal ultrasound, thus avoiding digital vaginal examination as much as
      possible.

      The study would focus on primigravid women as they are known to be in a higher risk for
      infection and also other potential risk factors such as GBS carriers and PROM.
