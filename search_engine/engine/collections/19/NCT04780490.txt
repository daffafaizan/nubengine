      major surgeries. Avoiding excess fluid resuscitation in the perioperative period is essential
      for reducing postoperative complications, morbidity and long-term mortality. In the
      perioperative period, ANP is released with increased wall stress in the cardiac atrium due to
      excess fluid loading. With the release of ANP, damage occurs in the glycocalyx layer, which
      is the structure primarily responsible for the permeability in the vascular endothelium.

      Thus, the amount of ANP released from atrium and heparan sulfate, syndecan 1, hyaluronan in
      the glycocalyx layer structure increases in the blood.

      The aim of this study is to compare changes in the glycocalyx structure by measuring the
      blood levels of ANP and heparan sulfate, hyaluronan and syndecan 1, which form the glycocalyx
      structure on the patients who received the liberal and restrictive fluid treatments during
      major urological surgeries. The blood samples will be taken at the beginning and at the end
      of the surgery.

      The primary outcome of this study is the increase in ANP levels and heparan sulfate ,
      hyaluronic acid, syndecan 1 levels which are the glycocalyx damage products in blood.

      Secondary outcomes are intraoperative advanced hemodynamic cardiac measurement values, the
      amount of blood and blood products replaced to patients, duration of intensive care stay,
      duration of hospital stay, cardiac and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal
      complications, urinary complications, surgical complications such as anastomotic leaks, wound
      infection and fistula.
