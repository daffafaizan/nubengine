    
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of LUCEMYRA in the treatment of opioid withdrawal during an opioid taper in
      subjects with chronic non-cancer pain.

      Subjects will begin a planned 14-day complete taper of their pre-study opioid medications and
      will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either LUCEMYRA or matching placebo. Study drug will be
      administered through the opioid taper and for 5 days after the opioid taper is completed.
      Study drug will then be tapered over a 4-day period for a total of approximately 21 days
      exposure to study drug.
