      resistant pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have
      become more common. There is an urgent need for additional antibacterial drugs with modes of
      action different from those currently available. CEM-102 is one such agent with excellent
      activity against S. aureus, including MRSA.
