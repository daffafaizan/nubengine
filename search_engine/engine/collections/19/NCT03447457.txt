    
      Prospective observational before-after study at the ED in two French centers.

      Selection of patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure at the ED.

      Application of oxygen strategy according to the period:

        -  before period: standard oxygen delivered through nasal cannula, face mask or
           non-rebreathing reservoir mask, with a flow rate adjusted to maintain a pulse oxymetry
           of at least 92%.

        -  after period: high-flow oxygen therapy continuously applied via large-bore nasal prongs
           with a gas flow rate of 50 L/min and a FiO2 adjusted to maintain a pulse oxymetry at
           least 92%.
