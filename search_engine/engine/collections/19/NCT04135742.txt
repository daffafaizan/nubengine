      current (1 to 2 mA) to apply a sinusoidal current to the scalp, directly interacting with the
      oscillating cortical activity at a given frequency with a given stimulus intensity. Studies
      have shown that simultaneous tACS on the left prefrontal lobe and left temporal lobe can
      significantly improve working memory in healthy older adults. The 40 Hz tACS is gamma
      oscillation, and more and more studies have pointed out that gamma oscillation regulation
      disorder is associated with impaired working memory function.CCT can improve the cognition in
      patients with MCI. We hypothesized that tACS combined with CCT can produce synergistic
      effects in sensitive brain areas.
