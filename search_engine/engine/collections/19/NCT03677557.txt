      treatment formulation.

      Polyvalent immunoglobulin treatment is used in patients with primary or secondary antibody
      deficiency diseases to prevent and lower the risk of infection. There are multiple products
      available in the market. Most products are administered via intravenous route such as
      Privigen® (CSL Behring), Gammunex® (Grifols), and Panzyga® (Octapharma). Up until recently,
      there have been only two products that are licensed for subcutaneous administration - 20%
      Hizentra® (CSL Behring) and 10% Gammunex® (Grifols).

      In our clinical experience, approximately 10% of patients treated with 20% Hizentra®
      developed adverse reactions. Some are mild and tolerable. Some are moderate to severe and
      required alteration of treatment plan: For example, changing the product from 20% Hizentra®
      to 10% Gammunex®. However, this results in a 100% increase in the injection volume due to the
      lesser concentration of the product, but a decrease in viscosity - both of which might alter
      overall tolerance. Likewise, any new treatment may bring new adverse events such as rash.

      In 2018, there will be two additional subcutaneous immunoglobulin products available in
      Canada - 16.5% Cutaquig® (Octapharma) and 20% Cuvitru® (Shire).

      Even though both new products are licensed and proven to be efficacious regarding preventing
      significant infection (1,2), the relative safety, tolerability, patient satisfaction,
      treatment-associated cost has not been studied in patients using the 16.5% Cutaquig®. The
      study product will be provided through the Canadian Blood Service (CBS) on a special request
      basis which is a standard procedure for any patients who are intolerable to inventory
      products.
