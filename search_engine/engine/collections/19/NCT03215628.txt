      during cardiac surgery. The majority of these interventions is performed during deep or
      moderate hypothermia (25-32Â°C) with reduced blood flow of the heart-lung-machine (HLM).
      Assuming a symmetrical anatomy of the cerebral arteries (C. Willisii) a single vessel (T.
      brachiocephalicus) is then supplying the cerebral blood flow. Using contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound the cerebral blood flow will be assessed during cardiac surgery interventions.
