      dose-escalation 3+3 design.

      This pilot study will evaluate nivolumab in combination with PAC-1 in subjects with
      metastatic RCC. Nivolumab will be delivered by IV infusion on Day 1 and PAC-1 will be taken
      orally on Days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle, and response will be evaluated after every 2
      cycles. Treatment will continue until disease progression (based on RECIST 1.1 criteria),
      unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or subject death either from progression of disease,
      the therapy itself, or from other causes. Subjects who voluntarily stop the study, have
      progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicities will be followed for survival every 3 months
      for 12 months from start of study medication
