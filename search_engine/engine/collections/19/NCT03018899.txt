      neuraxial anesthesia. The investigators have reported three patients who were at high risk of
      both general anesthesia and neuraxial anesthesia received percutaneous nephrolithotomy with
      ultrasound guided paravertebral block. Thenï¼ŒThe investigators performed ultrasound guided
      paravertebral block for 45 patients who received percutaneous nephrolithotomy successfully.
      The investigators' impression is that paravertebral block is as effective as epidural
      anesthesia for surgical anesthesia of percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

      Objectives:To assess the efficacy and safety of paravertebral block compared to epidural
      anesthesia for surgical anesthesia of percutaneous nephrolithotomy.

      Methods: Fifty adult patients undergoing elective percutaneous nephrolithotomy will be
      randomized to receive ultrasound guided paravertebral block or epidural anesthesia. The
      primary outcome will be the pain score 12h postoperation. The secondary outcomes will
      include: time spent to perform block, dose of intraoperative opioids, rate of hypotension
      need for vasoconstrictors, muscle Power Grading of the lower legs at the end of the
      operation, anus exhaust time, opioid consumption postoperation, postoperative PONV score and
      the frequency of vomiting , hospitalization duration and patient satisfaction.

      Clinical Implications: Ultrasound guided paravertebral block could be an equally effective
      and safe alternative to epidural block for surgical anesthesia of percutaneous
      nephrolithotomy.
