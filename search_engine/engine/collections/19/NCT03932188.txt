      Symptoms of schizophrenia include paranoia, hallucinations, and disorganized behaviors, and
      is associated with lifelong occupational and social disability. It typically develops in
      adolescence or early adulthood, which are particularly formative periods in life when major
      educational, vocational, and social life changes occur, and then the brain undergoes a
      rearrangement of critical neural circuits. The "prodrome" is the period before the onset of a
      psychotic disorder, like schizophrenia. Prodromal youth often have significant emotional
      distress and social withdrawal, and family members may observe a concerning change in
      behavior or school or work performance. Identifying those at clinical high risk for a
      psychotic disorder is important, as early intervention can improve symptoms and functioning,
      and could prevent the eventual development of a psychotic disorder. This study will focus on
      individuals aged 13-25 years who have met criteria for a psychosis-risk syndrome (or
      attenuated psychosis syndrome) or are at a very early stage (first 3 years after diagnosis)
      of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Involvement will
      be either 2 or 3 partial days at Washington University and will involve approximately 3 hours
      of MRI scanning and up to 6 hours of behavioral testing. Additionally, the investigators will
      study the effect of genetics on the patterns of brain connectivity in various psychiatric
      populations. DNA will be collected non-invasively from saliva and stored and processed in
      Washington University facilities.
