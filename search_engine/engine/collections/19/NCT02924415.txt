      randomized simple blind evaluation within an European project. FISTAR is developed to compare
      this technical solution with treatment as usual. Bipolar disorder patients are to be included
      and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) the experimental group (tele-care
      support) and the control group. Participants in both groups will be evaluated at baseline
      (pre-treatment) and at post-treatment.
