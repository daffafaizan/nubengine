      and mortality. It results from the blood thinners that are needed for use. Intravenous
      tranexamic acid (TxA) has become a mainstay in cardiac surgical procedures for decreasing
      bleeding and minimizing transfusion requirements. Although intravenous TxA is usually well
      tolerated, there is a well-known risk (1 to 4%) of postoperative seizures. This is due to the
      similarity between TxA and the brain tissues. The aim is to eliminate the risk of seizures
      but to maintain the protection against bleeding. When TxA is used directly on the tissues
      (topically) for other type of surgeries (joints), TxA is effective to reduce blood loss and
      transfusions. The aim is to prove that direct application of TxA on the heart can eliminate
      postoperative seizures and reduce the amount of blood transfusions in patients who have
      cardiac surgery.
