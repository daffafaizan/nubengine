      â…¢ trials. In the first trail, docetaxel (75mg/m2, every 3 weeks) significantly prolonged
      median and 1-year survival duration compared with best supportive care (median survival, 7.5
      months versus 4.6 months; P=0.010; 1-year survival, 37% versus 12%), although the response
      rate was low (5.5%). In the second study the 6-months and median survival rates were similar
      for docetaxel and vinorelbine or ifosfamide. However, the 1-year survival rate was
      significantly greater with docetaxel than ifosfamide or vinorelbine (32% versus 19%,
      P=0.025). In both studies docetaxel significantly improved some parameters of quality of
      life. Since these two pivotal studies, new potential second-line drugs were compared with the
      docetaxel standard of care. With regards to the therapeutic results of the docetaxel arm of
      these studies, it must be emphasized that response rates and survival data were highly and
      significantly reproducible.
