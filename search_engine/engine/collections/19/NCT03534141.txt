      transplantation to provide protection from AKI. Participants will be randomized to
      normothermia (36.5-37.5 °C) versus mild hypothermia (34-35 °C) during a portion of the liver
      transplant operation. The protocol is based on preliminary data from rodent models showing
      that hypothermia protects the kidneys from ischemia-reperfusion injury, as well as studies in
      deceased organ donors showing that cooling improves post-transplant organ function.
      Temperature will be maintained with standard techniques plus a minimally-invasive esophageal
      cooling device that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The investigators
      hypothesize that mild hypothermia will reduce the incidence and severity of AKI after LTx.
      Standard surrogates (e.g., change in serum creatinine, need for initiation of dialysis) and
      biomarkers will be used to assess the severity of kidney injury.
