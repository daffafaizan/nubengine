        -  To determine the feasibility of using oral ganciclovir (GCV) following induction with
           intravenous GCV in the setting of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation after bone marrow
           transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Blood cultures for cytomegalovirus (CMV) are obtained periodically after the planned
      bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Patients showing reactivation of CMV receive induction
      ganciclovir (GCV) IV twice a day on days 1-7. Patients then receive maintenance oral GCV
      three times a day for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for pharmacokinetic studies.
