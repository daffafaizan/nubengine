      undergoing FET in reproductive medicine renter of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital will be
      recruitedï¼Œwho should not be elder than 40 and had more than 3 frozen embryos. They will be
      randomized to receive either the NC-FET cycle (group NC-A) or the HRT-FET cycle (group
      HRT-B). In group NC-A, the ovulation is monitored spontaneously or induced by human chorionic
      gonadotropin(HCG) when the dominant follicle is larger than 18mm without luteinizing hormone
      surge(LH). Transfer of thawed embryos will be performed 4 days after LH /HCG administration
      or 3 days after ovulation is observed. In group HRT-B, oral estradiol, 2 mg, once daily, is
      introduced on cycle day 3 with an increasing doses protocol. If the endometrial thickness is
      greater than 7mm, progesterone 40-60 mg in oil will be administered via intramuscular
      injection. Transfer of thawed embryos will be performed 3 days later. This study was approved
      by the reproductive medicine ethics committee of Sun Yet-sen Memorial Hospital.
