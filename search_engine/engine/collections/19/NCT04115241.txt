      given actigraphs to wear around their waists starting 3 weeks prior to bone marrow
      transplants until they are discharged from the hospital. Participants will be asked to
      complete quality of life questionnaires and hand grip tests at three separate time points
      during their hospitalizations. All data gathered from these activities will be compared with
      patients' activity levels gathered from the actigraphs both before and during the
      hospitalization. This study is designed to determine the relationship between activity levels
      and length of stay, quality of life, and hand grip strength.
