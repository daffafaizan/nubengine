    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE:

      Blood samples are collected at diagnosis of chromosome 22q11 deletion and assessed for
      lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and
      concanavalin A (mitogen stimulation analyses). These analyses are repeated at 4 months along
      with a quantitative analysis of immunoglobulin.

      At 8 months, patients are tested for their lymphocytes' ability to respond to antigens
      (candida, tetanus, and diphtheria). At 1 year, patients have lymphocyte subset, IgG, IgA, and
      IgM analyses performed. Quantitative evaluations of antibody titers to diphtheria, tetanus,
      Haemophilus influenza, and hepatitis B are also performed.

      Over 1 year of age, all studies are performed if the patient is seen for a single visit.
