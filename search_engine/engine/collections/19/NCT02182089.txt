    
      Specific Aims are as follows:

        1. Assess the accuracy of a new rule set for CVInsight® in predicting intradialytic
           hypotensive episodes.

        2. Assess the comparative predictive accuracy of CVInsight® to other measures with regard
           to intradialytic hypotensive events.

        3. Assess estimated dry weight goals by monitoring post-dialytic vascular refill using
           CVInsight® and other measures.

        4. Assess hemodialysis(HD)-induced myocardial injury by monitoring the occurrence and
           frequency of arrhythmias and the levels of cardiac Troponin T.
