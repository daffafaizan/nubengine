      hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The most common toxicities are arthralgias and
      myalgias, which can be difficult to manage and necessitate discontinuation of therapy in up
      to 10% of patients. One potential interventional approach is with a pharmaceutical agent such
      as duloxetine, which has been shown to be effective for treatment of other types of chronic
      pain, including fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathic pain.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the proportion of breast cancer
      patients with AI-associated musculoskeletal symptoms who experience a 30% reduction in
      average pain score from baseline to 8 weeks due to duloxetine treatment. Participants will be
      treated with duloxetine for 8 weeks. Questionnaires to evaluate pain, functional status,
      depression, menopausal symptoms, and sleep difficulties will be administered at baseline and
      after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of therapy. In addition, 10 milliliters blood of will be drawn
      from the subjects at baseline for future pharmacogenetic evaluation. If the results of this
      pilot study suggest that the efficacy of duloxetine therapy is greater than that expected
      from placebo based on historical controls, then these data will be used to design future
      prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized trials of treatment with duloxetine in this
      patient population.
