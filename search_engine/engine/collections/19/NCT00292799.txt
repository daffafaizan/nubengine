      Patients will be included from all ethnic groups.

      Patients will have a baseline history, clinical examination, hormonal profile (FSH/LH,
      fasting Insulin/glucose ratio, androgen profile, day 21 serum progesterone, serum leptin and
      ghrelin levels) ultrasound examination (ovarian volume and antral follicle count), including
      Doppler blood flow study (ovarian stromal velocity, PI, RI, SD ratio and power Doppler)
      Participants will then be randomised to receive either metformin or orlistat. Patients
      receiving orlistat will receive the standard dose of the drug as recommended in the BNF.
      Metformin will be given in an incremental dose starting at 1000mg per day and increased at 4
      weekly intervals to 2000mg/d, depending on the occurrence of any gastrointestinal
      intolerance. The endocrinological and ultrasound investigations will be repeated at 4 weekly
      intervals. Both groups will be given a standard exercise and diet program in conjunction with
      medical treatment.

      The clinical endpoint will be the achievement of conception, a Body Mass Index of less than
      30, or completion of a 3-month course of treatment.

      Study design:

      A randomised controlled open label clinical trial. Participants be randomised using a
      computer generated randomisation program available at the pharmacy of the Jessop Wing, into
      either one of two arms: metformin or orlistat. The randomisation will be stratified in order
      to achieve a homogenous distribution of PCOS and non-PCOS patients in both arms of the study.
