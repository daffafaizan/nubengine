      characterized by the gradual loss of articular cartilage. It is a question of one of the most
      common rheumatic disorders in the population, is the most habitual reason of pain and
      disability in the major adults and the first reason of surgeries of articular replacement. In
      Mexico, in a study of national area, the prevalence of locomotives manifestations was 26 %,
      with predominance in the women. Nowadays criteria exist for the classification of the OA,
      based on epidemiological studies, for the knee, the hip and the hand. Basically they have
      been established to homogenize studies of clinical epidemiological type. In other hand, the
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory, chronic, systemic disease that has more
      prominent manifestations in the diarthrodial joints. The disease have a wide range of
      characteristics, from the progressively chronic disease with variable degrees of destruction
      to articulate up to the extra-articular manifestations clinically evident. Demographically,
      the RA is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and affects approximately 0.5 to 1 %
      of the world population, with an economic impact comparable with arterial coronary disease.
      The National Institute of Geographical Statistics (INEGI) thinks that in Mexico the
      population of major adults will double in the next decades, for what the impact of these
      rheumatic disorders will be serious and will turn into a problem of public health.

      Based in the previous information, the Mexican Initiative of Patients with OA and RA
      (IMPACTAR), will on patient interview to increase the knowledge regarding the number of
      affected adults and the current treatment strategies.

      This will be the first Mexican Registry related with Osteoarticular diseases.
