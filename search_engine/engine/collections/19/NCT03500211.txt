      associated with cesarean births. While the Lidoderm lidocaine patch has been FDA approved for
      the treatment of skin pain, it has not been studied in women undergoing cesarean birth who
      experience postoperative pain. Even though this medication has been used in post-operative
      pain in published studies, the use of this medicine under these circumstances is still
      considered experimental. A lidocaine patch may provide added benefit for pain control in
      addition to standard medicines participants would receive after surgery, such as spinal,
      intravenous, and oral pain medications following cesarean delivery.
