      engagement strategies to enhance user adherence with daily and weekly survey assessments. The
      new app developed for this study extends the previous app by featuring the capability to also
      deliver tailored health intervention. As part of the app, users are prompted to complete
      brief daily and weekly assessments for 30 days. For each completed assessment, users earn
      small financial rewards and points to unlock new fish that populate a virtual aquarium in the
      app. The app also features push notifications with survey reminders and life insights (or
      graphs plotting data collected over time) to increase user engagement with the app.
      Additionally, each day, users are randomized to receive intervention content (see the
      "Interventions" section for more information) tailored on their recent assessment responses.
      After 30 days of using the app, participants will be asked to complete a follow-up survey;
      data collected will provide preliminary feedback regarding the feasibility and effectiveness
      of using the app to deliver substance use intervention content to affected youth.
