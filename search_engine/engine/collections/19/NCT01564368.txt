      Primary

        -  To determine if the change in tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value measured
           from each treatment timepoint to baseline is predictive of pathologic complete response
           (pCR).

      Secondary

        -  To determine if the combined measurement of change in tumor ADC value, change in tumor
           volume, and change in peak signal-enhancement ratio (SER) is predictive of pCR.

        -  To investigate the relative effectiveness of the individual measurements, change in
           tumor ADC value, change in tumor volume, and change in peak SER for predicting pCR in
           experimental treatment arms.

        -  To assess the test-retest reproducibility of ADC metrics applied to breast tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) at baseline, after week
      3 of neoadjuvant paclitaxel regimen, and prior to and after completion of 4 courses of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients then undergo surgery. Patients undergo DWI prior to
      contrast administration for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI).

      After completion of treatment procedure, patients are followed up for 5 years on the I-SPY 2
      TRIAL.
