      hospital.

      Over a 5 year period, a maximum of 6 study visits per participant are planned. At each visit,
      nasal/throat swabs (for PCR testing) and/or blood samples (to assess immunological responses,
      e.g. for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing) will be collected. This will help to gain a better
      understanding of viral load and immunological responses, e.g. antibody development and their
      effects over time.

      At study visit 2 - 6, participants will also be asked to fill in a questionnaire (asking for
      SARS-CoV-2 risk factors, perceived risk, impact of the pandemic on their quality of life,
      their interest in getting a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine/their SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status and
      vaccination side effects).

      The remaining blood samples will be stored in a repository for future research.

      The study is part of a modular SARS-CoV-2-research programme of the University Medicine
      Greifswald.
