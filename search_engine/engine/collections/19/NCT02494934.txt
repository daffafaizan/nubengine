      is currently best understood within a biopsychosocial framework. Although the usefulness of
      non-medical treatment options for vulvar pain is recognized by many, there is limited
      research investigating the effectiveness of these treatments using a biopsychosocial approach
      to outcome measurement. Furthermore, there is little evidence to support the mechanisms by
      which these treatments lead to pain reduction. This study aimed to address these gaps by
      investigating two non-medical treatment options: individual cognitive-behavioural therapy
      (CBT) and physical therapy (PT).
