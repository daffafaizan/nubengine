      a HIV infected inner city ambulatory African-American Population aged 50 years and older. A
      secondary objective is to investigate possible relationships between sleep quality and
      aspects of a patient's medical history including BMI, CD4 count, HIV viral load, history of
      substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, concurrent medical conditions, current HIV
      medications and HIV medication compliance.

      Hypothesis: African-American HIV infected individuals aged 50 years and older have a high
      prevalence of sleep disorders and lower quality of sleep.
