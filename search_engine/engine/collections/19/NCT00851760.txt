      174 patients undergoing macular surgery between January 2005 and December 2006. Patients
      suffering from epiretinal macular membranes (ERM) secondary to uveitis, trauma, or associated
      with a simultaneous retinal detachment (RD) were excluded. We treated 109 eyes with a
      combined procedure (group 1) and 65 eyes with a consecutive surgery (membrane surgery and
      cataract separately)(group 2).
