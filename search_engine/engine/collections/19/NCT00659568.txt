      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of metformin
           hydrochloride when administered with temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid
           cancers or lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the toxicity and safety, with particular reference to glucose and lipid
           deregulation, of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To assess antitumor activity, including tumor response rate and time to progression, in
           patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of metformin hydrochloride.

      Patients receive oral metformin once, twice, or three times daily on days 1-28 and
      temsirolimus IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
