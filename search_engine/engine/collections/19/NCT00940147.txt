      surviving 90 day after LTx will be included. The investigators propose a classification of
      airway healing based on the endoscopic bronchial appearances at days 7, 14, 21, 90, 180 and
      365 after LTx. A score system including mucosal healing, full tissue necrosis (=dehiscence),
      lose sutures, fibrin plugs, polyps and malacia will be developed (max. score 8 points/date).
      Endoscopic findings will be correlated with the development of obstructive airway
      complications (OAC, requiring >1 intervention). Afterwards the new score system will be
      applied prospectively in the patients.
