      artificial dental restorative materials over 60 months. Subjects are recruit from patients
      that undergo a dental restorations independently from the present study. The sample size of
      n=65 would enable detection of differences in material and tooth wear greater than 10-13%
      from the baseline volume of teeth, when compared with volumes of teeth obtained from
      impressions taken at follow-ups, with the power of 0.8 and for the significance level of
      p=0.05. Paired t-test or a Wilcoxon signed-rank test is implemented depending on the
      distribution of the variables, for primary aim of evaluating suitability of polyvinylsiloxane
      dental impression for determination of wearing of teeth and restorative materials.

      Paired t-test for each sub-score or a Wilcoxon-signed rank test is implemented, depending on
      the distribution of the variables, for secondary aims. Then, if variables are considered also
      as categorical, a Mc Nemar test for each sub-score will be suggested
