      expected to last 12-15 months for each participant, and each participant will continue to be
      followed, with 3-monthly refills and research visits for as long as the pump lasts, until the
      participant chooses to withdraw, until the FDA approves the pump for regular care, or until
      the company stops supporting the pump. During the first 12-15 months of the study, there will
      be an estimated 13 clinic visits and one hospital stay for 2-3 days. The data collection
      visits will take about 30 minutes, and a continuous glucose monitor will be started. The
      participants will have a brief visit 3-4 days later to drop off the monitor. After this phase
      of the research, the participants will still be cared for with the implanted pump, having
      visits for refills and tests every 3 months. This long-term follow up will last until the
      participants choose to withdraw, the pump malfunctions, the FDA approves the pump for regular
      care, or the company no longer supports the pump. If the participants are no longer taking
      part in the study, the investigators will have the pump removed from their body.
