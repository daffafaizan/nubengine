      the mitochondria, organelles that regulate energy production in our cells. The ability of the
      mitochondria to produce energy can be affected by diet, and the composition of lipids in the
      cell is an important factor in determining how effective our mitochondria are. Dairy and
      plant based lipids differ in composition and therefore may differ in their ability to affect
      mitochondrial function when combined with fish oils (FO). The primary objective of this study
      is to determine whether supplementation with dairy or plant based fats combined with fish
      oils can alter skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Additional exploratory objectives are
      1) skeletal muscle and physical function and 2) cognitive function.
