    
      SATURN is a multi-center, pragmatic, prospective, randomized, open-label, and blinded
      end-point assessment (PROBE) clinical trial. A total of 1,456 patients presenting within 7
      days of a spontaneous lobar ICH while taking statins will be randomized to one of two
      treatment strategies: discontinuation vs. continuation of statin therapy (using the same
      agent and dose that they were using at ICH onset). Participating subjects will undergo
      baseline testing for APOE genotype and will be followed for 24 months to assess for the
      occurrence of recurrent symptomatic ICH or major adverse cerebro-/cardio-vascular events
      (MACCE) during the follow-up period.

      Recruitment will take place at ~ 140 sites coordinated through the NIH/NINDS StrokeNet and
      the Canadian Stroke Consortium.
