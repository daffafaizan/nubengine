    
      Clinical trials of platelet rich plasma injection for regeneration of atropic nasal mucosa.

        -  Injection interval and follow-up duration

             -  Injection interval 2 weeks (upto total 3 consecutive injection)

             -  Follow-up duration: 6 months

        -  Observation items, clinical assessment items and evaluation method

             -  Access the nasal mucosal status using nasal speculum.

             -  Access the nasal mucociliary function using saccharin test (primary outcome; once
                per month).

             -  Fill in the nasal symptom scores using Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation(NOSE)
                Instrument, Sino-Nasal outcome Test 20, and Visual analog scale (secondary outcome;
                once per month)

        -  The other atrophic rhinitis patients who did not want to perform platelet rich plasma
           injection

             -  Random allocation to saline nasal irrigation or saline nasal spray group

             -  Perform same observation items, clinical assessment items and evaluation method as
                well as platelet rich plasma injection group
