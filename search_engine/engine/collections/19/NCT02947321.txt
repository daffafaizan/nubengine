    
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common and effective treatment for severe knee
      osteoarthritis. As the average age of the population increases in developed countries, the
      number of TKAs performed is projected to increase to 3.48 million procedures per year by
      2030, a 673% increase from 2005. Although TKA is widely accepted as an efficacious form of
      treatment for severe knee osteoarthritis, the incidence of patient dissatisfaction and
      postoperative pain cannot be ignored. Genicular nerve RFA has been performed in non-surgical
      patients with chronic knee osteoarthritis with significant post procedure improvement in pain
      and functional status. This study is designed to determine the efficacy of preoperative
      genicular nerve RFA in improving acute and chronic postoperative pain as well as functional
      status in patients undergoing TKA.
