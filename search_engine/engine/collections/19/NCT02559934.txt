    
      It is an open-label, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic study. In stage 1, plasma concentration
      of solamargine will be examined after the test products were administrated to 5 subjects with
      Actinic Keratosis (AK). Thereafter, an interim report based on the results of stage 1 will be
      submitted for Taiwan Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) review to determine stage 2 will be
      conducted or not. For stage 2, another 5 subjects with AK will be enrolled to complete the
      study.

      The subjects will be recruited from AK patients of Taiwan. All subjects will sign an informed
      consent form (ICF). A copy of the signed ICF will be handed to the subjects. The subjects
      will be screened on an outpatient basis within 1 month prior to entry according to defined
      inclusion and exclusion criteria (medical history, personal history, physical examination,
      and laboratory values). The subject must be qualified for the study by fulfilling all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.

      In the study period, study drug will be given once daily for sixteen consecutive weeks.
      Specifically, subjects will receive a single dose of 0.3-0.5 g topical SR-T100 gel
      (containing 2.3% solamargine in Solanum undatum plant extract) in 25 cm2 skin area covered by
      occlusive dressing at least 20 hours a day.
