      perioperative period. It occurs as a result of the effects of anesthetic drugs on the
      regulation of body temperature and exposure to a cold environment.

      The main temperature loss during the perioperative period occurs during the first hour after
      the anesthetic induction as a result of heat redistribution from the central compartment to
      the peripheral compartment

      The most effective strategy to prevent perioperative hypothermia is the use of forced-air
      warming devices. These devices are usually initiated once the patient enters the operating
      room. At that time, the patient has already initiated the heat loss by distributing heat from
      the central to the peripheral compartment to maintain body temperature.

      We intend to use forced-air warming devices before the patients is transferred to the
      operating room in order to preserve the peripheral body temperature. This way the
      redistribution of heat should be avoided and, therefore, perioperative hypothermia and its
      harmful effects will be prevented.
