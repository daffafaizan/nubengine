      Participants' brain will be scanned at baseline and then again on a different day after the
      administration of an oral dose of 30 mg morphine in an open label design. Participants will
      receive morphine 60 minutes prior to the start of the second scanning session. The brain
      scans will include structural scans, functional scans at rest and functional scans during the
      ingestion of a highly caloric drink.
