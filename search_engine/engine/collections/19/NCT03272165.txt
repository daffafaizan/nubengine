    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single ascending intravenous
      doses of MEDI1341 in male and nonfertile female healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65 years.

      The study will include up to 6 planned cohorts; each cohort will comprise 8 subjects. Within
      each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive MEDI1341 and 2 will be randomized to
      receive placebo. A Safety Review Committee will review data from each cohort before
      progression to the next higher dose cohort occurs.

      On Day 1, each randomized subject will receive a single 60 minute intravenous infusion of
      MEDI1341 or placebo and will undergo scheduled safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and
      immunogenicity assessments. Additional study assessments will occur on Days 2, 4, 8, 15, 22,
      29, 43, 57, and 92.
