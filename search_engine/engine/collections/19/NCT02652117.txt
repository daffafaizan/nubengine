      will be acquired from July 2007 to July 2013. Allocation of regional anesthesia, and the use
      of spinal versus epidural versus epidural with catheter administration will be determined by
      provider preference. Date of surgery, age in months, gender, type of surgery, type of
      anesthesia, regional drugs, PaCO2 upon arrival in the PICU, time to extubation, and
      reintubation if applicable will be recorded. Time to extubation will be categorized into

      categorized into hypercarbia (PaCO2 â‰¥ 50mmHg) and normal (PaCO2 < 50mmHg).
