      to treat people who have prostate cancer. This study will look at achieving and maintaining
      testosterone suppression (<50 ng/dL).

      The study enrolled 136 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Relugolix 80 mg

        -  Relugolix 120 mg

        -  Leuprorelin 22.5 mg

      Relugolix was administered starting with a 320 mg (loading dose), followed by relugolix 80 mg
      or 120 mg tablets, for 48 weeks plus an optional 48-week extension at the investigator's
      discretion. Patients randomized to leuprorelin were administered 22.5 mg subcutaneously on
      Day 1 and every 12 weeks for 4 injections.

      This multicenter trial was conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time to
      participate in this study was 114.4 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic
      and at 12 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
