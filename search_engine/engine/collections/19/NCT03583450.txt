      virtual reality to reduce perioperative anxiety in pediatric patients undergoing surgery at
      UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. The study plans to employ virtual reality headsets during
      induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients for elective surgery in a randomized clinical
      trial. We will be enrolling patients age 5-12 years presenting for elective surgery.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: (1) virtual reality headset with routine
      anesthetic care and (2) routine anesthetic care only.
