    
      This study is a research trial of an outpatient, non-medication, non-invasive investigational
      treatment called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS is a noninvasive tool for the
      study of the human brain that has been approved by the FDA for use in depression, but it is
      also being investigated as a potential therapeutic agent for other symptoms, such as those
      seen in Depersonalization Disorder (DPD).

      TMS applies a magnetic field to the brain for a brief period of time. TMS is a procedure that
      involves 30 minute-long daily sessions every weekday for a series of weeks. The investigators
      are testing whether TMS can treat Depersonalization Disorder (DPD).

      In this trial, 32 adult outpatients with DPD, that have been only partially responsive to
      conventional therapies, will be treated with active or sham low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS applied
      to the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) daily for up to six weeks.

      DPD symptoms will be monitored through weekly self-report questionnaires as well clinical
      ratings with a doctor.
