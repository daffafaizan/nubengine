      response to static handgrip exercise, which are suggestive of impaired ergoreflex activation.
      An abnormal ergoreflex activation may lead to exercise intolerance and increases in
      cardiovascular risk. Despite the importance of therapeutic strategies in reducing the
      cardiovascular risk among patients living with HIV, exercise-related effects on ergoreflex
      sensitivity in these population have not been previously investigated.
