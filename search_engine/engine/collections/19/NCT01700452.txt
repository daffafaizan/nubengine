      changes in lung cells that might be an early indicator of lung cancer. The test uses mucus
      (sputum) which is collected in a non-invasive method. This study will compare the results of
      the lung biopsy with the laboratory test to determine if the test can detect cancer or the
      lack of cancer.

      The laboratory test will not be shared with the treating physician or the patient as the
      current standard for lung cancer diagnosis is a biopsy. Approximately 330 patients will be
      enrolled in the study. There is one visit involved and includes the collection of a sputum
      specimen by coughing into a cup. The medical records of patients who are negative for cancer
      by biopsy will be reviewed for 2 years to detect any changes in diagnosis.

      The results of the test will not be provided to the subject, the investigator and will not be
      used to diagnose or treat the subject.
