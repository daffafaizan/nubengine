      diagnostic imaging purposes.. The energies of positrons (β+) from F-18 (0.633 MeV) and
      electrons (β-) from I-131 (0.606 MeV) are very close and have similar equilibrium dose
      constants. Since [18F]- fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) clears rapidly from circulation,
      administration of 37-74 BGq (1-2 Ci) of 18F-FDG is relatively safe from an internal radiation
      dosimetry point of view. We initiated a phase I dose escalation study to assess the safety,
      toxicity, and potential therapeutic utility of administering high doses of 18F-FDG delivered
      over a 1 to 5 day period in patients with advanced lymphomas and solid tumors refractory to
      standard of care treatment (SCT).
