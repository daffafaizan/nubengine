      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of cetuximab when administered concurrently with paclitaxel,
           carboplatin, and radiotherapy, in terms of safety and compliance, in patients with
           unresectable stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival (1- and 2-year survival rate and median survival) of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression (at 1 and 2 years) in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Correlate epidermal growth factor receptor expression with the toxicity of this regimen
           and response, overall survival, and progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Cetuximab loading dose (week 1): Patients receive a loading dose of cetuximab IV over 2
           hours on day 1.

        -  Concurrent cetuximab and chemoradiotherapy (weeks 2-8): Patients receive cetuximab IV
           over 1 hour, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 8,
           15, 22, 29, 36, 43, and 50. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 8-12,
           15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, 43-47, and 50-53.

        -  Consolidation therapy (weeks 9-17): Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1 hour on days
           57, 64, 71, 78, 85, 92, 99, 106, and 113. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 3
           hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 78 and 99.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
