    
      AZEDRA速 (Iobenguane I 131) is a very high-specific-activity iobenguane I 131, produced using
      proprietary Ultratrace速 platform. Based on the well-characterized cellular active transport
      mechanism, the high specific activity of allows for effective cellular uptake of
      radioactivity and hence greater tumor uptake.

      During this study the subjects will receive two (2) Therapy Doses that are given
      approximately three (3) months apart. Prior to administration of the first Therapy Dose,
      subjects will be given an Imaging Dose of AZEDRA速 and will undergo iobenguane I 131 scans to
      evaluate tumor uptake and to measure normal organ distribution and allow for the calculation
      of radiation dose to normal organs.

      Screening procedures for eligibility will need to be done before imaging or therapeutic doses
      of AZEDRA速 are administered.

      Hospitalization is required for approximately one (1) week after each of the two (2)
      Therapeutic Doses. Frequent follow up is necessary for the first year and some of the follow
      up visits may be done by a visiting health care professional in the subjects' homes. Subjects
      will be followed in the treatment study for one (1) year and for an additional four (4) years
      in long-term follow up.
