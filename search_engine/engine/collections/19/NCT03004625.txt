      hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV-1b) patients. Patients with non-structural protein 5A
      (NS5A) resistance associated variants (RAVs) would have an inferior response. The
      investigators anticipate that12 weeks of daclatasvir and asunaprevir plus ribavirin is highly
      effective for HCV Genotype 1b patients without baseline NS5A RAVs.
