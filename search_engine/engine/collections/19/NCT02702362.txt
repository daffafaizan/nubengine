      Neurology. But the effects went down after 1 or 2 hours. To increase the lasting of the
      effects, a new study will evaluate the effects of tDCS on the precuneus cortex for 5
      consecutive days in chronic patients in MCS.

      2 sessions of 5 days of stimulation will be realized, one session will be real (anodal
      stimulation) and one placebo (sham stimulation). After each stimulation, behavioral
      improvement will be assessed with the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R). A final assessment
      will be done 5 days after the end of the sessions to assess the long term effect of the tDCS.

      Researchers expected to see an improvement of the CRS-R total score at the end of the anodal
      session and that this improvement persists for 5 days.
