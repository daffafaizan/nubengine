      following extracted parameters of the pulmonary function:

        -  forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1)

        -  forced vital capacity (FVC)

        -  relative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1/FVC)

        -  maximal expiratory flow (MEF 25)

        -  total lung capacity (TLC)

        -  resistance (Raw).

      These findings could bring out new prospective opportunity for pulmonary function tests
      without cooperation.

      Furthermore, the study aims to clarify whether EIT technique can be used for regional
      pulmonary function testing.

      In addition, dynamic lung function parameter and static radiological techniques will be
      correlated with EIT.
