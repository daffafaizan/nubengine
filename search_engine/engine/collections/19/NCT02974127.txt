    
      To date, the treatment of choice for intracranial meningiomas is surgical removal.

      Radiotherapy, especially the radiosurgery (SRS), in exclusive, adjuvant or salvage setting
      represents an alternative or complementary viable treatment to the neurosurgery. Despite
      being a well-established treatment for intracranial meningiomas, SRS might be associated with
      significant morbidity when large volumes or critical sites are treated. Hypofractionated
      stereotactic radiotherapy has the potential to deliver sharply focused high doses per
      fraction without increasing the risk of toxicity.

      The aims of our study are toxicity and symptom control evaluation of radiosurgery treatment
      delivered in multisession, for large or medium size intracranial meningiomas and/or for
      intracranial meningioma located at the critical sites (perichiasmatic area, perioptic area,
      PCA). We will evaluate also the efficacy of the treatment by volumetric analysis of treated
      meningiomas carrying out a volumetric comparison between pre- and post-radiosurgery treatment
      (every 6 month after treatment).

      The neurological and clinical assessment before and after s-SRS will be based on CTCAE v4.0
      and BPN BSN House-Brackman and sensorineural internation scale assessment.
