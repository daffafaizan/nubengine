      worldwide. The main indications include acute cholecystitis, cholangitis and gallstone
      migration. Abnormal liver function tests upon admission and suspicion for accompanying common
      bile duct (CBD) stone can delay the surgical management due to the need for further
      investigations and/or therapeutic maneuvers. These procedures include magnetic resonance
      cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and endoscopic retrograde
      cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP).

      While useful to detect or exclude potential CBD stones, these procedures include inherent
      risks, delay the surgical treatment, extend hospital stay and as a result, increase the
      overall medical costs. They can also potentially increase the morbidity and/or mortality by
      delaying emergency cholecystectomy (due to the presence of more local inflammation and
      adherence). Finally, more and more centers perform systematic intra-operative cholangiogram
      during cholecystectomies (laparoscopic or open), which allow an accurate assessment of the
      CBD and potentially lead to its subsequent exploration (endoscopic or surgical).

      In this study, the investigators will assess the following hypotheses:

        -  Patients with a SUSPICION of gallstone migration (with or without associated
           cholecystitis) should undergo emergency cholecystectomy with intra-operative
           cholangiogram (IOC) first

        -  "Cholecystectomy first" strategy will decrease both the length of hospital stay and the
           morbidity/mortality by decreasing the number of unnecessary EUS, MRCP and ERCP and
           therefore decreasing the overall number of their complications, as well as decreasing
           the complications related to delayed cholecystectomy (increased adherences due to
           inflammation, especially in case of associated cholecystitis, which increase the risk of
           bleeding, CBD lesion, duodenal lesion, gastric lesion, colon lesion, gallbladder
           perforation and intra-abdominal gallstones spillage with potential
