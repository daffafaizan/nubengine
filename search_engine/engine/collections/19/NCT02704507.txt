    
      A randomized, split-face, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-center clinical trial
      wherein 20 patients received daily 0.05% tretinoin with one half of the face receiving
      triamcinolone 0.025% and the other half an inert emollient for 4 weeks. Subjects continued
      applying tretinoin 0.05% daily to the bilateral face without triamcinolone or emollient for
      an additional 4 weeks. Investigator's Global Assessment, lesion counts, and study subject's
      self-assessments of burning/stinging, itching, erythema, and dryness/scaling will be
      collected at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks.
