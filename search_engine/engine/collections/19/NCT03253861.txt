      with a diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis admitted to digestive liver disease unity
      or ICUs at the Nantes University Hospital, from January 1, 2012, to december 31, 2015. For
      enrolled patients, general clinical characteristics were collected. Patients were categorized
      into two groups according to the development of an infected pancreatic necrosis (highly
      suspected or proven), and the differences of these characteristics between two groups were
      evaluated. Potential risk factors were collected and studied by using multiple logistic
      regression analysis.
