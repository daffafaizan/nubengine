      be enrolled and randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 into the control group (that is,
      conventional treatment group) and the intervention group (that is, conventional treatment
      plus calcium dobesilate [500 mg, 3 times per day] for 12 months). The severity of diabetic
      retinopathy will be assessed by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale.
