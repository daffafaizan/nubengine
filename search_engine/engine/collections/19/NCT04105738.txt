      vocal cords that occur when a person speaks) can be used as a reliable measure to predict
      airways that may be difficult to manage in the operating room.

      One of the reasons the Preoperative Surgical Assessment (PSE) is performed is to assess
      subjects for signs of a difficult airway. At this time, none of the assessments have proven
      to be both highly sensitive and specific. Multiple studies have shown that specific
      characteristics of a subject's speech can suggest that they may have an issue with the
      anatomy of the oropharynx (the area consisting of the back of the throat to the vocal cords).
      Prior research has shown that studying velar vowel sounds, those vowels that require the use
      of the back of the tongue to pronounce, can be used to predict a disorder called obstructive
      sleep apnea (a disease associated with difficulty breathing).

      The Investigators are trying to determine whether the development of a simple voice study
      conducted during the PSE visit could alert the Anesthesiologist caring for the subject in the
      operating room to use the extra precautions provided for people who have a documented history
      of a difficult airway. It is hoped that the voice analysis test being developed in this study
      will have the ability to objectively predict a difficult airway for future patients.
