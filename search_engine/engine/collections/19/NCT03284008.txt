    
      Axillary Web Syndrome (AWS) is one of the short / medium-term sequela of surgical treatment
      for breast cancer with axillary dissection (AD) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), with
      incidence reported in literature between 28% and 72%. AWS could be described as a
      thrombophlebitis of veno-lymph vessels due to a trauma of the region subjected to surgery,
      with the same characteristics of "Mondor's disease" diagnosed in post-traumatic and surgical
      areas where is a large presence of veno-lymphatic capillaries.

      The syndrome onset occur in approximately 2-4 weeks after the surgery and its complete
      regression happen in 3-6 months after the onset. The clinical signs frequently described are
      pain and tension during movement in the axillary region, elbow, forearm and wrist, following
      the arm lymphatic pathway. Moreover, patients report difficulties in moving the arm into
      activities that require a moderate range of motion and could feel and see in the affected arm
      cords similar to a tendon. Even if the impairment can cause disability for a limited period
      of time, rehabilitation is usually advice to prevent further complications such as frozen
      shoulder, articular impeachment syndrome and long-term chronic pain, complications that could
      worsen patient's quality of life with a significant increase in costs and time to recovery.

      Nowadays there are no studies in the literature that demonstrate the effectiveness of
      physiotherapy in AWS, with just case reports describing different treatments techniques,
      without a scientifically defined experimented rehabilitation protocol.

      This experimental, monocentric, randomized clinical trial wants verify the effectiveness of a
      manual maneuver associated with stretching exercises in the treatment of AWS.
