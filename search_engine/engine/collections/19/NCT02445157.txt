      4 metre gait speed test (4MGS), in patients with a lung disease called Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis (IPF). Drug development for this disease is slow in part because there is a lack of
      reliable measurements that can assess effectiveness of treatment. Slow walking speed has been
      shown to relate to poor outcomes in older adults and people with another lung disease called
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD. The investigators are interested to see whether
      usual walking speed is a reliable measure in patients with IPF as this will help inform us of
      its potential use as an outcome measure. To do this, participants who consent to taking part
      in the study will be timed walking at their usual walking speed over a distance of 4 metres
      (13.12 feet). Participants will be asked to do this twice with a rest in between if required.
      One week later, participants will be asked to repeat the walking tests again.
