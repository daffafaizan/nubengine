    
      This is a non randomized prospective multicentered study testing the effect of RAS treatment
      with a wash out period at the end of the study.

      Enrollment and informed consent will be performed in three AP-HP centers. Visit n° 1 will be
      performed in Hospital Tenon Center ( FONCTIONNEL Exploration Service) where final eligibility
      will be followed by several investigations aiming to measure albuminuria, basal GFR (51 cr
      EDTA clearance), cardiac parameters (doppler study); aortic stiffness (aortic pulse wave
      velocity) and endothelial dysfunction (microvascular laser-doppler, and blood and urine
      sample for assessment of several biomarkers).

      At the end of the evaluation, Ramipril administration will be initiated (for at least six
      months).

      Tolerance will be check up at visit n°2 (month 1) (clinical examination) and at the visit n°3
      (month 6 ) (clinical examination). Patients will be contacted by the investigators every two
      month between each visit in order to evaluate tolerance. In case of cough with Ramipril, the
      treatment may be change by Irbesartan. Posology of treatment may be reduced in case of
      intolerance.

      Treatment full dose (Ramipril 5mg/day or Irbesartan (300mg/day) will be obtained at the visit
      2 and stopped at the end of visit 3:

      Assessment of RAS treatment effect on albuminuria, GFR, heart, aorta and microvessels will be
      performed at visit 3 (under RAS treatment) with the same procedure as visit 1.

      Visit 4 will be performed after a 1 month wash out period in order to check whether the
      expected reduction of albuminuria under RAS treatment is sustained or not.
