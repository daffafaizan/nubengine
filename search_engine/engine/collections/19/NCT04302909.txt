      tunnel syndrome compared to participants receiving only night splint. Therefore 40 patients
      with mild to moderate CTS (verified by nerve conduction velocity) will be randomized to
      receive either fESWT (1-session a week for 3 weeks) or sham fESWT(1-session a week for 3
      weeks). All subjects will be asked to wear night splints.

      Evaluation will be performed at baseline (VAS, hand grip, electrodiagnostic parameters,
      questionnaires), 3 weeks (VAS, hand grip, questionnaires), 12 and 24 weeks (VAS, hand grip,
      electrodiagnostic parameters, questionnaires) after treatment.
