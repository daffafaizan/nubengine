        -  Compare the overall survival and survival without relapse for 1, 3, and 5 years of
           patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx or hypopharynx after treatment with
           twice a day radiotherapy with or without cisplatin and fluorouracil.

        -  Compare the presence of distant metastases at 1, 3, and 5 years in these patients after
           these treatments.

        -  Compare the local control and duration of control in these patients after these
           treatments.

        -  Compare the clinical changes and histological changes at 6 months in these patients
           after these treatments.

        -  Determine the rate of complete response in these patients after these treatments.

        -  Determine the early and late toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of fluorouracil and tolerability of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center
      and primary site of disease (oropharynx vs hypopharynx)

      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy twice a day, 6 hours apart, 5 days a week, for 7
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in arm I, plus concurrent chemotherapy
           consisting of cisplatin IV on day 1 and fluorouracil by continuous infusion over 24
           hours on days 1-5. Courses are repeated every 3 weeks for 3 courses.

      Patients are followed every month for 1 year, every 2-3 months for 2 years, then every 6
      months for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 160 patients (80/arm) will be accrued for this study within 4.5
      years.
