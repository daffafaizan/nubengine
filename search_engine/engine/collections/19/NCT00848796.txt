      The two different brands of heparin-Heparin Leo (Leo pharma) and Hepalean (Organon) are
      randomized by the float perfusionist using the program research randomizer.A 50 ml syringe is
      loaded with heparin for the Anesthesiologist and labelled. A 20 ml syringe is loaded with
      heparin and thenn labelled. It is a double blinded trial with the surgeon and anesthetist not
      knowing which brand heparin is being used. All cases are isolated Coronary Artery Bypass
      Grafting (C.A.B.G) with no concomittant conditions. The following are the patients excluded
      from the trial

        1. RE-DO

        2. COMBINATION PROCEDURE

        3. VALVE REPAIR/REPLACEMENT

        4. IABP-PRE/INTRA//POST-OP

        5. CELL SAVER INTRA-OP

        6. ANEMIA (70 g/L)/BLEEDING DISORDER eg:Jehovah's witness,hemophilia etc.

        7. USE OF APROTININ

        8. SMALL ADULT < 50 KG

        9. AORTIC SURGERY WITH/WITHOUT CIRC ARREST

       10. EMERGENT PATIENT WITH HEART FAILURE

      Heparin will be administered in the trial to elevate the A.C.T-Activated clotting time to 480
      s and above and the heparin level to 300u/Kg to intiate cardio-pulmonary bypass (C.P.B).
      Additional heparin will be given to maintain the above-mentioned levels.

      The following data will be studied

        -  BSA

        -  Height

        -  Weight

        -  Diagnosis

      Overall we are going to look at whether their is any impact on post-operative
      bleeding,hospital and ICU stay.
