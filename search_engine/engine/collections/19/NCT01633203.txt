      disease is the most frequent cause of cancer death in Chile. Despite of adequate surgery,
      survival rates are disappointing, with less than 60% of patients for all stages achieving to
      be alive at 5 years. This is due to the fact that frequently gastric cancer is diagnosed at
      an advanced stage. For locally advanced gastric cancer a multimodality treatment is
      recommended, with the alternatives of surgery followed by chemotherapy (asian approach),
      surgery followed by chemoradiation (US approach) and perioperative chemotherapy (european
      approach). These three strategies are valid standard treatment options and have shown to
      improve overall survival in stage IB to IVA gastric cancer.

      Perioperative chemotherapy administered pre- and postoperatively, has shown to downstage the
      tumor, increase curative resection, progression free and overall survival.

      For patients with potentially resectable gastric cancer staged T2 or higher or cN+, NCCN
      Guidelines recommend perioperative chemotherapy (category1). Chilean guidelines for gastric
      cancer state the alternative of perioperative chemotherapy, however this approach has not
      been used widely in public hospitals because lack of financial support.

      Some gastric cancers overexpress HER2, and this subset of patients benefit from targeted
      therapy at an advanced stage. The proportions of patients with these molecular
      characteristics vary widely depending of the geographic area. The chilean population has been
      investigated in small series, but the incidence of HER2 positive gastric cancer is not known.
      We therefore plan to measure HER2 expression in all participating patients.
