        1. To evaluate the long-term efficacy of Lamivudine extending therapy in CHB patients who
           received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents.

        2. To evaluate the long-term outcomes and predictive factors of Lamivudine extending
           therapy in CHB patients who received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents.

      A prospective, open-label, multicenter study will enroll 500 treatment-na√Øve CHB patients who
      received at least 3-year of oral antiviral agents. With their voluntary decision after
      consultation, 250 patients will receive Lamivudine extending therapy for 5 years and the
      other 250 patients will receive follow-up and serve as controls. The primary outcome
      measurement is HBV DNA recurrence, whilst the secondary outcome measurement is liver-related
      outcomes and associated predictive factors
