      their negative association with, and even management of, chronic diseases such as obesity,
      diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and inflammatory-bowel disease among
      others.Emerging evidence has suggested that these benefits could largely be attributed to
      short chain fatty acids (SCFA) (acetate, propionate and butyrate), the main by-products of
      fibre fermentation in the gut. Previous research has demonstrated that a long-term elevation
      in the SCFA propionate significantly reduced body weight gain in overweight adults and
      reduced liver fat storage.

      The current project will examine potential mechanisms for the positive effect of propionate
      on energy homeostasis and metabolic profile.The effects of propionate on circulating glucose,
      insulin, gut hormones and lipid levels at rest, following moderate-intensity exercise and
      mixed meal tolerance test will be examined.

      To acutely increase propionate absorption from the gut the present project will use a simple
      nutritional supplement: sodium propionate in a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) capsule.
      This capsule is coated with an enteric film which prevents gastric digestion until the
      capsule reaches the intestine. This nutritional supplement has been used in human volunteers
      in a previously approved ethics application (12/LO/1769: Oral propionate and glucose
      homeostasis). A 5g acute dose of sodium propionate had previously been tested and reported no
      adverse effects . The MHRA have confirmed that encapsulated sodium propionate is not classed
      as an investigative medicinal product.
