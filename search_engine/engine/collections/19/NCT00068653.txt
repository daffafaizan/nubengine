      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with platinum-refractory non-small cell lung
           cancer treated with gefitinib and celecoxib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for up to 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 22 months.
