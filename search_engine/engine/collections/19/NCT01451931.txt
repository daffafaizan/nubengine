      tomography (CT) for the evaluation of patients with suspected urolithiasis. The study will be
      conducted at 15 large urban Emergency Departments (EDs), reflecting geographic,
      socioeconomic, racial and ethnic diversity, and include academic medical centers as well as
      safety net hospitals. The patients will be randomized to one of three arms: 1) ultrasound in
      the Emergency Department (ED), 2) ultrasound in radiology or 3) CT in radiology. The
      investigators will then collect precise and unbiased data on a comprehensive range of
      outcomes that will allow assessment of effectiveness, safety, accuracy and cost between
      patients randomized to one the three groups. Taken together, these measures are intended to
      provide the basis for a valid comparison of imaging of patients with suspected urolithiasis
      seen in the ED. The results of this trial could lead to a change in clinical practice that is
      associated with both improved patient outcomes and reduced cost. Broad stakeholder
      involvement from within radiology, emergency medicine and several subspecialty communities
      has been sought to ensure the strategic completion of study aims and to help rapidly
      disseminate the results of the study into clinical practice. This will create a collaborative
      network of EDs willing to act as a laboratory for studying the comparative effectiveness of
      diagnostic testing. As a result, the proposed trial will demonstrate the feasibility of
      conducting Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) of imaging that incorporates measurements of
      outcomes that can be expanded to additional imaging tests in the future.
