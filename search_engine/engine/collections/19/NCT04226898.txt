      psychotic symptoms which are of at least moderate severity will be randomized. Intestinal
      inflammation will be assessed through the measurement of antibodies to Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, gliadin, Candida albicans as well as high-sensitivity C-Reactive protein and
      Pentraxin-3. The duration of the trial is 14 weeks: after a 2-week placebo run in, the
      participants will be randomized to receive the synbiotic compound or identical-appearing
      placebo over the 12 weeks of the randomized phase. The synbiotic compound is a quality-tested
      product, Probio-Tec ABCG-Stick-25, manufactured by ChrHansen which contains 4 strains of
      probiotic microorganisms - Bifidobacteria BB-12, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus
      acidophilus, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus - and the prebiotic, inulin, a fructan-containing
      polysaccharide which has been shown to increase the level of non-pathogenic bacteria in the
      gastrointestinal tract. All participants will also be maintained on a stable regimen of
      psychiatric medications prescribed by their treating psychiatrist.
