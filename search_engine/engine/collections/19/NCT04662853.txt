      studies suggest that the CCR may be related with changes in the gut microbiota. This clinical
      trial is focused in the development of a screening test for the people at risk of CCR (aged
      more than 50 years old), valid and safe, improving the screening prognosis. The main
      potential improvement lies in the fact that the proposed method is more specific and
      sensitive than the current method, fecal occult blood. It aims to distinguish whether the
      positive results for fecal occult blood test is due to fissures, not related with CCR (which
      are positive for fecal occult blood, false positive) or was caused by a cancer-related
      lesion. The methodology derived will also improve the sensitive as sometimes the polyps do
      not leak blood. Based in the previous differences found in the gut microbiota composition
      related with CCR for several research groups, the gut microbiota composition will be used as
      diagnosis tool.
