      antibiotics to urgent appendectomy in children (ages 7-17yrs) with acute appendicitis with
      the presence of an appendicolith. Enrolled participants were followed up to 1 year
      post-discharge to observe the rates of appendicitis recurrence as well as identify the number
      of patients with complicated appendicitis as determined by pathologic examination.
