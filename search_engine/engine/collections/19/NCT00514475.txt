      Since 1997, the Nordic Lymphoma Group has conducted phase II studies in order to improve the
      results for this lymphoma subtype. The first study included high-dose therapy with autologous
      stem cell support in the first line of treatment. The results showed the importance of a high
      quality response to pre-transplant induction treatment, and that CHOP-based regimen alone did
      not achieve this. Thus, the second trial was designed to improve remissions by including
      Rituximab and high-dose Ara-C. Results now show that a high rate of molecular remission in
      the bone marrow was achieved, and the 3-year FFS was improved in comparison to the first
      study (80% vs 24%). Furthermore, patient who had a molecular relapse (t(11;14) or IgV-gene)
      were treated with 4 doses of Rituximab and many converted back to be PCR negative.

      The present and thus third phase II study aims to improve the high-dose regimen by adding
      Zevalin radioimmunotherapy in patients who are not in CR prior to transplant. Data from the
      last trial show that patients not in CR at this point have a worse outcome (3 year FFS of
      63%, vs 85% for CR patients). Monitoring for molecular relapse in the bone marrow will be
      done, and patients who become PCR positive will be treated with Rituximab in order to
      evaluate the value of this strategy.
