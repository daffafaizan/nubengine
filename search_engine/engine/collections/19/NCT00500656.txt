      controlled,parallel group study of a 30 mg s.c. formulation of icatibant for the treatment of
      patients with moderate to very severe symptoms of cutaneous and/or abdominal symptoms of HAE.

      The study consisted of two parts: controlled phase and OLE phase. For the primary endpoint,
      Efficacy was determined by evaluating the differences in study outcomes using a Visual
      Analogue Scale for patients treated with icatibant and tranexamic acid.
