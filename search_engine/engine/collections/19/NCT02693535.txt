      clinical trial that aims to describe the safety and efficacy of commercially available,
      targeted anticancer drugs prescribed for treatment of patients with advanced cancer that has
      a potentially actionable genomic variant. TAPUR will study Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)-approved targeted therapies that are contributed by collaborating pharmaceutical
      companies, catalogue the choice of molecular profiling test by clinical oncologists and
      develop hypotheses for additional clinical trials.
