    
      This study will consist of 2 parts. In Part A the effect of ipragliflozin on the glucose
      homeostasis will be investigated and in Part B we will investigate the effect of exposure of
      ipragliflozin on UGE and plasma glucose levels.

      Part A

      This part will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-

      period, 2 treatment crossover design in healthy subjects and in T2DM

      subjects who are drug na√Øve or washed out for metformin prior to

      admission to the clinical site.

      Part B

      This part will be an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2 treatment

      crossover design in T2DM subjects stratified by baseline HbA1c

      levels (6.0-6.9%, 7.0-7.9%, 8.0-8.9% or 9.0-9.9%).
