      doses of subcutaneous NT100 following IVF in women with a history of repeated IVF failures.
      Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous NT100
      low dose, NT100 high dose, or placebo, qd for up to 4 weeks.

      Screening will include a standard IVF stimulation protocol, followed by fertilization and
      culture of embryos. If the subject remains eligible, she will be randomized to receive study
      drug. All subjects will be followed for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. At Week 10
      of gestation, subjects who are pregnant will roll over into a follow-up study (NT-04) to
      assess subsequent pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes.
