      mature dendritic cells with a fixed interval. The dendritic cells are generated from
      leukapheresis products and frozen after antigen loading.

      HLA A2 positive patients are treated with PADRE and oncopeptide pulsed DC; p53, survivin and
      telomerase peptides. HLA A2 negative patients are treated with KLH and tumorlysate pulsed DC;
      autologous or allogeneic. Each patient is given 6 immunizations with at least 5x106
      peptide/lysate pulsed autologous DC. Vaccination 1-4 is given weekly and 4-6 at 2-week
      intervals. Those patients who exhibit stable disease, partial response or complete response
      after 6 injections will be given 4 more vaccinations at 2-week interval. The vaccine is
      applied by intradermal injection near the inguinal region.

      IL-2 2 MIU s.c. day 2-6, Cyclophosphamide (Sendoxan®, Baxter A/S) 50 mg twice a day bi-weekly
      and 200 mg Celecoxib (Celebra®, Pfizer) daily are used. Scans and re-staging tests are
      performed at scheduled intervals throughout the study.
