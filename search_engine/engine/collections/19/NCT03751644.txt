      affect the skeletal muscles. Despite these advances, this group of diseases still continues
      to be associated with high morbidity and functional disability, mainly due to the proximal
      muscular weakness of the scapular and pelvic girdles that may prevent the total recovery of
      these patients. On the other hand, the importance of the peripherical neuromuscular
      electrical stimulation has never applied in the patients with systemic autoimmune myopathies.
      Therefore, the main objective of the present prospective, randomized, investigator-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the application of an
      acute peripherical neuromuscular electrical stimulation session in patients with systemic
      autoimmune myopathies.
