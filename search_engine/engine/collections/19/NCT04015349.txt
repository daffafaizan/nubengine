    
      Sleep bruxism is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep that is characterised
      as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic) and should be considered a risk factor rather
      than a disorder in otherwise healthy individuals.

      The diagnosis of sleep bruxism often is challenging and despite the use of questionnaires,
      clinical exams and portable devices, based on current knowledge, the polysomnography with
      audio-video recordings emerges as the gold-standard criteria for a definite sleep bruxism
      diagnosis.

      Included on the questionnaire there is a registration form, which contains: included: age at
      time of data collection , gender, marital status , and education level ; Occupational:
      individuals were asked about work outside home, and working hours; Clinical condition: body
      mass index, smoking; alcohol consumption; use of sleeping pills; respiratory allergy and
      Psychological: sense of coherence .
