    
      This is an interventional study in which researchers will recruit HIV positive individuals
      who do not have hepatitis B (HBV negative) in order to assess the effectiveness of a
      hepatitis B vaccine in 2 subgroups:

        1. Those who have received less than 3 months treatment, or no treatment, with highly
           active antiretroviral drugs (HAART naive).

        2. Those who have received at least 3 months of treatment with highly active antiretroviral
           drugs (HAART exposed).

      All study participants will receive vaccination against HBV.

      There will be 6-12 clinic visits depending on 1) whether or not the participant responds to
      the standard 3-dose vaccination protocol and 2) whether he or she suffers a clinical
      condition or vaccine related adverse event that would call for postponement of the next
      vaccine dose.

      The first visit will be to determine if the participant is eligible for the study. If
      eligible, the participant will receive one dose of vaccine at each of the following three
      visits. The fifth visit will be to collect blood to determine whether the participant has
      responded to the 3-dose vaccination protocol. The sixth visit will be to discuss the outcome
      of the vaccination with the participant. Participants who respond favorably to the 3-dose
      vaccine protocol will exit the study at this point. However, if a participant fails to
      respond to the initial 3-dose vaccine protocol, he or she may restart the regimen and receive
      another 3 doses of vaccine following the same schedule as before but off protocol.

      Participants will be reimbursed for travel costs to and from the clinic for scheduled clinic
      visits.
