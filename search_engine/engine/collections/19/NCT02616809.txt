      random order. Each of the four experimental conditions are as follows: 1) sit continuously
      for 8 hours in a simulated office environment, 2) break-up sitting time with standing based
      on set hourly intervals, 3) break-up sitting time with slow-walking on a treadmill desk based
      on set hourly intervals, 4) increase energy expenditure by slow cycling based on set hourly
      intervals. Participants will completed each condition one week apart and dietary intake will
      be standardized by giving participants the same meals during each intervention condition.
      Study measures will include: anthropometrics (height and weight), blood pressure, fasting
      glucose, 24-continuous glucose monitoring, full-day ambulatory blood pressure monitoring,
      cognitive testing (cognitive performance), energy expenditure, physical activity via
      accelerometer, sleep via accelerometer, and heart rate.
