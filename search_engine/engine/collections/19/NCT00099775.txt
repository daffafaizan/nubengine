    
      This study is designed as a prospective, multi-center randomized double-masked
      placebo-controlled trial of caspofungin versus placebo for prevention of invasive candidiasis
      in high-risk adults in the critical care setting. The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of caspofungin as prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis in high-risk ICU subjects
      by comparing the risk of invasive candidiasis in subjects receiving caspofungin with the risk
      in those receiving placebo. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the rate of invasive
      candidiasis in subjects meeting the clinical prediction rule; to prospectively assess the
      effect of colonization as a risk factor for the development of invasive candidiasis; to
      evaluate the safety of caspofungin as prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis by summarizing the
      proportion of subjects who discontinue study therapy because of a drug-related adverse event
      and the proportion of subjects with one or more drug-related adverse event(s); and to
      evaluate all-cause mortality. The planned sample size will be 1200 subjects, 1/3 in the
      control arm and 2/3 in the active treatment arm based on a power of at least 0.8 needed to
      detect a 50% reduction in incidence from base rate of 11% to 5.5%. High-risk icu subjects
      greater than or equal to 18 years of age meeting all eligibility criteria with at least 5
      days of anticipated ICU stay will be randomized to receive either caspofungin 50 mg/day (70
      mg/day for subjects on rifampin) or placebo (normal saline) daily. Caspofungin or placebo
      will be given intravenously as a single daily dose infused over approximately one hour.
      Subjects will receive study drug or placebo for the duration on their icu stay, up to a
      maximum of 28 days.
