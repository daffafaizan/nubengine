      to non-obese patients. Therefore, extrapolation of data from healthy volunteers and is not
      possible.

      To investigate these differences 16 obese patients and 8 healthy subjects will be studied.

      Patients will receive fluconazole by semi-simultaneous design. Blood sampling for
      pharmacokinetic analysis will be retrieved through a central venous catheter. A maximum of
      100 milliliter blood in total will be drawn for this study. Patients will be monitored daily
      during the treatment period for adverse events of the study drug.

      Full pharmacokinetic curves will be taken after oral and intravenous administration. This
      pharmacokinetic analysis will enable the determination of bioavailability and enable the
      determination of intra-individual variability.
