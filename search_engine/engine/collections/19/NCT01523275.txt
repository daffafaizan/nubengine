      severe morbidity and even mortality. Treatment of LTS continues to present a challenge and a
      wide array of surgical techniques have been employed. Despite multiple endoscopic and/or open
      reconstructive procedures, patients often experience restenosis as a result of the abnormal
      wound-healing process that initially instigated the airway obstruction. The high rate of
      stenosis relapse has therefore motivated researchers to find new methods to modulate and
      control the wound-healing process of the airway. Although other adjuvant treatments such as
      steroids and antibiotics have been investigated in LTS, much attention in recent years has
      turned to the use of topical mitomycin-C (MMC). As a topical application, MMC has been shown
      to inhibit fibroblast proliferation in wound-healing processes. The use of MMC in the
      treatment of airway stenosis was first reported in 1998 and is now routinely used in the
      endoscopic management of LTS. However, despite numerous animal and human studies, the benefit
      of MMC in LTS patients remains questionable. While previously published retrospective data
      suggest that the addition of MMC improves outcome, there have been no prospective studies to
      directly address the efficacy of MMC in endoscopic LTS surgery. This study will be the first
      randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial designed to
      investigate the efficacy of MMC as an adjunctive therapy to endoscopic surgical treatment in
      patients with LTS. In addition, the study will investigate the relationship between patient
      symptoms and objective pulmonary function measurements. Ultimately, the results of this study
      may influence the treatment and evaluation of patients with laryngotracheal stenosis.
