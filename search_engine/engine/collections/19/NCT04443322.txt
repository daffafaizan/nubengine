      potential in the treatment of locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma before liver
      transplant and metastatic unresectable HCC. This trial is designed as a prospective, open
      label study for 20 patients with locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma before liver
      transplant and metastatic unresectable HCC. The aim is to investigate the efficacy of the
      combination therapy of Lenvatinib 80-120mg daily orally and durvalumab 1500mg by IV infusion
      every 4 weeks in terms of progression free survival.
