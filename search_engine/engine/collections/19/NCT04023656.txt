      which are characteristically triggered by a sudden movement from rest. The prevalence of this
      disorder is estimated to be 1 in 150,000 population. Males are more commonly affected than
      females, and the age of onset is typically in childhood or adolescence. PKC is mainly a
      familial disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance, but it can
      occur sporadically. The PRRT2 (proline-rich transmembrane protein 2) gene is believed to be
      the major causative gene.

      The prognosis of PKC is usually favorable. The severity and frequency of the attacks are
      reduced by anticonvulsant medication such as carbamazepine, and the number of the attacks
      decreases at the age of 20-30 years. However, there has been little study of long-term
      prognosis of PKC, and no study has been conducted in Korean population.
