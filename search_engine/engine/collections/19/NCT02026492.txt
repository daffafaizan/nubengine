      function testing at rest. To provoke asthma symptoms a provocation test is necessary, e.g.,
      by bronchial methacholine testing or by a standardised exercise test on a treadmill. The
      correlation between methacholine and exercise test is fair, possibly because both methods
      measure different kinds of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Moreover, the sensitivity and the
      repeatability of the exercise test is fair.

      The value of the methacholine test to predict a positive exercise test will be measured. We
      hypothesize that the exercise test in a cold chamber, a combination of two provocation
      methods cold air and exercise, is more sensitive to detect EIB and that the test has a better
      repeatability.
