      voluntary authorization by a patient for surgical treatment (MeSH). The IC has to include: 1.
      What is and for what is it, 2. How is it made, 3. What effect will produce, 4. which patients
      will benefit, 5. Alternatives, 6. Risks and special situations.

      The standard IC is based in written and verbal information, but the information provided is
      insufficient, leading to misunderstanding and even litigation.

      Technology plays an important role in the improvement of IC: the portable video media,
      tablet, with the application (app) iURO assists the procedure through videos and
      illustrations.

      To evaluate and measure the comprehension of the information that patients received, we
      elaborated and validated a "Questionnaire to evaluate the comprehension of IC" (the process
      was mounted as "Questionnaire for urology IC validation" in the poster session at the 17th
      International European Association of Urology Nurses (EAUN) Meeting, Munich-Germany).

      The patients undergoing to bladder or prostate transurethral resection were selected.
      Afterwards they were randomized previous the interview, into two groups: patients informed by
      PVM with the app iUro (experimental group) versus patients with an SVC (control group). The
      questionnaire was used to compare the comprehension of the surgery immediately and 15 days
      after the surgery. The items regarding questionnaire were: information, utility of the
      intervention, side effects, complications, comorbidity, usefulness of information, anxiety
      and risks.
