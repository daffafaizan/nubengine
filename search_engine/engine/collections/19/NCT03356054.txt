      R-CHOP have a dismal prognosis. Only 25% long term survivors are observed after salvage with
      high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). CD30
      expression is observed in 30% of refractory/relapse DLBCL.

      Monotherapy with brentuximab vedotin is effective in relapse CD30 positive DLBCL. The
      addition of brentuximab vedotin to R-DHAP might improve the prognosis of these patients.

      Treatment will consist of 3 cycles of brentuximab-vedotin in combination with R-DHAP. During
      the phase I part the recommended dose level for this combination will be established. Cycles
      will be given every 3 weeks.

      Responsive patients will be treated with BEAM followed by ASCT. Total treatment duration is
      approximately 16 weeks.

      Subsequently patients will be followed until 5 years after registration.
