      efficacy of unguided Internet-based intervention for students low on resilience with three
      conditions: a) unguided web-based resilience intervention (CORE); 2) Healthy lifestyle
      psychoeducationalprogram (HLP); and 3) Care as usual condition (CAU). Online- and telephone
      assessments will be conducted at pre- and post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up
      (see Figure 1). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be
      stratified according to trial site.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of an Internet-based
      programme developed to promote resilience and coping skills among at-risk university students
      in Spain, Argentina and Mexico. The specific aims are:

        1. To provide a preventative online intervention for enhancing resilience for decreasing
           symptoms of depression and anxiety and for increasing wellbeing

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of CORE program in a randomized
           controlled trial compared with two conditions, Healthy lifestyle (HTP) and care as usual
           (CAU).

        3. To analyze feasible strategies to implement CORE and to identify possible implementation
           barriers from final users, professionals of University counseling services and the
           University authorities in three Spanish-speaking countries.
