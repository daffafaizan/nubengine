    
      children admitted to Riley Hospital for Children (RHC) with musculoskeletal infections
      (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, or pyomyositis) over a 12-month period will be
      prospectively enrolled. Eligible subjects will be identified by referral from the infectious
      diseases and orthopedic services at RHC. Blood samples will be obtained on the day of
      admission (within 48hrs), and 24 hours after the admission sample for real-time NGS testing
      at Karius Laboratory (Redwood City, CA). If a pathogen is identified by NGS, in either of the
      first two samples, subsequent samples will be sent every 48-72 hours while inpatient, and
      then collected every 1-2 weeks after hospital discharge, while being treated for MSKI
      (maximum 3 follow-up samples). If both of the initial inpatient NGS samples are negative, no
      further samples will be sent for NGS. Pathogen identification by NGS will be compared to
      standard cultures methods, and quantitative cfDNA will be evaluated over time.
