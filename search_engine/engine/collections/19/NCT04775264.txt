    
      To assess the safety and feasibility of electroporation/Pulsed Electric Field (PEF) as a
      technology to achieve selective GP ablation. This treatment will be performed on 30 patients
      undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. Primary feasibility endpoint will be demonstration of
      ability to access and deliver Pulsed Electric Field energy to all of the targeted ablation
      sites.
