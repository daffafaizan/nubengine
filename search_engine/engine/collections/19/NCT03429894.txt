      enroll up to 50 patients requiring treatment of a single, de novo lesion ≤ 24 mm in length
      located in a vessel ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.5 mm in diameter. All patients be followed clinically at
      30 days, 6 and 9 months, and 1, 2 and 3 years.

      All patients will undergo imaging (angiography and IVUS) follow-up with approximately
      one-half of the patients returning for follow up at 9 months and approximately one-half
      returning for follow up at 12 months.

      At select centers, a subset of approximately 20 patients will undergo FFR pressure wire
      measurement at baseline and at follow-up (or at a minimum follow-up) in conjunction with the
      IVUS imaging, and will also undergo OCT imaging at 9 or 12 months.

      The primary safety endpoint is Target Lesion Failure at 6 months. TLF is a composite endpoint
      defined as cardiac death, target vessel MI, and clinically-indicated target lesion
      revascularization.

      The primary imaging/efficacy endpoints for those patients undergoing imaging follow-up is the
      change in mean in-device area and mean lumen area at 9 or 12 months compared to
      post-procedure as measured by IVUS.

      Co-primary imaging/efficacy endpoints for those patients undergoing imaging follow-up is late
      lumen loss as measured by QCA and IVUS at 9 or 12 months.
