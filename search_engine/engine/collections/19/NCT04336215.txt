    
      This prospective longitudinal cohort study is comprised of: (1) 500 HCW from two RBHS
      hospitals: Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH) in New Brunswick and University
      Hospital (UH) in Newark ; (both hospital presidents have approved the study) (2) 250 NHCW
      from Rutgers faculty, staff, and hospital employees without patient contact; and (3)
      household members of participants who contract SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. At
      baseline, investigators will obtain nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, saliva, and blood (for
      detecting SARS-CoV-2 positivity and immunity, respectively) and collect questionnaire data on
      sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, and medical history. In participants who test negative
      for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, nasopharyngeal/throat swabs, saliva, and blood collection will be
      collected every two weeks for two months, after which monthly samples will be collected for
      four additional months (9 visits total, including baseline). Weekly questionnaire data and
      daily temperature data will be collected from each participant for the first two months of
      the study. Participants with positive nasopharyngeal/throat swabs or saliva will be
      immediately referred for medical care or home isolation as medically appropriate.
      Investigators will calculate and compare incidence rates and risk factors of SARS-CoV-2
      positivity and COVID-19 in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and assess symptoms,
      severity of disease, and rates and direction of household transmission.
