      from mast cells and basophils. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis may include generalized
      flushing, hives, stuffy nose, red and itchy eyes, difficulty in breathing, swelling of the
      tongue, throat, palms and soles, gastrointestinal cramping, lightheadedness and loss of
      consciousness. Although most common causes of anaphylaxis include foods, drugs and stinging
      insects, a causative factor is not identified in up to 50% of the patients with recurrent
      anaphylactic episodes. Mast cells are important mediators of anaphylaxis. This study will
      examine the hypothesis that some patients with unexplained anaphylaxis may have systemic
      mastocytosis, a disorder of pathologic mast cell proliferation, as an underlying cause. In
      addition, it will investigate hematopoietic cells, which result in their tissue mast cells
      being more susceptible to degranulation. The study will enroll patients with mastocytosis
      with or without flushing or anaphylaxis, and patients with unexplained flushing or
      anaphylaxis. Patients will receive a clinical evaluation, blood tests and a bone marrow
      biopsy and aspirate. Research studies planned include flow cytometric analysis of blood and
      bone marrow cells, investigation of mutations or polymorphisms in genes involved in mast cell
      growth and differentiation, determination of surrogate disease markers and examination of
      mast cell growth and function. The study will improve the understanding of the mechanisms
      involved in anaphylactic reactions, which could in turn lead to development of strategies to
      better prevent or treat the episodes.
