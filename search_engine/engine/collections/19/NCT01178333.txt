      antibody test between 1/21/2008 and 9/25/2008 at selected hospitals associated with the
      Transfusion Medicine/Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network .

      Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a major complication of the administration of
      heparin and can result in life-threatening thrombosis with or without thrombocytopenia
      (HIT-T) or can produce thrombocytopenia without clinically symptomatic thrombosis ("isolated"
      HIT). Isolated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is defined as a fall in platelet count
      associated with a positive heparin PF-4 antibody test, in the absence of clinically overt
      thrombosis. While the treatment of HIT-T (HIT with thrombosis) with anticoagulation is well
      established, the risks and treatment of isolated HIT are unclear.

      It is anticipated that this data analysis will provide a current overview of the implications
      of a positive heparin PF-4 antibody test in clinical practice. It should determine the
      percentage of positive heparin PF-4 antibody tests that are associated with thrombocytopenia
      and thrombosis (HIT-T) or "isolated" HIT at diagnosis and the subsequent major clinical
      outcomes of death, limb amputation/gangrene, and new thrombosis. No "snapshot" of such HIT
      patients has been conducted in the past decade and the results will be important in assessing
      the impact of HIT in current medical care as well as documenting current treatment
      strategies.
