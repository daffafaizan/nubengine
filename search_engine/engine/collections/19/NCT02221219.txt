      their combination, in affecting the incidence and severity of IVH/PVL in infants <30wks
      gestational age (primary outcome measure of 'fraction of survivors with no severe IVH or PVL'
      among the 4 groups), and longer term neurocognitive function. Other secondary endpoints and
      investigations include mechanistic effects of prophylactic indomethacin, DCC, and their
      combination (blood volume/circulatory status, inflammatory stress, progenitor cells) as well
      as defining relationships between clinical outcomes and mechanistic measurements among
      treatment groups.
