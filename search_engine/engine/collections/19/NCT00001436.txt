      peak age of onset has suggested a possible contribution to the pathogenesis of the tumor by
      the endogenous hormonal milieu, which accompanies the adolescent growth spurt. In support of
      this, recent in vitro and in vivo laboratory investigators suggest that Insulin-like growth
      factor I (IGF I) may play an important role in the pathobiology of osteosarcoma. Somatostatin
      (and its longer-acting analogues) directly inhibits the pituitary release of growth hormone,
      thereby indirectly reducing the level of circulating IGF I. Other data have also demonstrated
      that the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen, significantly reduced circulating IGF I levels. We propose
      to administer the long acting somatostatin analog, OncoLAR® (Registered Trademark), alone and
      in combination with tamoxifen in patients with osteosarcoma. The degree of suppression of
      both circulating IGF I and growth hormone levels will be determined at two dose levels of
      OncoLAR® (Registered Trademark) alone and in combination with tamoxifen to determine whether
      the addition of tamoxifen to OncoLAR® (Registered Trademark) leads to significant additional
      reduction in circulating IGF I and growth hormone levels.
