      patients with FA will receive ALCAR every day for 24 months. At the study endpoint, subjects
      will be assessed for changes in cardiovascular outcomes and FA symptoms. To determine the
      effects of LC on changes in cardiomyopathy, echocardiography with strain rate will be
      calculated. This technique has been validated in clinical studies and used in other studies
      of FA patients for the comparison of regional deformation and myocardial wall thickness.
