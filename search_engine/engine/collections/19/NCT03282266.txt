      compare the change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of PADN on PAH patients. Based on the
      previous studies, the 6MWD was 13±24 m after 6-month treatment using target drugs. And our
      previous data showed that 6MWD at 6-month after PADN procedure was 65±85 m. As a result, a
      total of 128 PAH patients was required, with 64 patients/per group at a ratio of 1:1
      randomization.
