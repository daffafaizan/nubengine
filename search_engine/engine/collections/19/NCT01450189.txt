      Malawi, 19% of pregnant women seeking antenatal care and 15.6% of Malawians aged 15-49 years
      were infected with HIV in 2007. Prevention interventions that prevent onward transmission of
      HIV are urgently needed.

      Persons with acute HIV infection (AHI) may be responsible for a substantial proportion of
      onward transmission of HIV infection. AHI is characterized by unfettered replication of HIV
      in a "ramp up viremia". The high concentration of HIV in blood and genital secretions remains
      elevated for up to 10-12 weeks before it declines to the levels observed in established
      infection. These high levels of HIV shedding in the genital tract are likely to produce very
      efficient sexual transmission and the proportion of virions that are infectious may be
      substantially higher during acute compared to chronic infection. Consequently, the
      probability of transmission during unprotected intercourse for those with AHI is very high.
      Identifying persons with AHI and intervening to reduce onward transmission represents a
      tantalizing, but unproven, opportunity for HIV prevention.

      To have maximal impact, a prevention program targeting AHI must identify a substantial number
      of acutely infected persons and intervene quickly to minimize onward transmission. An
      effective immediate intervention would require behavioral modification to limit sexual
      partners and unprotected sex acts, and a biological intervention to reduce infectious viral
      burden in genital secretions. This is the first study to pilot a combined behavioral and
      biomedical intervention in individuals with AHI to reduce onward transmission of HIV.
