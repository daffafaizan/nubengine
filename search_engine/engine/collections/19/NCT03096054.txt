      helps our cells replicate correctly. In normal cells, Cdc7 is usually found at a low level,
      but can reach higher levels in cancer cells. This is often the case in certain types of solid
      tumour cancers, which we will focus on in this study. It is thought that giving LY3143921
      hydrate will block the function of Cdc7 and will affect cancer cells by stopping their
      replication and causing them to die. LY3143921 hydrate looks promising in laboratory studies
      and studies in animals.

      This clinical study has two parts:

      Part 1 - a 'dose escalation' phase where groups of patients will receive increasing doses of
      LY3143921 hydrate to find a safe dose and a dose that best targets the cancer cells.

      Part 2 - an 'expansion' phase where a larger group of patients will receive the highest dose
      of LY3143921 hydrate considered to be safe from Part 1, to find out more about how the drug
      is working.
