      stages of COPD patients. PIF will be measured by in-check method.

      Commonly used for Asthma patients, the In-Check Oral Inspiratory Flow Meter is a portable
      hand-held inspiratory flow meter that provides an assessment of the speed of inhalation. The
      In-Check Oral measures inspiratory flow between 30 and 370 L/min, inspiratory flow is thought
      of by physicians as a sensitive marker for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
      screening. The In-Check Oral works when a patient inhales through the mouth, this will cause
      air to be drawn through the meter and a cursor moves along the scale to indicate the speed of
      inhalation. The flow rate achieved can be noted by checking the position of the cursor
      against the calibrated scale. The Standard In-Check Oral inspiratory flow meter can measure
      inspiratory flow rates in the range 30 to 370 l/min, with an accuracy of +/- 10% or 10 l/min
      (whichever is the greater). (A Low Range In-Check Oral Inspiratory flow meter is available by
      special request, measuring between 15 and 120 l/min).

      All In-Check Oral meters are calibrated using an ATS pulmonary waveform generator, and the
      product complies with the Australian and New Zealand standards for back pressure in flow
      meters. As with any inhalation device checking for loose foreign objects is important. The
      transparent body of the In-Check Oral meter is designed to allow a visual inspection before
      use. The meter is manufactured from medical grade components, and is suitable for multiple
      patient uses when cleaned appropriately between patients. The expected life of the In-Check
      Oral, in normal use, is two years.
