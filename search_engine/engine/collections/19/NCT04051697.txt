      facial disfigurement and impairments in speech, breathing and swallowing, and can have a
      negative impact on well-being. Self-management interventions can provide people with skills
      to deal with health-related problems, maintain life roles, and manage negative emotions, and
      have been found to increase confidence, improve quality of life, and reduce health service
      use across a range of chronic conditions.

      The aim of this study is to pilot a self-management intervention (SEA-CHANGE) designed to
      promote quality of life and participation in life activities, and reduce distress in people
      who have completed primary treatment for HNC as compared to usual care. The study includes:
      (1) a pilot randomised study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention
      and its related procedures; (2) a qualitative process evaluation of the intervention; and (3)
      a systematic decision-making process regarding progression to a definitive trial. The
      expected outcome is a self-management intervention that is feasible and acceptable to HNC
      survivors and has the potential to realise both health benefits and economic gains.
