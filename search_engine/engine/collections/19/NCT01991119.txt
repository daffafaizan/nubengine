      and maintenance of sinus rhythm is important. Propafenone and dronedarone has been used as
      treatment for maintenance of sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion. But there are no direct
      comparison study.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of propafenone and dronedarone to
      maintain sinus rhythm after DC cardioversion.
