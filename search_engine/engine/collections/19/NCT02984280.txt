      samples from NHS laboratories testing positive for six common respiratory viruses with
      admissions to NHS hospitals in England for a range of cardiac and vascular outcomes over the
      time period 01/01/2004 to 31/12/2014. This will involve generating Poisson regression models
      controlling for factors such as seasonal and long-term trends, environmental temperature and
      humidity.

      This study is funded by an Academy of Medical Sciences Starter Grant for Clinical Lecturers.
