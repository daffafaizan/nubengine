      locally advanced cervical cancer are randomly divided into two groups. Patients in the
      experimental group will receive PEG-rhG-CSF 6mg prevention during concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy, whereas the control group do not use PEG-rhG-CSF for prevention. When the
      patient's ANC is less than 1✕109/L, 5μg/kg rhG-CSF will be given for treatment until the ANC
      returned to 2✕109/L.

      Case selection: patients with IIb-IIIb cervical cancer, squamous cell carcinoma confirmed by
      histopathology, and three-week regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin with Concurrent
      Radiotherapy.

      Primary end point: incidence and duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia in patients. Secondary
      endpoints: 1) Incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN); 2) the rate of postponement of the
      course of radiotherapy, reduction in chemotherapy dose and postponement of the course of
      chemotherapy; 3) Changes of bone marrow function in patients 3 months and 6 months after
      radiotherapy.

      Safety assessment: laboratory safety testing, including platelet count and hemoglobin.
      Evaluation of adverse events: infection, neutropenic fever, bone pain, etc.
