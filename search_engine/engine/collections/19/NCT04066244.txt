      decrease(s) TSPO binding in the brain of participants with ALS, and to evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of BLZ945 in participants with ALS at these doses and dosing regimen. PET
      imaging with a ligand selective for TSPO is widely used as a marker for microglial
      activation. Following microglia reduction, the repopulation of microglia in participants with
      ALS will be assessed at different times post dosing.
