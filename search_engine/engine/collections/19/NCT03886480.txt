      pre and post measures, to evaluate the potential efficacy of a virtual reality-based
      treatment using the SaeboVR rehabilitation system in stroke survivors. Comprehensive
      measurement during the baseline and post-treatment phases will be completed, with each
      individual to serve as their own control. Participants will make 3 separate visits to the
      laboratory (approximately 2 days apart) on the Bannatyne Campus at the University of Manitoba
      prior to the 4 week intervention and again after the intervention. The Arm Activity Measure
      (ArmA) and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) will be used both pre and
      post intervention as well as the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) to measure
      participants' performance on self-identified occupational performance issues and their level
      of satisfaction with their performance. Two participants will be recruited upon discharge
      from inpatient stroke rehabilitation at the Riverview Health Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, and
      upon entry into this study, will receive one-to-one treatment and supervision using the
      SaeboVR rehabilitation system for approximately 1 hour per session, 2 to 3 times per week for
      4-weeks.
