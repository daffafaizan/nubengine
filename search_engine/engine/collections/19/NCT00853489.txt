      heal are typically treated with bone from the hip (iliac crest autograft; or ICBG). The use
      of ICBG bone with the treatment of delayed unions/non-unions with critical defect, although
      successful, has its drawbacks. The bone graft sources are limited and the procedure is
      associated with additional operating room time plus a second incision with increased risk of
      infection, post operative pain and increased hospital stay. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if Rh-BMP2, a new bone graft substitute, is at least as effective as using bone
      from the hip (autograft) to help promote healing of open, tibia (shin bone) fractures.

      Research Questions:

      Primary:

      What is the relative effect of rhBMP-2 versus autogenous ICBG on rates of union in patients
      with critical size defects following tibial shaft fractures?

      Null hypothesis #1: rhBMP-2 has the same union rate when used in critical-sized defects as
      does ICBG.

      Secondary:

      What is the relative effect of rhBMP-2 versus autogenous ICBG on infection rates in patients
      with nonunion or critical size defects following tibial shaft fractures?

      Null hypothesis #2: The infection rate in open tibias with critical-sized defects treated
      with rhBMP-2 and autogenous ICBG are the same.

      What is the economic impact of the use of Rh-BMP 2 for tibial fractures with critical sized
      defects?

      Null hypothesis #3: There will be no difference in the economic cost of the treatment of
      critical sized defects using the RhBMP-2 versus iliac crest bone graft.
