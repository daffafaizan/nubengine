      Ontario region. Determine whether acute bacterial infection is a risk factor for development
      of inflammatory bowel disease using the population of Walkerton as a cohort. We hypothesize
      that exposure to bacterial infection leads to development of post infectious irritable bowel
      syndrome which is associated with an increase in intestinal permeability and immune
      activation with low grade intestinal inflammation and that this sequence of events will
      trigger inflammatory bowel disease in genetically susceptible individuals
