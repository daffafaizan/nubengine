      1.5% of them have a univentricular heart. The Fontan procedure allows children with
      functionally univentricular hearts to live relatively normal lives. However, the
      cardiopulmonary physiology remains abnormal and chronic complications, including myocardial
      dysfunction, arrhythmias, pathway abnormalities, hepatic dysfunction, obstruction of the
      ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary veins, and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may
      significantly reduce maximal exercise capacity and quality of life. Quality of life and
      life-long heart health are, therefore, critically important for Fontan patients as their
      survival depends on the continued functioning of an already sub-normal cardiopulmonary
      physiology.
