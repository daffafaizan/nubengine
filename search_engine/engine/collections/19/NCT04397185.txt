      for breast cancer and to minimize positive margins. The purpose of this study is to provide
      evidence that the BCL is safe, effective, and non-inferior to the standard of care (WL) in
      the removal of non-palpable invasive breast cancer and DCIS.

      Investigators in the intervention group will be provided with a three dimensional (3D) image
      of the cancer in the breast which allows them to visualize the closest distance from the
      tumor to the skin and the chest wall and quantifies those distances. Investigators will also
      use a BCL, which is a patient specific, plastic, bra-like form that is transiently placed on
      the breast prior to surgery and allows the Investigator to mark the projected edges of the
      tumor on the breast skin and to place bracketing wires inside the breast which define the
      center of the cancer and distances 1 cm from the tumor edges defined by pre-operative supine
      MRI.
