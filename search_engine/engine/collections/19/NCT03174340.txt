      therapeutic approach to improve the control of glycaemia and decrease the need for
      prescription of insulin. Increased physical activity in pregnant women with gestational
      diabetes is expected to decrease the mother and child morbidity associated with gestational
      diabetes, but also to improve the general health status of the mother and the child.

      The objectives of this randomized trial are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of therapeutic exercise program on blood glucose regulation in
           women with GDM who are assigned to diet-and-exercise protocol.

        -  To demonstrate the feasibility of the therapeutic exercise treatment and the possibility
           of using the exercise program as an optional therapeutic approach for women with GDM.
