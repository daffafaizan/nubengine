      episodes of fever and serositis. Phenotype II, another kind of this disorder, has atypical
      courses, when the inflammation proceeds without any clinical sign.

      Each FMF attack is accompanied by sharp elevation of inflammatory markers in the serum, and
      serum amyloid A (SAA) one of them. The level of these inflammatory markers returns to normal
      with termination of the attack. The SAA is the main component of amyloids fibrils and
      constantly high level of SAA after the attack (as occurs in undiagnosed or undertreated
      disease) is the significant risk factor responsible for development of amyloidosis. On the
      other hand, in patients with phenotype II the amyloidosis occurs despite absolute absence of
      the attacks.

      The kidney is one of the first organ suffers from amyloid deposits. The spectrum of kidney
      damage spread wildly from mild proteinuria to obvious nephrotic syndrome with disturbance in
      renal function and progression to end stage renal failure.

      It is well known that deterioration of renal disease in AA amyloidosis links to level of SAA
      in serum. The permanently high SAA level is a major factor responsible to progression of
      renal disease. Occasionally, however, decline in the renal function occurred despite normal
      or near normal levels of SAA. Renal impairment in these cases may be explained by mechanisms
      existing in other kidney diseases when uncontrolled proteinuria aggravates renal dysfunction.
      The purpose of the study is to find whether a cohort of patients followed in our clinic and
      receiving colchicine for FMF- amyloidosis according to the SAA levels, monitored
      periodically, have better prognosis than an historical cohort receiving colchicine according
      to the attack status
