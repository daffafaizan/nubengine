    
      All 73 patients, who have been treated with apicoectomy on teeth with post and core and crown
      between the years 2004 and 2006 and who have already been followed up in 2008, will be
      followed up once more in 2017.

      The patients will have a clinical and radiologic examination. The investigators will examine
      if new periapical lesions, bone loss, fracture of teeth or loss of teeth exist.
