      in improving functionality and body balance in supported employed individuals with ID. To
      evaluate this effect, a total of subjects will participate in a longitudinal and clinical
      trial.

      Sample size has been calculated to detect minimal significant effects on the variable of
      physical performance (SPPB): accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a
      bilateral contrast, 26 individuals are required in order to detect a difference equal to or
      greater than 1.5 unit in the SPPB (SD= 1.94). It has been increased the sample size in an
      additional 20% (losts during follow-up) and 5% (mortality). The resultant sample size is
      determinate in 32 individuals, who are equally randomized in both experimental and control
      groups.

      Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 22.0). Data
      were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all
      outcome measures. Mean differences within the groups in the functional tests and
      stabilometric outcomes were estimated using paired sample t-tests, while mean differences
      between the groups in these variables were estimated using repeated measures analysis of
      variance. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. To determine the magnitude of
      the interactions between time and group, the effect size or µ2 was calculated as described by
      Cohen (1998) and interpreted as small (> 0.01 and < 0.06), moderate (≥ 0.06 and < 0.14) or
      large (≥ 0.14).
