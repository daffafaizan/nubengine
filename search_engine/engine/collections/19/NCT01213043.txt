      protection to patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is currently unknown. As a first
      step to address this question, the present study has been undertaken. This is a multi-center,
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of weekly
      infusions of 120 mg/kg of Prolastin-C, compared to weekly infusions of 60 mg/kg of
      Prolastin-C in patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. This study is a crossover design
      with 2 treatment sequences:

      Treatment Sequence 1: 60 mg/kg weekly infusion of Prolastin-C for 8 weeks followed by 120
      mg/kg weekly infusion of Prolastin-C for 8 weeks (starting at Week 1) (total of 16 treatment
      weeks)

      Treatment Sequence 2: 120 mg/kg weekly infusion of Prolastin-C for 8 weeks followed by 60
      mg/kg weekly infusion of Prolastin-C for 8 weeks (starting at Week 11) (total of 16 treatment
      weeks)

      Approximately 15 subjects are planned to be entered into each treatment sequence.

      At Weeks 8 to 11 and Weeks 18 to 21, a total of 15 serial blood samples for each subject will
      be drawn for pharmacokinetic analysis. The expected duration of the study subject's
      participation will be approximately 25 weeks (which includes a 3-Week Screening Phase, 2-Week
      Washout Period [between different alpha-1 PI treatment doses], and a 4-Week Follow-up
      Period). The following safety parameters will be assessed: adverse events, pulmonary
      exacerbations, vital signs, pulmonary function tests, and clinical laboratory tests.
