    
      The Ottawa score is a clinical predictive score aiming at stratifying thromboembolic
      recurrences in cancer patients according to identified clinical risk factors and histological
      type of the tumor. This score has never been validated externally in a prospective way in
      patients treated with tinzaparin. The objective of this observational prospective study is to
      enroll cancer patients with TED treated with tinzaparin for a planned period of 6 months and
      to collect data on thromboembolic recurrences, major hemorrhages, deaths and heparin-induced
      thrombocytopenia
