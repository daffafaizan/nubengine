      distressing auditory hallucinations. Their mere presence increases the risk of suicide. Most
      reach remission with D2 dopamine receptor blocking drugs after 1 year of adherence. However,
      30% of patients have intractable hallucinations, and 50% are non-adherent to their
      medications, commonly because of unfavorable side-effects - those intractable and
      non-adherent patients continue to suffer. There is a clear need for a mechanistic
      understanding of hallucinations as a prelude to rational treatment design.

      This study provides the initial steps towards the development of an interventional biomarker
      for clinical hallucinations, grounded in computational neuroscience.

      Computational psychiatry involves harnessing the power of computational neuroscience to
      address the clinical needs of those suffering from serious mental illnesses. There has been
      much discussion of the promise of the approach. There have been few studies thus far and they
      have largely involved correlative methods like functional neuroimaging. This study will
      address this shortcoming by causally manipulating the neural loci of computational model
      parameters in-person in patients with psychosis using transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS), tracking the impact of this manipulation on behavioral task performance . With such a
      causal intervention, the veracity of the model's explanation of hallucinations will be either
      validated or disconfirmed. If validated, the model can be further developed as a biomarker
      for predicting the hallucination onset, guiding, developing or tracking the effects of
      treatments for hallucinations. If disconfirmed, the model ought to be discarded and other
      alternatives should be pursued.
