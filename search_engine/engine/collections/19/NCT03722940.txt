      anesthesia were enrolled in this double blind, randomized study. Children were randomly
      allocated into two equal groups. Children in Group M (magnesium sulphate group) received an
      iv bolus dose of magnesium sulfate 40 mg Kg-1 over 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia
      followed by 15mg Kg-1 h-1 infusion until the start of skin closure. Children in Group C
      (Control group) received equivalent volumes of isotonic saline solution over the same period
      instead of magnesium sulphate. Haemodynamic variables, quality of surgical field, ESRT and
      the intraoperative anesthetic requirements were recorded
