      shock will be delivered.

      The objective of this first stage is to assess whether the burden of untreated non sustained
      VTs or episodes treated with anti-tachycardia pacing is predictive of appropriate ICD shocks.

      The second phase of the study will start after the first appropriate ICD shock delivered for
      VT.

      Patients will be then randomized to immediate VT ablation or to standard treatment, meaning
      waiting until next arrhythmic storm to perform a VT ablation procedure.

      The objective of this phase is compare the rate of worsening heart failure hospitalizations
      and deaths from any cause between the two groups.
