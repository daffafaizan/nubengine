      MDS.

      Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 monotherapy over 10
      days. From Day 11 through Day 14, subjects will receive hATG, Methylprednisolone and
      Cyclosporine. From Day 15 until Day 30 (of the first month), subjects will continue treatment
      only with Methylprednisolone and Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine will continue daily through Month
      6/Day 30 (M6/D30) (end of study treatment). Beginning on M2/D1, BL-8040 will be administered
      daily as part of the maintenance period for the first 5 days of each month through M6. All
      BL-8040 injection courses will be given at the site, as either an inpatient or outpatient per
      the treating physician's decision.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of the treatment with BL-8040
      on top of the standard immunotherapy regimen of: hATG, cyclosporine, and steroids in patients
      with Hypoplastic MDS and AA. Safety and efficacy will be assessed at defined time-points
      throughout the study. Duration of response and overall survival will be assessed as a part of
      the long term FU. A maximum of 25 patients will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be
      equally distributed between the disease populations.
