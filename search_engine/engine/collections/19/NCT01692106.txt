      Equally all patients will undergo Eckardt's and grading systems of symptom severity before
      and after the intervention. The patients will have a gastro-graffin swallow in the first day
      after the surgery.

      Procedure: Under general anesthesia upper endoscopy is performed using a standard single
      channel gastroscope. Submucosal injection with 10 ml saline with 1% methylen blue at the
      level of the mid esophagus is initially performed. A small longitudinal submucosal incision
      is created using a standard needle knife. For a sufficient entry point as well as submucosal
      tunnel, a dilating balloon is inserted submucosally via the created incision similar to the
      technique used in standard endoscopic submucosal dissection. The balloon is slightly inflated
      to allow sufficient entrance of the endoscope. The gastroscope is advanced into the
      submucosal space and the tunnel is created via needle knife or blunt dissection as
      appropriate. The tunnel is created distally and is stopped several centimeters beyond the
      lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which can easily be identified. Using flexible scissors, a
      triangle tip- or respectively an isolated tip-knife the clearly visible circular muscles are
      divided starting 4 cm above the LES extending 2 cm beyond the previously identified
      esophageal border. The longitudinal and serosal layers are left intact. Finally the mucosal
      entry is closed with standard endoscopic clips. Patients will receive standard postoperative
      care for surgical myotomy, including long-term follow-up.

      If for any reason the endoscopic treatment is unable to be completed or infeasible, a
      standard laparoscopic treatment will be performed.
