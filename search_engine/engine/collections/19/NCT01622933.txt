    
      This is a Phase I, single site study to evaluate the immunological effects of autologous DC
      transduced with the MART-1, tyrosinase and MAGE-A6 (melanoma associated antigens, MAA) genes
      in 30 subjects with recurrent, unresectable stage III, IV metastatic melanoma (M1a, M1b,
      M1c). AdVTMM2-transduced DC, 10e7, will be given intradermally (i.d.) every two weeks for a
      total of 3 vaccines.

      After the DC vaccines, subjects will be randomized to either receive a boost of high dose
      IFNa2b or no boost.

      Subjects randomized to receive the IFNa2b boost will receive Interferon-a2b, 20 MU/m2/d
      (rounded to the nearest 1 million units) administered intravenously for 5 consecutive days
      (Monday through Friday) every week for 4 weeks (induction). Administration will begin
      approximately 30 days (± 7 days) after the 3rd vaccine. The first dose of IFNα2b may begin
      within 10 business days of randomization. All subsequent procedure dates for Group A will be
      based on the date of the first dose of IFNα2b..

      The end-points of this study are local and systemic toxicity, immunological response,
      generation of determinant spreading and anti-tumor immunity, and clinical response.
