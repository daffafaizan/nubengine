      post-transplantation diabetes1. However, the optimal A1c target after transplantation has not
      been studied. The objective is to understand the optimal A1c target post liver and combined
      liver and kidney transplant. Strict A1c control will improve mortality and cardiovascular
      risk post liver and combined liver and kidney transplant and improve complications post liver
      and combined liver and kidney transplant.

      Strict blood sugar control in non-transplant patients with diabetes mellitus has shown
      unfavorable results in previous studies2. However, no optimal A1c level has been studied in
      liver and combined liver and kidney transplant patients. Furthermore, guidelines for A1c
      target post-transplant are of expert opinion3.

      The primary objective is to assess the impact of hemoglobin A1c on all-cause mortality among
      patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing liver or combined liver and kidney transplantation
      between 2008 to 2018. The second objective is to assess the impact of hemoglobin A1c on
      complications post liver or combined liver and kidney transplantation.
