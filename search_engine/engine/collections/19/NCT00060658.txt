      forms of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in
      the human prefontal cortex.

      Utilizing experimental neuropsychological tasks during functional MRI on healthy, adult
      volunteers, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex in mathematical cognition in a population of normal controls recruited among college
      and graduate students. We will also attempt to determine the relationship of mathematical
      cognition between non-frontal neural structures, such as left parietal lobe, and frontal
      neural structures involved in mechanistic plans, actions and mental sets.

      The data collected will consist of behavioral measures of cognitive performance and
      corresponding fMRI images. The data that we collect in this protocol will be of value in
      identifying a set of neural regions and distributed networks mediating the forms of knowledge
      representation stored in the prefrontal cortex. We will also use the data obtained in these
      studies to constrain theories of frontal lobe function and to provide evidence for the role
      of specific frontal cortex sectors in specific cognitive functions.
