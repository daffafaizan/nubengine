      postoperative pain after minimally invasive surgeries. Thoracoscopic surgeries are often
      associated with severe postoperative pain. To relieve the pain, potent narcotics have to be
      used, which have many side effects. Surgical patients would therefore benefit from an
      intra-operative analgesic regimen that is safe and effective, has minimal side effects and
      can reduce their postoperative narcotic requirements. Intravenous lidocaine has been shown
      previously to relieve cancer pain, chronic pain, and pain after other types of surgery.
