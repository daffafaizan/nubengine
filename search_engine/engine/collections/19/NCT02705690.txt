      allowing a long term intervention via a monitoring and training of balance health much before
      a fall happens. Towards this end, we have designed an iOS application and a belt. The phone
      is kept stable against the lower back of the participant using the belt. The application
      turns on the accelerometer in the phone to sample acceleration along x (media lateral) and z
      (anterior posterior) axis. These displacements from the mean are used to calculate the Root
      Mean Square of a person which acts a proxy score for Postural Sway. (Postural sway is defined
      as the phenomenon of constant displacement and correction of the position of the center of
      gravity within the base of support)

      Studies in the past have compared the use of accelerometers to the use of the clinical
      measured of Timed Up (TUG) test and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) in the assessment of postural
      stability and indicated that there is a high correlation between BBS, TUG and Accelerometry.
      Accelerometry has also found to be able to distinguish between sway responses to differing
      balancing conditions and between fallers and non-fallers.

      We aim to conduct a benchmarking study for our iOS application against the BBS.
