      if they presented no contraindications to use androgen therapy.

      Project Objectives :

      The general objective was to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of three vaginal rings
      containing DHEA, testosterone, or combination of both hormones in women.

      Secondary objectives were to assess effects on the hormonal profile, tolerability and
      incidence of adverse events.

        -  DHEA and/or, testosterone levels

        -  Estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG),
