      symptoms in PD patients. L. plantarum PS128 is a psychobiotic that regulates the level of
      dopamine in specific brain regions. Patients with PD will receive PS128 or placebo
      intervention for 12 weeks. Symptoms of PD will be clinically evaluated before and after the
      treatment, and the results will be compared.
