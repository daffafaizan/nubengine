      completed within a prescribed time period to assess CareLink scheduled transmission
      compliance. The evaluation will also assess adoption to remote monitoring, patient perceived
      benefit of BlueSync™ (how patients interact with the smart device application) and health
      care provider perception of the value of BlueSync™ and satisfaction with BlueSync™ (benefits
      experienced by clinicians that use BlueSync™).
