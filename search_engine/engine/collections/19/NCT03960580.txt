      of twice-daily doses of 186 and 372 Âµg of OPN-375 (fluticasone propionate) with placebo in
      subjects with chronic sinusitis using the following co-primary endpoints:

        1. A change from baseline in symptoms as measured by a composite score of nasal congestion,
           facial pain or pressure sensation, and nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior) at
           the end of Week 4.

        2. A change from baseline to Week 24/Early Termination (ET) in the average percent of the
           volume opacified in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.
