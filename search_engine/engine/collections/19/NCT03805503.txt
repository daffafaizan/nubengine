      sitting position on the side of the operation table and a epidural Tuohy needle 18G will be
      inserted into L3-L4 interspace via a loss-of-resistance technique. The dura will be punctured
      using a 27-gauge pencil-point spinal needle and a certain dose of chloroprocaine 1% will be
      given. After the spinal needle is withdrawn, an epidural catheter will be placed and the
      epidural needle will be withdrawn. After fixation of catheter the patient will be placed in a
      supine position.

      The first spinal dose of chloroprocaine 1% to start with is 50mg. This dose has been
      successfully used for spinal anesthesia in hernia repair outpatients to reach an adequate
      analgesia. Each time there will be added 2,5 microgram of sufentanil for prolongation of the
      analgesia. The testing interval is 2 mg.
