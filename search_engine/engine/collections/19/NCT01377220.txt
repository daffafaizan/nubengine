      the histological examination remains the reference for the diagnosis, it may be difficult to
      obtain biopsy material because of difficulty in getting to the lesion or due to their small
      size. However, it is know that the size of the lesion remains a major prognostic factor,
      implying the need for an earliest detection, which enhances the chance for curative
      treatment.PET enables the study of changes in the glucidic or lipidic metabolism of cancer
      cells. PET-CT, providing both metabolic and anatomic information, improves the performances
      of this technique. PET with 18F-FDG has not been sensitive enough in the detection of HCC,
      except in cases of low grade. Recently, several research studies reported that 11C-choline
      PET has shown a high detection rate of well differentiated HCC, which is an early stage of
      primary liver cancer.

      The study include 30 patients presenting a suspicion of HCC with or without cirrhosis. Each
      patient will be examined with two conventional imaging techniques, consisting in dynamic
      magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography; alpha fetoprotein measurement will be
      taken. PET-CT will be acquired after an intravenous injection of 11C-choline. The 11C-choline
      PET-CT performance for HCC diagnosis will be compare to histological analysis obtained by a
      tumoral liver biopsy, or by using of the American Association for the study of Liver Disease
      diagnostic criteria. In absence of the two criteria , the follow up within one year will
      serve as a reference.
