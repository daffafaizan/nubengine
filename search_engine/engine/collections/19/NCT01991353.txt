      shock absorption across the knee and meniscal damage can lead to secondary degenerative joint
      disease. This has lead to treatments directed towards repairing and preserving the meniscus
      to alter the progression of joint degeneration. Although success rates of meniscal repair are
      greater when performed in association with anterior cruciate reconstruction, healing rates
      remain in the 70-80% range for isolated repairs.

      Therefore, techniques such as the use of fibrin clots, trephining and rasping of the tissues,
      have been incorporated to improve healing results of meniscal repair. There has been a surge
      of enthusiasm for the use of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) to improve healing rates of soft
      tissue injuries. Therefore, it may be reasonable to surmise that applying blood products,
      such as thrombin and platelet rich plasma, to the meniscal repair bed may induce more
      complete and possibly faster healing.
