      milliliters (approximately two tablespoons) of blood drawn. This will be done prior to their
      scheduled screening or diagnostic colonoscopy. If the patient has indicated a desire to
      receive the results of their test, they will receive a written description, as will their
      primary care physician. The patients will be contacted yearly for up to 5 years by the study
      staff to learn whether they have been found to have a diagnosis of colon or other cancer.
