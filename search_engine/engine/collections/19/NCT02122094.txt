    
      The intervention is administered in community and clinic settings. The full intervention
      consists of seven core modules: Sexual Health, Sexual Diversity, HIV/STI Transmission,
      Behavioral Risk and Risk Reduction, Alcohol and Drugs, Stigma, and HIV/STI and Health Seeking
      Practices. In the community, outreach is conducted by Health Educators to deliver the
      intervention modules that young men express and interest in, as well as to provide risk
      reduction materials including condoms and lubricant. Study interviewers conduct a
      cross-sectional interview of young male sex workers in community venues (the interviewers and
      health educators are never present in a venue at the same time), and a random sample of
      interviewees are invited to a local clinic, where they receive a more detailed interview, the
      full intervention (delivered one on one by a Health Educator and including all seven
      modules), a clinical exam, testing for HIV and other STIs (HBV, HCV, gonorrhea, syphilis,
      chlamydia), onsite treatment, vaccination and referral, and a post-intevention assessment.
