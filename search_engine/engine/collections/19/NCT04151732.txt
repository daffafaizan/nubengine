      minor trauma can result in a fracture. Such an injury is known as low-energy fracture or
      fragility fracture, and the risk increases with age. Fragility fractures may be preventable,
      either by changes in lifestyle or by medication of underlying diseases. Fragility fractures
      also put a burden both on the affected individual and on society. As the population age, more
      individuals are at risk, and the absolute numbers of fragility fractures increase. Therefore,
      identification of individuals at risk before fracture occurs would be ideal.In the
      prospectively collected Malmo Diet and Cancer (MDC) cohort a large number of health and life
      style variables have been gathered from randomly invited men and women in a city of 350,000
      inhabitants in the 1990s'. The MDC database the investigators use for this study comprises
      30,351 participants. Outcome is updated via crosslinking with the National Patient Register
      in Sweden.
