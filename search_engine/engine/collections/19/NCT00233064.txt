      drug before injection. Both formulations of palivizumab have been shown to be bioequivalent
      in children 6 months of age or younger with a history of chronic lung disease. In previous
      studies of liquid palivizumab, immunogenicity was evaluated up to 2 months after dosing in
      adults, and 1 month after dosing in children. In this study, MI-CP116, immunogenicity will be
      evaluated between 4 and 6 months after the last dose of study drug, in order to provide data
      at a time point significantly distant from dosing when drug interference is minimal.
