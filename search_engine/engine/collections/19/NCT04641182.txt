      infected patients that are not intubated. Prone patient placement during invasive mechanical
      ventilation is a widespread practice in the management of severe ARDS. However, few attempts
      have been made to implement the prone position in patients that spontaneously ventilate with
      supplemental oxygen. Considering that it is a procedure that does not require additional
      equipment and does not represent an additional cost for its implementation, it becomes a
      valuable tool in the context of COVID-19 where intubation is associated with high mortality.
      The investigators will analyze a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure
      managed with prone position as indicated by the attending physician and register
      physiological variables and clinical outcomes (intubation and death).
