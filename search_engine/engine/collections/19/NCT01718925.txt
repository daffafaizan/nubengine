      or have quiescent disease, several studies have confirmed that symptoms, such as e.g.,
      fatigue, is troublesome.Previous studies have confirmed that vitamin D deficiency is
      associated with both Crohn's disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Since Vitamin D is associated
      with both onset of chronic disease and energy, we aim in this study to assess its impact on
      fatigue in various chronic diseases.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether or not there might be an association
      between levels of vitamin D and the subjective experience of fatigue in conditions, such as
      inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel
      syndrome.

      Secondary aims is to study both the co-occurence and influence of pain, depression and
      anxiety.
