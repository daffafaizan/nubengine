      Video-game Biofeedback Modulated Exercise (ViBE) program administered via Dance Dance
      Revolution to improve dynamic balance, gait and mobility in individuals with Huntington's
      Disease. Secondary aims were to explore whether the ViBE intervention would improve quality
      of life, fall risk, and neuropsychological functions. The investigators hypothesized that the
      video-game program would lead to greater improvements in walking, dynamic balance, quality of
      life, fall risk, and neuropsychological function than a control handheld video game program.
      Since motivation is essential to the long-term maintenance of an exercise program the
      investigators were also interested in finding out how successful people with Huntington's
      Disease were at playing Dance Dance Revolution, what their perceptions were of playing the
      game, and whether they thought that it was beneficial
