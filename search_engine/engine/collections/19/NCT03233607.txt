      intervention is dependent on care providers ability to accurately estimate ongoing blood
      loss. Studies in the past have shown that obstetricians and midwives tend to overestimate
      blood loss when the lost volumes are small while tend to underestimate by as much as 40 to 50
      percent when a large volume of blood is lost.

      Multiple studies have shown that routine hemoglobin assessment in postpartum patients after
      uneventful delivery either vaginal or via cesarean section, is not necessary. This leads to
      increased cost of care without any added benefit and causes inconvenience to the patients.
      However knowing how imprecise blood loss estimation can be it is reasonable to screen women
      for anemia prior to discharge.
