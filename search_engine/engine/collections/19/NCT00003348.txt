      O6-benzylguanine in patients with recurrent, persistent, or progressive cerebral anaplastic
      gliomas. II. Characterize the toxic effects associated with this treatment regimen in these
      patients. III. Observe patients for clinical antitumor response when treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior nitrosourea administration (yes or no).
      (Prior nitrosoureas stratum closed) An initial cohort of 3 patients per stratum is treated
      with intravenous O6-benzylguanine followed approximately 1 hour later by intravenous
      carmustine every 6 weeks. Additional cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated with escalating
      doses of carmustine until dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed. The maximum tolerated
      dose is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT. Courses
      are repeated every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-56 patients (12-28 per stratum) will be accrued in 12
      months.
