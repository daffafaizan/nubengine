      anticipates and prevents the onset of pain, and helps avoid the need for additional drugs.
      Usually it is possible to reach good analgesia in the immediate postoperative period by the
      administration of analgesic drugs. Recently, intra-articular administration of different
      anaesthetic substances with a local action (e.g. bupivacaine) has been introduced in clinical
      practice. The aim of the administration of these substances should not be the reduction of
      postoperative pain, but its prevention.
