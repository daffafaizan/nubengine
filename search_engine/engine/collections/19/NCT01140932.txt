      (including pupil dilation, dark adaptation, and local anaesthetics) are carried out to allow
      the ERG to be obtained. After electrophysiology, the subject will be clamped at a plasma
      glucose level of 10 mM (~180 mg/dL) and after a stabilisation period the ERG protocol is
      repeated.

      Each subject is examined twice on two different days. The first day the subjects are
      normoglycaemic in the morning (first examination) and hyperglycaemic (clamped to 10 mM)
      throughout the second examination. The second day subjects are also normoglycaemic and
      hyperglycaemic but shows up after 7-12 days of daily intake of prednisolone, high calorie
      diet, and exercise restraint.
