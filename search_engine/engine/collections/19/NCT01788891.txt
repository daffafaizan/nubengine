      defined by virologic, immunologic, and/or clinical criteria. There are few studies of HIV
      resistance mutations in children failing first line NNRTI therapy in resource limited
      settings. The emergence of treatment failure and drug resistance in children on ART
      emphasizes the urgency for developing evidence-based second-line and salvage treatment
      strategies. Pediatric treatment is complicated by a number of factors, including having fewer
      numbers of ARVs approved by drug safety agencies and the lack of pediatric formulations. This
      further shortens the list of available second-line ARVs as compared to adults.

      Despite the growing number of children on second-line therapy worldwide, there are limited
      data on efficacy of second-line PI therapy in children after NRTI-NNRTI failure. There are
      currently no options for third-line/salvage regimens for children in resource-limited
      settings. New drugs and drug classes are approved for use in children by the US FDA but are
      not routinely available outside of high-income settings.

      Also, there are no data on the resistance patterns of children failing second-line therapy in
      resource-limited settings to guide clinical management and ARV procurement. Clinicians need
      evidence-based guidelines for how to manage children with treatment failure, and access to
      the drugs necessary to construct potent and durable third-line regimens.

      TASER-P is a longitudinal observational cohort study to monitor for treatment failure to
      second-line ART in Asian children.
