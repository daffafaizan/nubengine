      size using fMRI has not been previously reported. Furthermore, how the brain response to food
      portion size and energy density is related to energy intake has not been previously reported.
      The goal of this study is to identify brain regions activated in response to portion size and
      energy density and relate these neural responses to laboratory eating behaviors in children.
