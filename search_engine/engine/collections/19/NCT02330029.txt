      medication worldwide. However, original clinical studies on pinaverium are scarce. Only five
      original clinical studies from Europe, one from Latin America, and one from Asian were found.
      These studies were single-centered and small sample sized (19 - 53 IBS patients) studies.

      Tong Xie Yao Fang has long been used in China. Its efficacy and safety has not been evaluated
      by modern scientific method.

      Effectiveness, onset and offset of actions are the most considered factors when physicians
      choose medications for IBS. Yet, to our knowledge, there are no clinical studies studied the
      onset and offset of actions of pinaverium, which remains one of the most transcribed IBS
      medications, and herbs, which are becoming more popular for treating IBS.

      This study is designed to evaluate onset and offset of actions, efficacy, and safety over a
      long term (>1 year) of pinaverium and Tong Xie Yao Fang for IBS treatment in a double-blind,
      randomized, and large sample size clinical trial using placebo as a control.
