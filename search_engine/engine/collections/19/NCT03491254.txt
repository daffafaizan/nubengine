      examinations within 2 weeks after the biliary drainage will enter the study and visit the
      study sites at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48. The follow-up duration is up to 48 weeks or until
      the death of patient during the study. The patients will be allocated to two groups based on
      whether being exposed to Huaier granule or not.

      Study data will be collected prospectively, including the patients' baseline characteristics,
      chemo-/radio-therapy history, previous Huaier granule treatment, laboratory tests, imaging
      examinations, and various clinical endpoints including liver function, quality of life,
      status of survival, and safety.

      This is a non-interventional study in patient population in real world. Therefore, the
      patients' treatment regimen will not be interfered, i.e., the patients will independently
      decide whether to take Huaier granule or not based on the recommendation from the clinician
      after the drainage. The patients will be allocated into different groups completely according
      to their treatment at clinic in real world. During the study, only the study required data
      and endpoints will be collected.
