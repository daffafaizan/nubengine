      for 6 months and the other half to receive placebo. Neither the subject nor the investigator
      will know which drug the subject is receiving, although this information will be available in
      case of emergency. It is anticipated that all subjects will have the choice to receive
      creatine after the 6 months study in an open-label study for an additional 12 months. A total
      of 114 patients will participate at 15 centers. Approximately 8 subjects will be enrolled at
      the Washington University.

      The effectiveness of creatine will be determined first by assessing any changes in strength
      in the arms and second by changes in grip strength, functional activities, electromyography
      changes or changes of the level of SOH 2'dG in the urine.
