      Primary

        -  Compare the overall objective response rate in postmenopausal women with estrogen
           receptor (ER)- and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, HER2/neu-overexpressing stage
           IV breast cancer treated with first-line therapy comprising fulvestrant and/or
           trastuzumab (Herceptin®).

      Secondary

        -  Compare the duration of response in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the antitumor activity of these regimens, in terms of time to disease
           progression, in these patients.

        -  Compare the clinical benefit of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Correlate HER2/neu expression and ER and/or PR expression with response in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to prior adjuvant endocrine therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of course 1 and
           then on day 1 only in all subsequent courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8,
           15, and 22.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive fulvestrant as in arm I in combination with trastuzumab as in
           arm II.

      In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
