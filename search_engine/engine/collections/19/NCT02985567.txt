      who are determined to require a sedation procedure at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital
      (KKESH). There will be two parts to the consent process. Oral consent will be administered to
      subjects who are not undergoing eye pressure evaluation. These children have chloral hydrate
      sedation for imaging or other eye evaluations. For these children, we will prospectively
      monitor the success rate of chloral hydrate sedation such that a complete ophthalmic or
      imaging evaluation could be performed and will determine the proportion of adverse events
      that occur due to sedation including vomiting, respiratory distress or depression,
      alterations in vital signs beyond reference ranges for normal sleeping children, hypoxia with
      oxygen saturation <90%, and unplanned hospital admission. No testing will be performed for
      study purposes on these individuals.

      For children undergoing sedation who will have intraocular pressure measurements for clinical
      care purposes, we will perform additional eye pressure measurements as part of the research
      protocol. Written consent will be obtained to allow us to additionally measure their
      intraocular pressure as specified below.

      After recruitment and completion of informed consent procedures by parents, subjects' medical
      and ocular history will be reviewed by a study ophthalmologist and one of two pediatricians
      overseeing sedation procedures. Patients unable to undergo intraocular pressure measurement
      due to infection or ocular surface disease and those in whom chloral hydrate sedation is
      medically contraindicated will be excluded. Age, gender, diagnosis, current medications and
      surgical history will be recorded from the clinical chart for all subjects.
