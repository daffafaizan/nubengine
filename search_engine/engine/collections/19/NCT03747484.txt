    
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of FH-MCVA2TCR autologous T-cells.

      LYMPHODEPLETING CHEMOTHERAPY: Between 2-7 days prior to receiving FH-MCVA2TCR T-cells,
      patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and cyclophosphamide for 3
      days.

      Patients receive FH-MCVA2TCR T-cells IV over 60-120 minutes. Patients also receive standard
      of care avelumab IV over 1 hour every 2 weeks for 1 year or pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes
      every 3 weeks for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with partial response or stable disease may then receive an additional cycle of
      FH-MCVA2TCR T-cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 15
      years.
