        -  To investigate the relationship between fatigue severity; protein biomarkers; and
           measures of activity, sleep, mood, and cognition in breast cancer survivors.

        -  To identify and quantify serum biomarkers and underlying biological pathways unique to
           cancer-related fatigue syndrome in these survivors.

        -  To map changes over time in order to explore the inter-relationships between these
           variables.

      OUTLINE: Participants undergo fatigue assessment by the Diagnostic Interview for Cancer
      Related Fatigue and the FACT-Fatigue questionnaire; psychological symptoms assessment by the
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the
      Insomnia Severity Index questionnaires; and quality of life assessment by the EORTC-QLQc30
      and EORTC-QLQ-BR23 questionnaires twice approximately 3 months apart.

      Participants also undergo activity level, circadian rhythm, and sleep measurements by the
      Micro-mini® Motionlogger actigraphy and measurement of cognitive disturbances by the
      Cantabeclipse™ technology.

      Participants undergo blood sample collection for protein analysis by 2D gel electrophoresis
      and mass spectrometry.
