      poorly to current therapies in a small minority of compliant patients. The goal of this
      investigator-initiated study is to determine whether intrathecal administration of clonidine
      reduces blood pressure in hypertensive patients, focusing on a group who often achieve
      inadequate blood pressure control with multiple drug therapy.

      After consent, pts will be screened and if qualified brought into center and intrathecal
      injection of clonidine given. Patients will be closely monitored for 4 hours, while data is
      collected.
