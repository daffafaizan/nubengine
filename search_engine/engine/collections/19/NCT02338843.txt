      underlying cause such as septic shock, inflammation due to trauma, or severe drug reactions.
      When these conditions occur, most patients will respond to either volume expansion or
      vasopressor treatment. However, some patients will require excessive doses of vasopressors
      and will be deemed to be resistant.

      Angiotensin II is a peptide hormone naturally produced by the body that regulates blood
      pressure via vasoconstriction and sodium reabsorption. LJPC-501 (angiotensin II) is being
      developed for the treatment of patients with catecholamine-resistant hypotension (CRH).

      This is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adult patients with
      CRH, who are hospitalized in an ICU setting, may be eligible to participate. Approximately
      315 patients will be enrolled.
