      will have a dose escalation and expansion. The dose escalation will identify the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of gedatolisib plus palbociclib/fulvestrant and
      gedatolisib plus palbociclib/letrozole. The expansion will estimate the objective response
      rate (OR) of the combination of gedatolisib plus palbociclib/letrozole and the combination of
      gedatolisib plus palbociclib/fulvestrant.
