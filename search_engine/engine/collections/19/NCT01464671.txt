    
      The purpose of this study is to compare in a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, 1:1
      fashion UFH versus bivalirudin in patients with stable angina pectoris or silent ischemia
      undergoing PCI.

      Secondary study endpoints will include:

        -  Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) comprising of all cause mortality, myocardial
           infarction (MI), ischemia driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), and cerebral
           vascular accident (CVA).

        -  Net adverse clinical events (NACE) will be consistent of MACE plus major bleeding as
           defined by the REPLCE-2 criteria.

        -  Cardiac death in-hospital and up to 30 days post discharge.

        -  MI in-hospital and up to 30 days post discharge.

        -  CVA in-hospital and up to 30 days post discharge.

        -  Incidence of all-cause mortality at 6 months and 1 year.

        -  MACE at 6 months and 1 year.

        -  Incidence of acute (0-24 hours post procedure) stent thrombosis rates.

        -  Incidence of sub-acute (24 hours - 30 days) stent thrombosis rates.

        -  Length of hospital stay (LOS)

        -  Economic analysis (total cost during hospitalization) and up to 30 days post discharge.
