      convincing evidence that extensive areas of radiographically-dense tissue in the breast is an
      independent risk factor for the development of breast cancer. Here, the investigators
      postulate that it is RANK ligand that mediates the association between breast density and
      risk of breast cancer for which progesterone is one of several factors that influence the
      availability of RANK ligand in mammary tissue to promote or sustain higher breast density. As
      such, the investigators hypothesize that inhibition of RANK ligand with the anti-RANK ligand
      antibody therapeutic agent denosumab will decrease breast density; a risk factor for breast
      cancer development. The investigators will test the primary hypothesis that RANK ligand
      inhibition by denosumab (Xgeva) given 120mg monthly to pre- and post-menopausal breast cancer
      patients will significantly decrease breast density over 6 months. Breast density will be
      assessed by magnetic resonance fat water imaging (MR-FW) of the breast. At the beginning of
      the study participants will be measured for a change in breast density by MRI between
      baseline 1 and baseline 2 (end of 3 months observation period). All patients will then
      receive 6 months of 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously every month with repeat MR imaging to
      obtain measurements after 6 months on denosumab. All participants will be asked to provide an
      optional core needle breast biopsy sample at baseline and after 6 months on denosumab.
