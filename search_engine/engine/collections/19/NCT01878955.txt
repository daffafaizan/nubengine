      diagnosed as PCOS according to the AES-Rotterdam criteria and 20 patients with multicystic
      ovarian structure but do not provide the PCOS-D3 criteria. The second purpose of this study
      is to investigate the mechanism that leads to the elevation of AMH in patients with PCOS, and
      to reveal the effects of intraovarian paracrine factors,insulin resistance and FSH /LH.
