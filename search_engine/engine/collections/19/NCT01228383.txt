    
      This study was designed to explore and obtain further safety and RVNA data on CL184 in
      comparison to HRIG and placebo as part of a classical post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
      regimen. This regimen will be applied as simulated PEP regimen to healthy subjects (i.e. in a
      pre-exposure setting) in this study. A comparison with placebo combined with each rabies
      vaccine was included to differentiate between the contribution of immune globulin and vaccine
      and to investigate potential interactions between immune globulin and vaccine. RVNA provided
      by CL184 or HRIG, as well as vaccination response will be checked regularly during the study
      and booster doses can be applied after the study, if necessary. In addition pharmacokinetic
      data will be collected.
