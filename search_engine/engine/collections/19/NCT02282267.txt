      EGFR-TKI as first line therapy. Meanwhile, this study was also proposed to explore the best
      intervention time of anti-resistant drugs (such as AZD 9291, a T790M inhibitor) through the
      quantitative and dynamic analysis of EGFR sensitive and resistant mutation in plasma cf-DNA
      during EGFR-TKI treatment process.
