      administrations of vitamin K antagonists when these drugs were temporarily interrupted and
      thus keep the time of an increased risk of thromboembolism and duration of "bridging" at a
      minimum. The control group will consist of patients who resume vitamin K antagonists at their
      usual maintenance dose. The aim of the study is to establish how to best restart
      anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists after temporal withdrawal of these drugs. The main
      outcome parameter will be the proportion of patients who are back to a therapeutic
      international normalized ratio (INR) ratio at certain days after restarting vitamin K
      antagonists. Two additional parameters will be evaluated: Firstly, bleeding and
      thromboembolic complications will be reported and secondly, a possible prothrombotic state,
      measured as an elevation of D-dimer, at the initiation of anticoagulation will be evaluated.
