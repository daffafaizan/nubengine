      occurring hormone, erythropoietin (EPO), is able to protect various neuronal tissues from
      ischemic injury and is beneficial in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. Lu AA24493 is a
      modified (carbamylated) version of EPO, neuroprotective but without the haematopoietic side
      effects. Lu AA24493 is developed for treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke.
