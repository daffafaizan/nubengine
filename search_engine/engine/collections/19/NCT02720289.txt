      however, there is limited research identifying an optimal teaching method.

      Social learning teaching methods are beneficial in promoting health-behavior change. The
      social learning theory hypothesizes that people learn and change their behavior by
      observation and modeling. The video used in the social learning method shows parents as role
      models methodically teaching proper car seat installation in a vehicle.

      Traditionally, child passenger safety education classes are didactic in design, relying on
      lecture formats and live demonstrations. The didactic method includes verbal instructions
      from a child passenger safety technician about car seat installation.
