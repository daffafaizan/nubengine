      experiences of residents, have been in real operative settings on living patients. We propose
      a study to demonstrate that - a low-fidelity simulation of an aorta-proximal vein graft
      anastomosis as in heart bypass surgery, using anatomical replicates (a special hydrogel
      polymer with properties similar to human vascular tissue) - is an effective, low-cost
      simulator for learning this surgical skill, and will provide the trainee with the ability to
      perform a better anastomosis in a shorter period of time.

      Hypothesis: Practicing an aorto-saphenous vein anastomosis on a low-fidelity surgical
      simulator will advance the trainees' learning curve. This will allow trainees to produce a
      higher quality anastomosis in a shorter period of time, than a group that only learns by
      watching a video and will lead to enhanced patient safety.
