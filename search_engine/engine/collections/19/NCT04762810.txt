      years. Patients with this disease respond well to glucocorticoid therapy, so you need to take
      glucocorticoid medication once the diagnosis is established. In addition, most patients need
      to use immunosuppressants when taking glucocorticoids. At present, the most commonly used
      immunosuppressants in the world are cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate and
      mycophoranate, etc. The function of the above drugs is to improve the disorder of the immune
      system function, in order to restore the normal immune state, so that the inflammation and
      swelling of the affected organs disappear, restore the normal function. It should be
      emphasized that if the use of hormones and immunosuppressant is not standard or stopped too
      early, it can lead to disease recurrence. Therefore, after the disease is under control,
      long-term adherence to medication is needed to maintain a stable state of the disease.

      At present, there is no clear treatment guideline for idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis in
      the world, and the addition of immunosuppressant is also out of debate. Therefore, a
      comprehensive evaluation of its pathogenesis, clinical characteristics and treatment response
      is needed.
