    
      Neratinib is a potent, irreversible, small molecule panErbB inhibitor of EGFR, HER2 and HER4
      tyrosine kinases. Its activity prevents the autophosphorylation of HER2 and thus halts the
      downstream activation of this key proliferative pathway in tumors dependent on HER2
      overexpression or EGFR activation. It has shown promising clinical activity in women with
      HER2+ stage 2 and 3 breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting (I-SPY 2 TRIAL) and in women
      with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, although evaluation in larger phase 3 trials is
      required to confirm these results.

      The rationale for this study is to determine the feasibility of adding neratinib to a taxane
      based chemotherapy and the approved HER2 antagonists, trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

      The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability and recommended dose of daily neratinib
      in combination with weekly paclitaxel, trastuzumab and tri-weekly pertuzumab in patients with
      HER2+ advanced or metastatic disease and, if successful, determine an optimal dose to move
      into phase II/III testing of this combination in the neoadjuvant setting.
