    
      Background

      -NCI-Frederick scientists performing in vitro studies involving human specimens have a need
      for a reliable and consistent source of samples which protects the donor from research risks.

      Objective

      -The purpose of this protocol is to establish a centralized repository for the collection and
      distribution of samples (either blood, buccal mucosal cells, semen, urine, or nail clippings)
      from paid, healthy volunteer donors for in vitro research conducted by NIH investigators
      located at NCI-Frederick and Ft. Detrick. Research will include, but are not limited to,
      genotype analysis, immune function studies, drug screening, vaccine development, method
      development, quality control testing of reagents, and propagation of infectious agents,
      including HIV.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy NCI-Frederick employees and other NIH staff located at Ft. Detrick will be recruited.
      Potential donors will be excluded if screening indicates exposure to HIV, HTLV, Hepatitis C
      or Hepatitis B virus infection.

      Study Design:

      Investigators requesting to participate to the Research Donor Program (RDP) by receiving
      samples for research use will be required to submit a written memo of request, briefly
      describing the nature of the research and providing assurance that samples provided through
      this protocol will be used solely for in vitro research.

      These Investigators will receive samples that will be either anonymous or coded, depending on
      the specific need.

      Codes will be securely maintained and under no circumstances will donor identity be released
      to Investigators.

      Donors will receive financial compensation for their time, discomfort and inconvenience
      according to an established schedule; compensation for blood donation is based on the volume
      donated.
