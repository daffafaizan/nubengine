      I. To evaluate changes in objective physical exam findings from baseline to the end of
      radiation and through two years follow-up for women with pelvic cancer.

      II. To examine changes in sexual, relational and quality of life outcomes from baseline to
      the end of radiation and through one year follow-up for women with pelvic cancer using the
      patient reported outcome measures.

      III. To compare physical exam and patient-reported outcome trajectories over time.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard of care pelvic exam at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 month
      follow ups. Patients also complete patient reported outcome measures at baseline and 1, 3, 6,
      12, 18, and 12 month follow ups.
