      pre-operative

      Currently there are two surgical procedures for the treatment of chronic low back pain:
      Spinal fusion and Total Disc Replacement. CAdisc™-L(Compliant Artificial disc - Lumbar) is a
      Lumbar total disc replacement product that preserves motion and restores disc height and
      stability

      Surgical access is via a routine anterior approach with discectomy (removal of the diseased
      disc), which is performed prior to implantation of the CAdisc™-L. Instruments are then used
      to prepare the disc space and to controllably place the replacement disc at the target point.
      It is not intended for the surgery to differ in type, duration or risk to any other device of
      this nature.
