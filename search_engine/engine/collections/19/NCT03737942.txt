      clinical findings which require attention during anesthesia. Partial degeneration or
      segmental demyelination of the nerve fibers and loss of motor units have been reported in
      patients with diabetes mellitus as well. Therefore, the effects of a neuromuscular blocking
      agent should be important because of potential complications from incomplete reversal or
      residual paralysis during anesthesia maintenance. In a series of studies, vecuronium has been
      the only agent investigated in patients with diabetes mellitus and other diseases
      characterized by neuromuscular dysfunction. Delayed recovery from the neuromuscular block
      after vecuronium administration was shown in patients with diabetes mellitus. Currently,
      rocuronium, with its rapid onset of action, rapid recovery profile and inactive metabolites,
      is generally known as a safe agent for anesthesia under normal conditions. It is known that
      the pharmacokinetic properties of rocuronium can be altered in some diseases, such as renal
      or hepatic failure. However, it has not been investigated whether the effect of rocuronium on
      neuromuscular function is changed in the presence of neuropathy in diabetes mellitus patients
      or not. The rationale of our study arises from the finding of many studies that show
      different changes in the neurophysiological parameters in diabetes mellitus. In diabetic
      nerve, the conduction velocity of the action potential is decreased, the amplitude of action
      potentials, both sensory and motor, is smaller, and the latency time is elongated.
