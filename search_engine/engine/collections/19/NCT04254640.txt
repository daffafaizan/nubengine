      benefit-risk ratio for longterm survival in elderly or unfit AML patients.Previous studies
      revealed that the standard dose of CAG regimen consisting of low-dose cytarabine and
      aclarubicin in combination with granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) priming as an
      induction therapy was well-tolerated by patients and led to a complete remission (CR) rate of
      50.0% in patients aged≥ 70 years. Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine ) is a nucleoside
      analogue of anti-adenosine deaminase that has extensive antitumor activity in hematological
      tumor.The purine analog 2-CdA increases the uptake of Ara-C and the accumulation of its
      active cytotoxic metabolite 5α-triphosphate Ara-C (Ara-CTP) in leukemia cells. This finding
      suggests that synergy occurs between cladribine and cytarabine. In this study, the
      investigators conducted a phase II trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of cladribine
      in combination with modified CAG regimen (low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin) in unfit
      patients with AML.Patients will receive C-CAG regimen as follows: cladribine 5 mg/m2, d1-5;
      G-CSF 300 µg, d0-9; aclarubicin 10 mg, d3-6; cytarabine 10mg/ m2 q12h, SC, d3-9; 4 weeks per
      cycle. The participants are permitted to quit the study if complete remission (CR) was not
      achieved after two courses of chemotherapy.The participants will be treated for a total of
      six cycles unless disease progression or unacceptable side effects are observed or
      participants withdrew their consent.
