      concomitantly with calcium. A number of recent studies suggest, however, that this important
      nutrient may play a significant role in many pathophysiological processes, including diabetes
      mellitus. With the prevalence of diabetes mellitus ever increasing, novel mechanisms for
      controlling blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c are being sought to help prevent the costly and
      debilitating complications of this chronic disease.
