      Despite widespread use of digitalis and its availability for nearly two centuries,
      uncertainty surrounded the appropriateness of its role and value in treating congestive heart
      failure patients in sinus rhythm. The study was a multicenter collaborative effort with the
      Department of Veteran Affairs Cooperative Studies Program which provided support for a data
      coordinating center and a pharmacy coordinating center.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind, simple, multicenter, international trial with 186 centers in the
      United States and 116 in Canada. In the main trial, patients with left ventricular ejection
      fractions of 0.45 or less were randomly assigned to digoxin (3397 patients) or placebo (3403
      patients) in addition to diuretics and ACE inhibitors. In an ancillary trial of patients with
      ejection fractions greater than 0.45, 492 patients were randomly assigned to digoxin and 496
      to placebo. Patients were recruited over a three-year period at the 302 centers and followed
      for a minimum of two years. Patient enrollment began in February 1991 and ended in September
      1993. Follow-up ended in December 1995. The main results paper was published in 1997.

      Three substudies were conducted. The quality of life/6-minute walk test substudy determined
      the effect of treatment on a patient's well-being, daily activities, and functional status.
      The Holter/signal averaging electrocardiogram substudy examined the pathophysiology of sudden
      cardiac death. The neurohormonal substudy determined whether long-term administration of
      digoxin attenuated the neuroendocrine response in patients with heart failure.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "Completed Date"
