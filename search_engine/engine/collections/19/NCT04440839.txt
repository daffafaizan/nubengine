      peripheral artery disease and diabetes are given the option to be seen by specialty care
      providers through telemedicine vs. normal standard in person referral. The study is being
      conducted in rural areas where there are no in person vascular surgery providers. The aim of
      the study is to determine if patient activation affects likelihood to use telemedicine and if
      use of telemedicine can expedite speciality care.
