      goniometric gloves in measuring finger joint movement in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

      We will use questionnaires to assess pain, stiffness and disability. We will be using an
      inner disposable glove worn under the electronic goniometric gloves as this will be important
      for infection control in clinical use.

      We will calibrate the electronic goniometric gloves using wooden blocks at predefined angles
      using our own software calibration process to optimise the accuracy of the glove for the
      individual patient.

      The patient will flex and extend their fingers repeatedly to get measurements of the minimum
      and maximum angle of flexion in their joints. During these movements we will also capture the
      dynamic characteristics of movement such as maximum velocity. In this study a laptop will be
      used to capture and record all of the measurements from the electronic goniometric glove and
      record the time at which the measurements were taken.

      Each electronic goniometric glove will be refitted for a second set of tests to assess
      variability due to the fitting process. We will record a full set of data from each set of
      movements for later analysis.

      Finally, we will assess usability and establish if patients have a preference between the two
      electronic goniometric gloves.
