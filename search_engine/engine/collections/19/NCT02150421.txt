      e-books or tablet computers have been introduced at some local primary and secondary schools
      and have been provided for their students during studying at school and at home. Parents and
      teachers' utmost concern are adverse effects on eye-sight of children, especially the higher
      progression rate in myopia and the visual discomfort which may be caused by the e-book
      technology.

      This is a prospective cohort study to determine if implementation of electronic devices for
      teaching promotes myopia development and progression and affects visual function in primary
      schoolchildren.

      The schools will introduce e-books to their students in some classes. Signed informed consent
      letters from parents will be obtained prior to subject recruitment and data collection. Eye
      examination and data collection will be conducted in primary school campus. The children from
      two local primary schools in same grade will be assigned into two groups by their schools.
      One group will use e-books (e-book group) to study course materials assigned by their
      teachers whereas another group will use ordinary textbooks (control group). Their refractive
      errors, axial length (AXL) and binocular functions will be measured and monitored at
      six-month intervals for a maximum of 2 years.
