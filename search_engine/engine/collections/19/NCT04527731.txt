      The recruitment of pregnant women (N=30) in the first or second trimester (until week 23)
      will be realized over different channels (e.g, local newspapers, facebook, and leaflets in
      gynecological practices, shopping centers, and nurseries).

      Informed consent consists of: (i) activity recording over seven consecutive days using an
      accelerometer, (ii) completion of standardized questionnaires, (iii) participation in a
      cardiac ultrasound examination in the German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK) -
      examination center.

      Participants are asked to wear an accelerometer at daytime, and over seven consecutive days,
      in trimester 1 (week 9-12), trimester 2 (week 23-26), and trimester 3 (week 36-39). Women who
      are attended the study in the first trimester wear the device up to three time whereas those
      who are attended the study in their second trimester wear the device up to twice. At the end
      of each measurement period women are invited to fill in a self-administered questionnaire.
      Also they are invited to participate in a cardiac ultrasound examination. Optionally,
      participants may receive feedback on their physical activity measured by accelerometer as
      well as about results of cardiac ultrasound examination upon completion of the study.
