      significantly, young children in the developing world, there is no licensed vaccine against
      Shigella. The rationale for using Shigella flexneri 2a whole cell killed vaccine (Sf2aWC), is
      that it is expected to be especially well tolerated by subjects. This is a single site,
      2a/2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study in healthy adult subjects.
      Approximately 72 subjects will be enrolled into one of three vaccination groups: Sf2aWC 1011
      Sf2aWC cells plus 10 Âµg dmLT (Group 1, n=24), 1011 Sf2WC cells alone (Group 2, n=24); or
      placebo (Group 4, n=24). The placebo preparation will be bicarbonate buffer.

      After the vaccination phase subjects will be admitted by cohort on day 84 to an inpatient
      facility for 12 days to undergo challenge with approximately 1500 colony forming units (CFU)
      of wild type S. flexneri 2a strain 2457T (administered with NaHCO3 buffer). After 5 days of
      observation for clinical endpoints (or earlier and within 12 hours if they meet the
      definition of moderate-to-severe shigellosis as defined in the primary endpoints section
      below), subjects will receive a 5-day course of orally administered ciprofloxacin.

      The primary objective of this study are to 1) evaluate, the safety and reactogenicity of 3
      oral sequential doses of Sf2aWC with or without dmLT, 2) To measure the protective efficacy
      of 3 spaced doses of high-dose Sf2aWC vaccine with and without dmLT against
      moderate-to-severe shigellosis following experimental oral challenge with wild-type S.
