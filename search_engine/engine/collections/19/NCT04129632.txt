      Burnout intensity in a Cross-Sectional Cohort of Colorado Health Care Practitioners Author:
      Doug Duffee MD, Mdiv, FACP, Attending Physician Parkview Internal Medicine Residency Program,
      Pueblo Colorado 2019 Intro: The problem of physician burnout has been well documented. As
      health care providers (HCP) encounter the demands and resources of a rapidly changing health
      care system, navigate their place and performance within it, deal with the demands of an
      internet informed patient populace and balance daily work load with family life, stressors
      arise. These stressors can contribute to burnout and this burnout has both interpersonal and
      health care system wide effects. Studies have shown that HCP burnout has personal physiologic
      consequences and predicts external objective associations with health care acquired infection
      rates, medical errors, medical litigation, patient satisfaction, job satisfaction, health
      care system costs, alcohol abuse and suicidal ideation, among others. As our population ages
      and its medical co-morbidities and system demands increase, the premature curtailing,
      cessation or turnover of an HCP's clinical practice due to emotional exhaustion is a
      concerning trend. While studies have shown that HCP's are no more prone to burnout then other
      professionals, a growing body of literature has shown that an intentional focus on
      institutional processes that nurture clinician well-being through multiple modalities is both
      important and effective. Additionally, insights into the role that forgiveness plays in
      personal well-being prompts our presentation of a novel mindfulness tool that focuses on
      improving clinician well-being through self-help exercises in meditation and forgiveness. In
      light of recent studies that have cautioned against the tendency to dichotomize and/or
      pathologize peoples' responses to their work environment, we will use the JD-R (Job
      demands-resources model) and the CBI (Copenhagen burnout inventory) to quantify these
      processes and responses. These factors have prompted us to present a unique study design a)
      to evaluate the wellness process affecters inside the culture of a regional health care
      center and b) to evaluate the effectiveness of a personal mindfulness intervention which aims
      at spectrum based burnout quantification and facilitated self-help, with an eye on both for
      institution wide application.

      Aims and Objectives: Using the Health Care Provider Wellness Assessment as quantified through
      the revised Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R), the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI)
      (20)and a novel mindfulness tool called "Psalm 19: Insights and Exercises in Personal
      Forgiveness", we propose to 1) Identify unique institutional job demands-resources whose
      presence-absence contribute to HCP strain and subsequent health impairment and 2) Assess the
      ability of said novel mindfulness tool as a personal job resource component to positively
      affect well-being and subsequent job motivation amongst a cohort of Colorado health care
      providers at a regional medical center. As beneficial process effectors are identified
      (more/better/culturally focused resources, less/better efficiency demands) , multi-factorial
      interventions on wellness outcomes can subsequently be studied and implemented.
