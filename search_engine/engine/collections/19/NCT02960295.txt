      weight, and presence of fetal heart activity. The treatment of GDM additionally requires the
      measurement of and review of maternal glycemia. Technology exists for patients to measure
      these parameters and to relay this information securely directly from these devices via the
      internet to the healthcare provider's office. A key element of antepartum care for GDM,
      self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), has for some years been conducted with memory-based
      portable glucose meters. To assure accuracy in reports of patient measurements, it is
      important that all devices be of a design wherein results of measures of patient parameters
      are transmitted in unedited fashion directly devices to the health care provider. While no
      data exists about the accuracy of self-reporting of patient weight and blood pressure,
      intentional or unintentional alteration in reports of self-monitored glucose results is a
      known risk of reliance on patient self-reported data. This pilot study will explore the
      feasibility of the use of this technology from patients' homes in lieu of an office visit.
