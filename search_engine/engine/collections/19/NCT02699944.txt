      treatment of patients with heart failure (HF). This therapy, also known as biventricular
      pacing, utilizes pacemaker leads to synchronize the contraction of the walls within the left
      ventricle (LV) and the contraction of the left and right ventricles. Many randomized trials
      have conclusively demonstrated that CRT improves symptoms, LV structure and function,
      hospitalization rates, and survival in appropriately selected HF patients. Nonetheless,
      approximately 30% of CRT patients will be "non-responders" because they will not demonstrate
      the expected clinical and/or echocardiographic improvement following therapy. A critical
      component of assessing CRT efficacy during the optimization clinic will be the use of a novel
      method of body surface electrocardiographic mapping under development by Medtronic, called
      the ECG Vest. In this proposal, we describe a research study to assess the potential benefit
      of using the ECG Vest as part of a CRT optimization strategy on clinical and
      echocardiographic outcomes (heart size and function) of patients receiving standard clinical
      care in the UHVC CRT Optimization Clinic.
