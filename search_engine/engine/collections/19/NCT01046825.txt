    
      1. This study will perform analysis of newly diagnosed mature B-cell lymphomas (e.g.
           Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, DLBCL, and MLBCL) obtained from participants in different
           parts of the world.

        2. This study will describe the types and frequency of mutations in the ARF-HDM2-TP53
           pathway, in B-cell lymphomas in the United States and that found in selected geographic
           regions of the world.

        3. This study will describe the expression of ARF-HDM2-TP53 and PUMA-associated pathways in
           B-cell lymphomas in the United States and that found in B-cell lymphomas of other
           selected geographic regions of the world.

        4. This study will describe the pattern and frequency of XLP gene mutations presenting with
           B-cell lymphomas in the United States and selected geographic regions.

        5. This study will describe the frequency of EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas in the United
           States and selected geographic regions of the world: and will describe the pattern of
           EBV protein and gene expression (e.g., EBNA 3) in EBV-positive lymphomas and the study
           will compare patterns of EBV protein and gene expression with clinical, laboratory and
           outcome data.

      Secondary Objective:

      To estimate the complete response rate, event-free survival, and overall survival rates in
      patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Burkitt leukemia/B-cell acute leukemia (B-ALL) and
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with a stage-adapted regimen based on the St.
      Jude B-cell II protocol.
