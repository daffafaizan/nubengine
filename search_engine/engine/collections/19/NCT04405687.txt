      limitations of the existing management and treatment of severe burn injuries. Investigation
      of the factors affecting the recovery and patients' return to the community in patients with
      severe burn injury may lead to effective amendments of the existing management, and thus
      aiding in the development of an integrated diagnosis and treatment guidelines.
