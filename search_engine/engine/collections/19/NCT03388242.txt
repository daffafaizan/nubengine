      expression and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine protein expression. The
      differences in microRNA and protein expression among the three groups, especially between the
      control and MCI, will be analyzed. This information will be used to construct a kit that can
      contain probes to detect a few microRNAs or proteins. This kit will be used in another set of
      patients to check its sensitivity and specificity. The first set of patients will also be
      followed up every 6 months for up to 1.5 years. Blood samples will be harvested during the
      follow-ups. The changes in microRNAs and proteins will be correlated with the changes of
      cognition. This information will be used for constructing the kit as well.
