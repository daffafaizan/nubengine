    
      Assessment of social and neurocognitive functioning in survivors of pediatric brain tumors
      who are least two years post-therapy and between 8 and 12 years of age will be included.
      Participants will be recruited from two tumor types: 1) medulloblastoma, and 2) other brain
      tumors that were not treated with craniospinal irradiation. Upon enrollment, participants
      will complete standard psychological questionnaires used to evaluate both performance-based
      and self-report measures of social and neurocognitive functioning. Parents will complete
      questionnaires. Families will be asked for permission to contact teachers to complete
      additional questionnaires. Children will identify their best friend as part of their
      questionnaires and will be asked permission to contact this friend to complete two
      questionnaires. Finally, children will be asked to complete an online daily diary of social
      interactions for seven days.
