      Nervous System (CNS). Acute optic neuritis is a common symptom of MS and is considered to
      have the same pathogenesis as MS, where autoimmune and inflammatory mechanisms lead to the
      progression of MS.

      Statins reduce the cholesterol in blood and in addition have anti-inflammatory effects. From
      experimental data and results from pilot projects there is evidence that the statins perform
      anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory effects and one can expect a beneficial outcome in
      the autoimmune inflammatory diseases after the treatment with statins.
