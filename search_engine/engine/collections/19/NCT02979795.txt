      the degree of response varies among patients. There are approximately 40-60% of LARC patients
      treated with CCRT achieve some degree of pathologic response. However, there is yet an
      effective method before the commencement of CCRT that can predict how patients will respond
      to CCRT and can subsequently render better survival. Identify patents who will benefit most
      from CCRT is crucial not only in lowering treatment-related morbidity and sustaining local
      control but also to improve survival rate in LARC.
