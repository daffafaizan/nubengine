      of two groups: 1) access to the 4-week TAVIEenM@RCHE intervention with an additional
      "booster" at 8 weeks (experimental group) or 2) access to a list of publicly available
      websites (control group). Participants will be included if they report insufficient levels of
      physical activity prior hospitalization, and they have no serious medical conditions impeding
      adherence to moderate-intensity physical activity. Data collection will occur at recruitment
      (in-hospital), at baseline (home 3 weeks post-hospital discharge), and at 5 and 12 weeks post
      baseline. The data analysis will be consistent with intention-to-treat principles. Baseline
      characteristics will be compared using descriptive statistics to identify trends in group
      imbalances. For the analysis of the primary outcome of change in steps per day between
      baseline and 12 weeks, and the secondary outcome of change in steps per day between baseline
      and 5 weeks, a repeated measures ANCOVA model will compare the adjusted differences between
      the experimental and control groups at a significance of 0.05. For the analysis of the two
      secondary outcomes of change in energy expenditure in walking and in moderate-intensity
      physical activity between baseline and 5 weeks, and between baseline and 12 weeks, a repeated
      measures MANCOVA model will compare the adjusted differences between the experimental and
      control groups at a significance of 0.05.
