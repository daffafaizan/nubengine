      admitted to the emergency room of the University Hospital RWTH Aachen with an unclear
      impairment of consciousness. Only patients who later on were diagnosed as having experienced
      a GTCS or a syncope and whose serum lactate concentrations had been measured within 2 hours
      after the event were enrolled in the study. The investigators compared the specificity and
      sensitivity of the serum lactate concentrations at admission with the CK concentration at
      admission and the CK follow-up taken 10 to 48 hours after the event.

      The values at admission were compared between patients from whom a blood sample was collected
      within 60 minutes after the event, and those from whom a blood sample was collected within
      61-120 minutes after the event.

      The comparison of initial lactate concentrations at admission with CK levels 10 - 48 hours
      later could only be performed on part of the patient collective because the other patients
      were already discharged at this time-point and could therefore not be included.

      The initial blood samples were taken at patient arrival in the emergency room. The follow up
      was performed during the inpatient stay.

      Serum lactate and CK concentrations between patient groups were statistically compared with a
      Mann-Whitney-U test. We defined cut-off values and their sensitivity and specificity by
      Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis.
