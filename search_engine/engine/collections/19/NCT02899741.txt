      will be fully assessed on the enrollment, and then seizure frequency will be counted for
      three months without changing medication. After three months, Omega-3 will be administered
      for next three months. Seizure frequency, questionnaires evaluating mood and QOL, and adverse
      events are evaluated at each visit.
