      amphotericin B (CAB) in the treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised
      patients. II. Compare the efficacy, safety, and toleration of voriconazole versus CAB
      followed by other antifungal therapy in the treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis in
      immunocompromised patients. III. Compare survival in patients treated with voriconazole
      versus CAB with or without other antifungal therapy. IV. Investigate resource utilization in
      patients treated with voriconazole versus CAB with or without other antifungal therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to center, site of infection, underlying disease, and baseline neutrophil count.
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive voriconazole IV
      every 12 hours for 7-28 days and continue with oral voriconazole twice a day for a maximum
      total duration of 12 weeks of therapy. Arm II: Patients receive intravenous amphotericin B
      daily for at least 2 weeks; treatment continues for a maximum of 12 weeks. Patients
      discontinued from study drug treatment because of toxicity, intolerance or clinical failure
      may receive alternative (nonstudy) antifungal therapy. All patients are monitored for a total
      of 16 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A sufficient number of patients will be accrued so that 212 patients (106
      per study arm) will be eligible for the study.
