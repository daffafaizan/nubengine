    
      Specific Aim 1: To assess first-pass SNR and CNR of pulmonary MR angiography performed with
      0.03 mmol/Kg of intravenous gadofosveset trisodium.

      Hypothesis: Use of 0.03 mmol/Kg of gadofosveset trisodium in gradient recalled echo pulmonary
      MR angiography will provide a pulmonary artery SNR and CNR equal to or better than the SNR
      and CNR obtained using the same MR technique with 0.2 mmol/Kg of a conventional contrast
      agent (gadopentetate dimeglumine) and equal to or better than 0.1 mmol/Kg of intravenous
      gadobenate dimeglumine. Data will be compared to SNR and CNR of pulmonary MR angiogram images
      obtained at Washington University as part of the PIOPED III study.

      Specific Aim 2: To assess SNR and CNR of breath-hold pulmonary MR imaging obtained
      immediately after the original first-pass breath-hold pulmonary MR angiography.

      Hypothesis: SNR and CNR of pulmonary MR angiography performed immediately after first-pass
      breath-hold pulmonary MR angiography will be at least equal to the SNR and CNR obtained using
      the same MR technique with 0.2 mmol/Kg of a conventional contrast agent (gadopentetate
      dimeglumine) and at least equal to 0.1 mmol/Kg of intravenous gadobenate dimeglumine.

      Specific Aim 3: To assess SNR and CNR of lower extremity MR venogram (MRV) performed
      immediately after the two pulmonary MR angiograms, described above.

      Hypothesis: SNR and CNR of passive lower extremity MRV performed after pulmonary MR
      angiography will be equal to or better than the SNR and CNR obtained using the same passive
      MRV technique with 0.2 mmol/Kg of a conventional contrast agent or 0.1 mmol/Kg of gadobenate
      dimeglumine. Again, data will be compared to SNR and CNR of lower extremity
