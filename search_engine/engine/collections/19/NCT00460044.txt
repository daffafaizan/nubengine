      lungs. In addition, NO is an important mediator of vascular smooth muscle relaxation,
      ventilation perfusion matching, neurotransmission and host defence and bacteriostasis.
      Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous derivative of arginine that inhibits NOS
      and thereby the bioavailability of NO. Preterm infants have increased concentrations of ADMA.
      Therefore, inhibition of NO by increased concentrations of ADMA which could be associated
      with reduced pulmonary functioning.
