      severe acute respiratory failure (ARF), which may have a poor prognosis. A severe hypoxemia
      is associated with preserved respiratory mechanical properties, in particular the pulmonary
      system compliance.

      The hypoxia during the early phase seems to mainly result from an important
      ventilation/perfusion (VA/Q) mismatch associated with an altered pulmonary vasoconstriction.
      The "protective" mechanism called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) normally reduces
      the blood flow in poorly or non-ventilated areas towards aerated zones leading to reduce the
      (VA/Q) mismatch. HPV seems poorly functional in COVID-19 severe patients in absence of "cor
      pulmonale".

      According to the French National agency for Drug Security (ANSM, Paris, France), only iv
      almitrine is indicated for hypoxic acute respiratory failure as Drug of Major Therapeutic
      Interest. This molecule is a routine option in the treatment strategy of severe hypoxemia.

      The investigators studied COVID-19 patients mechanically ventilated at FiO2 1 with a severe
      intrapulmonary shunt during their early phase. The emergency conditions and the acute high
      inflow of patients to ICU impeded the design of a randomized control trial. To eliminate the
      eventuality of a spontaneous evolution of hypoxia, these patients will be compared with
      control-matched COVID patients treated conventionally.
