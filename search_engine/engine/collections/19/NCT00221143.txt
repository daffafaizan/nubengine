      atherosclerosis or vasculitis in leg arteries. Prognosis of chronic CLI is poor, and no
      effective treatments have been established in patients who are not eligible for the
      traditional revascularization therapies such as angioplasty and bypass procedures due to the
      inappropriate anatomy of the leg arteries or frequent reocclusion following
      revascularization. Therefore, it is necessary to establish novel revascularization treatment
      to improve prognosis of the no-option patients. We will study the safety and clinical
      efficiency of vascular regeneration by means of transplantation of autologous peripheral
      blood endothelial progenitor cells (CD34 positive cells) in patients with chronic CLI who are
      not eligible for traditional revascularization treatments. The primary endpoint is the
      primary efficacy score identified by toe brachial blood pressure index (TBPI), absolute
      claudication distance (ACD) and Wong Baker's pain rating scale, while the secondary endpoints
      are evaluation of safety, ankle brachial blood pressure index (ABPI), percutaneous tissue
      oxygen pressure (TcPO2), etc.
