    
      Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which a t (9;22)
      (q34;q11) reciprocal chromosomal translocation gives rise to Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and
      generates the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene encoding a constitutively activated protein tyrosine
      kinases (PTK). Tyrosine kinase Inibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, by blocking BCR-ABL1 kinase
      activity, selectively eradicate CML cells and induce durable responses and prolong survival.

      CML patients treated with TKI are monitored by BCR-ABL1 RT-qPCR (Reverse Transcription
      real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) performed from peripheral blood samples.

      A first multicenter study entitled STIM trial demonstrated that imatinib could be safely
      discontinued in patients with complete molecular remission (CMR) for at least 2 years
      (undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript by RT-qPCR).

      Around 40% of these patients remain in a prolonged treatment-free remission (TFR) after
      treatment cessation. All molecular relapsing patients were sensitive when imatinib was
      re-challenged.

      The purpose of this STIM-FU study is to follow all the patients included in the STIM trial in
      order to evaluate their molecular status, vital status and ongoing treatment in patient with
      a first molecular relapse.

      This long term follow up will allow us to predict if a constant long term control of the
      disease is possible and to better define the clinical and biological CML-related factors
      predictive for a molecular relapse after TKI discontinuation.
