      prescribing information for Edaravone. The decision to prescribe Edaravone to the
      participants should be made separately from the decision to enroll then in the study. There
      will be no randomized assignments to treatment and no restrictions on the use of commercially
      available medications (but those participating in an experimental study, even if taking
      Edaravone, will be excluded). No experimental treatment is evaluated in this study. The
      intervention is limited to the collection of blood and urine samples for biomarker testing.

      During the estimated study period, eligible patients who are prescribed Edaravone within the
      approved indication will be invited to participate in the study. An initial
      screening/baseline visit will be scheduled for participants who are considered for study
      participation.

      Participants in this study will be followed from enrollment up to 24 weeks after treatment
      initiation (6 treatment cycles [each cycle consisting of 28 days], corresponding to a
      treatment period of approximately 24 weeks) or premature study discontinuation. Throughout
      the study period, the investigators will record participant baseline and follow-up
      information and perform clinical and biomarker assessments.
