      required a well validated test of the dynamic cardiovascular response to an abrupt stimulus
      and considered the diving reflex the most reliable and practical. In man, the diving reflex
      acts as a vestigial reflex aimed at conserving oxygen storage during apnoeic facial
      immersion. Facial immersion activates a vagally-induced bradycardia and a sympathetically
      activated alpha-adrenergic peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension. There are two
      triggers of the diving reflex, facial immersion in water and breath hold, both of which can
      impact on heart rate attenuation. Facial immersion can be further delineated into exposure to
      cold, wetness and pressure.
