      unknown. Vaginal delivery is thought to induce a maternal inflammatory response. Though
      epidural analgesia during labor was found to significantly influence peripartum maternal and
      newborn interleukin concentrations, these studies did not address at what stage epidural
      analgesia was performed. Preemptive analgesia has been found to be associated with attenuated
      proinflammatory cytokines, at least in the postoperative period.

      Healthy ASA I term parturients (>37 weeks) being accepted into delivery ward and wanting
      epidural analgesia will be studied.

      Parturients will be divided into two groups:

        -  Group I- those who have painless contractions awaiting augmentation of labor.

        -  Group II- parturients with cervical dilatation and painful labor (VAS >5).

      Parturients in Group I will be given epidural analgesia immediately upon arrival in the labor
      ward before onset of painful contractions (VAS<3). Parturients in Group 2 will be given
      epidural analgesia as soon as possible.

      Epidural analgesia protocol will be identical for both groups: graduated doses of bupivicaine
      0.1% 15cc and 100 mcg fentanyl followed by patient controlled analgesia at a concentration of
      bupivicaine 0.1% and fentanyl 2 mcg/cc delivered at 10cc per hour with possible boluses of 5
      cc every ten minutes.

      Maternal serum will be drawn before epidural insertion and 18-24 hours after delivery.
      Placental blood will be drawn after delivery.

      These blood sample will be assessed for IL-1Beta, TNF alpha, IL-1ra, IL-2, Il-6, IL-8, IL-10,
      IL-18.

      The patient's chart will be prospectively analyzed for demographic information about
      parturient and complications and progress of labor.
