    
      Sequential randomized, multicenter, active comparator study to evaluate the hypothesis that
      rNAPc2, a novel, potent and highly selective tissue factor inhibitor with anticoagulant,
      anti-inflammatory and potential antiviral properties, shortens time to recovery compared to
      heparin in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels. Study
      participants and Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) members assessing the clinical endpoints
      will be blinded to treatment assignment. The protocol comprises sequential Phase 2b and Phase
      3 studies. Analysis of Phase 2b data could lead to study discontinuation, adjustment of
      eligibility criteria or sample size, and will inform the rNAPc2 dose level to be studied in
      Phase 3.
