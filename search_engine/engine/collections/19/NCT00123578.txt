      popular drugs of abuse. In cases of severe withdrawal, delirium, confusion, hallucinations,
      and agitation can occur. There has been a sharp rise in the number of GHB related emergency
      room visits over the past few years, yet little is known about the effective treatment of GHB
      withdrawal and dependence. The purpose of this study is to describe the signs and symptoms of
      GHB withdrawal, identify predictors of withdrawal severity, and evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of treatment for GHB detoxification. There will be compensation for screening
      assessments.

      The study includes two phases. The open-label Phase 1 will aim to determine the safety of
      lorazepam for the treatment of mild GHB withdrawal. Participants who progress into moderate
      or severe withdrawal will enter the controlled Phase 2. In Phase 2, participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam or pentobarbital in order to determine which
      drug is more effective in treating GHB withdrawal.

      The study will consist of 1 to 2 outpatient screening visits, followed by up to 15 days of
      inpatient detoxification treatment and assessment. After hospital discharge from inpatient
      treatment, measures of protracted GHB withdrawal and psychiatric symptoms will be obtained on
      an outpatient weekly basis for 8 weeks. Repeat measures of cognitive functioning will be
      obtained at baseline, termination of treatment, and at 30, 60, and 90-day follow-up intervals
      in order to assess long-term neurocognitive effects of GHB withdrawal and use.
