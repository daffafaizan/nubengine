    
      -  A traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation design will be implemented.

        -  Successive cohorts of participants (3 or 3+3 participants /cohort) will start on a fixed
           cell numbers of allogeneic hepatocyte in three cohorts separately: L dose (low cell
           numbers); M dose (medium cell numbers); H dose (high cell numbers).

        -  The 1st cohort will be given dose of L.

        -  The 2nd cohort will be given dose of M.

        -  The 3rd cohort will be given dose of H.

        -  Dose escalation will continue until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). If no DLTs are
           observed for 28days after administration of the last dose, a new cohort will be enrolled
           at the next planned dose level. If DLTs are observed in 2 of the three participants, the
           MTD will be determined to be the dose administered to the previous cohort. If DLTs are
           observed in one participant in the cohort, another three participants will be treated
           with the same dose level. If the new three participants aren't observed DLTs, another
           cohort will be enrolled at the upper dose. If at least one of the new three ones are
           observed DLTs, the below dose will be the MTD.

        -  MTD will stopped by testing increasing up to the H dose.

        -  Toxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
           Version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0).
