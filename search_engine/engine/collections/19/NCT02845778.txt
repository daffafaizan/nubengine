      after apply melatonin niosomes (MN) oral gel 2.5, 5, and 10 mg per dose in 15 male healthy
      volunteers. The pharmacokinetic parameters include maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area
      under the curve (AUC), time to peak concentration (Tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2). Sleep
      induction will be determined as sleep onset and duration after use MN oral gels using
      actigraph and behavior observation. A polysomnography using electrode placement derive from
      multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) protocol will be used in some subjects. Adverse event will
      be evaluated by investigator.
