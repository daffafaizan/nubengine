      TNBC which presents activated PI3K/AKT signaling due to PIK3CA mutation or PTEN deficiency.
      TNBC cell lines having activated PI3K/AKT signaling showed a high sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR
      inhibitors. RAD001 is a potent mTOR complex 1 inhibitor and showed to enhance cisplatin or
      gemcitabine induced apoptosis by inhibiting p53 induced p21 expression.

      This study consists of two parts. In a phase Ib part, investigators will explore the
      recommended dose of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and RAD001 combination in patients with
      metastatic TNBC. After completing the phase Ib part, investigators will review the data and
      discuss with Novartis before the start of a phase II part. In the phase II part,
      investigators will compare the efficacy of the gemcitabine and cisplatin with or without
      RAD001 in patients with metastatic TNBC.
