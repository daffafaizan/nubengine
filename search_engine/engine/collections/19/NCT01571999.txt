    
      GSK573719 monotherapy and GSK573719/vilanterol combination are currently under development
      for the treatment of COPD. This study will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of inhaled
      GSK573719 and GSK573719/vilanterol (VI) in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe renal
      impairment. Nine subjects with severe renal impairment (as defined by a Clcr<30mL/min) will
      be recruited along with healthy control subjects (as defined by a Clcr>80mL/min matched to
      the severe renal impairment subjects based on gender, ethnicity, body mass index (±15%) and
      age (±5 years)). The results from this study will provide guidance on the use of GSK573719
      and GSK573719/VI in severe renally impaired patients.
