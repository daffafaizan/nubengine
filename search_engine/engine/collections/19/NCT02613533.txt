      anterior chamber angles on the day of their scheduled laser iridotomy. The angle
      configuration and IOP will be monitored following the WDT. Twenty patients with occludable
      angles will be enrolled in this study. After measuring the baseline IOP, weight and height,
      the patients will be asked to drink 10ml/kg water over 15 minutes (equal to approximately
      0.33 ounces of water for every 2.2 pounds of weight or 2 Â½ cups for a 150 lb. individual) and
      their IOP will be checked every 15 minutes up to one hour after drinking the water. This will
      be repeated after performing a laser iridotomy. The data obtained, mainly IOP and gonioscopic
      findings, will be analyzed using statistical tests and compared to historical controls of the
      WDT without narrow angles, and laser iridotomy subjects without the WDT.
