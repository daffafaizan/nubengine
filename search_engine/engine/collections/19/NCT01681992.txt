      multi-country study with four parallel groups. This study will evaluate the immunogenicity
      and safety of GSK Biologicals' trivalent investigational MMR vaccine (referred to as Inv_MMR
      vaccine, throughout this document) in contrast to the US standard of care comparator vaccine
      (M-M-R II, Merck and Co., Inc., referred to as Com_MMR throughout this document) in children
      during their second year of life. The first dose of this two-dose study is designed to
      establish the end of shelf-life potency of Inv_MMR vaccine. The Inv_MMR vaccine will be given
      as one of two lots; one of a minimum potency, designated Inv_MMR_Min; and the other at a
      mid-range or medium potency designated Inv_MMR_Med to two groups. The second dose for both of
      these Inv_MMR groups will have a potency within the release range of the marketed vaccine.
      The Com_MMR vaccine will consist of two lots designated Com_MMR_L1 and Com_MMR_L2 and will be
      analyzed as pooled lots within the study. The first MMR vaccine dose will be co-administered
      with Varivax, Havrix and (in the US sub-cohort only) Prevnar 13 which are routinely
      administered to children of this age in the US.
