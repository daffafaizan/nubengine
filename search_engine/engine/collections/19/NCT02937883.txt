      with young onset dementia and their informal caregivers. The empowerment intervention focuses
      on current capacities, maintenance of autonomy, and increasing the opportunities to feel
      useful. This pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial aims to investigate (1) the
      effectiveness of the intervention concerning participants' well-being, quality of life, and
      behavioral issues, (2) the effect of the intervention on the informal caregivers' sense of
      competence and perceived distress, and (3) the impact of the intervention on healthcare
      costs. Furthermore, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of the intervention to
      frame an implementation strategy.

      Participants in the intervention group will receive the intervention for 5 months.
      Participants of the control group receive care as usual.
