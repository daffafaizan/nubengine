      dynamic re-aeration score. Patients will be randomly allocated via sealed opaque envelopes
      into 2 groups of 30 patients each; control (C) group and minimal dose (Min) group.

      For general anesthesia; intubating dose of muscle relaxant will be injected according to the
      study group; in C group; atracurium 0.5 mg/kg while in min group 0.2 mg/kg will be injected.
      The trial for intubation will be assessed and recorded. Train-of-four (TOF) stimulation will
      be maintained less than 2 throughout the intraoperative period in the control group. While,
      in the min group, boluses of muscle relaxant will be given only upon complain of the surgeon
      and after a bolus dose of propofol 0.5 mg/kg. When required, 20% of the initial dose of
      muscle relaxant will be provided as a bolus to achieve this goal.
