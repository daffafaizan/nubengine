      for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic and biliary tract disease. However, post-ERCP
      pancreatitis (PEP) is the most common adverse event following the procedure, ranging from 2%
      to 10% in nonselective cases, and it can cause substantial morbidity, mortality, or high
      medical costs. Recent advances in cannulation technique and accessories for biliary
      cannulation have contributed to reduce the incidence of PEP, but biliary cannulation can fail
      in 5% to 20% of cases of ERCP. Suprapapillary needle-knife fistulotomy (NKF), with or without
      large-diameter balloon dilation, has been used as a rescue method in cases of difficult
      biliary cannulation, and NKF was recommended as an initial approach to selective biliary
      cannulation in cases of repetitive unintentional pancreatic cannulation.9 Moreover, difficult
      biliary cannulation is known to be a risk factor for PEP, and it has been reported that NKF
      is associated with a low risk of PEP. Thus, we hypothesized that NKF may reduce the risk of
      PEP in patients who are at increased risk for PEP.
