    
      This is a research study to determine the efficacy and safety of investigational drug
      MEDI3506 for the treatment of adult subjects with Atopic Dermatitis.

      Each participant will be assigned randomly to a treatment arm, which could be different
      strengths of the active treatment or a placebo which does not contain active treatment. Both
      Participants and investigators will be masked to the treatment assignment.

      Approximately 152 participants will take part in this study. There is a 3 weeks screening
      period to determine eligibility. After eligibility is confirmed, participants will receive
      investigational drug or placebo during the 16 weeks treatment period. This is then followed
      by an 8-week follow-up period.
