      base of each ring finger. 2ml 1% lidocaine in one of the fingers, and 1 ml 2% lidocaine in
      the other. After each injection, the subject will be asked to evaluate the pain on a visual
      analog scale (0-100 mm). Additionally the sensibility will be tested with a Semmes-Weinstein
      monofilament, to evaluate if the different methods achieve desired anesthetic effect.
