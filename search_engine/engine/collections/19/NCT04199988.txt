      included in the study. Shoulder endurance will be measured as isometric and isotonic on both
      arms of athletes using the posterior shoulder endurance test. The measurements will be
      repeated after 3-7 days, and the test-retest reliability of the isotonic and isometric
      posterior shoulder endurance test will be investigated.
