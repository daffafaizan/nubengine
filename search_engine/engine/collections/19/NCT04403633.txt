      order to improve the adverse health outcomes associated with this common condition. This
      project involves thorough evaluation of patient and provider feedback on barriers and
      facilitators to pediatric AKI self-management in order to develop patient-centered pediatric
      AKI interventions. This will be done through interviews with families of patients diagnosed
      with AKI and providers who take care of these patients followed by integration of the results
      into modification of an existing educational tool previously used in adult patients. The
      study will take place in three parts with the first involving interviews, the second
      involving tool modification and usability testing, and the third involving pilot testing of
      the tool's impact.
