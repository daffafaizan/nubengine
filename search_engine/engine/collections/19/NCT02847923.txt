      being, promoting their coexistence in society. However, several factors, among them the
      Cerebral palsy (CP), can cause changes in muscle tone, causing injury in phono-articulatory
      which prevent or impair the speech production. This research aims to the development of a
      mobile application to promote the augmentative and alternative communication for people with
      CP, which adapt to the characteristics of motor limitations of these users. A mobile
      application was developed with pictographic resources and a voice synthesis engine, which can
      be customized according to the level of motor impairment and need for communication of the
      user. Were recruited 30 volunteers with CP who have speech difficulties and motor impairment.
      By means of a test script, these volunteers have used the mobile application and evaluated
      their usability using the questionnaire System Usability Scale (SUS), which contains 10
      questions related to the ease of learning, efficiency, ease of memorization, occurrence of
      runtime errors of execution and level of user satisfaction.
