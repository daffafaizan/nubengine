      Hospital for second trimester termination will be offered participation in this study. They
      will be randomized to either delayed or immediate Copper T 380A IUD insertion. The subjects
      will be seen at a 6 month follow-up visit and Copper T 380A IUD placement will be verified by
      physical exam. At this 6 month follow-up visit, subjects will fill out a satisfaction
      questionnaire.
