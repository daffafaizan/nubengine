      white matter integrity, and suggest that damage to the connecting fibers of the brain (white
      matter) is related to mobility impairment. Unfortunately, age-related structural white matter
      damage appears irreversible and only indirectly indicates the functional connectivity between
      brain regions. The preliminary data show that directly assessed patterns of functional
      connectivity correlate with mobility function and can be changed by interventions that
      improve mobility function. It is not known how changes in CNS functional connectivity relate
      to changes in mobility, information critical for the design of interventions targeting CNS
      connectivity to improve mobility impairments. It is clear that structural connectivity
      underlies functional connectivity, and that structural brain lesions result in altered
      functional connections. B-NET will assess white matter (WM) disease burden and
      microstructural changes and relate these changes to functional brain network connectivity. We
      hypothesize that because sensory motor cortex community structure (SMC-CS) characterizes
      current brain organization, it will be associated with mobility function independently of
      anatomical damage markers. Such knowledge may permit earlier identification of persons at
      high risk for mobility decline and facilitate earlier and better targeted interventions.
