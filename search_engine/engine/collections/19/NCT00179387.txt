      relationship strains, existential distress and role losses are all potential "side-effects"
      of living with cancer and its treatment. Behavioral interventions have shown some success in
      mitigating distress and QOL impairment among cancer patients. The purpose of this
      randomized-controlled study is to compare the effects of Mind-body group interventions on the
      quality of life of patients with advanced cancer. Patients are randomized to one of two
      psychotherapy groups, which occur weekly for eight weeks. Quality of life assessments are
      conducted at baseline and two and four-month intervals.
