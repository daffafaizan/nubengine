      predictors of return of spontaneous circulation and survival following cardiac arrest. Stiell
      et al (2014) found optimal survival at a compression depth of 4.56cm, which is at variance
      with the current guidelines of 5.0-6.0cm. A change in guidelines is only likely to improve
      survival rates if healthcare professionals can accurately implement these subtle depth
      modifications into the basic life support (BLS) algorithm. This study aims to determine if
      healthcare professionals can accurately judge compression depth without real-time feedback.
