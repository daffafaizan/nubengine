      Interstitial fluid (ISF) is the medium for these approaches. A physiological lag in ISF
      glucose relative to capillary blood glucose has been noted, probably due to relatively low
      blood perfusion at the sampling site. 9 This physiological lag can result in an accuracy
      error, manifesting as a significant bias between blood and tissue glucose, particularly
      during periods of rapid glucose change. This lag error might be particularly meaningful when
      glucose is rapidly dropping towards hypoglycemia.
