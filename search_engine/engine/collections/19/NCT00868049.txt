      and normal weight subjects. The habitual chewing of a French bread and deglutition of solids
      and liquid was evaluated five times in obese subjects and controls. The tonus of the lips,
      tongue, cheeks, masseter and temporal muscles were evaluated by clinical observation and
      palpation and defined as either normal or reduced. Twenty obese patients (body mass index
      (BMI) > 30kg/m2) and twenty volunteers of normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 Kg/m2) were evaluated.
