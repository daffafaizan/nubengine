      tolerability signals are possible on co-administration. Four treatment arms will be used:
      ATV-PG + AQ placebo, ATV-PG placebo + AQ, ATV-PG placebo + AQ placebo, as well as ATV-PG +
      AQ. This will facilitate discrimination of the contribution of the treatments to any
      tolerability signal. In the event that ATV-PG + AQ is not considered sufficiently well
      tolerated, data on the individual agents will provide an indication of whether ATV-PG or AQ
      are suitable partner drugs for other combinations.

      Thus, this study will evaluate in healthy adults, whether the tolerability and safety profile
      of once daily administration of ATV-PG + AQ for 3 days supports future use in Seasonal
      Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), which will entail administration on a monthly basis to an
      apparently healthy population of children of 3 months of age and older, for the duration of
      the malaria season.

      This study will also determine the pharmacokinetics of ATV, PG, CG (active metabolite of PG),
      AQ and DEAQ (active metabolite of AQ).

      Given the ultimate target population (children in Southern and Easter Africa in areas in
      which SMC with SPAQ is not currently deployed due to SP resistance), the study will be
      carried out in healthy subjects of sub-Saharan African origin (defined as subjects whose
      parents were both born in sub-Saharan Africa).
