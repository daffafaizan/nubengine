    
      Aim 1: to recruit people interested in research on autism and other neurodevelopmental
      disabilities

      Aim 2: to complete a diagnostic assessment, to confirm the diagnosis of autism spectrum
      disorder or other developmental disability (e.g., developmental language delay) in our
      patient population and rule out a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and other comorbid
      conditions in our control group

      Aim 3: to maintain subject information in a database, from which we can recruit for our
      studies
