      distinguish between two subject groups: those with clinical stage II or stage III breast
      cancer and those without breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo light-scattering spectroscopy of the breast in addition to standard
      of care as it relates to screening for breast cancer or treatment of breast cancer.
