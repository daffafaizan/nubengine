      between the encoding of food reward in mesocorticolimbic reward pathways and homeostatic
      energy regulation is of paramount importance for the development of new treatment strategies.
      Healthy participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a
      task distinguishing between the anticipation and the receipt of either food or monetary
      reward. Every participant will be scanned twice in a counterbalanced fashion, both during a
      state of hunger (after 24-hours fasting) and satiety. Blood samples will be collected to
      assess hormonal satiety signalling. We hope to provide new insights into the neurobiological
      underpinnings of motivational processing and hedonic evaluation of food reward.
