      EssentialsÂ® on cognition in a healthy adult population with self-reported memory complaints.
      As there is a dearth of available literature on BDNF in this study population, the current
      study is designed to understand the role of BDNF to inform potential future studies. The
      study population represents a target group of individuals who would benefit from safe and
      efficacious nutraceuticals for the support of cognitive function. This transitional stage
      from normal cognition to cognitive impairment is viewed as an opportune window for
      intervention. This population of participants is being recruited to expand on previously
      published work on these individual ingredients while limiting confounding variables that
      could influence outcomes.
