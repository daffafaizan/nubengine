      study includes breast cancer patients that underwent primary surgery, either by mastectomy or
      breast conserving surgery, who are treated with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy as
      part of routine clinical care. The patient follow up time continues for 2 years after
      radiotherapy to identify early subclinical cardiac injuries (ESCIs), using repeat
      echocardiography (cECHO), cardiac MRI (cMRI) scans and cardiac CT (cCT) scans. The images are
      acquired prior to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (depending on the sequence of adjuvant
      treatment), and at 6 and 24 months after radiotherapy The first primary aim of this project
      is to detect ESCIs that are considered risk factors for clinically apparent major cardiac
      events in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The second is to
      use this information to develop prediction models describing the relationship between the
      radiation dose to cardiac substructures and ESCIs.

      In detail, the investigators aim to:

        1. identify longitudinal morphological and functional ESCIs using echocardiography, cardiac
           MRI and cardiac CT before and after BC treatment;

        2. determine the relationship between 3D-dose distributions to cardiac substructures and
           ESCI;

        3. establish the effect of chemotherapy on the dose-effect relationship between radiation
           dose and ESCI.
