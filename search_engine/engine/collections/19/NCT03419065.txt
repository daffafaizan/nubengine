      Study participants will then be trained in the use of progressive muscle relaxation and
      guided imagery for pregnancy. Participants will be issued a listening device and an audio
      file and asked to practice it on a daily basis while in the hospital.

      Prior to discharge or delivery, the participant will be visited by a member of the research
      team who will conduct a follow-up interview. The interviews and the relaxation practice
      sessions will take between 30 and 45 minutes each. The interviews will be audio-recorded,
      although no identifying information about the participants will be recorded.

      At the conclusion of the study, participants will be given a CD of the audio relaxation
      program and thanked for their participation in the study.

      There is minimal risk anticipated in association with participation in this study. All
      information gained from this study will remain confidential and is for educational purposes
      only. Participants are entitled to terminate their participation in the study at any time.

      It is hoped that the results of this study will provide information about an intervention
      that may be beneficial to women with high-risk pregnancies. It is also hoped that
      participation in the exercises will be enjoyable and/or beneficial to you in some way. The
      results of this study may be used to justify further studies or to influence the type of
      interventions offered in this or similar settings.

      All data collected from the research will remain confidential. Data collected from
      participants will immediately be assigned an identification number so that no one will be
      able to identify any individuals in the study.
