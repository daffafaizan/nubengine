    
      Non alcoholic fatty liver disease is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease
      world wide . Severe forms of NAFLD such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can progress to
      end-stage liver disease such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore,
      investigating risk factors associated with hepatic steatosis is required to perform effective
      screening .

      Hepatic steatosis develops for a variety reasons but obesity is the most common associated
      condition.

      Obesity is considered a gateway disease and NAFLD is considered to be one of the phenotypes
      of metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by obesity with visceral fat accumulation,
      diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia.

      Individuals with severe obesity have a disproportionately high risk of comorbidities
      including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

      The distribution of fat appears more important than the total fat mass in obesity .A
      predominantly upper body fat distribution increases the risks for the metabolic complications
      of obesity including hepatic steatosis especially when it is associated with increased intra
      abdominal fat .

      Most "metabolically obese" normal weight subjects have some increase in adipose tissue mass
      and insulin resistance probably due to an increase in visceral fat. Thus, subjects with a
      relatively low BMI can have gross increases in abdominal visceral fat, and others with a high
      BMI may have very little intra abdominal/visceral fat .

      Several studies suggested visceral adiposity to be a clinical predictor of hepatic steatosis
      .

      In addition, the severity of fatty liver has been linked to the VAT area as evaluated by CT.
