      Therapy usually involves 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. However,
      steroid resistance and dependency can become problematic. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as
      azathioprine, are beneficial but may have serious side effects. Therefore, new therapeutic
      approach is needed.

      Prostaglandin E2 is one of the prostanoids, which is involved with innate immunity. PGE2
      induces oral tolerance to specific antigen in the small intestine and downregulates the
      production and release of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages and neutrophils.
      Accordingly, PGE2 is considered to be the mediator of mucosal protection.

      Recently, it was elucidated that disruption of EP4 gene, which is one of PGE receptors,
      caused severe colitis in mice. Moreover, EP4-selective agonist (AE1-734) was also revealed to
      ameliorate severe dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice. We therefore examined the
      effects of 2 weeks intravenous EP4-selective agonist therapy for patients with mild to
      moderate ulcerative colitis.
