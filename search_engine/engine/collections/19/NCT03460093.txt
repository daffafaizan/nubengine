      section operations at H.S.U Kocaeli Derince Education and Research Hospital. The
      implementation of this procedure depends on the clinical situation of the patient, the
      preference of the surgeon and the anesthesiologist, the course of the operation, and whether
      the patient wishes or not. Superior hypogastric plexus block is performed with 0.25 %
      bupivacaine 30 ml injected under peritoneum above promontorium.

      This is a prospective case-control study. The sample consisted of 60 women having
      cesarean-section with general anesthesia at H.S.U Kocaeli Derince Education and Research
      Hospital divided into two groups: the first group having superior hypogastric plexus block
      for pain relief and the control group not having superior hypogastric plexus block. All
      participants signed an informed consent and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
      Kocaeli University ( KUGOKAEK 2017/270). The sample size was calculated with G Power 3.1
      program. With ki-square Goodness-of-fit test Î±:0.05 ,power 95% ,effect size 0.5 total sample
      size was calculated 52, including 26 in case group and 26 in control group. Women having
      cesarean-section with spinal anesthesia, women with known bupivacaine allergy, women with
      anxiety-depression disorder, women with known fibromyalgia were not enrolled to the study.
