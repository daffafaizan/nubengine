      trial (RCT) to assess the longer-term impact of the gender-transformative Bandebereho couples
      intervention on participating men, women, and their children. The Bandebereho program being
      assessed was first implemented by the Rwanda Men's Resource Center (RWAMREC) and Promundo-US,
      in collaboration with the Rwanda Ministry of Health and local authorities in Karongi,
      Musanze, Nyaruguru and Nyaruguru districts between 2013 and 2015. A two-arm RCT was conducted
      with 1,199 couples (575 treatment; 624 control) in 2015-16. Three rounds of data were
      collected: baseline (pre-intervention), 9 month follow-up (4 months post-intervention), and
      21-month follow-up (16 months post-intervention). The findings at 21-months demonstrated
      significant impacts of the intervention on multiple gender and health-related outcomes. The
      proposed study will conduct surveys with men enrolled in the RCT and their female partners,
      to assess the longer-term impact of the intervention on reproductive and maternal health,
      gender attitudes and household dynamics, intimate partner violence, mental health and
      wellbeing, parenting, and child development. In addition, child assessments will be conducted
      with a sub-sample of 800 children aged 4 to 7 years to directly assess early childhood
      development outcomes.
