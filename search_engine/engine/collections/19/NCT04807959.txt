      20Lighter comprehensive anti-obesity program in reducing body composition measures including
      body weight, body fat, visceral adiposity, intracellular fluid, and other metrics of
      interest. Anecdotal evidence on reductions of prescription medication, chronic health issues,
      and improvements in quality of life will be gauged via review of patient assessment forms and
      surveys.
