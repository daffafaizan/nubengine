    
      Methods: The study will be a double-blind randomized control trial. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either intramuscular injection of the lower cervical paraspinous muscles
      with 1 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine on each side, placebo injections with 1 mL normal saline on
      each side, or no intervention at all. If randomized to an injection, the investigator and the
      patient will both be blinded as to the nature of the injection.

      The location of the child's pain as well as severity will be assessed immediately prior to
      intervention and every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. If after 30 minutes relief is insufficient
      for discharge to home, intravenous treatment will be instituted according to current
      protocol. Pain will be reassessed at the time of ultimate disposition. The scale used to
      assess severity will vary based on the child's age.
