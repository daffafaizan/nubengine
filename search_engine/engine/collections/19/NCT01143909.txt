    
      Rationale: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is an effective therapy to correct for a deficiency of
      multiple coagulation factors during bleeding. In past years, use of FFP has increased, in
      particular in patients on the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and has expanded to include
      prophylactic use in patients with a coagulopathy prior to undergoing an invasive procedure.
      Retrospective studies suggest that prophylactic use of FFP does not prevent bleeding, but
      carries the risk of transfusion-related morbidity. However, up to 50% of FFP is administered
      to non-bleeding ICU patients.

      Objective: With the aim to restrict inappropriate FFP transfusions to critically ill
      patients, a randomized clinical trial will be conducted in a subgroup of ICU patients with a
      coagulopathy undergoing an invasive procedure. The objective is to assess the effectiveness
      and costs of prophylactic FFP transfusion (current practice) compared to no prophylactic
      transfusion, in non-bleeding ICU patients with a coagulopathy, prior to undergoing an
      invasive procedure (e.g. placement of central venous catheter, tracheostomy, chest tube).

      Study design: Prospective, multicentre, randomized, open-label, blinded end point evaluation
      (PROBE) design.
