    
      High-fat (HF) diets of as little as three days have been shown to accelerate GI transit. This
      study aimed to assess if 5-day HF supplemented diet varying in fatty acid composition were
      sufficient to accelerate GI transit, appetite responses and substrate utilisation and whether
      a 5-day deadaptation period to a HF diet would reverse the responses induced by adaptation to
      a HFD.

      The study will be conducted in a randomized, single-blinded manner in 24 healthy subjects.
      Three 5-day interventions will each followed by a test trial. In the first intervention
      period (CON), normal diet was supplemented with low-fat (LF) milkshakes (272 kcal, 6 g fat).
      The second and third interventions will involve repeating previous diet along with HF (1082
      kcal, 96 g fat) or LF milkshakes respectively. The three high-fat supplement groups that
      subjects will be randomized to are as follows: (1) olive oil (90 g oil), (2) olive oil + n-3
      EPA/DHA fish powder blend or (3) olive oil + macadamia oil blend.

      The effect of 5-day HF diet (daily milkshake supplement: 1082 kcal, 96 g fat) on gastric
      emptying and mouth to caecum transit time of a high-fat test will be measured using the 13C
      octanoic acid breath test and H2 inulin breath test respectively for six hours
      postprandially. During this time course, measurements of subjective appetite sensations by
      visual analogue scale and substrate utilization by indirect calorimetry were also collected.
      Subsequently, food intake will be measured using an ad libitum buffet meal.
