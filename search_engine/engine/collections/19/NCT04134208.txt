      I. Evaluate metabolic response by fluciclovine F18 (18F-fluciclovine) PET qualitatively and
      semi-quantitatively with standardized uptake values (SUV) following androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT) plus abiraterone at 22-28 weeks (+/- 4 weeks), and correlate the findings with
      size changes as defined by conventional imaging and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate pelvic 18F-fluciclovine PET imaging findings with pathologic findings at
      radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection to determine 18F-fluciclovine PET
      imaging sensitivity and specificity for pelvic lymph node cancer involvement.

      II. To evaluate 18F-fluciclovine PET imaging response and its correlation with progression
      free survival (defined by Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 [PCWG2] criteria).

      III. To determine if sites of progressive disease develop at the initial/prior site
      (diagnostic site) of metastases or in newly developed sites at the time of metastatic
      progression.

      IV. To evaluate metabolic response by 18F-fluciclovine PET semi-quantitatively with target to
      blood pool ratio (TBR) following ADT plus abiraterone at 22-28 weeks (+/- 4 weeks), and
      correlate the findings with size changes as defined by conventional imaging and PSA response.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 4 weeks before starting standard systemic therapy (SST), patients receive fluciclovine
      F18 intravenously (IV) then undergo a PET-CT scan over 30 minutes. Within 22-28 weeks after
      starting SST, patients receive fluciclovine F18 IV and undergo a second PET-CT scan over 30
      minutes.
