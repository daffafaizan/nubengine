      possibilities and the importance of geriatric screening, this study wants:

        -  to compare clinical judgment with standardized geriatric screening approaches (G8, CGA
           and IMWG score) in newly diagnosed elderly myeloma patients and to evaluate their
           influence on the detection of geriatric problems and on the choice of the anti-myeloma
           treatment

        -  to evaluate how geriatric scoring and the subsequent treatment choice influences the
           therapeutic efficacy and toxicities

      Geriatric scoring will be performed in 3 different ways:

        -  by clinical judgment performed by the treating physician

        -  by validated scoring systems independently performed by a trained nurse/ health care
           worker. Initial scoring will be done by the G8 score. If an abnormal G8 score is present
           (<= 14), CGA will be performed.

        -  based on the CGA parameters, the Palumbo/IMWG geriatric score will be calculated

      Results obtained by physician-based assessment and by geriatric assessment will be compared
      before treatment initiation. If, and to what extent the knowledge of the GA influences the
      therapeutic decision of the treating physician will be registered. In addition, we will
      register which geriatric problems diagnosed by the CGA assessment were already known or
      unknown by the treating physician. After three months of treatment and at the time of disease
      progression, geriatric assessment will be repeated in order to judge the evolution
      (disappearance, improvement, worsening) of the scored parameters, or the emergence of new
      geriatric symptoms.
