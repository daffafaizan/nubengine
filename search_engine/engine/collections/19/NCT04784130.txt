      the nation that pose an enormous disease and economic burden in this medically underserved
      state. Self-management of these two commonly found chronic conditions are an essential
      component of comprehensive disease management. The goal of this R34 planning project is to
      test the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week culturally-tailored, multimodal, diabetes
      and hypertension self-management program with a core (diet and physical activity) versus core
      plus (diet, physical activity and medication adherence) to an enhanced usual care (EUC)
      control group. Seventy-five eligible adults with comorbid diabetes and hypertension will be
      randomized with a 1:1:1 ratio, based on allocation sequence generated by the bio-statistician
      investigator in the team. The study will examine the extent to which key components (diet,
      physical activity, and medication adherence) contribute to the differences in clinical
      outcomes (HbA1c and blood pressure) between three groups using quantitative and qualitative
      focus groups and the RE-AIM evaluation framework. The longer term effects of the intervention
      will be evaluated in a subsequent R01 clinical trial.
