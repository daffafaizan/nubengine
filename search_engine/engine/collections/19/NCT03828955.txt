      people with mild hypertension. Thirty subjects with systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 120
      and 159 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 80 and 99 mm Hg were randomized
      to ingest 2 bags of soybean peptides or placebo per day for 8 weeks of a stage.
      Anthropometric measurements (blood pressure, body weight, body fat) and blood biochemical
      markers including fasting blood glucose (FBG), albumin, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride
      (TG), HDL-C, LDL-C, creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), AST, ALT) were examined every
      four weeks.
