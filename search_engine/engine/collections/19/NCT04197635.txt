    
      This study will be a double-blind multicenter randomized study (1:1) to evaluate the effect
      of dapagliflozin 10 mg per day or placebo on short-term functional capacity evaluated through
      changes in peak oxygen consumption. This trial will include patients with type 2 diabetes and
      stable symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Efficacy endpoints
      will be evaluated at 3 time points: 1) baseline (before dapagliflozin/placebo
      administration), 2) 30 days after randomization, and, 3) 90 days after randomization. An
      intermediate clinical visit will be performed one week after study initiation.

      Pre-and post-treatment evaluations (at baseline, 30 and 90 days) will include clinical
      assessment, cardiopulmonary exercise stress test, echocardiography, 6-minute walk test
      (6MWT), and quality of life indicators (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire
      -MLHFQ).

      The investigators postulate that dapagliflozin 10 mg/day improves short-term functional
      capacity of patients with type 2 diabetes and symptomatic HFrEF through multifactorial
      mechanisms, such as diuretic effect and improvement in myocardial energetic efficiency.
