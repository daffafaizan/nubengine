      intervention or usual care. The intervention group will receive a group psychoeducational
      intervention (designed in Phase 1: Qualitative study) in addition to self-help leaflets and
      usual care. It is anticipated that the intervention will be offered in 6 two-hour sessions
      over 3 months by an assistant psychologist. The control group will receive usual care plus
      self-help leaflets on relevant topics. All participants will complete outcome measures at 3
      and 6 months after randomisation. We will test the feasibility, tolerability and
      acceptability of delivering the intervention and will record data on study completion and
      attrition. Findings will inform the development of a larger trial and will determine if the
      content and delivery of the intervention meets the needs of people after TIA and minor
      stroke.
