      setting at London Health Sciences Centre in London, ON. Forty patients will be randomized in
      permutated blocks independently by Statistician, to either the EN or PN group on admission to
      the unit. The baseline evaluations are blood work, Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA),
      Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation, ultrasound, and a
      medical evaluation. Patients do have the right to refuse either or both types of nutritional
      support. As part of standard care, the risks and benefits of nutritional support for both EN
      and PN will be explained to the patient.

      Consent will be obtained prior to admission. Most of these patients initially continue to
      maintain their oral intake even after chemotherapy. On Day 5+/- 1 day after transplantation,
      the randomized nutrition therapy will only be initiated only if patient intake is < 80% of
      usual intake, where they will be provided with 25-35 kcal/kg/day, 1.2-1.5g of protein/kg/day,
      and omega-3 to supplement any oral intake the patient might not have. If the intake is >80%
      of required intake, initiation of randomized therapy will only happen on the day the intake
      falls to <80% of required nutritional intake.

      Patients will be monitored until Day 15 where post-transplant evaluations will be conducted:
      blood work, BIA, SGA, ultrasound, BMI, food records, and medical evaluation. If at that time,
      patients are not consuming 50% of energy from oral feeds, nutrition therapy will continue
      until oral goal is met or until discharge for medical reasons. Patients will be assessed at
      Day+30 post-transplant in clinic and the following will be completed blood work, BIA, SGA,
      BMI, food records, ultrasound, medical complications and a QOL assessment.
