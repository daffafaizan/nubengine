    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, sequential cohort, dose-selection study of CAEL-101 in
      Mayo Stage I, Stage II and Stage IIIa AL amyloidosis patients. CAEL-101 will be administered
      in combination with the standard of care (SoC) cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone
      (CyBorD) chemotherapy and daratumumab.

      The study is divided into two parts with the following objectives:

        -  Part A defines the safety and tolerability of CAEL-101 in combination with SoC CyBorD
           and determines the recommended Phase 3 dose (RP3D) of CAEL-101

        -  Part B evaluates the safety and tolerability of CAEL-101 in combination with SoC CyBorD
           and daratumumab

      The study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of CAEL-101.

      Part A of the study will employ a 3+3 dose escalation design. At least 3 patients will be
      enrolled in each dose cohort unless adverse events (AE) preventing further dosing are
      observed. CAEL-101 will be administered in combination with the SoCCyBorD chemotherapy.

      In Part B, a minimum of 6 new patients will receive CAEL-101 administered in combination with
      SoC CyBorD and daratumumab.

      Patients from both Parts A and B will receive CAEL-101 therapy weekly and SoC throughout the
      safety observation period. CAEL-101 study drug infusions will continue, with dosing
      approximately every two weeks (q2wk) thereafter. SoC will continue per the Investigator's
      discretion.

      Approximately 25 patients will be enrolled in the study at approximately 3 investigator
      sites.

      Patients will be treated with CAEL-101 until death, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic
      deterioration, Investigator decision, patient decision or Sponsor decision to terminate the
      study.
