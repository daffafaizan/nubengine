    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase
      Ib/IIa clinical study to assess the administration of ApTOLL together with endovascular
      therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with confirmed Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO)
      who are candidates to receive reperfusion therapies including endovascular treatment with or
      without i.v. rt-PA (recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator).

      The study will be a Phase Ib/IIa trial where 2 doses selected, based on safety criteria, on
      Phase Ib will be administered in the following Phase IIa.The objective of the study is to
      evaluate if administration of ApTOLL at different doses is safe and well tolerated compared
      to placebo when administered with endovascular therapy (EVT), with or without i.v. rt-PA, in
      the AIS target population.
