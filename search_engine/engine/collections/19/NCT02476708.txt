      clinical trial of curcumin for the treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.
      Cognitive impairment and persistent negative symptoms are the core dimensions of
      schizophrenia; however current antipsychotic treatment fails to address this issue. Evidence
      suggests cognitive impairment is not only limited to patients with late-stage schizophrenia.
      High rates of cognitive impairment in patients with first episode psychosis indicate that
      cognitive impairment is not solely a consequence of long-term antipsychotic treatment, but
      rather is an enduring problem over the course of schizophrenia. Likewise, negative symptoms
      persist throughout its entire course, and are associated with poor overall functioning.
      Currently, there are no pharmacological agents that specifically aim to treat cognitive
      functioning and persistent negative symptoms; therefore, there is growing interest in the
      development of effective treatments for this unmet need.

      The primary aim of this pilot trial is to provide an effect size estimate for the efficacy of
      curcumin in improving cognitive functioning in schizophrenia. Secondary goals are to
      determine the effect of curcumin over time on negative and positive symptoms, in association
      with inflammatory markers. Eligible participants will be randomized to curcumin (n=20) or
      placebo (n=20) in a 1:1 ratio. A commercially available surface-controlled water soluble form
      of 600mg curcumin (10% formulation) or matching placebo capsules will be administered three
      times a day for a total of 8 weeks.
