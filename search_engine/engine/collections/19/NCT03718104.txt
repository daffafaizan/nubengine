      and 50 comparison women on buprenorphine/naloxone (BPH) from Boston Medical Center and the
      University of North Carolina will be enrolled in this multi-center prospective comparative
      cohort study. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Safety and Efficacy: To compare
      maternal outcomes (safety, relapse, retention in care), fetal outcomes (growth, fetal
      distress), and infant outcomes (neonatal abstinence syndrome, growth, neurodevelopment)
      during pregnancy until 12 months post- delivery; An exploratory part of this aim is to
      collect safety and efficacy data on women receiving NTX for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We
      will collect maternal, fetal and infant outcomes related to prenatal alcohol exposure. 2)
      Pharmacokinetics: To determine the pharmacokinetics of NTX in pregnant and postpartum women;
      3) Genetics and Epigenetics: To examine the association between genetic variants and
      epigenetic modification in the mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) gene, as well as global DNA
      methylation changes after treatment with NTX and BPH within the mother, placenta, and infant;
      and 4) Breast milk: To measure breast milk concentrations of NTX and corresponding infant
      relative dose to determine safety for lactating women.
