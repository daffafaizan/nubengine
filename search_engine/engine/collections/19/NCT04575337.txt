    
      1. Set up a large population- based cohort including AD, MCI, pre-MCI, other
           neurodegenerative diseases, and elderly individuals with normal cognitive function.

        2. Collect the information of clinical and neuropsychological assessment, individual traits
           and social environmental factors, and neuroimaging data, as well as the biological
           samples, such as peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

        3. Screen biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity from peripheral blood,
           cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging to distinguish different clinical stages of AD at
           baseline.

        4. Screen the AD-associated gene and their risk variants.

        5. Establish a panel of AD-specific biomarkers for the preliminary development of
           diagnostic kit.

        6. Identify AD-relevant factors and the special biomarkers to create a preliminary risk
           models to predict the onset and progression of AD.

        7. Follow up the cohort for next 5 years and collect the multiple information and
           biological samples each year to validate and revise the risk prediction models and the
           diagnostic kit of AD.
