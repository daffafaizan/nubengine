      limiting further damage to the kidneys in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Reducing urine
      albumin excretion in type 2 diabetic patients is an indicator of successful treatment.
      Previous studies have shown that drugs that work in a similar fashion to moxonidine
      (intervene with the sympathetic nervous system)have been very effective in reducing the
      amount of albumin in the urine and are associated with long term renal and cardiovascular
      protection.
