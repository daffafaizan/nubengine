    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) therapy at the dose of 1000 mg results
      in a statistically significantly lower rate of proliferation in ductal carcinoma in situ
      (DCIS) breast cancer cells as measured by Ki67 when compared to placebo.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile and frequency of adverse events in women with DCIS breast
      cancer taking lapatinib at 1000 mg as compared to women taking placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether lapatinib treatment affects the incidence of DCIS seen at the time of
      surgical excision.

      II. Determine whether treatment with lapatinib will modulate breast tissue histology or the
      expression of specific biomarkers in normal and DCIS breast cancer cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 2-6 weeks until
      the time of surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 2-6 weeks until the time of surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4-5 weeks.
