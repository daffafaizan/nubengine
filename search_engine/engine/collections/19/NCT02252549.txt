    
      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial in which the recurrence rates of
      cancer between SPIES assisted and WLI assisted TURB are compared. Randomization is stratified
      by tumor multiplicity (single or multiple), tumor status (primary or recurrent) and
      macroscopic findings (papillary or flat, where CIS is scored as flat lesion). Patients
      randomized into the experimental arm (Arm A) will undergo SPIES and WLI assisted TURB,
      whereas the patients in the control arm (Arm B) will undergo WLI only assisted TURB. WLI is
      chosen as control, since it is considered the gold standard for detecting bladder tumors.
      Short and long term follow up will be recorded in order to evaluate the health gains for
      patients over a longer period. Perioperative (30 days) complications will be compared between
      the two treatment arms to evaluate the safety of SPIES.
