      intervention (pPCI) could offer clinical advantages over the intravenous route. Besides
      antiplatelet effects, abciximab can modulate inflammation via cross-reactivity with
      GPIIb/IIIa, avb3, and aMb2 receptors. The aim of this study was to assess whether abciximab
      administration route could influence its anti-inflammatory effects.

      METHODS: 87 consecutive STEMI patients candidate to pPCI were randomized to receive
      intracoronary (Group A, 47 patients) or intravenous (Group B, 42 patients) abciximab bolus.
      The primary endpoint was the extent of inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP),
      VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 levels.
