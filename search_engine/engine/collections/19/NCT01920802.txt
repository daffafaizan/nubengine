        1. Early changes (baseline vs day 3) in leptin will correlate with later changes in weight
           (at study termination.)

             1. Olanzapine will cause the greatest increase in calorie consumption from baseline on
                the multi-item meal compared with iloperidone or placebo.

             2. Olanzapine subjects will report the greatest frequency/quantity of eating in food
                diaries, and report increased preference for calorically dense foods (ie, higher
                fat content) compared to iloperidone or placebo.

             3. Early markers of endocrine changes caused by olanzapine will be greater than those
                caused by iloperidone or placebo, and these early changes will correlate with
                weight gain.

        2. Olanzapine will have greater effects on glucose homeostasis than iloperidone or placebo,
           and these effects will be separate from effects on body weight and composition.

             1. Early signs of metabolic disturbance, including glucose intolerance (greater
                excursion on OGTT) and insulin resistance (higher plasma insulin) will precede any
                significant weight gain.

             2. Early evidence of glucose intolerance and/or insulin resistance will predict
                greater metabolic derangements with further dosing of olanzapine, as evidenced by
                exacerbated glucose intolerance on OGTT or higher plasma glucose/insulin levels.
                These effects may not necessarily parallel weight gain.

             3. Olanzapine will be associated with greater markers of inflammation than iloperidone
                or placebo.
