      acceptability of the targeted elements of the intervention for the LGBT population. For Phase
      2 of this study, we seek to enroll 400 participants in a randomized controlled trial of the
      targeted intervention vs. a non-targeted, comparison condition. Both conditions will consist
      of group counseling sessions combined with nicotine replacement therapy and peer support. We
      expect that quit rates, stage of readiness, perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and treatment
      adherence will be higher among those who received the targeted intervention than those in the
      non-targeted intervention. Furthermore, we expect that a stronger LGBT cultural
      identification and salience of that identity will be associated with more satisfaction and
      adherence to the targeted intervention.
