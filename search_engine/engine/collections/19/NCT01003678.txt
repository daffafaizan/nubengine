    
      The specific purpose of the study is to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and recommended Phase II dose of clofarabine in patients with MDS.

        -  We will start at a dose of 1 mg daily.

        -  We will treat a group of 3 patients with clofarabine at that dose level.

        -  If there are no severe side effects seen at that dose level, then the next group of 3
           patients will receive a higher dose.

        -  Treatment of groups of 3 patients will continue at higher dose levels until severe
           side-effects are noted.

        -  If more than 1 of the 3 patients experiences a severe side effect, dosing will be
           stopped at that level.

        -  If only one of the three patients experience a severe side effect, then three more
           patients will be treated, at that dose level and if they too experience severe side
           effects, then dose escalation will be stopped and the maximum tolerated dose will be
           determined.

        -  10 more patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose.

        -  There will be up to 5 dose levels tested.

        -  We plan to test how much of the drugs are in the patient's blood at different times, and
           the levels of certain proteins in their blood.
