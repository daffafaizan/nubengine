      with blinded evaluation of response variables.

      The aim of the study is to test whether the Pressure Release of Myofascial Trigger Points
      technique(PRM) is effective in treating Myofascial Trigger Points present in the upper
      trapezius muscle of patients with mechanical cervical pain. This will be compared mainly with
      another manual technique that presents more evidence such as Ischemic Pressure (IP), through
      the evaluation of the Visual Analogical Scale (VAS), the Threshold of Pain at Pressure (TPP)
      and the Northwick Park Questionnaire (NPC) of neck disability, Spanish version.

      The patients, with a minimum sample for the pilot study of 30 subjects, of working age (18-50
      years) with mechanical neck pain for at least the last month, will be recruited from the
      clinic "Fisioterapia Los Molinos" in the town of Getafe, the same place where the treatment
      will be carried out.

      They will be randomly divided into three groups: one will be given Pressure Release of
      Myofascial Trigger Points technique (PRM), another Ischemic Pressure technique (IP), and a
      last one will be assigned as a control group. In compliance with the corresponding ethical
      criteria, the three groups will be subjected to random crossover so that no patient is left
      untreated. Visual Analogical Scale (VAS), Threshold of Pain at Pressure (TPP) and Northwick
      Park Questionnaire (NPC) of neck disability (spanish version), will be evaluated before and
      immediately after treatment.

      Statistical analysis will be performed by IBM SPSS v22.0 program or a later version,
      verifying that the sample meets the criteria of normality and homogeneity and comparing the
      results of the variables through an ANOVA Analysis of variance.
