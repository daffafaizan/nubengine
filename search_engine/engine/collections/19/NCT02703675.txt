      core brain temperature, the study will recruit 8 healthy volunteers, 10 adult normothermic
      participants and 10 adult sick febrile participants from Neurocritical Care ICU in The Ohio
      State University Wexner Medical Center. Before placing the collar around participant's neck,
      the investigators will record the participant's ear temperature and heart rate as a baseline.
      An Excel Cryo Collar will be placed around the participant's neck. After activating the
      cooling element, the investigators will place it within the neck collar.

      The participant's ear temperature will be recorded every 5 minutes. The investigators will
      replace the cooling element every 20 minutes and continue to record the participant's ear
      temperature every 5 minutes. A total of 6 cooling elements will be used over 2 hours. The
      heart rate and blood pressure of the participant will be checked and recorded every 20
      minutes when cooling element is replaced. The participant's bedside shivering assessment
      scale (BSAS) will also be recorded during the study.

      Five adult sick febrile participants will receive 2 rounds of cooling procedure each 2 hours
      long.

      The investigators will analyze data gathered from the study in 2 different ways:

      First, the investigators will run descriptive statistics in three groups of participant to
      find out the following variable: Average temperature drop, average time to mild therapeutic
      hypothermia and change in temperature at the end of study.

      Second, the investigators will compare the difference in achieving temperature drop among
      three groups by comparing mean values of temperature drop in three groups.
