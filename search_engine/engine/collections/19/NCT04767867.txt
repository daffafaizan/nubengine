      pre-oxygenation. Pre-oxygenation increases oxygen reserves in the body with the purpose of
      delaying the time until oxygen desaturation after breathing stops (apnoea) following the
      administration of an anaesthetic. In the last decade, clinicians have begun utilising
      high-flow nasal oxygen for pre-oxygenation. However, the rationale for this is based largely
      on its ability to achieve ongoing oxygenation after the onset of apnoea (apnoeic
      oxygenation). This study isolates oxygen administration with high-flow nasal oxygen to the
      period when the person is breathing, without ongoing oxygen administration during the apnoea
      period, to quantify its effects during the pre-oxygenation period only. A third group of
      participants breathes oxygen through a mouthpiece in addition to receiving oxygen via
      high-flow nasal cannulae. The effect of these pre-oxygenation methods will be measured by the
      time taken until oxygen saturation levels decline to the lower end of the normal range (92%),
      along with other parameters such as blood oxygen levels.
