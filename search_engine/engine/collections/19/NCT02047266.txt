    
      Prospective, single-center, randomized trial, intended to compare three different
      revascularization strategies in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease:

        1. MICS CABG. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery coronary artery bypass grafting (complete
           multivessel minimally invasive off-pump revascularization via left minithoracotomy).
           (MICS CABG group, n=50).

        2. OPCABG. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting treatment (OPCABG group, n=50).

        3. ONCABG. On-pump coronary artery bypass grafting treatment (ONCABG group, n=50). The
           endpoints: The primary endpoints will be death, MI, stroke, or new myocardial ischemia
           and will be target vessel revascularization and non-target vessel revascularization at
           30 days, 12 months and 3-year follow-up.

      The secondary endpoints: Procedural success, Procedural and post-procedural blood loss and
      number of transfusions, Wound complications, Recovery time, Heart Failure (New York Heart
      Association (NYHA)), Life quality assessed by one of the life quality questionnaires.
