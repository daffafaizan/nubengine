      Then the carious lesions belonging to each subject were randomly assigned to two subgroups
      based on different treatment agents used: Group 1; P11-4+NaF/NaF, Group 2;
      P11-4+NaF/CPP-ACP+NaF, Group 3; CPP-ACP+NaF/NaF. Accordingly, test 1 lesions received
      P11-4+NaF combination, test 2 lesions received CPP-ACP+NaF varnish, and control lesions
      received NaF varnish alone. At the 6th and 12th months after the clinical applications,
      Profluorid® Varnish application was repeated for test 1 and control lesions, and MI Varnish™
      application was repeated for test 2 lesions. At the end of the 12 months, carious lesion
      progression status was evaluated radiographically, by using independent visual reading,
      pair-wise visual reading, and digital subtraction radiography (DSR) methods.
