      used to decrease infection risk associated with neutropenia. However pegfilgrastim may induce
      back and leg pain in 20-50% of patients. No intervention has been consistently successful in
      treating or preventing this pain.

      The exact mechanism of pegfilgrastim-induced pain is unknown but may be related to
      histamine-mediated inflammation. Several case reports and anecdotal reports have suggested
      efficacy of antihistamines for this indication.

      This study will have two parts. In the first part (Observational Phase), patients receiving
      pegfilgrastim will be surveyed to document the incidence of significant pegfilgrastim-induced
      back and leg pain. In the second part (Treatment Phase), patients who previously experienced
      such pain will be randomized to receive a 7-day course of either the antihistamine loratadine
      or placebo to determine whether pegfilgrastim-induced back and leg pain can be prevented with
      this intervention.
