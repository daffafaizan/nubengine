      therapy has declined over the past few decades. Helicobacter pylori infection has become
      increasingly resistant to traditional first line treatment regimens because of emerging
      antibiotic resistance coupled with poor patient compliance with completing the treatment

      evaluating new antibiotic combinations and regimens .
