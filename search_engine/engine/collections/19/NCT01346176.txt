      end-of-life decisions (in this case, adults with advance forms of lung disease) and that our
      team can recruit and retain patients in a study of advance care planning. In addition,
      because a larger-scale randomized clinical trial will require that the investigators alert
      participants to the range of possible default options, the investigators must also determine
      the effects that this alerting will have on their selections of life-extending therapies.
      Therefore, the investigators seek to achieve three aims: (1) assess the influence of default
      options in advance directives on patients selections of life-extending therapies; (2)
      determine whether alerting patients to the spectrum of possible default options in advance
      directives influences their selections of life extending therapies; and (3) document the
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining patients with advanced lung diseases from
      university-based clinical settings into a randomized trial of default options in advance
      directives.
