    
      The drug being tested in this study is a new sodium formulation of levothyroxine.
      Levothyroxine (L-Thyroxine Christiaens®) is used in the treatment of hypothyroidism. This
      study will investigate the effect of switching subjects taking levothyroxine to a new
      levothyroxine sodium formulation.

      The results of this study will be used to provide instructions to general practitioners and
      endocrinologists assisting patients on levothyroxine hormone substitution in performing the
      switch to the new formulation.

      The study will enroll approximately 90 patients. Patients receiving the same daily dose of
      L-Thyroxine Christiaens® during the past 6 weeks and with serum thyroid stimulating hormone
      (TSH) levels between 0.4-2.5 mU/L will be switched to the equivalent daily dose of the new
      formulation of levothyroxine. After the switch, patients will be followed up after 2 (± 2
      weeks) and 4 months (± 4 weeks).

      All participants will be asked to take a daily dose at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This study will be conducted in Belgium. Participants will make 3 to 4 visits to the clinic.
