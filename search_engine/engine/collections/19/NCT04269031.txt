    
      This study will be conducted as a single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind
      study to assess the effect of AZD2373 following ascending dose sequential group design
      administrations to healthy male subjects of African ancestry. The study will include 6 single
      dose cohorts with the option to include 2 additional cohorts based on emerging data from
      preceding cohorts in the study.

      Approximately 48 male subjects aged 18 to 55 years at the time of informed consent
      (inclusive) will be randomized with the aim to have 8 subjects participate in each cohort.
      Within each cohort, 6 subjects will receive AZD2373 and 2 subjects will receive placebo.

      Sentinel dosing will be applied for each cohort and will be divided into 2 groups:

        -  Group 1 (sentinel group): 1 active, 1 placebo;

        -  Group 2 (the rest of the cohort): 5 active, 1 placebo. The safety data of up to 72 hours
           post-dose in Group 1 will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator (PI) before the
           subjects in Group 2 are dosed.

      The study will comprise:

        -  A Screening Period of maximum 35 days;

        -  A Treatment Period during which subjects will be resident at the Clinical Unit from the
           day before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration (Day -1) until at
           least 72 hours after IMP administration; discharged from the Clinical Unit on Day 4;

        -  Follow-up Visits on 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 weeks (Visits 3 to 10); and

        -  A Final Follow up Visit 10 weeks after the last IMP dose.

      The visit occurring at 5 weeks post dose (Visit 5) is optional. The expected duration for any
      subject participating in the study is approximately 10 weeks (excluding an up to 28-day
      Screening Period).
