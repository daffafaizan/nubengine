      to children and is associated with wider societal and healthcare costs. Previous analysis of
      the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence found significant
      associations between physical and sexual IPV and self-reported ill-health, symptomatology and
      suicidal behaviours.

      Real experience of IPV can comprise different combinations of emotional, physical and sexual
      abuse, and different timings and frequencies of these. A more nuanced testing of exposure to
      these different combinations of IPV and associations with health is needed.

      This study uses data from 29,990 women from 12 different countries collected by the WHO
      multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence to capture the effect of
      different combination types, frequency and timing of IPV on self-reported health, symptoms
      and suicidal behaviours.
