      starting from week 14-16 of pregnancy to post-partum week 28. The enrollment from
      approximately 7 centers will be in blocks for sample balance. By using the randomized table,
      280 HBeAg-positive pregnant women with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio in to two arms. Group assignments will be also stratified by the maternal HBV DNA
      levels >9 log10 versus â‰¤ 9 log10 IU/mL.

      Group A: This is the experimental group. Participating mothers will receive TDF (oral 300 mg
      tablet daily) starting at gestational weeks 14-16 and continue until delivery. The mothers
      will be followed together with their infants until postpartum week 28. Infants will receive
      hepatitis B vaccine at birth (within 12 hours) and additional hepatitis B vaccine at the age
      of week 4 and week 24. HBIg will be omitted for the infants in this group. However, the birth
      dose of HBIg will be provided to infants born to mothers who have poor control of maternal
      viremia (i.e. the levels of HBV DNA >200,000 IU/mL before delivery). Group B: This is the
      comparative group. Participating mothers will receive TDF (oral 300 mg tablet daily) starting
      at gestational weeks 28 and continue until delivery. Patients in group B will have similar
      follow-up schedules as those in the experimental group. Infants will receive hepatitis B
      vaccine plus HBIg at birth (within 12 hours) and additional hepatitis B vaccine at the age of
      week 4 and week 24.
