      metabolites 3'hydroxycotinine and cotinine)as a simple and clinically feasible biomarker for
      the rate of nicotine metabolism. The investigators hypothesize that a faster rate of
      metabolism leads to faster elimination of nicotine from the body and a more rapid dissipation
      of brain tolerance to nicotine in the interval between cigarettes, leading in turn to (1)
      more severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms and (2) greater subjective reward from the cigarette
      smoked following deprivation. These effects would help to explain why smokers with faster
      rates of nicotine metabolism have a poorer response to smoking cessation therapy when
      compared to those with slower rates of metabolism.

      The investigators will explore the relationship of the NMR to the endophenotypes of
      withdrawal, craving and reward, with the assumption that these factors are likely
      intermediaries for the mechanism linking nicotine metabolism to tobacco dependence and
      smoking cessation rates with pharmacotherapy. Our study design uses a brief (6 hour) interval
      of smoking abstinence followed by a "reward" cigarette to elicit the subjective responses
      relating to withdrawal and reward. Because smoking behavior and severity of nicotine
      dependence vary by race and sex the investigators will also compare the relationship between
      NMR and withdrawal and reward in African American vs white smokers and in men vs women.

      Secondary analyses will examine whether nicotine half-life mediates the observed effects of
      NMR on primary response measures.
