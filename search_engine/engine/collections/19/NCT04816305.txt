      randomized using a website (randomization.com) by a non-involved researcher.

      All patients and volunteers will be assigned to groups (arms) after being tried:

      (i) rTMS-DIR: in which the patients will be submitted to a customized treatment with
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) based in neurophysiological assessments;
      (ii) rTMS: patients will be submitted to standard treatment in the lesioned or non-lesioned
      hemisphere based in neurophysiological assessments; (iii) rTMS sham: each patient will
      receive a sham intervention that emits the same sound as the real stimulation;

      In each group, the patients will be submitted to 10 sessions for two weeks, five days a week
      in which will receive the rTMS followed by 45 minutes of neurofunctional physiotherapy. All
      outcomes will be assessed before and after the 10 sessions.
