      metastatic disease in intrahepatic, extrahepatic or hilar locations. To relieve obstructive
      decompression and jaundice as a result of the obstruction, endoscopic stent placement is
      usually required. Compared with surgical intervention, stent insertion offers shorter
      hospitalization, lower overall cost and lower morbidity. Previous studies have shown the
      superiority of SEMSs over plastic stents for maintaining biliary drainage. However, SEMS can
      occlude due to epithelial hyperplasia, tumor in-/overgrowth, biofilm deposition and sludge
      formation. Studies have showed that the median SEMS patency is 120 days. Once bile duct
      obstruction reoccurs, it may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, long-term
      patency of the SEMS remains an unresolved issue.

      Recently, endoscopic biliary radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have been used in patients
      suffering from inoperable malignant bile duct obstruction, and increasing the duration of
      stent patency. It delivers a high amount of thermal energy to target tissue with curative or
      palliative intent. The purpose of this study is to record information and evaluate the impact
      of radiofrequency ablation in improving the management of cholangiocarcinoma or malignant
      bile duct obstruction, and to compare the effects of SEMS plus RFA to SEMS alone.
