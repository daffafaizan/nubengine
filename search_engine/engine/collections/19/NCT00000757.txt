      that, although serum anti-gp160 antibody responses were detected, the level and duration of
      those responses were limited. A preliminary observation suggests that weak functional
      antibody responses may develop following the 18 month booster of 40 or 80 mcg; therefore, a
      dose of gp160 vaccine having potentially greater immunogenicity is of particular interest.

      Healthy volunteers are injected on days 0, 30, 180, and 365 with either 160 mcg gp160 vaccine
      (20 volunteers) or an alum placebo preparation (10 volunteers).
