      unappreciated vitamin D metabolites, notably 3 epi-25(OH)D348 and sulfated 25(OH)D3, in
      virtually all human sera and circulating in amounts that vary widely between individuals.
      These compounds may be measured by current "25(OH)D" assays,46, 63 and thereby confound
      accuracy of such measurements. Secondly, substantial but inadequately understood variability
      of 25(OH)D response to supplementation and UV exposure exists.15, 42-44 It is likely that
      currently unappreciated genetic and/or physiologic factors, e.g., differences in absorption
      or degradation, underpin these observations. Our panel will allow definition of these
      differences. Finally, the inadequacy of our current approach to classify vitamin D status
      (singular 25(OH)D measurement) is exemplified by the great between-individual variability in
      the PTH/25(OH)D relationship as noted above.8, 64 Thus, the investigators believe that
      exploration of a "vitamin D assay panel," consisting of measurements that reflect input
      (cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol) and confounders to the 25(OH)D assay [3 epi-25(OH)D and
      sulfated 25(OH)D] is essential to accurately define optimal vitamin D status and to determine
      the ideal approach for vitamin D repletion.

      To begin testing this hypothesis, the Specific Aims of this research are to document the
      vitamin D profile response defined as change in serum concentration of:

        1. 25(OH)D

        2. cholecalciferol

        3. 3 epi-25(OH)D

        4. Sulfated 25(OH)D following four months of supplementation with 2,200 IU of daily vitamin
           D3 in postmenopausal women. Our primary outcome variable is the effect of
           supplementation on serum 25(OH)D3; secondary outcomes are change in cholecalciferol, 3
           epi-25(OH)D3 and sulfated 25(OH)D3.
