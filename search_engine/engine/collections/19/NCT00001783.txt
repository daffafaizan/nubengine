      linked with customarily used Rehabilitation Medicine accelerates motor recovery after stroke.
      Additionally, if motor recovery occurs, this study will allow identification of the brain
      regions activated in association with this recovery.

      Techniques used will include longitudinal rating of motor function, neuro-imaging with
      positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance tomography (fMRI),
      electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Patients will be
      assigned to one of the two groups: amph linked with PT, and placebo linked with PT. Every
      patient will receive the standard of care PT. Motor recovery will be evaluated in the two
      groups. If motor recovery is accelerated in any of the groups, then neuroimaging and
      neurophysiological data will allow identification of areas and networks in the brain
      associated with this recovery.

      This is a Phase II study with potential major impact on how stroke patients are treated.
