      However, a growing body of evidence indicates that EPO has tissue-protective effects and
      prevents tissue damage during ischemia. In an ex vivo proof-of-concept, protective effects of
      EPO have been shown in human myocardium.

      Several studies have demonstrated that acute normovolemic hemodilution before aortic cross
      clamping decreases perioperative myocardial damage. We hypothesized that the onset of acute
      anemia increases the endogenous EPO concentration, which explains the cardioprotective
      effects of acute normovolemic hemodilution.
