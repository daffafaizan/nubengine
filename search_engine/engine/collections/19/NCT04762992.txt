      30% of stillbirths (Nardozza et al. 2017). Early FGR is associated with substantial
      disturbances of placental implantation and fetal hypoxia, which requires fetal cardiovascular
      adaptation. Both maternal and fetal Doppler alterations are present, allowing for risk
      stratification and monitoring (Arbeille et al. 1995, Nardozza et al. 2017a). Although the
      precise etiology for FGR due to placental causes is unknown, placental thrombosis, infarcts
      and hypercoagulability are frequently seen, suggesting a role for the activation of the
      coagulation cascade in the genesis of FGR (Elder et al. 1976, Bellart et al. 1998, Fuke at
      al. 1994). Currently, the management of early FGR is limited to the monitoring of fetal
      Doppler parameters until the risks for preterm delivery outweight the benefits of ongoing
      monitoring (Seravalli et al. 2015). As such, there is a special need for effective preventive
      and therapeutic interventions that improve the outcomes. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),
      for its anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties has been suggested as a possible
      therapeutic agent in this setting (Tyrell et al. 1995, Yu et al. 2004, Yu et al. 2010). We
      will randomize the participants to two intervention arms in a one-to-one ratio, using a
      computer generated randomization program. The randomization will be stratified for
      gestational age at diagnosis of FGR (22 to 26 weeks and >26 to 32 weeks). The experimental
      group will be administered enoxaparin subcutaneous injections (40 mg, 4000 IU daily) and the
      control group will be administered placebo subcutaneous injections (NaCL 0.9%, 0.4 mL). Both
      groups will start intervention immediately after the diagnosis of FGR, and will continue it
      until 36 weeks of gestation or 12 hours before delivery, whichever comes first.
