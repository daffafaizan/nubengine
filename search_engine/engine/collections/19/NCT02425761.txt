      shunt insertion techniques, anterior and posterior entry site. There is conflicting
      information and opinions in the pediatric hydrocephalus literature regarding entry site's
      effect on shunt survival. This trial is designed to detect a 10% or more difference in the
      rate of shunt survival at one year between the two techniques.

      The trial will be conducted by the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network and the
      Hydrocephalus Association. It is a four year study with an estimated sample size of 448
      patients. Patients will be randomized in the operating room. Subjects will be followed for a
      minimum of 18 months.
