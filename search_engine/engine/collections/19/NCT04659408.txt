      participate in an intervention consisting of a four-week intake of probiotic, using the
      commercially available multistrain probiotic preparation "BactoSan pro FOS" from Mepha
      (Basel, Switzerland), followed by a four-week wash-out period, and a four-week prebiotic
      intervention using "Naturaplan Bio Oat Bran" (Coop, Switzerland). Total duration of the study
      will be 16 weeks.
