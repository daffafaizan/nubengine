    
      Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of death among the "communicable" diseases in the world.
      Pulmonary TB, the main localization, leads to the dissemination of cases. An earlier
      diagnosis of contagious pulmonary TB is a cornerstone to stop the air transmission by
      starting earlier treatment. The aim of the study will be to compare two strategies, in
      patients with a chest-X-ray in favour of pulmonary TB: the classical strategy of sputa
      collection during three consecutive early mornings, versus the studied strategy of sputa
      collection at hour h, hour h+1, hour h+2 during the first early morning.
