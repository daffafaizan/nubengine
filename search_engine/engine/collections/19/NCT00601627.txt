      Primary

        -  To evaluate the 1-year survival rate in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
           treated with panitumumab and continuous infusion fluorouracil administered concurrently
           with external-beam radiotherapy followed by gemcitabine and panitumumab.

      Secondary

        -  To determine overall survival, time to disease progression, confirmed response rate,
           duration of response, and time to treatment failure in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To determine adverse events in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Panitumumab and chemoradiotherapy : Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once
           daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-38. Patients also receive
           panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 15, and 29 and fluorouracil IV continuously over
           24 hours daily OR oral capecitabine twice daily beginning on day 1 and continuing
           through the last day of radiotherapy.

        -  Panitumumab and chemotherapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after completion of panitumumab and
           chemoradiotherapy, patients receive panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15 and
           gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
           3 courses. Patients then proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15.
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.
