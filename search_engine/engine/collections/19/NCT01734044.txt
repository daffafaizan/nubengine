      of 200 primary ITP adult patients from 14 medical centers in China. One part of the
      participants are randomly selected to receive recombinant human thrombopoietin (given
      subcutaneously at a dose of 300Units/kg for7-14 consecutive days, following with a flexible
      dosage depending on platelet count until the 28th day), combining with dexamethasone (given
      intravenously at a dose of 40 mg per day for 4days, the others are selected to receive
      high-dose of dexamethasone treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 40 mg daily for 4
      days). Platelet count was evaluated before and after treatment, in order to report the
      conversion ratio of primary ITP to chronic ITP.
