      fat. Recent clinical trials in obese subjects have found that low-carbohydrate diets result
      in greater weight loss compared with low-fat diets on a time scale of months when diet
      adherence was likely the highest. One hypothesis regarding the mechanism of improved weight
      loss with low carbohydrate diets is that such diets significantly modify the body s hormonal
      milieu to influence metabolic regulation and energy expenditure. Low-carbohydrate diets may
      thereby offer a metabolic advantage over low fat diets. In addition, low-carbohydrate diets
      may also decrease hunger or increase satiety compared to low-fat diets.

      Determining the mechanism whereby one diet leads to greater weight loss than another is
      hampered by the inability to accurately measure food intake or physical activity in an
      outpatient setting. Thus, an inpatient feeding study lasting many weeks is required to
      accurately measure energy balance differences between isocaloric diets that differ in
      macronutrient composition. In this pilot multicenter cross-over study in 16 overweight and
      class I obese men, we will measure changes in energy expenditure in response to 4 weeks of
      inpatient feeding of a eucaloric, very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (5% Carbohydrate, 15%
      Protein, 80% Fat) immediately following an inpatient period of at least 4 weeks of consuming
      an energy balanced standard American diet (50% Carbohydrate, 15 % Protein, 35% Fat).
