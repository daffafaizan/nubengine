      diagnosed or relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, high risk chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia, or prolymphocytic leukemia treated with irinotecan. II. Determine the toxicity of
      this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the level of DNA topoisomerase I mRNA and
      protein, as well as SN-38 induced topoisomerase I-DNA complex formation, with the clinical
      response and toxicity in these patients. IV. Determine if a down regulation of topoisomerase
      I or altered subcellular distribution of this enzyme is involved in the drug resistance to
      irinotecan.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment
      repeats every 6 weeks for 2-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
