      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR) and partial
      response (PR) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma
      (TCC) harboring a TSC1 mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sapanisertib (MLN0128) (TAK-228) in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic TCC harboring a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation.

      II. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ORR in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TCC harboring a TSC2
      mutation.

      II. To evaluate toxicity, PFS, and OS in TSC2 mutation patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks and every 6 months
      thereafter.
