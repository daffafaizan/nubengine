      The most empirically supported treatment for stress-related disorders is cognitive behaviour
      therapy (CBT), but accessibility is low and most patients in primary care do not receive this
      evidence-based treatment. Collaborative care has been shown to be an effective working model
      for primary care patients with mental health problems. In this study collaborative care is
      conducted by a nurse who provides the patient with self-management support. This intervention
      has been implemented at Gustavsbergs primary care clinic in Stockholm as a means to increase
      accessibility and quality of care for the large group of patients with stress-related
      ill-health (operationalized as ICD-11 adjustment disorder). This type of care intervention
      has however not been compared against CBT, which is arguably the gold standard treatment for
      this patient group.

      Our research group has developed and tested an Internet-based CBT (ICBT) for stress-related
      ill health, which has been shown to be effective and also potentially very suitable for the
      primary care context. The overarching purpose of this project is to investigate if
      implementation of two treatment models - collaborative care and ICBT - can be effective as
      early interventions for primary care patients with stress-related ill-health.

      Main research question: Is a brief collaborative care intervention provided by a nurse at
      least as effective as ICBT delivered by a psychologist for primary care patients with mild to
      moderate symptoms of stress (ICD-11 adjustment disorder)?
