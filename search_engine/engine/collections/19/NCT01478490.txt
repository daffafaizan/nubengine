      the study. Genotype expression is confirmed by dextromethorphan phenotyping.

      Part I: The pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of YM178 is compared in 8 healthy male
      subjects genotyped and phenotyped as poor metaboliser (PM) for CYP2D6 and in 8 healthy male
      subjects genotyped and phenotyped as extensive metaboliser (EM) for CYP2D6.

      Part II: The effect of YM178 on the model substrate of CYP2D6 metoprolol is evaluated, using
      a cross-over design, in 12 healthy male subjects genotyped and phenotyped as EM for CYP2D6.
