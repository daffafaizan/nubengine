      However, studies assessing the herb's effectiveness in older adults with symptoms of
      Alzheimer's disease are limited. This study will determine the effect of sage extract on the
      cognitive function of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.

      This study will last 6 weeks and will comprise 4 study visits, approximately 10 days apart.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sage pills or no treatment during
      each 10-day period. The treatment assignments will be switched in 10-day intervals, so that
      during the course of the study, each participant will undergo two periods of sage treatment
      and two periods without treatment. At each study visit, participants will undergo cognitive
      testing, including tests to determine attention, memory, and visual cognition. Participants
      will also undergo an electroencephalogram (EEG) and an electrocardiogram (ECG) at each visit.
