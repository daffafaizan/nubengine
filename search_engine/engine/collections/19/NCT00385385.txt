      weeks on carotid atherosclerotic disease progression in patients who test positive for
      Chlamydia pneumoniae. Measurements of the carotid artery wall (intima-media thickness) and
      plaque characteristics will be evaluated with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) and carotid ultrasound. at Baseline and at 6,12 and 18 months following initiation of
      drug treatment in Chlamydia pneumoniae seropositive patients with a history of
      atherosclerotic disease. Biomarkers will be collected throughout the study. Safety will be
      evaluated by the collection and analysis of laboratory parameters, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, physical examination and adverse events. Seventy two patients will be
      enrolled in this study. There will be a total of approximately 7-9 visits which will occur
      over an 18 month period.
