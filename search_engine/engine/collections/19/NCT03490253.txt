      and text messaging system through three iterative phases of UCD with ten patients each (total
      n=30). The first phase consisted of 1.5-hour individual semi-structured interviews. Findings
      from phase 1 were used to inform content and information delivery decisions of the final
      intervention, including selecting the thematic message categories and the design. In the
      second phase, patients tested out an early prototype of the mobile application through
      usability testing. Patients tested the final DIAMANTE intervention including thematic message
      content and the application in the third, final UCD phase, in order to address any
      user-related issues prior to launching the randomized control trial.

      In the DIAMANTE Randomized Controlled Trial, we aim to examine the effect of a smartphone app
      that uses reinforcement learning to predict the most effective messages for increasing
      physical activity. We will recruit 276 low-income minority patients with depression and
      diabetes within he San Francisco Health Network. We will compare this intervention to static
      messages with health management content, and a control group that only receives a weekly mood
      message.
