      treated on more than one regimen, if they meet the eligibility requirements.

      Patients on regimen A are adults and receive uridine triphosphate (UTP) by inhalation,
      followed immediately by bronchoscopy.

      Patients on regimen B are children, aged 4 to 10 years. Patients receive up to 4 graded doses
      of UTP by inhalation on day 1. On day 2, patients receive a single dose of UTP. Patients
      receive amiloride followed by UTP by inhalation on day 3.

      Patients on regimen C are children, aged 4 to 18 years. Patients inhale a radiolabelled
      (technetium 99m) monodisperse iron oxide aerosol. Radiation deposited in the patient's lungs
      is monitored. Patients are randomized to receive one of 4 different aerosols (vehicle; UTP;
      amiloride; or UTP plus amiloride), which is inhaled for 20 minutes. Patients are followed 24
      hours after aerosol exposure.

      Regimen D is a dose escalation study in which patients are aged 9 to 40 years. Patients
      receive either the vehicle or UTP by inhalation 3 times daily for 3 days. Cohorts of 4
      patients each are entered at each dose level.
