    
      This is a Phase II open-label, 2-Part, multi-center study in Japan. The study will be
      conducted in two parts: Part 1 (Cohort 1) includes participants regardless of prior CDK4/6
      inhibitor use and is designed to determine the recommended dose (RD), evaluate the
      tolerability and safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant. Part 2 consists of 2
      cohorts (the CDK4/6 inhibitor naive participants are in Cohort 2 and the CDK4/6 inhibitor
      pre-treated participants are in Cohort 3) which are designed to assess the efficacy and
      safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant, will start once the RD of alpelisib is
      established.

      Participants will be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason and will be followed for
      survival regardless of treatment discontinuation reason (except if consent is withdrawn or
      participant is lost to follow up).
