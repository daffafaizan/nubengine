      be decreased and if patient exposure to x-rays can be reduced by utilizing an ultrasound to
      diagnose and confirm reduction in shoulder dislocations.

      This study also seeks to determine if patients prefer ultrasound to x-ray when used to treat
      their shoulder dislocation.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: either x-rays or ultrasound for
      the diagnosis and reduction confirmation of your shoulder dislocation.

      Participant's shoulder dislocation will be treated per standard of care.

      Participants will be asked to complete a short survey at the end of their visit.
