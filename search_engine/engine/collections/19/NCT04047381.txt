    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia with a reported incidence of
      2.1% in Turkish population aged 60 and above. Although a minority of patients have minimal or
      no symptoms, palpitations, dyspnea and fatigue are frequently reported by AF patients. It is
      well documented that AF patients, including those with no symptoms, have poorer quality of
      life (QoL) compared to healthy population. Worrying about their condition, side effects of
      treatments and worsening health are the other factors that have an impact on QoL, beside
      symptoms. Management of QoL is a key therapeutic goal in AF treatment and guidelines
      recommend that QoL in these patients should be measured regularly. There is a concern in the
      literature that generic QoL measures may not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to measure
      AF related QoL, thus using disease specific QoL measures are recommended for AF patients. An
      AF-specific quality of life measure is lacking in Turkish language, thus our aim in this
      study is to validate the Turkish version of 'Atrial Fibrillation Impact Questionnaire
      (AFImpact)' in Turkish AF patients.
