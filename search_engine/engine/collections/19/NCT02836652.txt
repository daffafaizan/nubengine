    
      This is a post-market clinical study of HM II patient management practices to be conducted in
      the United States.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the following research drug groups:

        1. Treatment Arm: Warfarin (INR target: 2.0-2.5, median: 2.25) + Placebo (1 pill/day)

        2. Control Arm: Warfarin (INR target: 2.0-2.5, median: 2.25) + ASA Therapy (81mg/day)

      The study will investigate if subjects in the Treatment Arm experience a reduced incidence of
      non-surgical bleeding, without an increased risk of thromboembolic events.
