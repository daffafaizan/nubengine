      a target enrollment of 3,000 patients from 60 centres of the Northeast China. Eligible
      patients are as follows: (1) definite acute ischemic stroke; (2) neurological deficit: 4 ≤
      NIHSS ≤ 10; (3) time from onset to drug treatment: within 48 hours.

      Patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group will receive a 300mg loading dose of clopidogrel,
      followed by clopidogrel 75 mg/d and aspirin 75 mg/d from day 2 to day 14, and followed by
      clopidogrel 75 mg/d or aspirin 100 mg/d from day 15 to day 90.

      Patients in the aspirin-alone group will receive 100-300 mg aspirin from day 1 to day 14,
      followed by aspirin 100 mg/d from day 15 to day 90.

      The primary efficacy end point is early neurological deterioration assessed as a change of
      NIHSS: no change of NIHSS within 14 days.
