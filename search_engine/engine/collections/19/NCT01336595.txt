      femoral knee component had beneficial wear properties in vitro, there are conflicting
      clinical results. The purpose of the present study was to compare the clinical, subjective,
      and radiographic results as well as the weight, size and shape of polyethylene wear particles
      in the patients with an oxidized zirconium and a cobalt-chromium femoral knee component.
