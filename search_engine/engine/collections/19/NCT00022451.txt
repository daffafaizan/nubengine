      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of tipifarnib in pediatric
           patients with refractory leukemia.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Analyze the gene expression profile of leukemic blasts from these patients before and
           after treatment with this drug.

        -  Determine circulating levels of nerve growth factor and correlate these levels with
           clinical neurotoxicity from this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib every 12 hours on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 9 additional patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-34 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
