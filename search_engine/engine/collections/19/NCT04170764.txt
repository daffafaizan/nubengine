      hemoglobin levels is routine practice at Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates, TriHealth Inc.
      after pelvic reconstructive surgery.

      There is minimal data supporting this practice. Multiple studies throughout the gynecology
      literature suggest that this is not a necessary or cost effective strategy to assess for
      postoperative anemia. Most patients who require blood transfusion or reoperation for bleeding
      will show clinical signs of anemia.

      The investigators aim to determine if checking a routine CBC results in clinically relevant
      changes to patient care in women undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery with vaginal
      hysterectomy for treatment of pelvic organ prolapse.
