      Primary: (While uterus is under tension)

        -  To determine the shortest distance from the ureter to the uterine vessels.

        -  To determine the distances from the ureter to the gonadal vessels in infundibulo-pelvic
           (IP) at the pelvic sidewall. This will be defined at the distance from the IP ligament
           at the level of the pelvic sidewall to the point on the ureter directly below these
           vessels

        -  To determine the distances from the ureter to the gonadal vessels in the
           infundibulo-pelvic (IP) ligament at the point where the gonadal vessels enter in to the
           ovary. This will be defined as the distance from where the vessels in the IP enter the
           ovary to the point on the ureter directly below this.

      Secondary

        -  To determine thermal spread from the Ligasure, and Harmonic device using H&E and Movat
           staining.

        -  To determine the burst pressure of segments of IP ligament that have undergone Ligasure
           or Harmonic electrosurgery.
