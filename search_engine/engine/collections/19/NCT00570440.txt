      pregnancy rates, continuation rates, and acceptability of COCs in women taking COCs by the
      21/7 cyclic regimen compared with the continuous use of COCs with bleeding-signaled
      hormone-free intervals. The primary objective is to determine whether continuous COC use
      leads to higher 12-month continuation rates than use of the standard 28-day COC regimen.
      Secondary objectives are to 1) compare pregnancy probabilities through 6 and 12 months
      between the continuous use group and the 28-day group 2) compare COC continuation rates
      through 6 months between the continuous use group and the 28-day group 3) compare
      acceptability of the two COC regimens 4) to compare bleeding and other side effects between
      the continuous use group and the 28-day group 5) to compare hemoglobin/hematocrit between the
      continuous use group and the 28-day group
