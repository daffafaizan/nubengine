      radical prostatectomy (RP) patients who undergo Decipher testing to those who do not. 350
      subjects from within the statewide Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative
      (MUSIC) will be randomized to either a Genomic Classifier (Decipher) or Usual-Care-Based (UC)
      strategy for a period of three months. If enrolled during the Genomic Classifier period, both
      subjects and their treating physician will be provided Decipher results and CAPRA-S scores.
      In the UC periods, CAPRA-S scores but not Decipher results will be provided.
