      to engage students in Physical Activity (PA) through the day, but is limited when physical
      education programs have insufficient curricular, time, financial and staffing allocations. A
      growing body of research supports the premise that interventions focused on increasing
      physical activity in schools may be more successful if supported by evidence that increased
      PA improves academic achievement, that is the clear priority for limited school time and
      resources.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a school-based physical activity
      intervention on fourth and fifth grade elementary students' academic achievement, as measured
      by standardized test scores. Baseline information about current physical activity practices
      will be collected. Schools will receive ongoing in-person and virtual training, and schools
      will be provided physical activity equipment, resources, and teaching aids. Student
      accelerometer data will allow for monitoring of physical activity levels. This study seeks to
      address gaps in the literature by studying the efficacy of a well-established intervention
      that has been shown to impact school physical activities practices, and shows promise of
      efficacy for improving student education outcomes.
