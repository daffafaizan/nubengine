      students with no previous experience in intubation.

      Part two: This was a convenience sample of patients undergoing elective surgery. All patients
      were consented. The subjects were physicians and nurse anesthetists who were going to be
      intubated in the operating room setting.

      For both parts of the study, the subjects viewed the glottic opening using direct
      laryngoscopy followed or preceded by visualization of the glottic opening using the
      Trachview. The subjects were asked to score the amount of the glottic opening that could be
      visualized using the POGO (percent of glottic opening)score. Subjects were only given a very
      brief inservice on how to use the Trachview. Additional measurements such as presurgical
      airway assessments of the patients were obtained.
