      and the Penumbra System in Europe. Consecutive patients presenting within 6 hours from
      symptom onset with an acute ischemic stroke (within the internal carotid artery and internal
      carotid terminus, middle cerebral - M1/M2 segments) due to anterior circulation large vessel
      occlusion (LVO) will be treated using the ADAPT technique with thrombo-aspiration as first
      intention and site routine practice.

      The follow-up visit will occur 24 hours, 7-10 days or discharge, 30 days and 90 days
      post-procedure and will review patient's functional outcome, quality of life, and adverse
      events.
