      preparations and vitamins, minerals and supplements that you take. Information about you
      (such as age or gender), the status of the disease (such as cancer diagnosis and extent of
      disease), and your Emergency Center visit (such as your reason for visit and discharge
      diagnosis) will be collected from your medical record.

      To find out if your answers on the questionnaire are correct regarding the medications you
      take, researchers will check the pharmacy database for medications you fill at the M. D.
      Anderson pharmacy, your medical record, and contact any outside pharmacy that you may use to
      fill your medicines, with your permission. In order for outside pharmacies to release the
      requested medication information, you will need to sign an Authorization for Disclosure of
      Health Information from Pharmacy Records.

      Your information will be kept confidential. All patient data will be reported and published
      as a group. You will not be individually identified. Data will be stored with patient codes
      so that your identity will be protected. In addition, the study database will be password
      protected.

      You may be contacted in the future for more information; however, you are not obligated to
      answer any future questions just because you agreed to participate in this study.

      This is an investigational study. About 350 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
