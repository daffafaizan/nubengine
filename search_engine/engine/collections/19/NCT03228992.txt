      efficacy study. Healthy male or female subjects who have a history of occasional muscle
      soreness and are not currently exercising will be asked to volunteer for the study. All
      subjects will complete an informed consent process prior to study procedures.

      The study duration is anticipated to be approximately 4 months. Each subject may be in the
      study for up to 45 days including screening, run-in, inpatient and outpatient dosing and
      assessments, follow-up visit and follow-up telephone contact.
