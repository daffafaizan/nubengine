    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the cumulative incidence of extensive chronic graft versus host disease
      (GVHD) at 1 year after transplantation utilizing the novel conditioning/GVHD prophylactic
      regimen for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, in patients
      who do not progress before day 100.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate clinical response, engraftment rate, progression-free survival (PFS) at one
      year and, overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the cumulative incidence of relapse. III. To evaluate the day 100
      transplant-related mortality rate. IV. To determine the cumulative incidence of grade III-IV
      acute GVHD.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of melphalan hydrochloride.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days -5 to -2 and melphalan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day -2. Patients
      undergo total body irradiation (TBI) on day -1.

      STEM CELL INFUSION: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 3-4,
      mycophenolate mofetil IV over 2 hours on days 5-35, and tacrolimus IV and then orally (PO)
      once tolerated on days 5-180 with a taper beginning on day 100.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months and then annually
      thereafter.
