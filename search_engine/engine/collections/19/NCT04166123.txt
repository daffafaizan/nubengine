      criterion-related validity, predictive validity and construct validity of Elderly Health
      Questionnaire in assessing frailty risk of community-dwelling older adults.

      The investigators conduct a prospective study to require data of health states, function,
      lifestyle and quality of life in community-dwelling older adults ,and will recruit about 150
      subjects in NTUH and communities in Taipei City. The investigators analyze the (change)
      scores of Elderly Health Questionnaire to test the internal consistency and test-retest
      reliability. Also, the investigators test the correlation between the scores of Elderly
      Health Questionnaire and the scores of the other measurements (i.e., HELP-T, WHOQOL-BREF,
      MoCA, SPPB, UPSA-B) to validate the concurrent validity, and the correlation between the
      scores of Elderly Health Questionnaire and the scores of CFS to validate predictive validity.
      The construct validity is validated by exploratory factor analysis.
