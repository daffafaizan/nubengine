      (NCT01535326, 01699399, and 01894191) comparing air insufflation, water immersion and water
      exchange. These studies were conducted at Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital. Permission will be
      obtained from the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review, analyze and report
      de-identified findings.

      Two experienced endoscopists (YHH and CWT) performed all the recorded colonoscopies.
      Recordings will be selected for review if they are complete examinations; include clear
      identification of the appendiceal orifice and/or the ileocecal valve, indicating arrival at
      the cecum; available in the appropriate format for video editing; and contain no patient or
      endoscopist identifiers. Patients with incomplete recordings and a history of bowel resection
      will be excluded from analysis. The included video recordings will be edited to remove the
      insertion phase to blind the study reviewer to the insertion techniques. One blinded reviewer
      uninvolved in the performance of the colonoscopies will be in charge of evaluating the
      selected videos, using the criteria described by Yung et al
