    
      Study will be conducted in adult subjects, above 18 years inclusive, males and non pregnant
      females, diagnosed with chronic open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both eyes.
      Qualifying Intra Ocular Pressure (IOPs) following wash-out, at baseline (Day 0/hour 0 i.e.,
      8:00 am) should be ≥ 22 milli meter mercury (mm Hg) and ≤ 34 mm Hg in each eye and any
      asymmetry of IOP between the eyes no greater than 5 mm Hg.

      Each study subject will use one drop of test or reference Ophthalmic Suspension in both the
      eyes three times daily at approximately 8:00am, 04:00 pm and 10:00 pm for 42 days (6 weeks).
      The dose and mode of treatment chosen in this study is the dosage approved by United States
      Food and Drug administration (US FDA) for use in treatment of patients of Chronic Open Angle
      Glaucoma.

      The study subjects will undergo clinical evaluations throughout the study in order to assess
      efficacy and safety. Study subject primary endpoint evaluation will be assessed after 2 weeks
      (14 days) and 6 weeks (42 days) of treatment for each study subject deemed eligible for
      evaluation, (i.e., at Visit III - Day 14 ± 2 days and Visit IV - Day 42 ± 3 days).

      The primary bioequivalence comparison is between the test and reference products for the mean
      difference in intraocular pressure (IOP) of both eyes at four time points, i.e., at
      approximately 8:00 am and 10:00 am at the Day 14 (± 2 days) and Day 42 (± 3 days) visits.
