      stages because cancer causes remarkable symptoms such as postmenopausal or abnormal bleeding.
      Mostly, it does not spread, detects no metastasis. Endometrial carcinoma is surgically
      staged. Laparotomy or minimally invasive surgery can be performed for treatment and staging.
      Patients have been operated for staging surgery, have a larger surgical incision, longer
      operation period, more complications, more intensive care units need. Nowadays, researchers
      show us that there is no difference in overall survival and prognosis between surgery with or
      without lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer. With all these improvements in gynecologic
      oncology leads us to minimally invasive surgery. Patients undergo sentinel lymph node
      detection by using fluorescence imaging with an indocyanine green solution. Two different
      ways used to assess SLND. The first group who the cervix is injected superficially with 1 mL
      of ICG ( indocyanine green) at 4 and 8 o'clock quadrans. The second group who ICG has
      injected the uterine cavity during hysteroscopy. The investigator's aim is to assess and
      compare the performance of two approaches for sentinel lymph node ( SLND) biopsy.
