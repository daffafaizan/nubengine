    
      This is a randomized (treatment assigned by chance), double-blind (patient and investigator
      will not know what treatment is being given), multicenter, parallel-group, exploratory study
      in adult Japanese patients with moderate atopic dermatitis. This study will include 3 phases.
      In the screening phase, patients' eligibility will be determined. During the treatment phase,
      eligible patients will receive JNJ-39758979, 300 or 100 mg once daily, or placebo (a
      treatment that looks like JNJ-39758979, but contains no active agent) for up to 6 weeks.
      Study visits will occur at the end of Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6. There will be a follow-up visit 4
      weeks after dosing is complete. The duration of participation in the study for an individual
      patient may be up to 14 weeks (including screening). Patient safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
