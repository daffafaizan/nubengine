      including assessment and treatment guidelines to improve non-VA community mental health care
      for OEF/OIF Veterans with TBI and co-occurring behavioral health issues within the state of
      Colorado. In addition to the development of assessment and treatment guidelines, other
      products developed through this study will include a training and accompanying toolkit, which
      may be used for annual educational training of mental health providers. As such, there are no
      hypotheses associated with this study. This statewide initiative may not only improve quality
      and access to non-VA community mental health care for persons with TBI and co-occurring
      behavioral health issues within Colorado, but also serve as a model for implementation across
      the country.
