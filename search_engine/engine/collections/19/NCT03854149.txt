      due to the progress of surgical techniques and optimal medical management. Non-valvular
      atrial arrhythmias (AA) carries a significant burden for long-term morbidity and potentially
      mortality in ACHD patients. AA occur three times more frequently in ACHD compared to the
      general population. When complicating ACHD, AA convey a twofold increase in the risk for
      stroke, contributing to an up to 100-fold higher prevalence of stroke in the ACHD population
      compared to age-matched healthy controls. At present, the European Society of Cardiology
      (ESC) Guidelines suggest oral anticoagulation (OAC) in all adult patients with AA and
      intracardiac repair, cyanosis, Fontan palliation, or systemic right ventricle. In the
      remaining ACHD patients with AA, OAC is suggested if CHA2DS2-Vasc (congestive heart failure,
      hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular
      disease, age 65 to 74 years, sex category) score is ≥1 (Class of recommendation IIa, level of
      evidence C).

      Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly preferred over vitamin-K
      antagonists (VKAs) in most clinical scenarios due to improved safety (with regard to
      intracranial and other major bleeding) and efficacy (prevention of embolic stroke or systemic
      embolism) along with the convenience they offer for patients and physicians (fixed dose, no
      food and drug interactions, no INR monitoring). On the other hand, scarce data is available
      on the use of NOAC in ACHD.

      In order to address this gap in evidence, we propose a prospective multicenter single arm,
      observational cohort trial, which will provide data on the efficacy and safety of apixaban
      used for the prevention of thromboembolism in ACHD patients with AA.
