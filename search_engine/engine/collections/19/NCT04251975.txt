    
      Recruitment: It will be recruited subjects with masked hypertension. For that, normotensive
      subjects (Blood pressure (BP)<140/90mmHg in the office) referred to the sleep unit of the
      Hospital Santa Maria (Spain) who are diagnosed of severe OSA (AHI≥30) by a sleep study and
      who do not present significant somnolence (Epworth≤18) will be proposed to participate in the
      study. Then, it will be performed an ABPM during-24 hours, and those subjects with an
      abnormal ABPM results and normal BP in the office will be included, are those subjects called
      masked hypertensive.

      Definition of the groups: Patients will be randomized to receive one of the following
      treatments:

        1. CPAP: Patients who will receive CPAP treatment. The CPAP titration will be carried out
           with an automatic or manual CPAP according to usual clinical practice.

        2. Conservative treatment: Patients who will receive conservative treatment based on
           hygienic-dietetic measures.

      Randomization: It will be carried out with an automated platform

      Duration of the treatment: All patients randomized to CPAP will begin treatment as soon as
      possible after randomization, and will continue treatment until the study ends (3 months).

      Patients who interrupt treatment will be excluded from the study. ABPM and blood sample
      collection will be performed on all included patients at the beginning of the study and at 3
      months under treatment (CPAP or conservative care).

      Follow-up: All patients will be evaluated at the beginning of the study, at first month and
      at three months during the follow-up period.
