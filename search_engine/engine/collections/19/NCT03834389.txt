      given to the experimental group, and classical training was given to the control group.
      Critical thinking scale and self-efficacy scale both before and after the training were
      applied to both groups. Posttest scores were calculated and compared for both groups. The
      focus group consultation with 10 people from the experimental group was carried out and the
      opinions and suggestions about the initiative were taken and evaluated. Permission was
      obtained in writing from all institutions before and after the participants, and the study
      was conducted by creating ethical conditions.Four separate training cases were given to the
      experimental group. the control group continued the classical training and no intervention
      was made.
