      their routine visit using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety
      Disorder 7 (GAD-7). Participants who call in will be asked to provide verbal informed consent
      for phone screening and the IRB approved Screening Questionnaire and the Overall Anxiety
      Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) will be administered.

      Participants who remain eligible after the phone screening will be asked to return for a
      Clinical Interview, Behavioral Session, Biomarker blood draw, (and optional genetics), and
      Neuroimaging Session.

      All participants will be contacted approximately 3-months later and invited to complete the
      same battery of self-report measures completed during the baseline session (described below).
      The self-report measures will be administered through a secure on-line survey database. This
      data will allow investigators to (1) confirm that participants continue to meet initial
      eligibility criteria and are therefore eligible for the full re-test battery and (2) use
      baseline measures of positive and negative valence domains to predict changes in symptoms and
      functioning.

      A subset of 50 participants (n=25 from each UCSD and UCLA) will be randomly selected to
      return approximately three months later to complete the same battery of assessments in the
      Behavioral and Neuroimaging Sessions to establish test-retest reliability of the latent
      constructs.
