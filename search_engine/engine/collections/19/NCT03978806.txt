      culturally tailored peer-navigator (PN) intervention to improve patient-centered and clinical
      outcomes for Latino patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We will compare a
      culturally tailored intervention that includes a PN to control (standard care). In the
      culturally tailored intervention, the bilingual PN will provide support with social
      challenges during 5 visits. We will assess the feasibility of (1) referral, (2) recruitment,
      (3) retention, (4) intervention implementation, and (5) data collection. We will also assess
      various outcomes including inter-dialytic weight gain and other adherence and
      patient-centered outcomes.

      Specific Aim 1: Conduct a pilot RCT of the peer navigator intervention to assess feasibility,
      acceptability, as well as outcomes of the proposed peer navigator intervention.

      Hypothesis 1: A culturally tailored intervention that consists of a
      bilingual/culture-concordant peer navigator that provides support with social challenges for
      Latino end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients, is feasible and acceptable.

      Hypothesis: A culturally tailored intervention using a bilingual PN who provides support with
      social factors and a bilingual LCSW who provides CCBT for depressed LEP Latino ESRD patients
      is feasible and acceptable.
