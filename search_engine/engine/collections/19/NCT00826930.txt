    
      In this open-label, one-site study, up to 48 patients with high grade glioma (HGG) who are
      undergoing biopsy or partial debulking of the tumor as part of standard of care will have an
      oxygen monitoring probe placed in residual tumor tissue. Oxygen levels in the tumor tissue
      will be measured prior to and after administering a single bolus injection of TSC. Safety
      assessments will occur throughout the trial, including at a 7 to 14 day follow-up visit.
      Pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed prior to and during the first 24 hours after
      TSC dosing.
