      a baseline purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test to determine tuberculin reactivity.
      Cohort 1 comprised patients with an induration of <10mm in diameter, and Cohort 2 comprised
      patients with an induration of ≥10mm. Enrollment was staggered by 3 weeks for each of the
      first 3 patients in Cohort 1, Group 1 to enable safety monitoring of each patient prior to
      exposure of additional patients.

      In all cohorts, study treatment included BCG (200 µL volume) given IL on Day 1, isoniazid
      (300 mg) given orally daily from Days 29 to 56, and ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) given IV every 3
      weeks (± 3 days) on Days 36, 57, 78, and 99. The dose of BCG varied by assigned treatment
      group: Cohort 1, Group 1 received 0.16 - 0.64 × 10^6 colony-forming units (CFU); Cohort 1,
      Group 2 received 0.8 - 3.2 x 10^6 CFU; Cohort 1, Group 3 was to receive 4.0 - 16.0 x 10^6
      CFU; and Cohort 2 was to receive 0.16 - 0.64 × 10^6 CFU. Enrollment into Cohort 2 was to be
      initiated after the final patient in Cohort 1, Group 1 reached Week 7. Enrollment was then to
      proceed in parallel for Cohort 2 and Cohort 1, Groups 2 and 3.

      Patients were monitored for safety, tumor response, and immunogenicity (cellular, humoral,
      and in situ immunity) for the duration of study participation.
