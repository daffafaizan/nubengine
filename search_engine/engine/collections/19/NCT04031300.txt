      participants will undergo identical procedures, which include four steps: Baseline visit (1
      day), calibration period (25 days), validation period (23 days) and a close-out visit (1 day)
      with a total duration of 50 days.

      The calibration period consists of 23 home-based days and two in-clinic days. At the two
      in-clinic days, measurement sessions are performed every 30 minutes. A measurement session
      consists of two reference measurements (Contour Next One) and three measurements on the
      Investigational Medical Device. The glucose level of the participants is manipulated by
      administration of a glucose rich drink. At home-based days, the subject must perform four
      measurement sessions a day. During the validation period, participants perform up to four
      home-based measurement sessions a day.
