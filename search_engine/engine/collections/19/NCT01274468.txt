    
      DCAMLK1 is a Ca2+ - ca/modulin (CaM) - dependent protein kinase that is a marker of stem
      cells in colonic crypts. Mutations within the stem cell population are thought to be
      responsible for the development of most colorectal carcinomas and studies have shown that
      DCAMLK1 is highly expressed in these tumors. Since the lung is an embryological development
      of the foregut, we speculate that DCAMLK1 will also be upregulated in lung cancers. The aim
      of this pilot study is to determine if DCAMLK1 can be measured in the endobronchial biopsy
      specimens and bronchial washings from patients with lung cancer.

      This is a prospective study in 10 patients with lung masses suspected to be malignant who are
      scheduled for diagnostic bronchoscopy.

      Patients with lung masses scheduled for diagnostic bronchoscopy will be included if they can
      give informed consent to participate and the diagnostic portion of the bronchoscopy has been
      uncomplicated. Patients considered to be at high risk during bronchoscopy because of either
      abnormal blood gases (Pco2 > 50 mmHg or PaO2 < 70 mmHg on oxygen) or coagulopathy (platelets
      <100,000 or INR > 1.5) will be excluded.

      If the preliminary results indicate this is feasible, we will then propose a larger study to
      examine DCAMLK1 distribution in normal and cancerous tissue as well as the predictive value
      of this biomarker.
