      D and E underwent surgeries from January 2009 to January 2014. All patients were divided into
      group A and group B by taking the drawing of lots. In group A, radical debridement, bone
      graft and instrumentation were performed. In group B, isolated posterior instrumentation
      without debridement were performed in all cases and drainage of iliopsoas abscess via
      laparoscopy in 2 cases. The operative time, blood loss, visual analogue score (VAS),
