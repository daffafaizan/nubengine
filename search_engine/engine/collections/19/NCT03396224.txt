    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, non-controlled post-market clinical follow-up study to
      fulfill the post market surveillance obligations according to Medical Device Directive and
      MEDDEV 2.12-2.

      The objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and performance of the Avenir Cemented
      Hip Stem when used in primary total hip arthroplasty at 6 weeks to 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
      and 10 years post-operatively.

      The Avenir Cemented Hip Stem is a straight double-tapered stem offering 9 standard and 9
      lateralized versions, the same as the uncemented version, the Avenir-Mueller Stem.

      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events and
      through radiographic review.

      Performance will be based on the implant survival, overall pain and functional performances,
      subject quality-of-life and radiographic parameters of study subjects who received the
      AvenirÂ® Cemented Hip stem.

      Implant survival will be based on removal or intended removal of the device.

      A total of 130 patients will be enrolled into the study at up to 4 sites.
