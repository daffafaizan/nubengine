    
      This is a phase I, double-blind, stratified, parallel group, placebo-controlled repeat dose
      study in a minimum of 8 circumcised and 8 uncircumcised healthy male volunteers. Subjects
      will attend 2 study visits, of which 1 will be a Screening Visit (Visit 1) and the other, a
      consecutive 21-day treatment visit (Visit 2; Days 1-21) which commences no more than 14 days
      after the Screening visit. Subjects will reside in the phase I unit throughout the treatment
      period. The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be up to 5 weeks.

      Subjects are stratified based on whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised and within
      each stratified group subjects are randomized to PSD502 (lidocaine prilocaine spray) or
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio.

      Procedures during the 21 day treatment period include: visual examination of the glans penis,
      blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis of lidocaine and prilocaine, swabbing of
      the glans penis for residual PSD502, vital signs and 12-lead ECG, adverse event enquiries and
      collection of concomitant medications. Subjects are discharged from the clinic on Day 21
      following a safety evaluation.
