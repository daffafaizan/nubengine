      an ideal option for patients with ADHD. Moreover, the once-a-day administration of Concerta
      secures a steady delivery of methylphenidate across the day, minimizing the well-known risks
      of peaks and valleys of IR methylphenidate, which could offer an added advantage to the
      pharmacokinetic advantage of once-a-day administration. Despite these putative advantages,
      whether this new delivery system will lead to the same results as those documented with
      immediate-response methylphenidate in the treatments of adults with ADHD requires empirical
      corroboration. To this end we are conducting a randomized controlled clinical trial to
      evaluate the short- and medium-term safety and efficacy of Concerta in the treatment of
      adults with ADHD with and without co-morbid psychiatric disorders. We also wish to examine
      the role of genetics in predicting ADHD treatment response to Concerta. There is growing
      literature that supports the role of genetic factors in treatment response in youth with
      ADHD, and we seek to further explore this relationship in adults.

      The proposed study includes the use of a 34-week design to document the response rate,
      assessment of the impact of Concerta on functional capacities (quality of life, psychosocial
      function) and cognition, and careful assessment of safety and tolerability.
