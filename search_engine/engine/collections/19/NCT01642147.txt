    
      30 patients undergoing selective craniotomy (craniotomy group) for supratentorial brain tumor
      removal and 30 patients undergoing selective abdominal surgery (abdominal surgery group) are
      planned to be enrolled in the study. Mean blood flow velocity in middle cerebral artery
      (Vmca), mean arterial pressure (MAP), blood oxygen saturation of jugular vein bulb (SjvO2)
      (only measured in craniotomy group)and arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) will be measured
      before general anesthesia, at tracheal extubation, and 30,60, 90, 120 min after extubation in
      both groups.
