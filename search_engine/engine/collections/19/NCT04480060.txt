      many countries of the world. Emergency departments also carried out an important part of the
      fight against pandemics in our country/Turkey. The emergency department including an
      intensive care unit is very few in this country/Turkey and the only hospital, which has an
      Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU) in Istanbul, is the study center. Throughout the
      pandemic, many patients, including COVID-19 patients, were successfully followed up and
      discharged from EICU. With this study, the investigators expect to show the role of EICU
      during the pandemic. In addition, it will be seen that whether the patients, who are waiting
      for hospitalization or waiting for referral, are admitted to EICU faster and their treatments
      will be started promptly. Therefore, this retrospective study aimed to provide useful
      information about how an effective EICU should be, especially how to use them during pandemic
      periods.
