      (SAD) design to assess the local ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of a single
      topical eye drop of LHA510 administered at various concentrations. Four separate cohorts of
      unique elderly subjects (55 to 80 years) were utilized, with each cohort randomized to
      receive either topical LHA510 or vehicle in a 3:1 ratio as a single dose. A disposition
      evaluation was performed 7 days later. Part 2 was a multiple ascending dose (MAD) design to
      assess the local ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of LHA510 administered at
      various concentrations and dosing frequencies. Six separate cohorts of unique AMD subjects
      were utilized, with each cohort randomized to receive either topical LHA510 or vehicle in a
      3:1 ratio for 7 days. A disposition evaluation was performed 14 days after the first dose of
      study drug. A review of all available safety data was conducted by the Sponsor and the PI(s)
      prior to dose escalation (cohort progression). The same concentrations levels were used in
      Part 1 and Part 2 and are ordered as Lowest, Next Lowest, Next Highest, and Highest.
