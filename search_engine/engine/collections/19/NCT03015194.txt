      no surgical options exist. In as many as half of patients, TMVR can cause life-threatening
      blockage of the left ventricle by displacing the existing mitral valve leaflet. For these
      patients the only options appear to avoid TMVR or in some to cause a focused heart attack and
      to wait 6 weeks. The investigators have developed and tested a technique to tear the existing
      mitral valve leaflet and enable TMVR in patients who have no other options. The procedure is
      called intentional laceration of the anterior mitral leaflet to prevent left ventricular
      outflow tract obstruction (LAMPOON). Although there are no dedicated TMVR devices
      commercially available, there has been short-term success with implanted transcatheter aortic
      valve devices in the mitral position for TMVR.

      The purpose of this study is to perform LAMPOON and TMVR in patients who have no good options
      to treat their mitral valve failure, using heart valve devices designed to implant in the
      aortic valve position.
