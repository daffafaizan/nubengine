      first is the surgical removal of all grossly visible deposits of cancer from the abdomen; and
      the second is application of heated chemotherapy in salt water at the same time as the
      removal of the visible cancer. HIPEC is an alternative method of delivering chemotherapy.
      Traditional chemotherapy is injected into a vein, while HIPEC applies chemotherapy drugs
      warmed up by an FDA-approved machine to 108 degrees Fahrenheit directly into the abdomen
      during surgery, making it an option for cancers that originated in or have spread to the
      abdominal cavity. Standard treatment in this manner usually includes Mitomycin C or Cisplatin
      as its chemotherapy agents. In this study, the investigators will use nanoliposomal
      irinotecan as the chemotherapy agent. Irinotecan is FDA approved for the treatment of
      pancreatic cancer.
