      platelets are not stored in smaller hospitals, or in deployed military hospitals. Patients in
      these hospitals therefore currently have limited or no access to platelet transfusion.
      Cryopreservation of platelets is a promising technology that would allow smaller hospitals to
      provide platelet transfusions, reduce overall platelet wastage, and possibly produce better
      patient outcomes through more effective haemostasis.

      This is a phase III multicentre blinded randomised controlled clinical non-inferiority trial
      of cryopreserved platelets vs. conventional liquid-stored platelets for the management of
      surgical bleeding. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety and cost
      effectiveness of cryopreserved platelets, compared to conventional liquid-stored platelets,
      for the management of surgical bleeding. This trial will recruit cardiac surgical patients
      deemed to be at high risk of surgical bleeding and who may potentially require transfusion of
      platelets. It is estimated to require 808 high-risk cardiac surgical patients to be
      recruited, to obtain 202 patients who receive transfused study platelets for surgical
      bleeding. The study will recruit patients in Australian tertiary hospitals.The study
      hypothesis is that cryopreserved platelets will be at least as effective as conventional
      liquid-stored platelets in the treatment of active bleeding due to surgery.
