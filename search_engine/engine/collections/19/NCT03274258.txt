      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) treated with combination of nivolumab plus
      ipilimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in
      patients with RMC.

      II. To evaluate potential biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment response, as
      well as tumor antigen-specific immune responses, such as antibody and T cell responses, as
      surrogates for anti-tumor activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over 90
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive nivolumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
