      Treatment as Usual(TAU) for traumatized refugees and asylum seekers in the Mid- Norway
      region. Clinicians in psychiatric outpatient clinics in the region will deliver the two
      conditions to asylum seekers and refugees that qualifies for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
      Each patient will receive 10 sessions of either NET or TAU. Assessment tools in the study
      will be MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and
      the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Exclusion criteria will be psychosis, substance
      abuse and serious suicidal ideations. The age group in focus will be adults of 18 years or
      more. Refugees and asylum seekers from all countries will be accepted in the study, and there
      will be used qualified interpreters if the refugees do not speak English or Norwegian
      fluently.
