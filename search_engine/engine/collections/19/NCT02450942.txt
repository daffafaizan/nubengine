      organisms by selectively metabolizing sorbitol. They exclusively express the enzyme
      sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is the enzyme responsible for initiating sorbitol
      metabolism. 2-[18F]-fluorodeoxysorbitol (18F-FDS) is a positron-emitting analog of sorbitol.
      The substitution of the hydroxyl group by fluorine at the C-2 position, however, completely
      abrogates the recognition by mammalian sorbitol dehydrogenase.18F-FDS could be a suitable
      probe to selectively label and tomographically image enterobacteriaceae in vivo.

      For further interests in clinical translation of 18F-FDS, an open-label dynamic whole-body
      PET/CT study was designed to investigate radiation dosimetry, plasma pharmacokinetics,
      biodistribution, safety and diagnostic performance of 18F-FDS in healthy volunteers and
      patients with suspected infection. A single dose of nearly 370 MBq 18F-FDS will be
      intravenously injected into healthy volunteers and patients with suspected infection. Visual
      and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images. Changes of blood
      pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature, routine blood and urine tests, serum alanine
      aminotransferase, albumin, and creatinine, and any adverse events will be collected from the
      volunteers. Adverse events will also be observed in the patients.
