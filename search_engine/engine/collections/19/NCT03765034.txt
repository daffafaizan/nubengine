      intervention to improve strength and function in their weak or paralyzed arm.

      Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is known to increase upper extremity function in
      children with weakness or disuse as a result of cerebral palsy. However, it is unknown if
      this therapy is effective for treating arm weakness or disuse as a result of perinatal
      brachial plexus injury. The addition of CIMT to usual and standard occupational therapy care
      is evaluated in this trial.
