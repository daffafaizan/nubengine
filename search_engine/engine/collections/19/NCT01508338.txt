      HMB supplement, ATP supplement, or HMB plus ATP supplements for 12 weeks. While consuming the
      supplements the subjects will undergo an extensive resistance training program designed to
      train all major muscle groups. An additional overreaching training cycle during weeks 9 and
      10 which will involve a high-volume, hypertrophy style training program.

      Subject testing will consist of the following:

        -  Strength and power at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12

        -  Range of motion and muscle soreness at weeks 0, 1, 8, 9, and 10

        -  Body composition and muscle assessments at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12

        -  Body fat assessments at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12

        -  Blood biochemical measurements at weeks 0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 12

        -  Urinary analysis for protein breakdown (3-methylhistidine) at 0, 1, 8, 9, and 10 weeks
