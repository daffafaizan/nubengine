      leukapheresis procedure. Depending on arm/schedule, about 4-5 weeks later, study treatment
      will begin. For HER2 BATs, the white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with
      two proteins - OKT3 and IL-2 -- which activates the cells to multiply. After approximately 14
      days in culture, the activated T cells are coated with OKT3 and trastuzumab/Herceptin
      (HER2Bi), and washed to remove excess Herceptin in order to produce bispecific antibody armed
      T cells (BATs). Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to be infused.

      Follow-up appointment schedule will include clinic visits 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6
      months after the last dose of Pembrolizumab.
