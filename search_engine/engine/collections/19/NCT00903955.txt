    
      Specific Aim I directly tests the hypothesis that mucus clearance is impaired due to mucus
      dehydration. It measures 1) COPD Mucociliary and Cough Clearance 2) mucus hydration 3) the
      concentrations of the dominant regulators of airway hydration and 4) the consequences of
      mucus dehydration on mucus biophysical properties and bacterial infection.

      Specific Aim II tests the hypothesis that COPD acute exacerbations are associated with
      failures of mucus clearance. Measurements will be similar to that of Specific Aim I, but
      conducted during periods of baseline health, acute exacerbation and recovery.

      Specific Aim III tests whether airway surface hydration with 7% Hypertonic Saline will
      restore clearance in the basal state and during a COPD acute exacerbation. COPD subjects will
      be exposed to inhaled Hypertonic Saline during periods of baseline health and acute
      exacerbation. Acute efficacy via measures of mucus clearance and spirometry will studied.
