    
      Urinary Track Infections (UTIs) are the second most common infection in the United Stated.
      There is growing concern about the amount of antibiotic use and drug resistance. Patients
      with frequent UTIs are encouraged to keep well hydrated. Some are encouraged to drink
      cranberry juice or cranberry extract. In 2016 a published study demonstrated no difference.
      The investigators hypothesize that the Uqora dietary supplement will decrease the frequency
      of UTIs.

      The study was designed as a prospective randomized blinded study. Results will be patient
      reported results along with any confirmation of a documented UTI. Participants will be asked
      to keep a weekly diary logging the supplement intake. The participant will also be asked to
      complete the King's Health Questionnaire, a urinary health questionnaire and quality of life.
      The data will be entered by the participant into a portal using a personalized login and
      password.
