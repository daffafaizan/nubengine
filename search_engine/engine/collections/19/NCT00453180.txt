      significance. The core symptoms of autism include severe deficits in social relatedness and
      communication, and interfering repetitive behavior. No medications have been shown to
      consistently improve any of these symptoms.

      The central hypothesis of this study is that NAC will improve behavioral manifestations of
      autism which may include core or associated symptoms. We plan to test our hypothesis and
      complete the objectives of this project by pursuing the following specific aims:

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of oral NAC in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
           involving 32 children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral NAC in 32 children and adolescents with
           autism spectrum disorders.
