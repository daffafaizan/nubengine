           For each element from ii to xi, a rating of nil (0), mild (l), moderate (2), and severe
           (3) for each category was made by the same evaluating physician.

           i. Physician VAS scale - assessment of wrinkles prepeel, post peel (Score 1 -10).

           ii.Fine peri-orbital wrinkles (less than 1 mm in width or depth) (FPW); iii.Course
           peri-orbital wrinkles (greater than 1 mm in width and depth) (CPW); iv.Upper lip
           wrinkles (ULW); v.Lower lip wrinkles (LLW); vi.Melasma defined as blotchy, brown,
           epidermal macules with indistinct margins; vii.Solar lentigines defined as dark brown
           macules with distinct margins measuring from 3 to 10 mm; viii.Solar keratoses defined as
           diffuse erythema with keratotic adherent scaling; ix.Guttate hypomelanosis defined as
           localized macules of absent melanin measuring from 3 to 10 mm in diameter;
           x.Poikiloderma defined as a symmetrical reddish-brown pigmentation of the neck,
           typically sparing the sub-mental area;

           The totaling of the scores of the above parameters will form a prepeel score. This will
           be compared against the patient's score post peel - we expect to find an improvement.

        2. Safety profile assessment

             -  redness, swelling, oozing, hyperpigmentation, scarring

             -  each of the 5 parameters will be scored from 0 -3, none, mild, moderate, severe

             -  this will serve as a safety assessment.
