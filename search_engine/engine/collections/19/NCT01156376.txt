      parallel-designed study. Approximately 90 generally healthy adults meeting the necessary
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled so that 78 subjects (26 per treatment group)
      would reasonably be expected to complete the study. Subjects will have their oral soft/hard
      tissues assessed at Screening (visit 1), Baseline (visit 2), and Days 3, 5, 24, and 25
      (visits 4,6-8). During the first week of the study, subjects will be instructed to brush
      their teeth for one minute in their usual manner, twice daily using the provided standard
      fluoride toothpaste. Subjects will return for the Baseline exam and, upon qualification with
      entry criteria, will be assigned to one of three treatment groups. Qualified subjects will be
      instructed to return to the site for five consecutive days. Subjects will have four
      supervised rinses with their assigned mouth rinse for either 30 or 60 seconds using 10 ml or
      20 ml, at subsequent one-hour intervals. During the 5 consecutive days of exposure to the
      assigned mouthrinse, subjects will brush their teeth using the provided fluoride-free
      toothpaste and soft-bristled toothbrush.

      Subjects will then have an 18-day rest period (off treatment). During this time, subjects
      will follow their usual oral hygiene and dietary habits, using the standard fluoride
      toothpaste and soft toothbrush provided, and must refrain from using any unassigned oral care
      products. On the 19th day after completion of Day 5 (Day 24), subjects will return for an
      oral examination. If no pathology is present, subjects will be given a challenge treatment
      (four supervised rinses) and the final oral examination will be performed on Day 25.
