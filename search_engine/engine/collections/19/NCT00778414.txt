      bioequivalence study to compare the rate and extent of absorption of a test amoxicillin -
      clavulanic acid versus Augmentin ES - 600, a reference amoxicillin - clavulanic acid, under
      fasting condition. Prior to study commencement, subjects were randomly assigned to a
      treatment in accordance with the randomization scheme generated by Anapharm. Subjects were
      confined to the Anapharm Clinical Research Facility from at least 10 hours prior to the drug
      administration until after the 12 - hour post dose blood draw, in each period. The treatment
      phases were separated by a washout period of 20 days.

      were confined for Period I; of these subjects, 48 (24 males and 24 females) were enrolled and
      were dosed in the study; 42 of these enrolled subjects completed the study.
