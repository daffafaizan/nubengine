    
      Primary Objective:

      To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib in combination with capecitabine as
      treatment for metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

        1. To determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

        2. To determine the compliance and toxicity of the combination.

        3. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) in
           patients with measurable disease.

        4. To determine the duration of response.

        5. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS).

        6. To determine the predictive value for response of serum markers such as VEGF.
