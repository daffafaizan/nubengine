      collected before eating and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after eating each bar. The
      incremental area under the curve was used to calculate glycemic index. The investigators will
      also measure the second meal effect by measuring the metabolic response (glucose, insulin,
      and gut hormones) after a standardized lunch two hours following the first assessment.
