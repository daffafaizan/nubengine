      with several seconds of even finger gentle press under aseptic conditions, then it was
      untouched and observed for 10 min. Vascular occlusion of the liver was allowed if necessary,
      but was open for evaluation of hemostatic efficacy. Hemostatic time began to calculate when
      gauze was applied. Time to hemostasis was recorded in seconds and the maximum time to
      hemostasis was 600 seconds. Hemostasis success was achieved based on there was no visible
      bleeding or minimal ooze from the resection wound.
