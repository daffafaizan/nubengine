    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution and diagnosis.

      The weekly attack rate is determined during an 8-week assessment prior to therapy initiation
      and at crossover.

      Patients are randomly assigned to oral dichlorphenamide (DCP) or placebo for 9 weeks and then
      cross to the alternate treatment. Patients on DCP at baseline continue on the same dose;
      those on acetazolamide (ACZ) at baseline receive a DCP dose equivalent to one fifth of the
      ACZ dose.
