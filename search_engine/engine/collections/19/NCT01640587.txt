      artesunate combination therapy has been used since 1992. It was studied first in trials, but
      by 1994 it became the first line treatment for all uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria
      episodes in the non-pregnant population. In vivo efficacy of a 3 day regimen of mefloquine+
      artesunate (MAS3) has been monitored regularly since its introduction in 1992. In 2009
      Carrara et al summarised the in vivo PCR-adjusted cure rates at Day 42 and Day 63 in patients
      treated with MAS3 between 1995 and 2005, as well as the in-vitro parasite susceptibility to
      MAS3 during that same period, and the changes in pfmdr1 copy numbers.The proportion of
      patients with parasitaemia persisting on day-2 increased significantly from 4.5% before 2001
      to 21.9% after 2002 (p<0.001). Delayed parasite clearance was associated with increased risk
      of developing gametocytaemia (AOR = 2.29; 95% CI, 2.00-2.69, p = 0.002). MAS3 efficacy
      declined slightly but significantly (Hazards ratio 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.19, p<0.001),
      although efficacy in 2007 remained well within acceptable limits: 96.5% (95% CI, 91.0-98.7).
      The proportion of infections caused by parasites with increased pfmdr1 copy number rose from
      30% (12/40) in 1996 to 53% (24/45) in 2006 (p = 0.012, test for trend).

      Evidence of reduced susceptibility to artemisinins in Western Cambodia was first reported in
      January 2007. Artemisinin resistance was manifest by a marked slowing of parasite clearance.
      In Pailin, Cambodia, the median parasite clearance time was 84 hours compared to 48 hours on
      the Thai side of the international border with Myanmar following either 2 mg/kg of artesunate
      (AS) alone for 7 days or 4 mg/kg AS for 3 days plus 25 mg/kg of mefloquine at both locations.
      A more recent analysis of parasite clearance data collected prospectively in patients with
      uncomplicated hyperparasitaemic malaria has shown a progressive decline in parasite clearance
      rates over the last decade suggesting a decline following the same trajectory as in Western
      Cambodia but with a time lag of a few years.

      Clinic experience data collected in 2011 have shown a steady decline in efficacy of MAS3,
      albeit in a small number of patients. We have observed this trend over the past 10 years. It
      appears to be related to the increased copies of the gene Pfmdr1 in adult males. The PCR
      corrected efficacy in 43 patients was 47.0% (95% CI 27.0-64.7), well below the 90% threshold
      at which WHO recommends changing to an alternative treatment. This decline in efficacy of
      mefloquine + artesunate is likely to be attributable to reduced parasite susceptibility to
      mefloquine. The other fixed dose combinations available dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)
      is the best option to replace mefloquine-artesunate since it is thought that it remains
      effective in the presence of high pfmdr1 copy numbers. In addition DP is administered once
      daily and needs no special dietary modification to ensure adequate absorption.

      However other groups in the area have documented a good efficacy of MAS3. In other words we
      think there is a decline in efficacy but we do not feel confident to say what the magnitude
      of this drop is. Changing policy is a difficult task and we need more and stronger evidence
      of the current efficacy of MAS3. The best design to avoid selection bias is to do an
      adequately powered randomized control trial and we would like to compare MAS3 with the next
      generation ACT: DP. We have already conducted studies with DP and we know it is safe and
      effective. In laboratory studies we found that this treatment (DP) is more effective against
      P.falciparum when it exhibits resistance to mefloquine via increased expression of the Pfmdr1
      gene. We think it is timely to compare MAS3 and DP again and carefully monitor for the
      treatment response in patients with signs of mefloquine resistant parasites. Therefore, we
      propose a study to evaluate in an adequately powered RCT MAS3 (the current national policy
      for Thailand and routinely use along the border) to a potential replacement, DP.
