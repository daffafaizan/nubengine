    
      An observational, cross-sectional, web-based questionnaire survey, with multi-centre
      involvement across hospitals in the South Asia and middle-east region. The questionnaire
      consists of two sections. Section one obtains information from participants regarding
      communication and visiting practices in ICU during pre-COVID-19 era, and the Section two
      obtains information regarding the policy changes if any during the COVID-19 pandemic in
      regards to safety of healthcare workers (HCWs) and public.

      In order to obtain the largest representation of South Asia and Middle East ICUs, a network
      of research doctors as facilitators from each country is created. The role of the
      facilitators is to contact and recruit adult ICUs within their country. Each facilitator
      contacts the hospitals (public and private), creating a network of collaborating
      doctors/nurses (participants) from those hospitals who expressed their willingness to
      participate.

      Data collection: a web based Google Forms with online access will be used Only one entry per
      ICU will be collected during the study. Statistic analysis: a descriptive analysis is planned
      for the general characteristics of the participating units and the study population.
