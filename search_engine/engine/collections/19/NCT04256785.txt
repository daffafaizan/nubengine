      abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, meteorism, diarrhea and/or constipation. To date there is
      not any specific treatment for these symptoms that markedly impair the quality of life of
      these subjects. This trial intends to investigate if the addition of a polymicrobial
      probiotic product, which has shown efficacy in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, can
      also be useful to ameliorate the gastrointestinal symptomatology of patients with
      fibromyalgia.
