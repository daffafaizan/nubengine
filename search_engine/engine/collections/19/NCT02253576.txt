      moderately severe bronchiolitis (as defined by inclusion/exclusion criteria below) will be
      approached for entry into the study. Recruitment will only occur when Research Assistants are
      on duty, is projected to include regular working hours Monday-Friday as a minimum and will
      continue until the calculated sample size has been obtained (anticipated 12 months). Initial
      routine assessment by the ED staff will identify potential subjects and Research Assistants
      will be notified to apply the inclusion/exclusion criteria and obtain informed consent if
      appropriate. Recruited subjects will be randomized to receive treatment in a double blind
      fashion with inhalation of nebulized study solution containing either 7% hypertonic saline
      (HS, study group) or 0.9% saline (NS, control group). Each dose of study solution will also
      contain a standard dose of bronchodilator (salbutamol, 0.15 mg/kg; 0.03 ml/kg of 0.5%
      salbutamol nebulizer solution) added by the ED staff. Each participant will remain on the
      same allocation throughout the protocol and receive 3 consecutive 4ml doses of the assigned
      study solution with salbutamol over a 1-hour period.
