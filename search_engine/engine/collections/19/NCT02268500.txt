      compared to standard dose influenza vaccine for one season in adult participants with
      symptomatic heart failure. The primary outcome measure is humoral (antibody-mediated) immune
      response, and secondary outcomes include cumulative incidence of influenza-like illness
      symptoms and all cause hospitalizations. The aim is to gather information on feasibility of
      this study design and effect size differences to inform a larger outcomes-based clinical
      trial.

      Background: The 5.8 million Individuals in the US with heart failure (HF) are at high risk
      for influenza infection and associated morbidity, mortality and increased health care costs
      despite annual influenza vaccination. Higher dose of vaccine is approved for use in older
      adults. Antibody-mediated immunity contributes to vaccine-induced protection from influenza
      illness.

      Preliminary data: Our research group at UW Madison has demonstrated reduced antibody titers
      to influenza vaccination in patients with HF. Additionally, we've shown in a pilot study that
      double dose influenza vaccine resulted in increased titers and was well tolerated.

      Methods: A multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label blinded-endpoint trial will be
      conducted with 20 patients assigned to the standard dose vaccine dose and 20 patients to high
      dose influenza vaccine. The primary outcome measure is the rate of seroconversion (4-fold
      rise in antibody titers to A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and B-type vaccine antigens), assessed 4 weeks
      post vaccination. The study will also examine feasibility differences in symptoms of
      influenza and all-cause hospitalizations between vaccine dose groups, and these data will be
      used for planning a subsequent outcomes-based clinical trial.
