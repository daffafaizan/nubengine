        -  Determine, preliminarily, the feasibility of chemoembolization with GelSpheres™ beads
           mixed with doxorubicin hydrochloride in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo catheterization of the hepatic artery followed by chemoembolization
      comprising an infusion of GelSpheres™ beads mixed with doxorubicin hydrochloride into the
      target hepatic artery. Patients may receive up to 3 chemoembolization treatments.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 1
      year, and then every 3 months during year 2.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
