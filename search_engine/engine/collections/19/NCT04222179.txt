      long, cost 5 US dollars). One conventional EGD (diameter 2.8 mm) biopsy forceps was inserted
      into the lumen as a strengthened stylet. Then investigators inserted a biopsy forceps
      (diameter 2.0 mm) and protruded a little out of the working channel of an ultrathin EGD scope
      (Fujinon EG 530 N, diameter 5.9 mm) to grasp the suture. The ultrathin EGD and NG tube were
      parallelly pushed into a selected nostril after adequate decongestive anesthesia (Epinephrine
      0.3% + Lidocaine 5%) into the small intestine as deep as possible to the jejunum.

      Being placed to the small intestine as far as possible, the NG tube was released and the
      ultrathin EGD scope withdrew. When the scope was pulled backwards from the stomach, the
      shape/layout of a NG-tube could be simultaneously monitored and adjusted. At last, the EGD
      biopsy forceps (2.8 mm) inside the NG tube was removed. With this method, in real life, a
      plain film is not necessary to confirm the NG tube position. However, for study purpose, a
      KUB film was taken to check the NG tube position.
