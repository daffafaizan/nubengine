      50 million Americans, with 15 million being significantly bothered. Using functional
      connectivity MRI (fcMRI), the investigators have found distinct differences in the cortical
      attention networks between patients with bothersome tinnitus and age-matched controls. These
      novel findings suggest that some of the classic and most disturbing characteristics of
      tinnitus result from derangements in cortical pathways. Using a validated task-based
      functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm developed at Washington University, the investigators will
      explore the ventral and dorsal frontoparietal cortical attention networks in patients with
      bothersome tinnitus and non-tinnitus controls.

      This will be an experimental task-based fMRI pilot study involving the neurocognitive and
      neuroimaging assessment of patients with severely bothersome tinnitus.

      The investigators plan to perform a pilot study and enroll a total of 10 subjects to undergo
      task-based imaging. These results will be compared to a control (no tinnitus) cohort (n=35)
      that has already undergone task-based fMRI. This task-based paradigm will allow us to advance
      knowledge about the role of the attention, control, and other cortical networks in the
      development and maintenance of bothersome tinnitus.

      The investigators anticipate it will take one year to successfully enroll and test a total of
      10 patients. All scans will be performed on the Washington University grounds.
