      treatment tailored to individual patient needs, with the ultimate goal of maximizing
      cognitive and real-world functioning for older adults with cognitive aging, mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI), neurodegenerative, or other neurological diseases/conditions.

      Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) is a non-invasive, neurorehabilitation procedure in
      which a weak electric current is passed between electrodes that are placed on the scalp with
      the intention of modulating excitability of the underlying brain regions. Because the field
      of TES is relatively young, rapidly evolving, and primarily focused on cognitive neuroscience
      with "healthy" individuals, there is a clear need for well-conceptualized and conducted
      clinical research. The current protocol is intentionally broad with respect to both
      methodology and patient characteristics in order to tailor potential TES interventions to
      individual patients or small samples. The current protocol utilizes various forms of TES
      including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), alternating current stimulation
      (tACS), and random noise stimulation (tRNS) and sham stimulation in older adults. As this is
      a cross-over design, some participants may receive active (or "real") TES and/or sham TES
      conditions.This includes head to head comparisons of the different forms of TES.
      Additionally, TES could be performed in conjunction with cognitively-based intervention since
      this may enhance the neuroplastic response of the targeted brain region(s) while at the same
      time shaping/optimizing the pathways that are engaged by cognitively-based interventions.
      This broad approach is important since etiological differences in cognitive impairment may
      necessitate distinct interventions.
