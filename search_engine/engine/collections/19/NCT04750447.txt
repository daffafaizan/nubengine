      safety and IOP-lowering effectiveness of XEN 63. Approximately 29 patients who are scheduled
      to undergo glaucoma surgery with XEN63 implantation will be enrolled and followed for up to
      12 months postoperatively. Enrollees will follow the standard of care visits (pre-op, post-op
      day 1, post-op week 1 and post op month 1) where they will undergo a full eye exam (visual
      acuity, refraction, slit lamp exam and intraocular pressure measurement). In addition to the
      standard of care visit, enrollees will have 2 additional visits (post-op month 6 and post-op
      month 12) where they will undergo a full eye exam. Additional tests include a Visual Field
      assessment and Endothelial cell count on their pre-op visit, post-operative month visit 6 and
      post-op month 12 visit.
