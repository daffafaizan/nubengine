      and timely prediction of impending respiratory failure would be highly consequential.
      Subjective evaluation of respiratory loading conditions is inconsistent, imprecise and may
      result in erroneous management. Photoplethysmographic (POP) waveform analysis provides a
      non-invasive, readily available tool to estimate breathing effort in a semiquantitative
      fashion.

      It is the aim of this study to examine:

        1. if the degree of dyspnoea, when clinically assessed by means of the respiratory rate and
           SpO2 values, correlates with the SpO2 wave variations (ΔPOP) in ICU spontaneously
           breathing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients.

        2. if a ΔPOP threshold could be identified to adequately predict further need of
           orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.

      This study consists of three main steps:

        1. Clinical evaluation of dyspnoea based on:

           1.1. Respiratory rate

           1.2. Oxygen saturation (SpO2)

        2. Storage of SpO2 curve for ΔPOP computation according to a proprietary algorithm after
           offline POP analysis .

        3. Within a time frame of 10 days from when the first two steps are met, monitor for need
           of invasive ventilatory support.
