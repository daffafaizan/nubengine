        -  From fully dilated cervix to delivery of the child.

        -  Associated with pain as the foetus rotates and descends through the pelvis.

        -  End of second stage: the perineum dilates as the child is being born.

      Pudendal block is provided by inserting a needle close to the pudendal nerve that runs
      through the pelvis and innervates the perineal area.Pudendal block is an old and relatively
      simple method, but not well studied. The main aim is to study pudendal nerve block as pain
      relief in final stage of labour for primiparous women delivering vaginally.

      The investigators aim to investigate whether possible adverse effects may outweigh the
      positive analgesic effect in the final stage of labour, or the opposite. The ASL (Analgesia
      in the Second stage of Labour) study may fill knowledge gaps and add important knowledge
      regarding pain relief during the final stage of childbirth.
