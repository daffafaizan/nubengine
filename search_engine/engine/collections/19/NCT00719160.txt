      absorption in humans. However, we do not understand the mechanism by which dietary protein is
      affecting calcium absorption. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to evaluate whether
      dietary protein-induced changes in gastric acid secretion explain the observed changes in
      intestinal calcium absorption. We have compelling in vitro data that amino acids can
      stimulate gastric acid secretion. We have found that this occurs via allosteric activation of
      the calcium sensing receptor expressed on the gastric acid-secreting parietal cells. At a
      fixed concentration of extracellular calcium, addition of L but not D isomers of specific
      amino acids activates the calcium sensing receptor and stimulates parietal cell acid
      production. We hypothesize that dietary protein induced gastric acid production increases
      calcium solubility and bioavailability thereby increasing its absorption. We will test this
      hypothesis in humans by quantifying the impact of dietary protein on intestinal calcium
      absorption in subjects who cannot make gastric acid. We will measure intestinal calcium
      absorption in healthy adults as they consume either a high protein diet with concomitant
      administration of a proton pump inhibiting (PPI) drug or the same high protein diet with a
      placebo instead of a PPI. The order of the 2 interventions will be randomized, and study will
      be double-blind and placebo controlled. If our hypothesis is correct, then intestinal calcium
      absorption will be highest during the high protein diet with placebo, and lowest during the
      drug intervention.
