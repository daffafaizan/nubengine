      subjects and/or parents will be tested with all instruments before the intervention, and
      approximately every 30 days for no less than 3 months and a maximum participation of 6
      months. Treatment time points will be at least 30 days apart. Because some subjects are not
      scheduled to come into the clinic every 30 days for SOC appointments, they are unable to
      complete 3 sessions of CAT in a 3 month time period. For those subjects who are scheduled to
      come into clinic every 1-2 months for SOC appointments, study participation may take up to 6
      months. This 6 month time period would allow for the completion of 4 different time points of
      CAT.

      The testing will take place in an exam room after vital signs have been completed upon intake
      to the clinic. The trained research assistant, trained RN, or PI will administer the
      questionnaires. The PedsQL includes a subject report (ages 5 and over) and a parent report.
      The Resilience Scale is a self-report and will be used for ages 12 and over. The Faces Scale
      will use parent report for ages less than 5 and self-report for ages 5 and over. In order to
      confirm consistency, the posture measure will be completed by the PI (nurse practitioner) or
      registered nurse on the study after training with the manual included with the inclinometer
      tool.
