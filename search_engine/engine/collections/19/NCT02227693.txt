      Prerandomization Phase includes a Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1) and a Baseline Period
      (Day 1). During the Prerandomization Phase, participants will be divided into two cohorts
      based on the platelet count: Low Platelet Count Cohort and High Platelet Count Cohort.
      Participants in Low Platelet Count Cohort will be randomized to receive one of the four
      treatments: Placebo, Avatrombopag 20 mg, Avatrombopag 40 mg, or Avatrombopag 60 mg.
      Participants in High Platelet Count Cohort will be randomized to receive one of the three
      treatments: Placebo, Avatrombopag 20 mg, or Avatrombopag 40 mg.

      The Randomization Phase includes the Treatment Period and the Follow-up Period. The Follow-up
      Period comprises 3 visits: Visit 4 (5 to 8 days after last dose of study drug [Study Day 10
      to 13]), Visit 5 (12 to 15 days after last dose of study drug [Study Day 17 to 20]), and 30
      days after receiving the last dose of study drug.
