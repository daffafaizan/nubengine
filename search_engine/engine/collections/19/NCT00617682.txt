      treatment and indirect costs of $5 billion. Because of its major public health impact and the
      troubling increase in antibiotic resistant organisms, vaccine strategies to prevent OM are
      being tested. We previously proposed an efficacy study to determine if immunization with
      pneumococcal vaccine during pregnancy protects offspring against early infant OM, which is an
      important predictor for recurrent and chronic OM. Recent data from an efficacy trial in
      California demonstrated that infants immunized with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      (PNCRM7) at 2, 4, 6 and 12 - 15 months were protected against invasive pneumococcal disease
      after 7 months of age. Since licensure of this vaccine, questions have been raised about
      whether maternal immunization with a pneumococcal vaccine during pregnancy suppresses active
      antibody production in offspring who are immunized with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine (PNCRM7). The main objective of this study is to investigate that question. We will
      also evaluate vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and fetal antibody transfer among women who
      receive 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PNCRM9) at 30 - 35 weeks of pregnancy,
      determine persistence of maternal and infant antibody 13 months after birth, evaluate opsonic
      activity of maternal and infant antibody, and determine the relationship between breast milk
      and serum antibody in lactating women.
