      factors.

      The treatment usually consist of Topical administered antibiotics .the emergence of
      multidrug-resistant bacteria is a concern that might complicate the treatment and cure of
      infectious keratitis.

      Collagen cross linking (CXL) using ultraviolet-A (UV-A) and riboflavin in a treatment that
      was developed to increase the biochemical strength of the cornea The procedure is based on
      using riboflavin as a photosensitizer, which generates reactive oxygen species when activated
      by UV-A at 365 or370 nm.

      The standard technique (epi-off) also called Dresden Protocol includes removal of the
      epithelium in order to expose the underlying stroma to riboflavin, which is otherwise
      incompletely absorbed by the epithelium because of tight junctions. The area of corneal
      epithelium removed has a diameter of 6.0 to 8.5 mm. A crosslinking procedure without
      epithelial removal could also be performed (epi-on). It would likely be less painful compared
      to the standard procedure.

      The crosslinking process generates reactive oxygen species that can damage the cell walls of
      pathogens. CXL induces formation of new covalent bonds thereby rendering the corneal stroma
      biomechanically stronger and more resistant to enzymatic digestion . This can potentially
      limit the spread of infection. Furthermore, CXL-induced apoptosis could contribute to the
      reduction of inflammatory response during corneal infection .
