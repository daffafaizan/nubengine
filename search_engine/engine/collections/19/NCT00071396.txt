        1. To determine the efficacy and response rates of Campath-1H when given as a continuous
           intravenous infusion followed by subcutaneous injection plus rituximab in the treatment
           of chronic lymphoid disorders that are refractory to conventional therapy, have
           relapsed, or have no established frontline therapy.

        2. To assess the safety of the combination of Campath-1H when given as a continuous
           intravenous infusion followed by subcutaneous injection plus rituximab in chronic
           lymphoid disorders that express both CD52 and CD20 cell surface antigens.

        3. To measure levels of soluble (s) CD20 and sCD52 as well as levels of Campath-1H,
           rituximab and antibody complexes of rituximab/CD20 and Campath-1H/CD52 in patients with
           chronic lymphoid disorders treated with Campath-1H plus rituximab.
