      the limited chance of cure, with a dismal overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 14%.
      The prognosis of lung cancer depends largely on early detection and immediate treatment prior
      to metastatic spread. For Stage 1 lung cancer the 5-year survival rate can be as high as 70%
      . These data suggest that early detection and surgical treatment would have a huge beneficial
      effect on the lung cancer population. We developed a single arm observational study for the
      early detection of lung cancer with low dose CT scan in high risk asymptomatic subjects. A
      mainly non invasive algorithm for management of undetermined nodules was designed including
      low dose CT at three months for baseline nodules with diameter between 5 and 8 mm, a PET scan
      for nodules larger that 8 mm (not reduced after antibiotics and one month follow up CT).
      Lesions increasing in diameter or in density or positive nodules at CT/PET were sent to
      surgical biopsy (videothoracoscopic approach preferred).

      Spirometry was done in all subjects prior to CT scan to evaluate correlation between BPCO and
      lung cancer.
