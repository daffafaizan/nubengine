      vivax infections in Laos. Participants with subclinical P. vivax infections and those meeting
      the enrolment criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

        -  Intervention: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) therapy 3 days dosing plus 14 days of
           supervised primaquine (7mg/kg total dose) administered once per day (0.5 mg/kg/day).

        -  Control arm: Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) 3 days dosing therapy plus 14 days
           identical primaquine placebo.

      Participants found to be G6PD deficient (G6PDd) will be treated with primaquine
      0.75mg/kg/week for 8 weeks according to WHO recommendations. Primaquine and placebo will be
      administered with food (biscuits), which has been shown to reduce gastrointestinal side
      effects. All doses of study drugs will be supervised. If participants cannot visit the study
      centre, or fail to attend during the 14 days of supervised therapy, team members will visit
      them in their homes, schools or work to ensure complete dosing.
