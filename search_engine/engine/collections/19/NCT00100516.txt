      transplantation. The technical methods have been rapidly adopted by the transplant community,
      but remain limited by the requirement for pneumoperitoneum, a technique that increases
      intra-abdominal pressure to gain surgical exposure. Pneumoperitoneum reduces renal cortical
      blood flow, potentially inducing ischemia associated factors that promote allograft rejection
      or attenuate post transplant renal function.

      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of pneumoperitoneum used for minimally
      invasive donor nephrectomy on renal perfusion using infrared imaging. Our goals are to:

        1. Analyze the effect of varying levels of pneumoperitoneum intraoperatively using infrared
           imaging;

        2. Correlate the effects of both open and laparoscopic living donation with respect to
           transcriptional events, donor and recipient renal function, urine output, post-operative
           pain and return to work postoperatively;

        3. Determine optimal conditions for procurement of renal allografts for subjects undergoing
           renal transplantation.

      In this study, patients will be those who have been consented to kidney donation on the Live
      Donor Renal Donation for Allotransplantation (99-DK-0107). This study will represent the
      first such use of infrared imaging and the first prospective evaluation of strategies for
      living kidney donation.
