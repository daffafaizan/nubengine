      prescribed as the first-line HAART for HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings.
      Protease inhibitor (PI)-based HAART are the recommended second-line regimen after failing
      NNRTI-based HAART. The most commonly used PI in Thailand is lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r).
      However, the metabolic complications of lopinavir/ritonaive (LPV/r) such as hyperlipidemia
      and lipodyrtrophy are common and a concern for HIV-infected children as it may contribute to
      the development of cardiovascular disease in the longer term. There are data on efficacy,
      safety and pharmacokinetics of ATV/r-based HAART in HIV-infected adults but none in children.
      Furthermore, many studies in both adults and children have shown that different ethnicities
      can result in different pharmacokinetic response to antiretroviral drugs. As a result of
      this, this study investigated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ATV/r-based HAART
      in HIV-infected Asian children.
