      whether lidocaine topical pharyngeal anesthesia should be administrated is still in doubt.
      Considering the fact that lidocaine anesthesia may cause airway narrowing and anaphylaxis, it
      is important to clarify the role of lidocaine topical pharyngeal anesthesia in
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy under propofol sedation. Our study could test whether lidocaine
      topical pharyngeal anesthesia should be performed in sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy in a
      randomized controlled trial.
