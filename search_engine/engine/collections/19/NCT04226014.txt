      and / or pancreatic endocrine cells (1). To date, there are no biomarkers allowing the
      detection of a fatty pancreas. It appears that older age, male, obesity, alcohol consumption,
      high triglycerides, high ALT, diabetes or insulin resistance, fatty liver and metabolic
      syndrome are risk factors for a fatty pancreas (2,3,4).To the investigator's knowledge, these
      different factors have not been evaluated on the impact of pancreatic echogenecity in
      endosonography. The objective of this study is to correlate the factors making up the
      metabolic syndrome with pancreatic echogenecity.
