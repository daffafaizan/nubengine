      surgeon. Full-thickness flaps were raised and dental implant osteotomy preparation will be
      completed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Laser treatment will be completed
      using Gallium-Aluminum-Arsenide diode laser. The photobiomodulation application will v-be
      completed by laser energy immediately and three times a week for just 15 days after surgery.
      The control group will consist of laser application without energy delivery to the tissue.
      Immediately after implant placement, the third generation stability resonance frequency (RF)
      analyzer will be applied for direct measurement of implant stability and the value will be
      recorded. The microbiological plaque samples will be collected at specific times, according
      to the following schedule; at the first 24-hour and 90 days after implant surgery. All
      bacterial DNA specimen will be analyzed with qPCR technique to evaluate Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi) ,
      Tannerella forsythia (Tf ) and total amount of bacteria.
