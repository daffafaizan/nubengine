      the first increase in serum hCG level) on the viability of pregnancies and to determine if
      such effect of timing differs between fresh embryo transfers and frozen-thawed embryos
      transfers. In this case, the timing of implantation will be measured through serum hCG
      analysis on days 3, 4, 5, and 7 after blastocyst transfer.
