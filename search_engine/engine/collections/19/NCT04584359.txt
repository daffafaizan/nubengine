      urogynecology doctors' clinics, invitations via social networks, gyms, clubs, and sports
      consultants. Women had to be between 30 and 60 years old and report symptoms of urine loss
      due to exertion in the last six months.The participants were randomly allocated into four
      groups (G1 = intervention using an HVLA/thrust technique for the sacroiliac and T10-L2
      joints, G2 = global osteopathic protocol, G3 = PFT, and G4 = control) by a blinded researcher
      with a spreadsheet of random numbers.The primary outcome measure was surface electromyography
      (EMG) performed at five different times: before the intervention and immediately, 30 minutes,
      60 minutes, and four weeks after. This evaluation was performed by a physiotherapist with ten
      years of experience in urogynecology and expertise in PFM electromyographic evaluation who
      was blinded to the group allocation.
