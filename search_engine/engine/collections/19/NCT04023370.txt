    
      This study adopts a prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial design, aiming at
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of the BeGraft Peripheral Stent Graft System for primary
      iliac artery stenosis and/or occlusive lesions. A total of 182 subjects are planned to be
      enrolled, with all consecutively enrolled subjects being randomly assigned to an experimental
      group (BeGraft group, n=91) and a control group (bare metal stent group, n=91) in the ratio
      of 1:1 and respectively treated using the BeGraft Peripheral Stent Graft System and the bare
      metal stent system. Follow-up visits are carried out for the above-mentioned 182 subjects at
      baseline, upon discharge from hospital, at 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and then once a year
      from the 2nd to 5th year following surgery. A Doppler ultrasound (DUS) examination is carried
      out when subjects return to hospital at 6 months following surgery, and a CT angiography
      (CTA) examination when returning 12 months following surgery, with telephone follow-ups being
      conducted at 30 days and then once a year from the 2nd to 5th year following surgery.
