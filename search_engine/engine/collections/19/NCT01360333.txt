      blood sample is drawn and thereafter the healthy volunteer ingests one of the three fluids.
      Blood samples are drawn 10 times during the following two hours. Finally the healthy
      volunteer is asked to void and the voided urine is measured. The hemoglobin concentrations
      are used to calculate the blood volume expansion with volume kinetic methods.

      The process is repeated another two times with the two remaining fluids.
