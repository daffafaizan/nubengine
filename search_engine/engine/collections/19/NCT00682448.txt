      antipsychotics, may lead clinicians to avoid its use, despite evidence of greater efficacy.
      These problems may also pose a therapeutic dilemma for patients who respond well to
      olanzapine. Metabolic complications negatively impact on morbidity and mortality, impair
      quality of life and increase illness relapse secondary to medication non-compliance. Thus
      far, no pharmacologic agent co-administered with olanzapine has proven effective at
      preventing these untoward effects. The present study proposes to examine the efficacy and
      safety of metformin to attenuate the metabolic side effects associated with olanzapine.
