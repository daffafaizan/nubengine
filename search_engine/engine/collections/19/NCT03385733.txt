      pulmonary vascular resistance and right heart failure. Patients with pulmonary hypertension
      have, dyspnea, physical inactivity, reduced condition and respiratory muscle dysfunction.
      Aerobic exercise programs in patients with pulmonary hypertension are reported to result in
      improved exercise capacity and endurance of the patients, improvement in WHO functional class
      and quality of life, increased peak workload and increased peripheral muscle function. In
      recent years, few studies have investigated the efficacy of inspiratory muscle training in
      patients with PH.The aim of this study is to investigate the effective of inspiratory muscle
      training on respiratory function, exercise capacity, physical activity and quality of life.
