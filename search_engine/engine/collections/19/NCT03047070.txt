      neck field. It is known that bleeding during FESS can affect directly to the visibility of
      safe landmarks and surgical outcomes.

      Use of vasoactive drugs to control bleeding is not without pitfalls. Systemic effects of
      epinephrine may constitute a potential hazard in patients with hypertension, ischemic heart
      disease, anemia, preexistent liver or renal damage and endocrine dysfunction
      (hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma and diabetes mellitus).

      Lidocaine is a prototypical local anesthetic, but it also has systemic effects that are
      mediated by inhibitory effects on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and leukocyte priming.
      Consequently, systemic lidocaine is antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antihyperalgesic.
      Randomized clinical trials, however, have produced mixed results. Several studies have shown
      reduction in postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores, whereas others have failed to
      show a benefit.
