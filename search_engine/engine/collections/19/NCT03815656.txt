    
      The purpose of this study is a small, first in man, clinical feasibility trial for patients
      with severe Parkinson's Disease (PD), who are already clinically eligible for deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) with two goals:

        1. to compare efficacy from two common sites of DBS (subthalamic nucleus (STN), and globus
           pallidus interna (GPi)) through the implantation of dual DBS electrodes on each side of
           the brain; and

        2. to develop a closed loop DBS system using evoked and spontaneous potentials derived from
           these two electrodes.

      The study will involve bilateral dual DBS electrode placement in clinically standard
      locations (ie, STN and GPi) unilaterally or (more often) bilaterally, the placement of the
      RC+S Medtronic research implantable pulse generator (IPG), and a commitment to return for
      both extensive postoperative programming and testing to define clinical efficacy and separate
      research days to develop the closed loop approach. In addition, patients will undergo
      intraoperative research using temporary percutaneous extensions to the DBS electrode(s) and
      DBS lead cannula after implantation to confirm the electrode location and to identify what
      the signals will look like during later chronic recordings through the research IPG.

      The research RC+S IPG includes both ordinary DBS stimulation as well as a recording system
      that simultaneously measures the DBS local evoked potential (DLEP) and/or local field
      potential (LFP) responses from either the same or a second DBS electrode.
