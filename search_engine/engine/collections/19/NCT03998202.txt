      toxicity in overall survival (OS) in older adults with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal
      cancer (CRC) receiving 5-Fluouracil (5FU)systemic chemotherapy. The study also explores the
      mediating influence of genetic variation in the association between myopenia and chemotherapy
      toxicity.
