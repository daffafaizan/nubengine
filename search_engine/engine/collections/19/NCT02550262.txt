      amount of local anesthetic that was below the patient's requirement per hour, as the studies
      were done in the context of an association with PCEA (Patient controlled epidural anesthesia)
      as a rescue technique. As a result, PCEA requests were frequent and therefore these studies
      have not been able to truly understand the pharmacology of the bolus technique in the PIEB
      regimen, as the PCEA utilized by patients added an extra component to the regimen.

      The ideal volume and interval time between PIEB bolus has not yet been established in the
      literature. Most likely the ideal volume and interval time between PIEB bolus will be
      specific for each epidural mixture.

      At Mount Sinai Hospital, PIEB devices have been recently introduced. Currently our standard
      epidural mixture is bupivacaine 0.0625% with fentanyl 2mcg/ml. Our current epidural regimen
      consists of 10 ml continuous infusion per hour, with PCEA boluses of 5 ml and a lock out
      interval of 10 minutes, for a maximum of 20 ml of the epidural mixture per hour. In this
      study, the investigators will offer patients 10mL PIEBs of bupivacaine 0.0625% with fentanyl
      2mcg/ml at 4 different intervals. PCEA bolus of 5mL of the same solution will also be
      available. The goal is to establish the ideal PIEB regimen that will be effective for our
      patient population with our standard epidural mixture.

      Finding the best way of using the new device that will be able to provide analgesia for 90%
      of the parturients will represent a great improvement in labor analgesia. Moreover, there are
      expectations of having fewer side effects since the PIEB is more effective than CEI.
