      pathophysiological mechanisms associated with its appearance and development. The objective
      was to determine the effect of supplementation with β-carotene to type 2 diabetics and
      healthy individuals, on iron metabolism, oxidative balance, and antioxidant plasma capacity,
      using doses similar to the daily nutritional requirement.

      A total of 117 volunteers participated in the study. Type 2 diabetics (34) and healthy
      individuals (24), received 6 mg β-carotene for 45 d, and were compared to similar
      non-supplemented diabetic (33) and control (26) groups. Blood samples were taken at the
      beginning, end and 30 days after finishing supplementation, to determine hemoglobin,
      hematocrit unsaturated iron binding capacity, total iron binding capacity, transferrin
      saturation, ferritin, glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL,
      LDL, oxidized LDL, copper, zinc, TBARS, FRAP, nitrites, GPx, SOD, folates, retinol and
      β-carotene.
