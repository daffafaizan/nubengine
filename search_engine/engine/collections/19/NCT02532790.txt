    
      Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) is one of the most common complications of
      Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and has become one of the main causes of chronic kidney disease in
      children. However, the diagnosis and treatment of HSPN is still based on the clinical
      experience, lacking of evidence-based support. This study is performed to explore the
      biological markers for early prediction of the prognosis and evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of various measures in the treatment of HSPN in children.

      The patients who are proved to get HSPN by renal biopsy will be randomized to receive either
      prednisone p.o. or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor(ACEI) p.o. We will follow up them
      for about 2.5 years and compare the efficacy and safety of both measures by monitoring
      several indexes.
