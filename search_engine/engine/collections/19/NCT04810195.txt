      commercially in Europe in September 2020 as a successor to the original Acurate neo
      prosthesis. Modifications include an added sealing skirt. The original Acurate neo failed to
      reach non-inferiority to other TAVI prostheses in two randomized trials. There is a need to
      gather initial safety and efficacy data from this next generation prosthesis, as there is no
      larger dataset presented after the CE-mark study of the Acurate neo2.

      Project objectives To gather initial safety and efficacy data in the initial up to 500
      consecutive patients treated with the Acurate neo2 in various European sites.

      Karolinska will be the coordinating center for data collection.

      Methods Data will be collected in an anonymous form and sent to Karolinska for compilation
      and statistics. Data collection will continue until 500 patients are reached (April, 2021).

      Statistics Standard descriptive statistics will be used for the main results. For the
      comparison to SCOPE data (with the original Acurate neo prosthesis) on postoperative aortic
      insufficiency, standard statistical methods will used (Fishers exact test for categorical
      variables, and t-test for continuous measurements such as amount of regurgitation by
      videodensitometry).

      Core lab studies The core lab analyses will be performed at CORRIB in Galway (Prof. Serruys
      et al).
