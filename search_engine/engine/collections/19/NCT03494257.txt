      of a foldable intraocular lens (IOL) is the preferred technique for cataract surgery today.

      OVDs in spite of their advantages in phacoemulsification surgery, have been correlated with
      intraocular pressure (IOP) increase within the first 24 hours postoperatively. This
      constitutes a frequent short-term complication of cataract surgery and can lead to corneal
      edema and pain. This IOP rise may also increase the risk of retinal artery occlusion,
      ischemic optic neuropathy, and deterioration of preexisting glaucomatous nerve damage.

      DuoVisc, an OVD that consists of Viscoat (chondroitin sulfate 4.0%-sodium hyaluronate 3.0%)
      in combination with Provisc (sodium hyaluronate 1.0%) is the most frequently used OVD during
      cataract surgery.

      To prevent IOP spikes postoperatively, various antiglaucoma agents have been used.
      Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that acts upon the ciliary processes and
      reduces aqueous humor secretion.Brimonidine is a highly selective a2-adrenergic agonist that
      increases uveoscleral outflow and reduces aqueous humor production.
