    
      Rationale: Patients in the last phase of life often use many medications until shortly before
      they die. This is partly inevitable, because these patients often experience multiple
      distressing symptoms. However, for a considerable number of medications currently often used
      at the end of life, the benefit is debatable, e.g. because they are aimed at the long-term
      prevention of illness.

      Objective: the primary objective is to examine whether the use of a clinical decision support
      system (CDSS-OPTIMED), a personalized medication advice to attending physicians of patients
      in the last phase of life, contributes to patients' quality of life.

      Main study endpoints: the primary outcome is an assessment of the quality of life of
      patients, four weeks after baseline assessment

      Potential risks and benefits associated with participation: the intervention in the
      medication study supports physicians in using available evidence and knowledge when
      prescribing or deprescribing medication for patients in the last phase of life. The
      intervention does not involve experimental treatment or medication. The investigators expect
      no other risks than known side effects of (stopping) medications. The investigators are aware
      that the study population concerns vulnerable people who may experience fluctuating symptoms
      and levels of suffering across their disease trajectory. The investigators acknowledge the
      risk of overburdening participants. If patients feel burdened by participating in the study,
      they are encouraged to indicate that.
