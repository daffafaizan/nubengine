      important, not only for bone health, but appear to be important for prevention of certain
      autoimmune diseases, infections and cancers. Current FDA recommendations for vitamin D intake
      do not differentiate between lean and obese people. There are no published studies indicating
      if the 25(OH)D response to a given daily dose of vitamin D is any less in an obese person
      than a normal weight person. The purpose of this study is to characterize the quantitative
      relationship between steady state cholecalciferol input and the resulting serum 25 (OH)D
      concentration in obese subjects. Data obtained in this study will be compared to published
      normative data for non-obese subjects. Recommendations will be provided for optimal treatment
      of vitamin D deficiency in obese men and women.
