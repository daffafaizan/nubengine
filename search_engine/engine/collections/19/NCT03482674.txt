      intervention for people at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus will result
      in an improvement in body weight (primary outcome) and participants health literacy
      (secondary outcome) or not. A three-month intervention in the intervention group is followed
      by a one-year follow-up. The control group receives standard care as provided by the German
      statutory health insurance for three months and a one-year follow-up as well.
