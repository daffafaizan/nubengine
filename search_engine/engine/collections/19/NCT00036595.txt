      of the control exerted by the primary motor region of the cerebral cortex over the
      contralateral extremities (Mima and Hallet 1999). However, the relationship between a
      cerebral hemisphere and ipsilateral motor control is not well understood. We hypothesize that
      a cortical motor control region ipsilateral to the extremities is located in Brodmann's area
      6. There are several methods that can be used to study this relationship in terms of cortical
      region involved: coherence, correlation, and event-related desynchronization and
      synchronization. Cortical EEG activity associated with contralateral limb activity or
      stimulation usually is larger than that associated with ipsilateral limb activity.
      Furthermore, activity over the scalp that is ipsilateral to motor activity is very small and
      difficult to identify as compared with that occurring contralaterally. Recording responses
      directly from the cortical surface would improve the ability to identify this activity. An
      occasion that would allow us such an opportunity would be invasive monitoring in patients
      with epilepsy.

      Epileptic patients who are surgical candidates, but require more precise localization of
      epileptogenic zones, typically undergo long-term video-EEG monitoring with subdural and/or
      depth electrodes. Some patients may have seizure onsets close to the sensory-motor area of
      the brain and require functional mapping in terms of motor function. We would like the
      opportunity to study electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity associated with simple movements
      in these patients who are undergoing invasive monitoring.

      This study will not disturb ongoing monitoring, nor endanger the patient since no activation
      or stimulation is involved.
