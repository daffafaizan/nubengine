        -  Determine the time to treatment failure and disease-free survival in patients with
           high-risk transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with adjuvant
           paclitaxel, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the tolerability and feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease stage.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1,
      ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily
      beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for a total of 2 courses.

      Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of the second course of chemotherapy, patients receive
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Patients also receive G-CSF SC once daily on days 2-6 and again beginning on day 9 and
      continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 2
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
