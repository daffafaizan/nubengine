    
      Objective: To compare the effectiveness and feasibility of the measurement-based care (MBC)
      in the treatment of depression with clinician's treatment decisions, standardizing treatment
      (ST, clinicians' choice decisions) to two commonly prescribed antidepressants.

      Methods: Selecting the patients in psychiatric hospitals and general hospitals with
      depression, with multi-center randomized controlled study design. Refer to STAR-D
      "measurement-based care" mode, to establish the whole measurement-based evaluation system.
      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to 24 weeks of MBC or ST, restricting treatment
      to paroxetine (20-60mg/day) or mirtazapine (15-45mg/day) in both groups. the ST group will
      maximize simulate of the actual clinical situation, and the patients of the MBC group are
      required to complete the prospective Life-chart Methodology (LCM-p), 16-item Quick Inventory
      of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR16) and other related symptoms and side
      effects of self-assessment, the doctor will make a comprehensive assessment according to the
      results of self-assessment, adjust treatment according to research programs. This is 1-year
      follow-up study; the independent members will have a blinded assessment in the baseline visit
      and each point of view. Depressive symptoms are measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for
      Depression (HAMD) and QIDS-SR.
