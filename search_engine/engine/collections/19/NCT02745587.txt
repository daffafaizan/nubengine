    
      In an era with increasing evidence in favour of an aggressive local treatment, where an
      extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) is more frequently performed and with data
      supporting the potential role for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in pelvic node positive
      (N1) prostate cancer (PC), the treatment of N1 PC patients needs to be revised. Seen the lack
      of clear guidelines regarding the extent of radiation field in N1 prostate cancer patients,
      there is an urgent need for studies evaluating the place of pelvic EBRT.

      The aim of this trial is thus to evaluate if pelvic irradiation has an impact on clinical
      relapse free survival in pathological N1 PC.

      The hypothesis is that performing a pelvic EBRT after EPLND in pathological N1 PC patients
      results in a significant improved clinical relapse free survival with 15% when compared to
      prostate only EBRT.

      This will be evaluated in a multicentre Phase III stratified randomised trial randomising
      patients with PC and 1-4 positive lymph nodes on EPLND between prostate(bed) only
      radiotherapy + 2 years of ADT or pelvic radiotherapy + 2 years of androgen deprivation. A
      total of 330 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Stratification is based on the number
      of positive lymph nodes since patients with increased number of positive lymph nodes exhibit
      a poorer prognosis.
