      usual treatment, a randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted. 54 patients with a
      primary diagnosis of anorexia nervosa and a BMI > 18.5 will be randomly assigned to the
      experimental group receiving VR body exposure in addition to cognitive behavioral therapy or
      control group, which receives cognitive behavioral therapy only. Data regarding eating
      disorder symptomatology and body related attention will be collected before and at the end of
      the intervention, as well as after six months of follow-up. In the systematic and
      hierarchical VR body exposure intervention, which consists of 5 weekly exposure sessions,
      patients will gradually be exposed to increases in the BMI of their virtual avatar. Each
      session starts by inducing illusory feelings of ownership over the virtual body by the means
      of visuo-tactile and visuo-motor stimulation. Then patients are exposed to their virtual
      bodies in order to achieve the habituation or extinction of the anxiety response to their
      body image and, consequently, reduce the fear of gaining weight. During exposure, patients
      will be asked to focus on different parts of the virtual body, by asking what they think and
      feel about them. Body ownership illusion, body-related anxiety and fear of gaining weight
      will be assessed within each session by means of visual analogue scales.
