      imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium
      deposits in the body, and blood-vessel disease).

      This study is an open-label, multi-centre, single-group, 24-week study of fermagatebonate.
      Subjects participating in this study are those who took at least one dose of double-blind
      study medication in the IH 001 study and either completed study IH 001 or were withdrawn due
      to reasons other than an adverse event (AE) considered related to study treatment.
