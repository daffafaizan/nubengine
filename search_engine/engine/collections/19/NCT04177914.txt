      third ventriculostomy with choroid plexus cauterization (ETV+CPC) and shunt in infants with
      hydrocephalus. The study will leverage the infrastructure of the Hydrocephalus Clinical
      Research Network (HCRN), a committed group of 14 leading North American pediatric
      neurosurgical centers with a long track-record of successful collaborative clinical research
      and RCTs in hydrocephalus. Optimal cognitive outcome is the primary concern of families and
      will, therefore, be the primary outcome. Assessment of dMRI, a validated, non-invasive method
      of measuring white matter microstructural integrity and structural connectivity in the
      developing brain, will provide further insight into the developmental consequences of these
      two treatments. The results of the RCT will help families determine the optimal treatment of
      hydrocephalus for their child.
