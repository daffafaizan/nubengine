      probability. If results of retrospective data analysis imply that design will be improved by
      stratification, randomization will be stratified by factors that could influence outcomes.

      Data will be collected from the clinics' Enterprise Data Warehouses which store copies of
      data recorded in the electronic health record. Data elements from qualifying office visits
      will be collected from coded portions of the electronic health record.

      An encounter is eligible for intervention if the patient's diagnosis is in the selected group
      of acute respiratory infections. The intervention EHR functions will be triggered when
      clinicians initiate an antibiotic prescription or enter a diagnosis for an acute respiratory
      infection that has a defined Order Set. If an antibiotic from a list of frequently
      misprescribed antibiotics is ordered and a diagnosis has not yet been entered, providers will
      be prompted to enter a diagnosis. If the diagnosis entered is acute nasopharyngitis; acute
      laryngopharyngitis/acute upper respiratory infection; acute bronchitis; bronchitis not
      specified as acute or chronic; or flu; the interventions will be triggered. The
      diagnosis-appropriate order set will pop-up for providers in the SA arm, while clinicians
      randomized to the AJ arm will receive an alert and be required to enter a brief statement
      justifying their antibiotic prescription if antibiotics are not indicated for the diagnosis
      entered. This note will then be added to the patient's medical record.

      Clinicians randomized to the Peer Comparison condition will receive email updates about their
      antibiotic prescribing practices relative to other clinicians in their practice.
