      Americans requiring admission to an intensive care unit for invasive mechanical ventilatory
      support each year. Though acute respiratory failure is a pulmonary disorder, patients who
      survive are not limited by respiratory symptoms after discharge. Rather persistent
      neuromuscular weakness is the primary disorder that adversely affects their quality of life
      and ability to function on a daily basis. Weakness in these survivors is related to the
      development of critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM). Presently, there are no therapies
      to treat the estimated 110,000 acute respiratory failure survivors who have developed CIPNM
      each year. Based on the results of our national surveys of physical therapists and intensive
      care physicians, the utilization and types of physical therapy for patients recovering from
      acute respiratory failure with neuromuscular weakness varies significantly depending on the
      type of hospital and primary diagnosis of the patient. The investigators plan to perform a
      randomized clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of an intensive four week physical
      therapy program for patients with acute respiratory failure. This trial will determine the
      efficacy of the physical therapy programs that is currently performed in a non-evidence based
      manner for patients with acute respiratory failure across the United States. If successful,
      this study will pave the way for a larger multi-center clinical trial of intensive physical
      therapy for survivors of acute respiratory failure.
