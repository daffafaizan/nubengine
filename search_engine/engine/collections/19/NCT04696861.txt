      3-session, nurse-delivered telehealth intervention to reduce suicidality and improve HIV care
      engagement among adults living with HIV in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. Suicide is a
      leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PLWH) worldwide and mental health
      disorders are key contributors to poor HIV care engagement, lower quality of life, higher
      transmission risk, and increased mortality among PLWH. Conversely, connecting PLWH with
      targeted mental health support improves these critical health outcomes. Telehealth counseling
      represents a cost-effective, innovative approach to mental health treatment in low-resource
      settings such as Tanzania, with the potential to expediently extend services. The proposed
      study will include Aim 1: Identifying the desired characteristics of a telehealth
      intervention for suicidality and HIV care engagement in the Tanzanian clinical context, Aim
      2: Refining intervention content with support from a local study advisory board in Tanzania,
      and Aim 3: Testing the telehealth model in a pilot randomized control trial. Given emerging
      evidence for telehealth approaches to improve access to treatment and reduce health
      disparities, the intervention has great potential to support NIMH strategic objectives to
      address mental health comorbidities and strengthen the HIV care continuum.
