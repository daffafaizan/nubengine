      orally in participants with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
      or frontline therapy in patients with AML who were unfit for intensive therapy. The secondary
      objective was to evaluate the preliminary safety of venetoclax administered orally in
      patients with AML. The first portion of the study was to consist of 19 participants with the
      objective of evaluating anti-tumor effects and confirming the safety of the regimen. The
      second portion (expansion) was to consist of 35 additional subjects to evaluate anti-tumor
      effects and safety and was to commence if an adequate efficacy signal (i.e., ≥ 5/19 achieved
      complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi] or partial remission
      [PR]) had been observed in the first portion of the study. The criterion for success would
      have been met if ≥ 16 of 54 participants achieved remission. The efficacy signal from first
      portion of the study was deemed insufficient for enrollment into the second portion of the
      study, as 4 of the 19 subjects achieved CR/CRi. During the trial, a number of participants
      were in screening at the point of the interim analysis. Given the early signs of clinical
      activity of venetoclax, disease severity, and prognosis of these participants without
      available options for therapy, they were allowed to initiate treatment ahead of completion of
      the interim analysis. Therefore, 32 participants were enrolled. No additional participants
      were screened or treated after the interim analysis was completed.
