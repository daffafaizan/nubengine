      For rectal anastomoses within 6 cm of the anal verge, leakage rates are up to 15%. Here
      liberal use of protective stomas is widely accepted. Fecal diversion by loop ostomy may also
      be performed after extended adhesiolysis with serosal lesions and risk of intestinal
      perforation, in patients with obstructing rectal tumours requiring neoadjuvant
      radio-chemotherapy or in patients with complex anorectal injuries or fistulas. Generally,
      diverting loop ileostomies are secured at skin level by means of a supporting device in order
      to prevent retraction of the loop ileostomy into the abdomen. Nevertheless, due to the
      supporting rod, difficulties may occur in applying a stoma bag correctly and leakage of feces
      onto the skin may occur even with correct eversion of the afferent limb. Despite easier
      application of stoma bags and therefore reduced risk of skin irritation, none of these
      alternative techniques are established. In various non-randomized studies rodless loop
      ileostomies were described with an overall morbidity between 3 and 39%. However definition of
      morbidity varies significantly in these studies and randomised controlled trials are missing
      so far.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to determine, whether a modification (without rod) of the current
      standard method of protective loop ileostomy formation (with rod) could improve ileostomy
      specific morbidity. Secondary endpoints include stoma care, determinants of quality of life
      and stoma function.

      Methods

      The study is designed as multi-institutional, randomized controlled, two-armed study.
      Patients scheduled for a protective loop ileostomy and meeting the eligibility criteria will
      be randomized to creation of a loop ileostomy with or without sustaining rod.
