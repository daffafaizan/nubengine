      I. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib therapy on circulating levels of myeloid derived
      suppressor cells MDSC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety of the study combination in study subjects.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on circulating levels of MDSC.

      II. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib and ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on the
      immunosuppressive function of circulating MDSC by measuring their ability to inhibit T cell
      proliferation and natural killer cell mediated antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity.

      III. Study the effect of ibrutinib and ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on levels of circulating
      innate and adaptive immune cells such as natural killer cell and T lymphocyte subsets.

      IV. Study circulating MDSC levels at the time of disease progression. V. Evaluate in a
      preliminary fashion the effect of the regimen on progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily for 15 days. After 7 days receiving
      ibrutinib, participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and
      15. Courses with nivolumab repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months.
