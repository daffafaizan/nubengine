      bed-days . Falls lead to prolonged length of hospital stays (LHS). The first step of an
      efficient and cost-effectiveness strategy of fall prevention is the screening of individuals
      at higher risk of falls. Recently, a brief geriatric assessment (BGA) composed of a few
      number of items has demonstrated to successfully predict the risk of prolonged LHS (5). We
      hypothesized that the use of the BGA items would make it possible to predict the occurrence
      of falls among older inpatients.
