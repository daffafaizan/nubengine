      institutional weaning guidelines: 6 hours after arrival in the ICU, a patient who is
      normothermic, hemodynamically stable, has normal blood gasses and absence of residual
      bleeding. The ICU nurse caring for the patient will start weaning the patient from the
      ventilator, following these departmental guidelines.
