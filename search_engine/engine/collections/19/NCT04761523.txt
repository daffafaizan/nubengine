      pancreatitis (ARP) and 10% progress to chronic pancreatitis (CP). While interventions to
      avoid recurrences exist for the two most common causes - removal of the cholecyst in the case
      of biliary, and alcohol seccation in the case of alcoholic - a method to prevent idiopathic
      pancreatitis is not yet known. Although none of the guidelines suggest the administration of
      low fat diet, it is recommended by physicians to all pancreatitis patients are. Our aim is to
      conduct a randomized controlled trial, to assess the problem of dietary fat reduction on the
      recurrence of acute pancreatitis Patients, who had at least two acute pancreatitis episodes
      in the preceding 2 year will be approached to participate in the study and to either to be
      randomized to the 'reduced fat diet' (15% fat, 65% carbohydrate, 20% protein) or to the
      'standard healthy diet' (30% fat, 50% carbohydrate, 20% protein; based on WHO
      recommendations) group. During the 2 year long followup, participants will receive repeated
      dietary intervention at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months, they will completer food frequency
      questionnaires and their data regarding mortality, BMI, cardiovascular parameters and serum
      lipid values will be recorded The EFFORT trial will determine the effect of modified dietary
      fat content on the recurrence of AP, mortality, serum lipids and weight loss in idiopathic
      cases.
