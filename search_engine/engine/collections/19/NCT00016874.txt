        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of 3-AP, cisplatin, and paclitaxel in patients
           with advanced or metastatic cancer.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive 3-AP IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4 and paclitaxel IV over 3
      hours followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response
      (CR) receive 1 additional course of therapy after documented CR. Patients with partial
      response or stable disease may receive therapy for up to 6 months.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP, paclitaxel, and cisplatin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
