      I. To examine the impact of legacy-making on coping strategies and adjustment outcomes among
      children with refractory or relapsed cancer.

      II. To examine the impact of legacy-making on coping strategies and adjustment outcomes among
      parent caregivers.

      III. To examine the process of implementing a web-based legacy-making intervention for
      children with refractory or relapsed cancer and their parent caregivers by obtaining parent
      self-reports (e.g., What did you and your child-like/not like about the intervention? How
      difficult was it to complete the intervention? What made it difficult? What else you would
      like to teach us?).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients participate in a web-based legacy intervention by answering questions about
      themselves and uploading videos, photographs, and music to create a digital story within 2
      weeks.

      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care. Patients have the option to participate in the
      web-based legacy intervention after 2 months.
