hormone therapy in metastatic breast cancer.. clinical response andurinary gonadotrophins .the total urinary gonadotrophin output of a group of post menopausalwomen with metastatic breast carcinoma undergoing hormone therapy, whichin every case initially consisted of treatment with diethylstilboestrol,des (ca. 20 mg/d), has been studied for periods varying from sevenmonths to 31/2 years .no correlation between gonadotrophin output and clinical response wasfound, except that in all cases showing objective regression urinarygonadotrophin remained low throughout the remission period . a low levelof gonadotrophin output was not, however, necessarily indicative of agood clinical remission . following withdrawal of des, and independentof the period of therapy, recovery to pre-treatment levels was the rulerather than the exception .a small group of patients maintained on a lower dose of des (3-5 mg/d)showed the same degree of suppression of urinary output as thosereceiving 20 mg/d, and several of these exhibited objective remissions .the study has emphasised the importance of site specificity in theresponse to hormone therapy, and underlines the difficulties of relatingthe clinical response of the patient as a whole to changes in hormonalenvironment .
