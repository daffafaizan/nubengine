      patients with ALCAPA and one other patient is currently enrolled in a prospective study after
      recent surgery, also at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. We propose to study these 3
      patients with this rare defect concurrently with their routine echocardiographic evaluations.
      Data will then be taken off-line for analysis.

      Standard deviations of times to peak contraction velocity will be assessed for twelve cardiac
      segments. These will be reevaluated at follow up intervals after surgery on previously
      obtained echocardiograms. Those subjects in whom improvement of cardiac function, Left
      Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and mitral regurgitation is seen will be compared to
      those in whom no improvement occurs.
