      anti-obsessional and behavioral improvement and conduct the first randomized controlled trial
      of naproxen sodium in the treatment of children with PANDAS. The study will involve an
      8-week, double-blinded randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of naproxen
      sodium (10mg/kg, by mouth, twice a day) versus placebo to treat OCD symptoms in children with
      PANDAS. The investigators will acquire completed data on 44 children with PANDAS for this
      pilot study (i.e., 22 randomized to active treatment; 22 randomized to placebo). Outcome will
      be assessed comparing pre- and post-treatment OCD symptom severity using a standardized,
      clinician-administered interview assessing OCD symptoms by an independent rater blind to
      treatment assignment.
