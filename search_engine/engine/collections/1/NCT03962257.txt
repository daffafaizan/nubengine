      couples. Half of the couples will be planning on undergoing ovulation induction with
      insemination (OI/IUI) and the other half in-vitro fertilization (IVF).

      Procedures (methods): This is a multi-center prospective randomized controlled trial where
      couples undergoing OI/IUI or IVF will be randomized to receiving the current traditional
      standard of in-person treatment teaching by their physician and nursing team with standard
      paper consents or to the identical process of in-person teaching with the addition of
      unrestricted access to the EngagedMD online video resource platform with online consents.

      Patient demographics, knowledge base, psychological impact of with the treatment, teaching
      and the consent process and overall satisfaction with the process as a whole will be assessed
      using surveys administered at three time points throughout the treatment process. A subset of
      patients that agree will be contacted after the completion of the treatment cycle for a live
      phone interview.
