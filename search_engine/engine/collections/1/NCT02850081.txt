      patients with carotid artery narrowing. Statins, a class of drugs usually used to lower blood
      cholesterol, may protect the brain after surgery. Specific statins have been shown to protect
      the brain after surgery when compared to others. eCD affects about 25% of patients undergoing
      CEA and about 15% of undergoing asymptomatic CEA. It is associated with marked elevations in
      tissue markers of cerebral injury and is associated with earlier post-CEA mortality. This
      clinically significant, but subtle, cerebral injury is 10 times more common than stroke and
      its mechanism appears to be similarly related to regional hypoperfusion and ischemia. It is
      imperative to determine in a prospective randomized trial whether alteration/increase of
      preoperative statin regimens leads to improved neurologic outcome and an even lower incidence
      of stroke and possibly greater survival.

      In order to optimally design and conduct such a trial it is critical to: 1) explore the
      safety and feasibility of altering statin regimen acutely (approximately 2 weeks) before CEA,
      and 2) clearly establish the neuroprotective outcome of an acute alteration in statin
      regimen. This would promote a better understanding of statin neuroprotection in humans and
      determine the statin treatment that affords the most neuroprotection in patients undergoing
      one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US.
