      4 mg reduction of their buprenorphine maintenance dose. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the relative exposures of lofexidine and its 3 major metabolites in subjects tapering
      from buprenorphine maintenance treatment. Lofexidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist under
      development for the treatment of acute withdrawal from short-acting opioids.
