      chemotherapy between concurrent capecitabine-based long-term radiotherapy and total
      mesorectal excision (TME) surgery would be more effectively improved local control rates and
      improved metastases-free survival rates. The investigators attempted to investigate the
      effect on pathological response of delivering 4 cycles XELOX between concurrent
      capecitabine-based long-term radiotherapy and TME with lengthening the interval from
      radiation to surgery. In this study, the participants with high risk of deeper infiltration,
      or extramural vessel invasion, or circumferential resection margin involvement, or
      surrounding organs and structures invaded et al. were recruited. The participants will be
      randomized (1:1 ratio) to a control and intervention arm. The participants in the control arm
      will receive best current practice of concurrent capecitabine-based long-term radiotherapy
      followed by TME and then a 6 cycles of XELOX as standard adjuvant chemotherapy. The
      participants in the intervention arm will receive concurrent capecitabine-based long-term
      radiotherapy followed by 4 cycles XELOX as neoadjuvant chemotherapy pre- a delayed TME.
