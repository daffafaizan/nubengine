    
      This is the first belgian feasibility study of HER2 imaging using a labelled monoclonal
      antibody, namely trastuzumab labelled with zirconium 89.

      The aims of this study are:

      I/ Evaluate the diagnostic potential of HER2 imaging using zirconium 89 labelled trastuzumab
      (based on the Groningen experience), through the analysis of the correlation between the
      FDG-PET/CT and the HER2 immunoPET.

      II/ PET quantification of HER2 receptor by using the images and the blood pharmacokinetic of
      the tracer.

      III/ In the subset of patients for whom biopsies of metastatic sites have not been carried
      out previously and are of an easy access, tissue will be acquired as part of the validation
      of the HER2 immunoPET and as an attempt to better understand the molecular heterogeneity of
      HER2 positive breast cancer at the time of relapse.

      IV/Evaluate the concentration of circulating HER2 extracellular domain in the blood and study
      his possible role as on imaging quality
