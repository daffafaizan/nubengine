    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and dose limiting toxicities of nelfinavir in combination with
      cisplatin plus inguinal +/-pelvic radiation therapy for treatment of patients with
      unresectable T2-4, N0-3 vulvar carcinoma.

      II. To determine the recommended phase II dose of nelfinavir combined with chemoradiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine recurrence site (local/distant), progression-free survival and overall
      survival.

      II. To determine the levels of Akt activity (and downstream effectors such as pGSK3, pEBP1)
      and p16INK4A in addition to the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) 16 and 18, and E6/E7
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) in vulvar biopsy specimens of patients at up to two(2) different time
      points (1. pre nelfinavir, pre-radiation, 2. while on nelfinavir, pre-radiation).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nelfinavir orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 8 weeks. Starting week 2,
      patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes once weekly during
      weeks 2-8. Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for 5 consecutive days
      between weeks 2-8. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 1 year.
