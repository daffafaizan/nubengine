      targeted bucindolol compared to metoprolol for the prevention of symptomatic atrial
      fibrillation or atrial flutter in a genotype-defined population with heart failure and/or
      reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at high risk of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter
      recurrence.
