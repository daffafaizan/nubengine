      genetic variations in the DNA extracted from blood samples collected from patients who were
      randomized (assigned to treatments by chance) in 1 of 3 previous topiramate studies on
      obesity and diabetes. The study consist of a screening telephone contact, a single visit to
      the study site for a blood sample collection (10 ml of whole blood) for genetic analyses, and
      a 24-hour post-sample adverse event reporting period. The total duration of the study is 24
      hours from the time of the blood sample collection. Safety will be monitored up to 24 hours
      after blood sample collection. No study medication was administered.
