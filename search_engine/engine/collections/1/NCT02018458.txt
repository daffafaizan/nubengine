      the immune effector function already present may augment the cytotoxic effects of standard
      therapies.

      vaccination remains the most attractive strategy because of its expected inducement of both
      therapeutic T cell immunity (effector T cells) and protective T cell immunity (tumor-specific
      memory T cells that can control tumor relapse). Several clinical studies have now
      demonstrated that immunity against tumor antigens can be enhanced in cancer patients by
      vaccination with ex vivo-generated tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs). This strategy
      capitalizes on the unique capacity of DCs to prime lymphocytes and to regulate and maintain
      immune responses.

      Our goals are to boost T cell immunity targeted against breast cancer utilizing a tumor
      antigen-loaded DC vaccine, to enhance chemotherapy effectiveness and decrease tumor
      metastagenicity, and to decrease the recurrence rates of LA TNBC and ER+/HER2- BC. Patients
      will be treated with a combination of antigen-loaded DC vaccinations along with standard
      preoperative chemotherapy, to improve immunogenicity and to increase the pCR rate achieved
      with standard therapy. The trial will consist of 2 patient cohorts: TNBC and ER+/HER2- BC.
