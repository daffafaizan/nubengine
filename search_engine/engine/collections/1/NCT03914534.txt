      randomized, single-dose, crossover study. 30 healthy adults will be randomized to receive a
      single dose (500 mg) of the test formulation of valproic acid and reference formulation of
      valproic acid separately in each treatment period. There will be two treatment sequences (AB,
      BA) and a 7 day washout between the two treatment periods.
