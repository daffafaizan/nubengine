      (narration leading through deep-breathing, mindfulness, and other relaxation techniques)
      followed by VR in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and caner. The VR headset (NeuTab
      VR Virtual Reality Headset, Dynamic Virtual Viewer, or similar device) used will be
      compatible with an iPhone purchased by the PI. The VR session will be narrated by Jon
      Seskevich, RN. Patients will be provided with a second iPhone to play the recording while the
      other iPhone is used to display the VR session.

      The patients will first be provided a consent form and consented. They will have the
      opportunity to ask questions prior to and following consent. They will subsequently give a
      pain score and fill out a GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health
      Questionnaire) form. They will be taught how to use the VR headset. Patients will listen to a
      recording by Jon Seskevich, RN of a ten-minute relaxation response. An iPhone will then be
      placed in the VR headset, the recording started, and the headset placed on the patient. The
      VR scene is available through Provata VR app and has been previously chosen prior to the
      start of the study. Following this, patients will again give a pain score as well as complete
      another GAD-7, PHQ-9, Presence Questionnaire, and Patient's Global Impression of Change
      (PGIC) form. Patients will be asked to fill out pain score and general health questions via
      the TRU-Pain app. Patients will then be able to ask questions/provide further feedback.
