      models of type 1 diabetes and to reduce the death of beta cells (cells that make insulin) in
      petri dishes. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione currently approved for the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes. This study explores the question of whether pioglitazone can preserve beta
      cell function in patients with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus.
