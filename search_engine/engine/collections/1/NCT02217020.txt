      cancer, but the role was limited, only 5%. The adverse event cause by radiotherapy was
      severe. This single phase II trial was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of triplet regimen
      (FOLFOXIRI) in treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. All patients will
      receive the study regimen every 2 weeks for 4-6 cycles. MRI of the pelvic will be performed
      after 4 cycles of chemotherapy to assess clinical response. If the tumor response over 20%
      after 4 cycles of treatment, the patient will go to surgery (TME) directly or 2 more cycles
      of treatment before surgery under the decision of MDT. On the contrary, if the tumor show
      poor response (<20%), radiotherapy will be performed before operation. After surgery, 6-8
      cycles of mFOLFOX6 will be given as adjuvant chemotherapy.
