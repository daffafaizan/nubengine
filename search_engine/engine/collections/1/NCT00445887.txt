      I. Determine the impact of levonorgestrel on the relative frequency of apoptosis in the
      ovarian epithelium of patients at high risk for ovarian cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the impact of this drug on proliferation and transforming growth factor-beta
      (TGF-beta) expression in the ovarian epithelium of these patients.

      II. Assess the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients
      are stratified according to menopausal status (premenopausal vs postmenopausal). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral levonorgestrel once daily.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily.

      In both arms, treatment continues for 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity, including on the day of surgery. Patients then undergo prophylactic
      salpingo-oophorectomy. After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 year.

      NOTE: * Patients who are unable to have surgery completed during the expected 4-6 weeks, may
      continue levonorgestrel or placebo for a time period no > 5 months. Patients unable to
      undergo surgery within 5 months are removed from the study.
