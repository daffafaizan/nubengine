      To reveal whether gait training with the WA for chronic stroke patients who can walk
      independently (Functional Ambulation Classification [FAC] 5 or 6) is superior to gait
      training with a physical therapist.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a multicenter study. Patients continue gait training with WA or without WA for 4
      weeks. The effect of rehabilitation is evaluated by 6 Minute Walk Test without device.
