      between 20 and 30 years, were recruited voluntarily from September 2010 to July 2011. All
      enrolled participants were informed of the purpose of the study and procedures, and provided
      written informed consent. The study was carried out at the institution where the authors
      belong.

      Research design. A prospective simple-blind trial was performed. After baseline assessment,
      participants were allocated to one of the two groups (control group, n=65; experimental
      group, n=64). An external assistant not involved in the study performed assignment.

      Intervention. A Physiotherapy professor with over-10-year experience in Ethics and

      applied the teaching methodology to the EG according to the group assignment. The
      intervention consisted of an eight-month blended-learning program based in professional
      ethics, including two phases: A) online syllabus and online activities (4 months); and B)
