      Functional evaluation of a standard and a high-flexion knee prosthesis using thigh-calf
      contact force measurements.

      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to investigate whether subjects receiving a high flexion knee
      prosthesis (Sigma RP-F, J&J, UK) show a better knee function than patients receiving a
      standard knee prosthesis (Sigma FB, J&J, UK).

      Study Design:

      Prospective double blind randomized study.

      Study population:

      Subjects who will receive total knee arthroplasty (TKA) because of invalidating gonarthritis
      based on primary osteoarthritis or rheumatic disorders or trauma.

      Intervention:

        -  28 subjects will receive the standard Sigma FB knee prosthesis.

        -  28 subjects will receive the high flexion Sigma RP-F knee prosthesis.
