      Patients will receive an MRI at the time of their scheduled PUSH ultrasound. Ideally, the MRI
      will be performed the same day or a similar time point near liver ultrasound (+/-90 days, but
      Investigators will allow a larger window due to the slow progression of fibrosis).

      Blinded radiology review of imaging sequences will be performed by a local study radiologist
      with central review performed by the Imaging Core. Analysis by the Imaging Core will include
      calculation of the liver stiffness, liver and spleen volume, and hepatic and lipid content
      for all MRI studies.
