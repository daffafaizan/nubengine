      multimodal analgesic regime following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) (i.e. both for spinal and
      general anesthesia). However, a femoral nerve block will often result in quadriceps
      paralysis, and this will increase the risk for the patient to fall as long as the femoral
      block have effect. Thus, the search for sensory nerve blocks to stop pain after TKA is a very
      interesting topic. The saphenous nerve is a purely sensory nerve, and the posterior branch of
      the obturator nerve is a mixed nerve, where the motor component only affects part of the
      adductor major muscle.
