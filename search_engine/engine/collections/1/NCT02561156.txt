      people who have depression. This study will look at the tolerability and PK of TAK-653 in
      healthy participants.

      The study may enroll up to 112 participants and each cohort will enroll 8 participants. This
      study consists of 2 parts: Part 1- single rising dose (SRD) consisting of at least 6 cohorts
      and Part 2- single rising dose and multiple rising dose (SRD/MRD) consisting of at least 5
      cohorts. Additional cohorts may be added depending on the emerging safety and PK data.
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) within each cohort
      to receive TAK-653 or placebo which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study
      doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need). Participants enrolled in
      Cohort 1 to 5 of Part 1 will receive TAK-653 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, 3.0 mg, 5.0 mg and 9.0 mg or
      TAK-653 placebo-matching tablet. Subsequent dose escalation in Part-1, from Cohort 6 onward
      will occur after the full availability of safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data from
      preceding cohorts. Participants in Part-2 Cohorts 1 to 3 will receive TAK-653 0.3 mg, 1.0 mg
      and 3.0 mg respectively. Dose for Part 2, from Cohort 4 onward will be based on review of
      safety, tolerability, and available PK and PD data from previous cohorts. All participants
      will be asked to take the drug at the same time each day on Day 1 for Part 1 and Day 1 and
      Days 6 to 18 in Part 2.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 14 days for Part 1 and 31 days for Part 2.
      Participants will be admitted to the clinic for 6 days in Part 1 and 22 days in Part 2.
      Participants will be followed up 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
