        -  To obtain a larger cohort of rhabdomyosarcoma samples (alveolar and embryonal) to
           establish a more accurate estimate of the frequency of particular genetic lesions.

        -  To provide the statistical power to establish an unambiguous connection between focal
           genetic lesions, histological subtype, and outcome for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.

      OUTLINE: DNA samples are analyzed in solid and liquid phase for exons of all genes mutated
      from previous discovery. DNA is then eluted and sequenced by illumina platform.
