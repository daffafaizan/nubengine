      there be a difference in the incidence of hypotension. Hypotension is a common complication
      especially for pregnant women undergoing caesarean section. A high speed of injection can
      theoretically cause a higher spread of anaesthetic, which may increase the incidence of
      hypotension. We want to know if by prolonging the injection time, will this lead to a
      reduction in a rate of hypotension.
