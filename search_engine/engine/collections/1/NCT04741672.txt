      design. This study will be conducted between February 2021 and March 2022 with premature
      infants mothers. The sample of the study will be mothers (n = 102) of premature infants
      discharged from Antalya Training and Research Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. 51
      mothers participating in the study will be given a premature infant home care guide after the
      discharge routine procedures are completed. In addition, mothers will be given an appointment
      for a phone call a week later. No intervention will be applied to the other 51 mothers after
      their discharge routine. Data will be collected by Mother-Infant Descriptive Information
      Form, Perceived Maternity Self-Efficacy Scale (PMSES), State Anxiety Inventory (SAI). Data
      will be collected with forms and scales immediately after discharge (pre-test) and in the 4th
      week after discharge (post-test). Ethics Committee and Institutional Permission was obtained
      for the study. In addition, written consent will be obtained from the participants.
      Statistical analysis will be done using SPSS 23.0 and significance will be evaluated at p
      <0.05. Support will be received in the analysis phase of the Statistical Information Unit of
      Akdeniz University. It is predicted that the new information obtained from the research data
      will guide the education of premature infant mothers and new researches.
