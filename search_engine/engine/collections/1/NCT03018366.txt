        1. To test the hypothesis premenopausal HypoE is associated with pre-clinical CVD as
           determined by reductions in vascular endothelial function and increased central arterial
           stiffness.

        2. To test the hypothesis premenopausal HypoE is associated with increased immune-mediated
           inflammation.

        3. To test the hypothesis estrogens can reduce inflammation, improve vascular endothelial
           function and central arterial stiffness in premenopausal HypoE women.

      In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in premenopausal HypoE women the
      investigators will test 12 weeks of transdermal estradiol 0.1 mg/day patch or placebo
      followed by 2 weeks of estradiol plus progesterone 200mg on vascular endothelial function,
      arterial stiffness and immune-mediated inflammation versus placebo. Patches will be applied
      by the participant to the lower abdomen twice weekly, alternating sides.

      The investigators will be using non-invasive tests to measure vascular function including:

        -  Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT)

        -  SphygmoCor measurements of central blood pressure

        -  Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT)
