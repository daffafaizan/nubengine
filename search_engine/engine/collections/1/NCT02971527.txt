      be randomly assigned to two different detective sequence groups. In one group, the
      investigators will detect the same calcaneus of each subject by experimental ultrasound bone
      strength device firstly and then by control device. In another group, the investigators will
      detect the same calcaneus of each subject by control ultrasound bone strength device firstly
      and then by experimental device. Experimental ultrasound bone strength device is developed by
      Wuxi Huajian Hengchuang Medical Equipment Science and Technology Co., Ltd.. This device's
      model number is Oste-scan 500A and report number is Z-Y-2009-2014, Z-E-0530-2014(G). Control
      ultrasound bone strength device which has same clinical indications and action mechanism with
      the experimental one, is manufactured by Osteosys Co., Ltd.. This device's model number is
      SONOST3000.
