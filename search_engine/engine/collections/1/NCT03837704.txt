    
      This is a controlled, open-label, 3-arm parallel group, multi-center study in patients
      diagnosed with Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) to evaluate the AAA annual growth rate in
      adult smokers randomized to either continue smoking combustible cigarettes (CC) or to switch
      to IQOS and in adults who had stopped smoking, as a non-randomized control arm.

      This is a descriptive study, designed to gain an understanding of how changes in smoking
      behaviors impact AAA growth rate and disease progression. Therefore, there are no formal
      statistical hypotheses to be tested.

      Smoking patients with AAA who did not quit smoking after their AAA diagnosis, and who are not
      intending to quit within the next 6 months will be screened for enrollment and randomization
      in the CC and IQOS arms if all other eligibility criteria are met.

      Smoking patients with AAA who had completely stopped smoking and using of any other tobacco
      or nicotine-containing products within 2 months of their AAA diagnosis, and are still
      abstinent at the time of the Screening Visit and of the Baseline Visit will be screened to be
      enrolled in the smoking cessation (SC) arm without randomization.
