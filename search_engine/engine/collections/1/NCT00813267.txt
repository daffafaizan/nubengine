      properties. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) have revascularization properties and
      complimentary effects to MSCs. Patients in this study will receive infusion of expanded
      autologous MSC and BMMNCs. The puncture of femoral artery will be conducted with digital
      subtraction angiography(DSA), and the tubes will be inserted into medial femoral circumflex
      artery,lateral femoral circumflex artery and obturatou artey. The study will evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of MSC infusion in patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head.
      This study will last for 5 years. Patients will undergo infusions at Day 0. Afterward,
      patients will be evaluated for response, and undergo X-ray examination, CT and MR scanning at
      a 6-month interval.
