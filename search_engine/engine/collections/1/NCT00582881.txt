      produces antibodies against the body's healthy cells and tissues. These antibodies, called
      autoantibodies, contribute to the inflammation of various parts of the body and can cause
      damage to organs and tissues. Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is another autoimmune
      disease that overlaps in terms of signs and symptoms with three other connective tissue
      diseases, including SLE. In both SLE and MCTD, the immune system appears to be abnormally
      activated by small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) autoantigens. Furthermore, lung tissue,
      in particular, appears to be affected by the immune response induced by snRNP autoantigens.
      The causes of SLE and MCTD remain unknown. However, it is likely that a combination of
      genetic, environmental, and possibly hormonal factors work together to cause the diseases.
      Past studies suggest that several different genes may be involved in determining a person's
      likelihood of developing SLE or MCTD, which tissues and organs are affected, and the severity
      of the disease. The purpose of this study is to characterize immune system abnormalities,
      genetic components, and disease progression in people with SLE and MCTD.

      Participants will attend up to four study visits, at intervals of at least 3 months, over the
      course of this study. Each study visit will include questionnaires, a physical exam, and
      possibly blood and/or urine collection. At the end of the study period, participants may
      choose to continue or discontinue participation.
