        -  Determine the optimal mode of injection (peritumoral vs periareolar) of patent blue V
           dye and technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid in patients with stage I or II breast cancer
           undergoing sentinel lymph node identification.

        -  Determine the reduction of morbidity associated with breast cancer surgery, in terms of
           local control and survival, in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node identification
           with these drugs.

        -  Determine the evolution of disease in patients who have undergone this procedure and do
           not show histological invasion of the sentinel lymph node.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive peritumoral injections of patent blue V dye and technetium Tc
           99m sulfur colloid.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive periareolar injections as in arm I. Patients in both arms
           showing histological metastasis of the sentinel lymph node or without identification of
           the sentinel lymph node undergo standard axillary lymph node dissection.

      Patients are followed for disease evolution.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients (225 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 2-2.5 years.
