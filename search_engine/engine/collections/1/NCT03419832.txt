      provided the opportunity to make autonomous choices is a paramount ethical premise in human
      research. The effectiveness of consent document design and consent process to accurately and
      fully convey the elements of informed consent is critical and deserves further study.
      Development of an improved informed consent document design for clinical studies would be a
      valuable contribution to human research. Chunking sentences or phrases in text into related
      groupings resulted in a positive significant improvement in reading comprehension among
      students with poor reading skills. Because the information contained in consent documents can
      be complex, detailed, and novel for potential research participants, the use of a modified
      form of chunking may be an effective and a low cost way of improving comprehension of the
      elements of consent. Specifically, the primary objective of the study is to determine if
      participants who receive the NEAT form report greater comprehension at the end of the consent
      process, than participants who receive a standard form.
