      double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled period designed to compare the safety and
      efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg and abatacept for the treatment of signs and symptoms of
      participants with moderately to severely active rheumatoid RA who had an inadequate response
      to or intolerance to bDMARD therapy and were currently on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) and had
      never received abatacept. Period 2 is an open-label, long-term extension study to evaluate
      the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once a day (QD) in
      participants with RA who had completed Period 1.
