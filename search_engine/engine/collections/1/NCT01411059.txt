      physical capacity in older adults; however, our clinical trial experiences suggest that
      without proper evidenced-based prescription, Yoga participation can be ineffective or even
      injurious for seniors. To address this lack of evidence-based knowledge, the proposed IDS
      will: 1) quantify the physical demands of a 32-wk Yoga program designed for independent
      ambulatory seniors; 2) characterize the relations between these demands and participant
      physical characteristics; 3) examine the adherence, efficacy, & safety of the program; and 4)
      characterize the relations among reported adverse events, baseline participant
      characteristics, and Yoga physical demands.
