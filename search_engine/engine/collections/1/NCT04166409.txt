    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To demonstrate that the efficacy of treatment with selumetinib as measured by event-free
      survival (EFS) is non-inferior compared to treatment with carboplatin/vincristine (CV) in
      previously-untreated low-grade glioma (LGG) not associated with BRAFV600E mutations or
      systemic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate tumor response rates to each regimen of chemotherapy. II. To evaluate visual
      acuity (VA) outcomes utilizing Teller Acuity Cards (TAC) and HOTV letter acuity testing in
      previously-untreated optic pathway gliomas (OPGs).

      III. To describe the improvement in motor function as measured by the Vineland Scale in
      children with previously-untreated LGG that have motor deficits at enrollment.

      IV. To estimate the difference in EFS and tumor response rate between BRAF rearranged and
      non-BRAF rearranged patients treated on each chemotherapy regimen.

      V. To prospectively evaluate the quality of life of children with LGG not associated with
      BRAFV600E or systemic NF1 treated with either CV or selumetinib.

      VI. To prospectively evaluate the cognitive, social, emotional, and behavioral functioning of
      children with LGG not associated with BRAFV600E or systemic NF1 treated with either CV or
      selumetinib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To obtain paired blood and tumor specimens for future biology studies, including studies
      to correlate genomic drivers to response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) over 1 minute on days 1,
      8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, and 64, and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,
      22, 43, 50, 57, and 64 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 1, 8, and 15, and
      carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 42 days for
      up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 27 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for year 1,
      every 6 months for years 2-3, and then annually for years 4-10.
