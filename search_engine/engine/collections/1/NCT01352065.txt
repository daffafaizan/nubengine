      (particularly aerobic) after 7-day intake of higher doses of non-selective ERA bosentan
      (doses used were approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment). This is in part in
      accordance with results of previous research (Faoro et al. 2009), although authors
      administered regular single dose (62.5 mg) of bosentan in hypoxic healthy subjects. Our study
      should examine metabolic profiles of athletes after receiving significantly higher doses of
      two oral ERA as compared to previous research, along with assessment of ergogenic potential
      with 8 weeks of administration in placebo-control and randomized design. We expect that ERA
      will increase time to exhaustion during endurance test, increase the maximal oxygen uptake
      and rate of ultra-short term heart rate recovery after exercise, and affecting blood and
      urine cortisol, testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone following administration. Moreover,
      we will clearly evaluate 24-h pharmacokinetic profile of ERA in blood and urine and collect
      data for concentration-time profiles of ERA and main active metabolites, in aim to provide
      more rationale basis for identification and detection for doping control.
