      continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP) versus nasal Bilevel positive airway pressure
      (n-BiPAP) and non invasive positive pressure ventilation(NIPPV) on the need for mechanical
      ventilation via endotracheal tube (MVET) to 7 days of age or less in preterm infants less
      than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation requiring intubation and surfactant if indicated for
      respiratory distress syndrome within 120 min of delivery . Second aim is to compare different
      outcomes of post-extubation n-CPAP , n-BiPAPand NIPPV.
