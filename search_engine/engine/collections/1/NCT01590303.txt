      biomarkers have been shown to be increased during periods of oxidative stress eg
      post-operative, trauma, sepsis. The investigators will determine if Vitamin C administration
      decreases oxidative stress and as a result, a decrease in the markers of organ dysfunction eg
      SOFA Scores. Ultimately, if the investigators show a decrease in injury to organs, will this
      result in a better outcome for patients.
