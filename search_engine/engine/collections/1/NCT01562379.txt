      strategies, adequate complementary feeding practices and provision of complementary foods
      that are appropriate and fill the nutrient gap by providing macro and micronutrients
      essential for growth are important means to reduce the global burden of undernutrition and
      related morbidity and mortality.

      We propose to evaluate the impact of three complementary food supplement products that are
      fortified with micronutrients in a rural, remote setting in Bangladesh, where high rates of
      childhood undernutrition persist on child growth, health, and development. The three foods
      being tested are an enhanced wheat-soy blend (WSB++) developed by WFP, and locally developed
      chickpea-based and a rice-based complementary food supplements.

      We will assess the impact of feeding these daily against the non-fed controls, hypothesizing
      that the children fed these foods show increased length for age Z scores (LAZ) and weight for
      length age Z scores (WLZ) of >0.21 and decreased prevalence of stunting and wasting by >10%.
      We expect that the impact of the three foods will be equivalent/ non-inferior to that of
      Plumpy'Doz.
