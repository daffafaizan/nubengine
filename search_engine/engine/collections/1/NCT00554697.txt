      lower in diabetic than non-diabetic patients; and, 2) supplemental oxygen provides less
      benefit in diabetic than non-diabetic patients.

      We propose a prospective case-control study which will include 30 Type II diabetics matched
      for age, sex, and race to 30 non-diabetic controls. Patients will be preselected from a
      population undergoing abdominal surgery and given supplemental inspired oxygen of 30 - 80% to
      PaO2 of approximately 150mmHg and/or 300mmHg at three timepoints in the perioperative period.
      PsqO2 will be measured with an IV-sized probe inserted through a small incision made in the
      skin. Data will be recorded and analyzed using unpaired two tailed t-test, Wilcoxon's ranked
      sum test, or repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) test as appropriate.
