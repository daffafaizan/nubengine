      or minimally conscious state (MCS). At present, there are no evidence-based guidelines
      regarding the treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). A previous study
      showed that a single stimulation (using transcranial direct current stimulation - tDCS) of
      the left prefrontal cortex induces an behavioral improvement in some patients in DOC.
      Nevertheless, only 43% of patients in MCS responded to the stimulation. Therefore, it is
      needed to find new protocols to increase the number of responders and improve the effect of
      tDCS in patients with DOC.

      In this study, investigators aim to assess the effect of single session anodal (i.e.,
      excitatory) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over right and left
      fronto-temporal cortices (using 4 anodes and 4 cathodes), on the level of consciousness of
      patients with DOC, in a double blind randomized sham controlled study. The anodes will be
      placed over F3, F3, CP5 and CP6.

      tDCS is a form of safe non-invasive cortical stimulation, modulating cortical excitability
      under the electrodes, via weak polarizing currents. It has been reported that anodal tDCS
      transiently improves working memory and attention by stimulating the left DLPF in healthy
      subjects and patients with stroke, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. By increasing the
      surface of the stimulated area, it is expected to increase the number of responders as
      patients' brain lesion are very heterogeneous and widespread.
