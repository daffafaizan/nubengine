      incidence and prevalence rates.Anemia is one of the most frequent early complication of CKD.
      The main cause is erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency due to impaired kidney function However,
      other causes should be considered when the severity of anemia is inconsistent with the
      decrease in renal function; when there is evidence of iron deficiency or matching decreases
      in hemoglobin, leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia are also found
