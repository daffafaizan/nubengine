    
      This study aims to test brain activation changes related to self-regulation targets of
      attention, emotion regulation, self-compassion, interoception and pain regulation that are
      influenced by mindfulness training within primary care (compare MINDFUL-PC study).

      The study will also look at whether successful chronic disease self-management relates to the
      observed brain activation changes after compared to before the mindfulness intervention.

      The study will examine the relationship between mindfulness training within primary care and
      medical regimen adherence (initiation and maintenance) as well as the underlying neural
      correlates associated with changes in self-regulation.

      This is a single-arm pilot trial, recruiting from a randomized controlled trial (see
      MINDFUL-PC study). .
