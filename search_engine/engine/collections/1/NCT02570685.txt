      gratitude journal, and b) an reflective and behavioral interpersonal gratitude journal,
      versus (c) an active control journal, on life satisfaction and other secondary outcomes.
      Explanatory mechanisms will be tested utilizing the broaden-and-build theory of positive
      emotions. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of these three conditions with three
      week, one month and three month follow-up assessments.
