    
      This is an open-label study randomized by sequence. Each eligible subject who signs a consent
      form and fulfills all Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will undergo ophthalmic measurements by
      the two test products:

      A. Haag-Streit Lenstar Version i4

      B. Zeiss IOL Master 500

      The order of measurements for the IOL Master 500 and the Haag-Streit Lenstar Version i4 will
      he randomized. The two possible sequences will be balanced (approximately 22 eyes each:
      AB,BA). One eye of each subject will be measured. Time needed to complete testing will be
      measured utilizing a stop-watch. Total time needed to complete all measurements of the study
      eye using each of the test products to capture a complete ophthalmic exam with the devices
      standard operating settings set to automatic measurement and analysis will be calculated by
      the following start and stop points:

      First Timed Measurement: Measurement Acquisition Start: When the technician starts to acquire
      tbe first measurement Stop: When the technician has completed all measurements

      Second Timed Measurement: Subject Data Entry Start: When the technician starts to enter the
      subject data. Stop: When the technician has completed subject data entry.

      Third Timed Measurement: Complete Ophthalmic Exam with each test product Start: When tbe
      subject is seated at the instrument, just prior to the technician entering any subject data
      into the test product.

      Stop: Upon completion of all measurements using one of the test products, just prior to
      printing results.

      Three trained technicians will operate tbe same study devices (Haag-Streit Lenstar Version i4
      and IOL Master 500). Approximately equal number of subjects will be assigned to each
      technician.
