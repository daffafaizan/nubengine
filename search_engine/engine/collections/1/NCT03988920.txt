    
      Patients who complete the TEN-02-301 study (PHREEDOM) may be eligible to enroll into
      TEN-02-401 (NORMALIZE).

      Patients from the TEN-02-301 tenapanor arm will either receive only tenapanor or be given
      sevelamer in addition to tenapanor based on their sP. Patients from the TEN-02-301 sevelamer
      arm will be given tenapanor in addition to their sevelamer dose and the sevelamer dose will
      then be adjusted based on their sP following a protocol-specified dose titration schedule.
      Patients will be monitored for safety and efficacy with in-office and telephone visits for up
      to an additional 18 months.

      Laboratory assessments will be measured at every visit (Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 and Months
      3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18) using a central laboratory.

      Safety assessments will be performed during the study and will include physical examinations,
      vital signs (blood pressure and pulse), body weights, clinical laboratory evaluations,
      12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and adverse event (AE) monitoring.
