        -  Determine the toxicity of hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) in young
           patients with metastatic medulloblastoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of chemotherapy (vincristine during radiotherapy and 8 courses of
           lomustine, cisplatin, and vincristine after radiotherapy) in association with HART in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Radiotherapy and vincristine: Beginning 4-6 weeks after surgery, patients undergo
           hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (HART) twice a day, 5 days a week, for 5
           weeks. Patients also receive vincristine IV once weekly for 8 weeks beginning in week
           1*. Approximately 6-8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, patients proceed to
           maintenance chemotherapy.

      NOTE: *The first 7 patients undergo radiotherapy without receiving vincristine

        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Patients receive oral lomustine once on day 1 and cisplatin IV
           over 6 hours on day 1 and vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 6
           weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.
