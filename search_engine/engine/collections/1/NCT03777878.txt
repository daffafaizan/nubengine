      to maternal mortality and morbidity especially in developing countries. The risk of PPH is
      much higher for women undergoing cesarean delivery (CD). Oxytocin is regarded as the gold
      standard uterotonic agent but only has a half-life of 4-10 min; therefore, at cesarean
      section oxytocin must be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion to attain
      sustained uterotonic activity throughout the surgical procedure and immediate postpartum
      period. Carbetocin is a long-acting synthetic analog of oxytocin that can be administered as
      a single-dose injection; intravenously administered carbetocin has a half-life of
      approximately 40 min.

      A single intravenous bolus of carbetocin produces a tetanic uterine contraction within 2 min
      and persists for an average of 60 min following injection.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of combined tranexamic acid (TA) and
      oxytocin infusion with intravenous carbetocin for prevention of PPH in patients with risk
      factors during cesarean section.
