      patients treated for an advanced ovarian cancer will limit physical alteration before major
      abdomino-pelvic surgery, compared to a control group without prehabilitation program. The
      primary endpoint will be the comparison of the variation of VO2 max, between baseline and
      surgery, in the prehabilitation group vs control group: VO2 max will be measured with a
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) at maximal effort.

      This prospective, multicentric randomized control trial will be conducted in 7 French
      comprehensive cancer Centers or University Hospital, in compliance with inclusion criteria.
      After an initial evaluation, patients will be randomized in two groups: Prehabilitation group
      (P group) and a Control group (C group).

      For the P group, after baseline evaluation, we will be offering from diagnosis to surgery,
      during the NACT:

        -  A standardized, patient-tailored preoperative physical activity training program will be
           performed at home, from diagnosis to surgery. Supervision will be done with connected
           device (connected watches) and activity will be adapted,

        -  A nutritional care established in respect of the SFNEP-SFNCM guidelines. Nutritional
           support will be adapted by a dietician according to information transmitted daily
           (connected body fat weight scale),

        -  A psychological support with coping strategies.

      For the C group: Patients with ovarian cancer will undergo NACT after baseline evaluation
      without prehabilitation program.

      After NACT, for both groups, major abdomino-pelvic surgery will be done with or without ERAS
      pathway, according to the practice in each center.
