      neurodegeneration, and patients with idiopathic RBD have increased prevalence of non-motor
      symptoms (or prodromal markers) closely related to Parkinson's disease(PD). Moreover, the
      investigator's previous studies have further confirmed the familial aggregation of RBD, and
      first-degree relatives (FDRs) of RBD patients had more prodromal markers of Parkinson's
      disease compared with FDRs of healthy controls.

      In these regards, current prospective study aims to map the progression and evolution of
      prodromal markers (including autonomic dysfunction, olfactory loss, color vision impairment,
      neurocognitive impairment, neuroimaging of dopamine dysfunction, daytime sleepiness and
      psychiatric disorders), onset of RBD, and neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, other markers,
      such as physical activity and circadian rhythm and tonic electromyography (EMG) activity
      level, which have been found to be reliably associated with Parkinson's disease or other
      neurodegenerative diseases. In this regard, it is also interesting to investigate whether
      these indicators will additionally predict the progression of prodromal markers of PD.
