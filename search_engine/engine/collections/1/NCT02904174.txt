      community elderly centres. A 6-week HLP, which included one 45 minutes weekly session, was
      offered to the participants.

      122 participants were recruited. This study shows that the 6-week HLP has a potential to
      improve the physical well-being of the participants, and to increase their knowledge in diet,
      drug management and fall prevention.
