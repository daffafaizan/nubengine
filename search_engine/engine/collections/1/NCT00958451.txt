      vitamin D levels as defined by K DOQI Guidelines. Patients will be randomized to receive oral
      daily ergocalciferol or paricalcitol. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled, 40 in the
      cholecalciferol group and 40 in the paricalcitol group. Outcomes will be assessed as
      proportion of patients achieving pre-defined changes from baseline and as absolute changes
      from baseline values. Baseline values will be determined from averaging two consecutive
      measurements of the variables of interest prior to randomization.
