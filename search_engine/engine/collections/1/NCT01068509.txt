      safety and consistency of manufacturing between Cvac drug product manufactured in the United
      States (US) and Australia. After the manufacturing characteristics of Cvac were confirmed to
      be consistent and each patient in the initial cohort had completed 1 injection cycle of Cvac
      with no serious or treatment-related Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs), 56 patients were
      enrolled and randomized (1:1) to either Cvac or observational standard of care (OSC).
