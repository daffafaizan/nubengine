3200. studies on the binding of protein by nickel.with special reference toits role in nickel sensitivitythe reaction between nickel and proteinswas studied using the technique ofequilibrium dialysis.  in most of the experimentscrystalline bovine serumalbumen was used.  the nickel-protein complexwas of low stability, the quantityof nickel bound by the protein being dependenton the concentration of freenickel ions, the ph, and the particular protein used.the sites of binding ofthe nickel ions were primarily carboxyl and aminogroups.  the author concludedthat it was unlikely that nickel behaved as ahapten capable of initiating anallergic response.
