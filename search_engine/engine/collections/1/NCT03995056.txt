      diagnosed with NAFLD and body mass index under 35 kg/m2 will be recruited. They will be
      randomly assigned in a high-intensity aerobic interval training (n=30) and a control group
      with a sedentary lifestyle (n=30). The intervention group follows a supervised high-intensity
      aerobic interval training two times per week and additionally, an individualised home workout
      program to have 3 hours of aerobic training per week. Blood samples, adipose tissue biopsy,
      24h-urine and faecal samples will be collected at the baseline, midway (only stool) and at
      the end of the study. Dietary intake will be analysed at weeks 0, 6, 12.
