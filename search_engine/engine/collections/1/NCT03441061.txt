      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete morphologic remission with positive minimal residual
      disease (MRD) in terms of relapse-free survival (RFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate other efficacy endpoints such as overall survival and MRD negativity rate by
      flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overall and after the first cycle, as
      well as safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin in this setting.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive inotuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 day and then periodically
      every 6 months.
