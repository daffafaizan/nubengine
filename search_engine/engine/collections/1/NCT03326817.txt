      motion of the fingers (finger flexion and extension) of degenerative arthritis patients, for
      the purpose of providing pain relief and alleviating stiffness at the finger joints.
      Specifically, we intend to 1) observe the changes in range of motion of the fingers using the
      Total Active Motion (TAM) measure; 2) observe the changes in grip strength and pinch
      strength; and 3) record changes in the patients' perception of performance in activities of
      daily living using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM).

      The hypothesis is that a soft robotics approach in providing continuous passive motion of the
      finger joints of degenerative arthritis patients can reduce pain, maintain mobility and
      flexibility of the joints, and to improve hand function. The soft robotics approach and the
      standard hand therapy is better than the standard hand therapy alone.

      The proposed soft robotic glove is capable of providing continuous passive motion (flexion
      and extension) of the fingers, and in addition, it is also designed to be portable and easy
      to operate, with minimal supervision. It is aimed at the home therapy of degenerative
      arthritis patients. In this study, by using the soft robotic glove and in observing changes
      in finger range of motion, grip and pinch strength, as well as perception of performance in
      daily activities. This is important in establishing this device as a viable means to
      ultimately slow down the progression of degenerative arthritis, and to significantly improve
      the patients' abilities in carrying out activities of daily living, which had been impaired
      by degenerative arthritis.
