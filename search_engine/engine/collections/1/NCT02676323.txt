    
      STUDY PART 1: Dose Escalation Cohort

      During the dose escalation phase (Part 1), participants will receive one course of
      panobinostat plus fludarabine and cytarabine. The starting dose of panobinostat will be 10
      mg/m^2/dose, with 2 additional dose levels of 15 and 20, depending on tolerability. Each
      course is 12 days

      STUDY PART 2: Dose Expansion Cohort

      The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be chosen based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and the totality of data obtained from study Part 1. Additional patients will be enrolled, if
      needed, so that at least 6 patients are treated with the recommended RP2D to confirm the MTD
      of panobinostat to be given in study Part 2.

      After final MTD determination, 12 additional participants will be treated at this dose level
      for further evaluation of tolerability and response, including more complete toxicity data
      and estimation of the response rate to the combination of panobinostat, fludarabine, and
      cytarabine.
