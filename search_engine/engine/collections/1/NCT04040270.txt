      interaction and communication between parents and children. Healthy eating and physical
      activity were also promoted. The drama project staged 100 drama performances in primary
      schools during the 2012-13 school year. The main targets were Primary 4 to 6 (P4-6) students
      and their families. Group A students would watch the live drama in school and were encouraged
      to watch the DVD and finish worksheets with their parents, while group B students would be
      given a DVD and worksheets and were encouraged to watch the DVD and finish the worksheets
      with their parents.

      The goals of the study were to evaluate the effectiveness of the project to enhance health,
      happiness, harmony (3Hs), healthy eating and physical activity and participants' satisfaction
      levels towards the drama project.

      Quantitative assessments were used to evaluate the effectiveness and the satisfaction of the
      project. Questionnaire was distributed to assess the immediate and short-term effects.
