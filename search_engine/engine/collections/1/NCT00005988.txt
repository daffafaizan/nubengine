      bone marrow failure who receive HLA haploidentical bone marrow treated with anti-B7 antibody
      have normal engraftment. II. Determine if these patients are free of hyperacute graft versus
      host disease (GVHD), defined as grade D GVHD in the first 10 posttransplant days, when
      treated with this regimen. III. Determine if these patients have an acceptable incidence of
      life threatening grade D GHVD in the first 50 posttransplant days following this treatment
      regimen. IV. Determine the safety and tolerability of this treatment regimen in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood
      cells which are incubated with donor bone marrow cells in the presence of anti-B7.1 and
      anti-B7.2 antibodies for 36 hours. Patients receive total body irradiation twice daily on
      days -6 to -3, cyclophosphamide IV daily on days -2 and -1, and methylprednisolone IV every
      12 hours for a total of 4 doses on days -2 to 0. Patients are infused with the treated donor
      bone marrow on day 0. Patients then receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and
      leucovorin calcium IV 24 hours after each dose of methotrexate every 6 hours for 3-8 doses
      each time. Patients also receive cyclosporine IV or orally twice daily on days -2 to 100.
      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
