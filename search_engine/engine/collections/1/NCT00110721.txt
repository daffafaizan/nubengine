      tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors who failed standard, approved
      treatments. The main reason for doing this Phase II study in advanced colorectal cancer
      patients is to verify the safety observations in the early Phase I study and further evaluate
      the efficacy of these drugs' combination to stabilize tumors, preventing further growth and
      potentially shrink tumors.
