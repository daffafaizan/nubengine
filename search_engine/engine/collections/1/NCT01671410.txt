      period. In a clinical trial, sublingual buprenorphine reduced this treatment period by ~30%.
      However, infants with both opioid and benzodiazepine exposure were not included in the trial.
      This study will test the safety and tolerability of sublingual buprenorphine in infants with
      in utero exposure to benzodiazepines or who are breastfeeding.
