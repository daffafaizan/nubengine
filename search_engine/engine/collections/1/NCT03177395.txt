    
      The study will be an open label, randomised, exploratory, rising dose design, NAC controlled,
      phase 1 safety and tolerability study in patients treated with NAC for
      paracetamol/acetaminophen overdose.

      Entry into the study will depend on the patient's blood results confirming the need for NAC.
      A total of 24 patients will be assigned into one of 3 dosing cohorts of 8 patients (N=6 for
      PP100-01 and NAC; N=2 for NAC alone).

      The study will primarily evaluate safety and tolerability for treatment with PP100-01 in
      combination with NAC as compared to NAC alone.
