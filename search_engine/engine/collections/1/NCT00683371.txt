      from the maxillary sinuses of ten CRS patients undergoing sinus surgery are analyzed using
      three microarrays: 16S rRNA PhyloChip (to detect bacteria), MycoChip (to detect fungi) and
      ViroChip (to detect viruses). Ten control patients with normal sinuses, as assessed by CT
      scan and a sinusitis-specific survey, will have the same samples taken. The hypothesis is
      that bacterial, fungal, and viral communities present in the maxillary sinus of patients with
      CRS are significantly different from those patients with healthy sinuses, and that
      microorganisms identified in patients with or without CRS will differ from previously
      published data obtained using other techniques. Comparing diseased and control flora will
      provide insight into the relative contribution of each pathogen to CRS and may guide the
      development of future therapies.
