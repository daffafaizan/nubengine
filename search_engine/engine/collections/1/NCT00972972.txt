      high in antioxidants (e.g., blueberries, strawberries and spinach) can retard and even
      reverse age-related decline in brain function and in cognitive and motor performance in rats.
      This is the first placebo-controlled human study to evaluate the effect of dietary intake of
      fruit polyphenols on neuropsychological test scores and whole blood gene regulation

      Sixty-two non-demented, non-depressed men (age 67-77 years) with subjective memory decline,
      were randomly assigned to a blueberry/grape juice- and placebo-group in a 9 week double blind
      intervention study. Pre- and post treatment assessment were measured with a computerised
      neuropsychological test battery (CANTAB), including tests for motor speed, visual reaction
      time, and spatial memory. Dietary habits were registered before intervention and several
      clinical biomarkers were measured in plasma/serum before and after the intervention. Pre- and
      post intervention-samples for measurement of gene regulation were also collected
