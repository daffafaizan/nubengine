      3 cm in size) primary hepatocellular carcinoma will be randomized into two percutaneous
      ablation treatment arms, including radiofrequency ablation and multi-pronged ethanol
      ablation. The local treatment responses, complications,and long-term disease-free survivals
      and overall survivals are analyzed.
