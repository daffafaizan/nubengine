    
      This is an open, multicenter, two-armed Phase III study

      Patients will be randomized to either of the following two arms:

      Arm A (concomitant arm), Gemcitabine 1000 mglm2 will be administered intravenously on Days 1
      and 8, repeated on Day 22. Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 will be given on Day 8 (before Gemcitabine),
      repeated on Day 22. This 3-week schedule defines a cycle of treatment for this arm. Overall 8
      cycles will be administered.

      Arm B (sequential arm) four cycles of Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 an Day 1, repeated an Day 22,
      followed by four cycles of Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 an a Day 1 and 8, repeated an Day 22, will
      be given. Both drugs will be administered in a 3-week schedule.

      Bimonthly follow-up for patients without confirmed disease progression until progression of
      disease. Long-term follow-up for patients with confirmed disease progression will be done in
      4 intervals.

      For therapy control frequent blood chemistry and hematology, physical examination, weight
      control, potential adverse events and imaging procedures (CT, X-ray, MRI, Bone scan) am
      foreseen.
