      extubation. In the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), a blinded safety-assessor will use the
      visual analog scale to clinically assess post-operative pain. Post-operative nausea and
      vomiting (PONV) will be assessed using a PONV rating scale every 30 minutes until PACU
      discharge. All patients will be monitored with continuous pulse-oximetry.
