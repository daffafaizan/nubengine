    
      1. To study whether in healthy subjects with an increased platelet turnover, a twice daily
           dosing of aspirin 81 mg will be more effective in inhibiting platelets compared with
           once a day aspirin 81 mg.

        2. To study whether in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with an increased
           platelet turnover, a twice daily dosing of aspirin 81 mg will be more effective in
           inhibiting platelets compared with once a day aspirin 81 mg.

        3. To study whether in healthy subjects with an increased platelet turnover, a twice daily
           dosing of aspirin 81 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg will be more effective in inhibiting
           platelets compared with once daily of both aspirin and clopidogrel.

        4. To study whether in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), increased
           platelet turnover and aspirin resistance, an oral fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
           and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), 4 gm/day) supplementation will increase the efficacy of
           aspirin by modifying platelet function compared to once a day aspirin 81 mg.
