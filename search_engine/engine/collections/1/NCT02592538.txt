      neoplasms are unresectable at the time of diagnosis. Biliary drainage with placement of metal
      or plastic stents for palliation is the therapy of choice in this set of patients.

      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is well established method for treatment of some solid tumors,
      like liver cancer, lung cancer, etc. Recently, an endoscopically applicable radiofrequency
      probe, HabibTM EndoHBP catheter, was approved for clinical use. RFA uses a high-frequency
      alternating current to generate heat and achieve coagulative necrosis when in contact with
      tissue. Many studies showed RFA with biliary stent was a beneficial treatment option for
      palliation of malignant biliary strictures. However, most of therapeutic effects were
      expected to delay bile duct obstruction rather than to decrease the tumor. Recently orally
      available chemotherapeutic agent, S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine, was reported as effective in
      patients with bile duct adenocarcinoma. To date, little is known about the role of the
      addition of systemic chemotherapy to RFA for cholangiocarcinoma.

      The aim of this study is to conduct a randomised, controlled, clinical trial to compare the
      effect of S-1 plus RFA with stent with RFA with stent in patients with unresectable
      cholangiocarcinoma.
