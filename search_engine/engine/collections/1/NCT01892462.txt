        -  you will come into the EP device clinic every three months for one year to have your
           device interrogated and will complete an EKG

        -  you will have labs drawn to measure levels of certain markers of inflammation in the
           body. This information will be used to identify new ways to test for risk of abnormal
           heart rhythms and other heart disease

        -  you will review your medications with the study coordinator and along with any recent
           illnesses or hospitalizations
