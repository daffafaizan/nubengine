      double-blinded and randomized. Participants will first attend a screening visit (Visit #1) to
      determine eligibility. Then, eligible participants will be asked to wear a FreeStyle Libre
      Pro continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for up to 14 days (Visit #2). After this 14-day CGM
      session, participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two groups that will receive:
      1) food products containing onyx sorghum (Onyx Group) or 2) food products with wheat flour
      (Control Group). The diet intervention will last a total of 28 days. Participants will have
      weekly visits to pick up food and bi-weekly blood draws (no more than 20mL at each visit).
      They will also be asked to wear the CGM throughout the diet intervention and will record
      their food intake in a daily food diary to confirm that the diet intervention is being
      followed.
