      permanent ostomy. This type of surgery is usually associated with processes that fall within
      the scope of Coloproctology.PH is difficult to deal with high rates of recurrence after
      surgical repair.This type of hernia remains a problem of first order, generating a
      significant consumption of health and economic resources and determining an impaired quality
      of life of these patients.Laparoscopic surgery is increasingly used in colorectal surgery.

      Also with this type of approach is present the problem of prevention of PH. The use of a mesh
      in the repair of hernias is not discussed since the placement of a prosthesis significantly
      reduces the recurrence rate. There are now many types of prosthetic meshes available. A low
      weight mesh composed of large pores (about 5mm) with a high proportion of absorbable material
      and a layer of oxidized regenerated cellulose which is placed in the vicinity of the bowel is
      available on the market (PROCEED Â®, Ethicon). The introduction of this low-weight mesh
      provides a good opportunity to prevent the development of an PH when we use a laparoscopic
      approach.
