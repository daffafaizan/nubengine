    
      This is an open-label, multiple-dose, Phase 1 study in premenopausal subjects aged 18 years
      to 40 years, with a history of regular menstrual cycles (24 to 32 days long) and no evidence
      of significant gynecological disorders. The objective of the study is to determine the
      effects of different dosing regimens of elagolix on ovulation, ovarian activity, and ovarian
      reserve. The study consists of 3 periods: a Screening Period of up to 50 days prior to the
      first dose, a Treatment Period of 3 months duration (Cycles 1-3), and a Follow-up Period of
      up to 60 days. During the Screening and Treatment menstrual cycles, serial transvaginal
      ultrasounds and determination of serum levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating
      hormone, estradiol, progesterone, and inhibin B will be performed three times weekly.
      Subjects will maintain a daily diary of uterine bleeding. Pregnancy testing will be performed
      frequently throughout the study. Subjects will be required to use nonhormonal dual
      contraception consistently during the study, and will be counseled on appropriate and
      effective forms of birth control to promote pregnancy prevention.
