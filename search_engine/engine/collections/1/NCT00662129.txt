      Primary

        -  To determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate of patients with metastatic
           breast cancer treated with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation,
           gemcitabine hydrochloride, and bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the confirmed response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30
      minutes and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after every other course, and then after
      completion of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
