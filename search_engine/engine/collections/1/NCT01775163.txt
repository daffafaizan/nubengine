      198 individuals with the objective to understand why certain people fail to lose weight in
      exercise programs. In E-Mechanic changes in body weight, body composition, energy intake and
      energy expenditure are measured before and after 3 different exercise programs of 24 weeks in
      duration. The 3 exercise programs being compared are self-directed exercise, low dose
      exercise and high dose exercise. The goal of this ancillary study is to undertake
      comprehensive assessments of energy metabolism in a metabolic chamber in a group of 60 obese
      individuals enrolled in the main study. We will compare differences in the changes in 24h
      energy expenditure and spontaneous physical activity between the 3 exercise programs. We will
      also test if changes in energy metabolism might explain why people don't lose the expected
      amount of weight after 24 weeks of exercise.
