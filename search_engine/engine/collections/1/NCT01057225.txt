      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose of carfilzomib given in combination with oral
      cyclophosphamide and thalidomide and dexamethasone. (Phase I) II. In newly diagnosed myeloma
      to evaluate the response rate (CR, nCR, and VGPR) to carfilzomib given in combination with
      oral cyclophosphamide and thalidomide and dexamethasone after four 28 day cycles. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (CR, nCR, PR) after 4, 8, 12 cycles. II. Determine the
      duration of progression-free and overall survival for patients receiving this regimen.

      III. To evaluate the incidence of toxicities for this regimen. IV. To evaluate the ability to
      successfully collect peripheral blood stem cells following four months of combination
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of carfilzomib followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive carfilzomib IV on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16; oral cyclophosphamide on days
      1, 8, and 15; oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; and oral thalidomide on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 months, then every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
