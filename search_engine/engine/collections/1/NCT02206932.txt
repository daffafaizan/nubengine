    
      This is a research study of an investigational combination of two hepatitis C medications
      call sofosbuvir (SOF) and simeprevir (SMV). Both medications are approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of hepatitis C in combination with other
      medications. The combination sofosbuvir and simeprevir has not been approved by the FDA and
      is being tested as an investigational combination in research studies such as this. The
      purpose of this study is to see if SOF + SMV given for 12 weeks is safe and able to clear the
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) from subjects who are co-infected with HIV-1 and who have scarring of
      the liver (fibrosis of 3 or 4 on a scale of 0-4, with 4 as the most scarring, also known as
      cirrhosis).

      This study is an investigator-initiated clinical trial sponsored by University of California,
      San Francisco (UCSF), with support and the study drug simeprevir provided by Janssen
      Scientific Affairs, LLC.
