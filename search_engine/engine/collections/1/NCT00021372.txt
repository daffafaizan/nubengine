      of patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with paclitaxel and
      estramustine. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine 2-3 times daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV
      over 1 hour on day 2 on weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for at least 1 course in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or
      partial response continue therapy for at least 3 courses or for 1 course after achieving
      maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
