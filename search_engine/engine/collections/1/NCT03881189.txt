      measurements the aesthetic performance on the area around the eyes of the"SUNEKOSÂ® 200"
      injective treatment. Precisely three micro-injection sessions with an interval of 15 days
      were performed by a specialized dermatologist using periosteal and subepidermal injection
      techniques, on the area around the eyes of female volunteers with dark circles.

      An additional aim of this study is to evaluate the product tolerance by both the investigator
      and volunteers.
