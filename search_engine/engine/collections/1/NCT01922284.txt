      volunteers. The main aim is to see whether three of the five vaccines can be given together
      rather than one after the other, in five rather than seven sets of vaccinations and a course
      shortened by eight weeks. All volunteers will receive three injections of the first two
      vaccines (DNA plasmids) and half will be randomly assigned to receive two injections each of
      the second (MVA-C) and subsequent vaccines (CN54rgp140 mixed with GLA-AF) during the same
      visit or two injections of the MVA-C followed by two of CN54rgp140 mixed with GLA-AF.

      The investigators are interested in ensuring that the vaccines are safe and also that the
      immune responses in the two groups of volunteers are similar. The three vaccines have all
      been shown to stimulate the immune response to specific parts of the HIV virus and none are
      infectious. The first vaccine consists of two DNA plasmids. When injected into muscle cells
      small parts of the HIV virus which are encoded by the DNA are produced and these are then
      recognised by the immune system. The second vaccine MVAC, is derived from vaccinia virus
      which has been modified so that it cannot divide. The virus (Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA))
      actually expresses the same portions of HIV as the DNA and results in amplification of the
      responses seen. The third vaccine is a synthetically produced component of the HIV viral
      outer coat and it will be administered with an additive which has been shown to greatly
      enhance particular types of immune response which have recently been shown to play a role in
      protection against infection
