      infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Both
      prasugrel and ticagrelor show more rapid and potent antiplatelet effect compared with
      clopidogrel. However, previous report comparing the efficacy and safety of prasugrel and
      ticagrelor in patients with STEMI of East Asian ethnicity is lacking. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to compare the antiplatelet efficacy and safety using laboratory platelet
      function tests and clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI treated with either prasugrel or
      ticagrelor.
