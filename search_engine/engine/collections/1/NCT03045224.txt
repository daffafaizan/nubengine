      effectiveness, safety and quality of the endovascular therapy, and history of the disease
      after endovascular therapy. The resulting specific research questions were determination of
      the technical and clinical success of the procedure, monitoring of periinterventional
      complications, evaluation of vessel patency, amputation rate, mortality, and major adverse
      cardiac events during the follow-up. In addition, the quality of life after endovascular
      peripheral intervention over a period of two years was evaluated.
