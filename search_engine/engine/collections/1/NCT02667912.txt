      fact might be easily predicted from the very beginning. Conventional RDN done as 4-6 point
      treatments equally distributed within main trunk of renal artery (RA) may only be effective
      if renal plexus tightly surrounds the artery throughout its whole course with equal
      longitudinal and circumferential density of the nerve fibers. While this idea itself is
      unnaturally idealistic also a number of surgical studies demonstrated that proximally
      majority of renal nerves go at a distance from RA obliquely to its course and join the artery
      mainly in its distal part (fan-shaped renal plexus with wide base directed toward aorta and
      apex converging to renal gate). We developed a distal mode of RDN targeting segmental
      branches of RA and conducted a single-center double-blind randomized controlled parallel
      group study to compare its efficacy and safety to those of conventional RDN in patients with
      drug-resistant hypertension.
