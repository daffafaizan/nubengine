      investigators' study in acromegaly, a state of GH excess, suggests that GH reduces adipose
      tissue (AT) mass and serum inflammation. However, GH seems to reduce macrophage markers in
      adipose tissue yet increase adipocyte inflammation. This novel dissociation of macrophage and
      adipocyte inflammation is hypothesized to be due to GH. In order to examine this hypothesis
      further this study will examine adipose tissue and serum inflammation in patients with GH
      deficiency before and after GH therapy. The investigators will obtain subcutaneous adipose
      tissue by biopsy in patients with active GH deficiency planning to undergo therapy for GH
      deficiency. Concurrently serum samples will be taken for analysis of levels of inflammatory
      markers and adipokines. After treatment for 12 months with a normal levels of Insulin-like
      growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a marker of GH deficiency, patients will have a repeat adipose
      tissue biopsy. Adipose tissue parameters will be analyzed in each specimen and then compared
      to each patient over time as well as to body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects.
