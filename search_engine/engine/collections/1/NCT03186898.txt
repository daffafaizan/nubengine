      I. To determine if Overall Survival (OS) is different for hepatocellular carcinoma patients
      treated with protons compared to photons.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the difference in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with protons compared to patients with HCC treated
      with photons.

      II. To determine the difference in local progression (LP) in patients with HCC treated with
      protons compared to patients with HCC treated with photons.

      III. To determine differences in toxicity in patients with HCC treated with protons versus
      photons.

      IV. To determine differences in fatigue, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue in patients with HCC treated with protons, versus
      photons; as well as quality-adjusted survival, if the primary endpoint is met.

      V. To determine if there are correlations between the baseline values of HGF and outcomes
      (OS/PFS/fatigue).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine differences in overall Quality of Life, measured by FACT-Hep in patients with
      HCC treated with protons.

      II. Biospecimen collection for future correlative science projects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo proton therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.

      ARM II: Patients undergo photon therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
