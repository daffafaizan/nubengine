      However, an increase in the incidence rate of adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction,
      called cardia or AEG has been observed in recent years. AEG may represent a specific
      histopathological and biologic entity. In the treatment AEG there is argument over whether
      proximal gastractomy(PG) or total gastractomy (TG) should be done. The quality of life (QOL)
      of the patients following TG or PG arouses people's attention. The purpose of this study was
      to evaluate differences of the quality of life in patients undergoing total gastrectomy or
      proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction.
