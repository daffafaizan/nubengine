    
      This study is focused on understanding the neurophysiology of major depressive disorder
      (MDD), and the impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children and
      adolescents. This is a cross-sectional study which will utilize single and paired-pulse
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to collect measures of glutamatergic cortical
      excitability (the motor threshold and intracortical facilitation), and GABAergic cortical
      inhibition (the cortical silent period and intracortical inhibition) of the motor cortex in
      chilren and adolescents in various disease states of MDD. The optional proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy and imaging scans (MRS/MRI) at 3 Tesla (3T) will examine glutamate
      concentrations in the motor cortex and anterior cingulate cortex.

      This is a biomarker study (MRI/MRS and TMS neurophysiology measures); treatment is not
      provided in any form. This study will not utilize Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS).
