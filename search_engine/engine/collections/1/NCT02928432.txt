      AA. Previous retrospective data (Lorente et al, BJC 2014) has shown that the change of
      prednisone by dexamethasone in CRPC patients treated with AA post-docetaxel leaded to durable
      biochemical responses in 40% of cases. Recently, superiority of dexamethasone over prednisone
      in PSA response has been reported by a phase II trial that included 82 chemotherapy-naive
      metastatic CRPC patients.

      In our study patients with biochemical and/or limited radiological progression to AA +
      prednisone are prospectively enrolled. The principal objective was to evaluate the percentage
      of PSA responses in clinically stable metastatic CRPC patients after at least 12 weeks of AA
      + prednisone. Secondary aims will include time to biochemical progression, time to first
      radiological progression, overall survival and the evaluation of the safety profile.

      Biochemical response was monitored with PSA determinations every 4 weeks, and defined as a â‰¥
      30% decline in PSA from baseline, confirmed with a second reading. PSA progression was
      evaluated according to PCWG2 criteria. Radiological response was re-evaluated every 12-16
      weeks using bone and CT-scan according to RECIST v1.1 and PCWG2 criteria.

      Translational studies: archival tissue will be obtained from all patients, to perform PTEN
      and TMPRSS-ERG rearrangements evaluation. Plasma will be collected after AA + prednisone
      progression to study the androgen receptor status in plasma.
