      magnitude. Clinical and genetic patient information are systematically collected in a fashion
      that will enable also future retrospective evaluation of clinical and genetic details from
      each patient. This study is a discrete arm of a series of research projects that focus on the
      development of personalized medical therapy and share a common purpose: predicting future
      risk of cardiovascular events, assessing the severity and complexity of coronary artery
      disease by incorporating genetic information into the SYNTAX score and providing personalized
      therapeutic guidance to patients. The ultimate goal of the study would be to identify, design
      and develop a panel of genetic markers that in combination with clinical and angiographic
      information will be a reliable tool for predicting cardiovascular risk for future adverse
      events.
