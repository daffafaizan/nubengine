    
      Material and Methods This observational multicenter study will be done in 21 medical-surgical
      ICUs. We will use Sabadell Score like prognostic scale at ICU discharge and the intensivist
      will collaborate with the medical team in medical assistance of patients at risk (Sabadell
      Score 1 and 2). Investigators will compare the hospital mortality and the readmission rate
      with a previous period when this collaboration didn't exist.

      Anticipate results The collaboration of attending intensivist might reduce ward mortality
      after ICU discharge by 3%.
