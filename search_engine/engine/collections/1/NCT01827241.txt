    
      Investigator's goal is to collect data from the endoscopy reports and clinic station reports
      to complete a descriptive analysis of the demographics, colonoscopy procedure performance,
      and assess the type of benign colon polyps detected during screening and surveillance from
      02/01/2000 - 12/31/2020.

      Specific variable to be reviewed:

        1. Patient Demographics: Age, Sex, Race, Height, Weight, BMI (patient privacy will be
           acknowledged).

        2. Indications for Colonoscopy (screening, surveillance, symptoms or tertiary referral
           [EMR])

        3. Comorbid conditions: , cancer and surgical history, medical conditions,

        4. Colonoscopy procedure; quality of colon preparation (using the Boston Bowel Preparation
           Scale) 0 - 3 for each section of the colon (Ascending, Transverse, Descending and Total
           Colon) , cecal intubation rate, cecal intubation and total procedure time, type of
           colonoscope (if CO2 was used in the procedure and techniques for colonoscope insertion,
           including position changes.

        5. Examination findings: number of polyps and nature of polyps removed (site, size,
           surface, vascular pattern); type of polyp removed (serrated and sessile (flat) ; optical
           features and histology of polyps.

        6. Resection techniques: biopsy, snare resection, endoscopic mucosal resection etc.

        7. Including Pathology report findings so that a comparison can be made of the optical
           features and actual pathology report.

        8. Outcomes of colonoscopy: adenoma detections (tubular and villous), cancer and quality
           metrics.

        9. Outcome of colonoscopy: Complications (Bleeding and performance).
