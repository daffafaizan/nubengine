      patients aged 18-80 years with severe septic shock. Severe septic shock was defined as a
      septic shock with norepinephrine >15ug/min. The investigators randomly divided the patients
      into two groups: the glucocorticoid treatment group (control group), the glucocorticoid
      combined with vitamin C and vitamin B1 treatment group (treatment group). The
      microcirculation was monitored at 0h(baseline), 4 h, and 24h after treatment. The
      investigators monitored the sublingual microcirculatory alterations by Hand-held vital
      microscopes and scored the collected images according to the recommendations of the consensus
      on microcirculation monitoring in 2018. During the experiment, researchers, Microcirculation
      Image analysts, and patients were blinded to the treatment group.
