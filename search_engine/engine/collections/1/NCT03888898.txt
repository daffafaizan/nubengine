      of a just in time elastomeric half mask respirator (EHMR) fit test and competency training
      for healthcare personnel (HCP) during a simulated public health emergency. This study will
      assess participant and institution ability to rapidly convert and demonstrate proficiency
      using reusable respirators in the healthcare field to provide a stopgap for respiratory
      protection program guidelines in times of disposable respirator supply shortages. This
      protocol is the first in a series of three studies included in the Assessment of Elastomeric
      Respirators in Healthcare Delivery Settings project sponsored by the National Institute for
      Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC). This project is funded in kind by the National Personal Protective Technology
      Laboratory (NPPTL), the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (OPHPR), and the
      National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). The first of three
      protocols, this will be followed by laboratory and field studies assessing disinfection
      methods and routine use EHMR. Three (3) United States (US) healthcare delivery organizations
      (University of Texas Houston, Wayne State University, and Emory University) will be included
      as study sites in this base protocol, individually accruing a participant sample size up to
      100 HCP, with a minimum of 50 evaluable participants per site. A total sample size of 150 to
      300 evaluable participants are expected to be accrued nationally. The purpose of this Base
      protocol is to assess feasibility of reusable EHMRs in healthcare for a just in time
      adaptation during respiratory infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, and/or
      disposable respirator supply shortages.
