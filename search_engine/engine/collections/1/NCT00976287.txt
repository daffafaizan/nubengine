      infused to patients using interventional method via hepatic artery for One group. The
      catheter was inserted to proper hepatic artery. After the catheter placed at proper hepatic
      artery was confirmed by angiography, autologous bone marrow MSCs were infused slowly for
      20-30 minutes. The control group accepted conserved therapy.
