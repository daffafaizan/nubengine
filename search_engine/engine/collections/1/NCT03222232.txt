      catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) frequently results in replacement of their
      tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs) which may lead to future loss of central venous
      access.

      This observational study investigates the consequences of a catheter-salvage-strategy related
      to CRBSIs according to different causative microorganisms, and short- and long-term risk of
      recurrence of the CRBSI. The study is based on the Copenhagen Intestinal failure database,
      which is a web-based database with retrospective data collection performed by reviews of
      medical charts from all adult intestinal failure patients discharged with home parenteral
      support from the Department of Medical Gastroenterology, Rigshospitalet.
