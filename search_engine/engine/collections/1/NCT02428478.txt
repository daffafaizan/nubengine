      approximately one week apart in random order. The placebo or drug will be administered 2
      hours before lights out. At least 15 minutes of quiet wakefulness will be recorded to
      quantify the participant's awake EMG GG activity. Participants will then sleep in the lateral
      position to minimize pharyngeal resistance similar to previous studies of this kind.

      The same will be done for stable non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM)
      sleep (free of arousals and other artifacts). Both NREM and REM sleep will be analyzed,
      recognizing that REM is less frequent on these drugs.

      During the second part of the night, the participants will be connected to a modified
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine (Pcrit3000, Respironics) which can provide
      a wide range of pressures between 20 and -20 cm H2O in order to modify upper airway pressure
      and measure change in EMG GG as a function of epiglottic pressure (muscle responsiveness).
