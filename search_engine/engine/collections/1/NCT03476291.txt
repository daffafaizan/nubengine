      an automated detection of multiple retinal diseases with OCT horizontal B-scans with a
      high-quality labeled database. Datasets, including training dataset, testing dataset and
      validation datasets, will be built by ophthalmologists of the First affiliated hospital of
      Nanjing Medical University according to the standardized annotation guidelines.
