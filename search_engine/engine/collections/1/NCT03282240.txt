    
      This randomized, modified double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial was conducted
      in healthy adults (greater than and equal to [>=] 65 years) to assess the safety and
      immunogenicity (geometric mean titers and seroconversion for the 4 virus strains at 28 days
      post vaccination) of the QIV-HD compared to one of the TIV-HDs containing either the B strain
      from the primary lineage (TIV-HD1; licensed vaccine [FluzoneÂ® High-Dose] for the 2017-2018
      Northern Hemisphere [NH] influenza season) or the B strain from the alternate lineage
      (TIV-HD2, investigational TIV-HD containing an alternate B strain).
