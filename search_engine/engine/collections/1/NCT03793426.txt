      ultra-rare setting of congenital fibrinogen deficiency. Real-world evidence (RWE) derived
      from non-interventional studies can describe product utilization, demonstrate value, and
      facilitate benefit-risk assessments; RWE can only be fully assessed once a product is
      launched and used in a real-life setting.

      This post-marketing, observational study is designed to collect information concerning
      safety, efficacy, and outcomes of Fibryga administration in routine clinical use in patients
      of any age with congenital afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia. Documentation of the
      administration of Fibryga in clinical practice for the treatment of both minor and major
      bleeding events (BEs) will not only enhance the knowledge on the efficacy and safety profile
      of Fibryga, but will also gather information that cannot be obtained in the same way in
      controlled clinical studies. These observational data will support the safety and efficacy
      data generated with Fibryga in good clinical practice (GCP) clinical studies, providing
      benefit for both physicians and patients.
