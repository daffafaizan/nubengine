      with no co-morbidity, clinical supervision is provided by the best specialists in the field,
      and strict protocols are used to enhance patients' compliance. Thus, results may not be
      generalizable to real-world clinical practice.

      Observational studies are now gaining attention, showing with previous treatments (combined
      pegylated interferon and ribavirin) a wide range of results in terms of treatment
      effectiveness (SVR from 21% to 63% overall), whereas related pivotal clinical trials had
      estimated SVRs between 54% and 63% overall.

      Egypt is the first low/middle-income country where a national treatment program has been
      established on a large scale, allowing an evaluation that might be useful to itself and other
      similar countries. A real life evaluation will be particularly relevant now that new
      anti-viral drugs, direct-acting antivirals, are being introduced in Egypt.

      ANRS 12332 HepNile cohort study will allow "in real life condition" the study of:

        -  Efficacy (cure rate) and safety of new HCV regimens introduced in Egypt

        -  Emergence of resistance variants for patients with virological breakthrough

        -  Factors associated with treatment failure

        -  Drug-Drug interactions

        -  Adherence to the treatment regimens
