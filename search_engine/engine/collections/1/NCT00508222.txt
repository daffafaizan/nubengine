    
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine how safe and effective the drug Kaletra® is
      in treating HIV when it is administered without any other antiretroviral drugs (monotherapy).
      Kaletra® is 2 protease inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir) combined in one dosage form.

      Kaletra monotherapy is experimental and subjects eligible to the study are switching from a
      successful conventional triple therapy to an unproven experimental therapy.

      Approximately 40 HIV/HCV coinfected participants, aged over 18 years will participate in this
      study.
