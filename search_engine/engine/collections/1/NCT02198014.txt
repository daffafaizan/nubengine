    
      Randomized trial with two treatment groups: one using joint traction, passive muscle
      stretching and isometric exercises, active resisted and proprioception exercises (group MT);
      and another with educational sessions and home exercises (group E); and a control group
      (group C).

      The intervention was carried out during twelve weeks, performing evaluation before and after
      treatment, and six months of finalizing this. The treatment in MT group consisted of two
      sessions per week for one hour each, and the treatment in group E consisted of a session of
      90 minute every two weeks, with exercises daily home. The control group (group C) did not
      receive any treatment. After the allocation to the groups, the composition was follows: MT
      group = 7; E group = 7; and control group = 7.
