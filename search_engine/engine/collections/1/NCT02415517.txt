      and after (posttest) cognitive-training intervention are investigated. Changes in cognitive
      functions are compared to changes in two control groups: 1) age and gender matched active
      control group 2) age and gender matched passive waiting list control group.

      The neuropsychological test battery applied at pretest and posttest includes measures of
      episodic memory, working memory, short-term memory, executive functions, perceptual speed and
      intelligence. In addition, the investigators apply standardized questionnaires of
      self-assessed quality of life, cognitive functioning in daily life, selfcare, and
      psychological well-being (depression, anxiety and personality). Relevant physiological data
      such as ejection fraction, heartrate, N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP)
      as well as drug blood level are recorded.
