      that result in periods of profound neutropenia leaving patients susceptible to severe
      infectious complications. There are little clinical data to inform whether management of
      neutropenia post AML chemotherapy should occur in an outpatient or inpatient setting.
      Further, no studies have been conducted that assess the impact of neutropenia management
      strategy on the quality of life of pediatric patients with AML. Given that infectious
      complications are the leading cause of treatment related mortality among AML patients, it is
      important to identify the neutropenia management strategy that will lead to the best
      clinician- and patient- identified outcomes in order to improve the care of these patients.

      This is a qualitative interview study where interviews of patients and/or caregivers will be
      performed. Participants will be patients less than 19 years of age at diagnosis (and their
      caregivers) receiving or having received chemotherapy for AML from eleven participating
      pediatric hospitals across the United States. Participants (children and caregivers) will be
      interviewed in an effort to develop a survey that captures patient- and caregiver- identified
      outcomes related to neutropenia management.
