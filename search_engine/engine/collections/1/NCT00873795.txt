    
      This double-blind, placebo-control, fixed dose, randomized study will be conducted at a
      tertiary clinical setting. Patients over 18 y/o fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for major
      depression, having a baseline HAM-D score â‰§ 14 and a HAM-D item 3 score < 3 will be recruited
      into the groups. The study group of patients will receive ten weeks of treatment with a
      combination of fix-dosed sertraline and aripiprazole. The control group will received
      sertraline only. The score reduction in HAM-D17, CGI, SF-36 and Brief Symptom Rating Scale
      (BSRS-50) will be periodically estimated as an efficacy following the use of a SSRIs or and
      aripiprazole.
