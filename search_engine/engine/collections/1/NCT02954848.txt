    
      A phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study
      will be conducted to verify the superiority of TAK-438 (TAK-438 10 mg, once daily, 4 weeks)
      to placebo (placebo, once daily, 4 weeks) in participants with non-erosive gastroesophageal
      reflux disease (NERD).

      The study consists of a 1-week, single-blind run-in period and a 4-week, double-blind
      treatment period. The participants will receive the study drug (TAK-438 placebo tablet) for
      the 1-week single-blind run-in period. After the run-in period, eligible participants will be
      randomized into TAK-438 10 mg or placebo treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. The randomized
      participants will receive the assigned study drug (TAK-438 10 mg tablet or placebo tablet)
      for the 4-week double-blind treatment period.
