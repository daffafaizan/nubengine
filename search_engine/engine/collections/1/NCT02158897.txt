    
      The Phase I part of the study is designed as a randomized cross-over trial, including two
      arms: a Control arm and a multi-cycle special 5-day dietary regimen (Diet, 3 cycles) arm.
      After 3 cycles, the Control and Diet groups are crossed over such that the Control group will
      under-go dieting and the Diet group will return to normal diet. Participants will be
      monitored for body weight and physiological changes, as well as the adherence to the dietary
      intervention.

      The Phase II part of the study is an expansion of the Phase I to ascertain the impact of the
      dietary intervention on risk factors for metabolic syndrome and biomarkers associated with
      aging and age-related diseases.

      Statistical methods: Paired samples t-test and Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare
      between Control and Diet groups as well as pre- and post-diet values.
