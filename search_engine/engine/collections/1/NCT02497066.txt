      creams are more effective than placebo; as well as measuring the subjects' satisfaction with
      the compounded pain creams. Three different compounded pain creams (specific to the type of
      pain being treated) will be used to examine effectiveness and satisfaction in treating
      neuropathic, nociceptive, or mixed pain syndromes. Up to 399 subjects will be randomized to
      receive a compounded pain cream or placebo. The type of pain cream to be used will be based
      on the subjects' pain diagnosis. Pain relief will be measured by a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale
      and satisfaction by a 1-5 Likert Satisfaction Scale. The outcome measures will include a
      'positive outcome' defined as a two point or greater reduction in average pain (as measured
      by a NRS) and a score of greater than 3 (on a 1-5 Likert scale measuring satisfaction) at
      1-month. The investigators will use the Rand Corporation SF-36 to measure changes in health
      status during enrollment. Subjects who obtain benefit at 1-month will be followed at
      3-months, while those who fail to obtain benefit (i.e., â‰¥ 2 point reduction in NRS with a
      greater than 3 Likert satisfaction score) will exit the study to receive alternative care.
      Patients will be given a pain diary so that their NRS can be calculated at follow up visits.
