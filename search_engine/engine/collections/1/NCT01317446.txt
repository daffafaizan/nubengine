      mechanical cleaning of the teeth. However, remaining dental biofilm can be approached by
      antibacterial mouthrinses. As a consequence of regular use of these mouthrinses, gingivitis
      can be reduced. Amine fluoride/stannous flouride mouthrinse (ASF)has proved its efficacy in
      several studies. In the previous years, a new formulation that does not contain ethanol
      anymore was introduced in the market. Therefore, it is the aim of the study to proof whether
      rinsing with ASF adjunctive to mechanical oral hygiene is more effective on gingivitis
      reduction than mechanical oral hygiene alone. In addition, effects on dental plaque,
      discoloration of teeth and bacterial colonization should be studied.
