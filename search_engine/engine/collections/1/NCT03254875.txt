      inclusion at the Section of Breast Surgery at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. Of these 324
      participants enter the randomized controlled trial (RCT) and are randomized in a
      computer-generated sequence of 1:1 to the intervention (nurse-navigation) or control group
      (standard care). A total of 432 participants will enter an observational questionnaire study.
      All participants are followed for 1,5 years.
