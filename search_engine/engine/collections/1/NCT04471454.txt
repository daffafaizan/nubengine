      fast and free cognitive assessment tool. It has good reliability and validity in patients
      with depression, but its application in patients with bipolar depression is not clear.

      This study includes three steps.

        1. baseline: demographic data, sequential test THINC-it and standard test tools, clinical
           scale evaluation, to verify the discriminant validity and parallel validity of THINC-it
           in bipolar depression.

        2. follow-up (1 week): 30-50 patients with stable bipolar depression were evaluated by
           clinical scale and THINC-it test to verify the test-retest reliability of THINC-it in
           bipolar depression.

        3. follow-up (8 weeks): all patients with bipolar depression were evaluated by clinical
           scale, THINC-it test, longitudinal comparison data, and the influencing factors of
           cognitive impairment were analyzed.
