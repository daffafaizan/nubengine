      developing diaphragmatic hypertrophy through inspiratory muscle training, improving
      functional capacity and quality of life. In type 2 diabetes mellitus patients the frequency
      of inspiratory muscle weakness is unknown, as well as the response to inspiratory muscle
      training. For this reason, the present study evaluated the inspiratory muscle strength in
      type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and the effect of inspiratory muscle training on
      inspiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function, functional capacity and autonomic modulation
      assessed through heart rate variability.
