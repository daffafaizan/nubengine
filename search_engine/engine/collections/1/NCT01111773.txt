      70 mg and tetracaine 70 mg topical patch for the treatment of pain associated with patellar
      tendinopathy. A number of efficacy variables will be employed to evaluate their utility for
      assessing painful responses in this population. The study will be a 2-week, open-label study
      conducted at a single study site in patients with pain associated with patellar tendinopathy
      in a single knee. During this out-patient study, patients will apply one study patch to the
      affected tendon twice daily for approximately 14 days. Patches will be applied morning and
      evening (applications separated by approximately 8-10 hours) and removed after 2-4 hours.
