    
      In this prospective cohort study, patients who are clinically determined to require
      escalation of their glycaemic therapy, and prescribed a DPP4 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor
      agonist, or insulin, will be invited to participate.

      Blood and urine samples will be taken before, 4 to 8 weeks after, and 26 weeks after starting
      the new therapy. Markers of inflammation, renal function and glycemic control will be
      measured at each timepoint.
