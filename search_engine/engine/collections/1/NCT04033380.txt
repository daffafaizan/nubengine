      is the only effective way to treat these diseases. However, failure of RCT is commonly seen
      without coronal restoration.Endocrown is a new type of onlay with a retainer in the pulp
      cavity which consists of a cervical margin in the form of a butt joint and a preparation of
      the pulp chamber.This restoration method is not only good at the preservation of residual
      tooth tissue, but also suitable for severely damaged molars or premolars after dental pulp
      treatment.More and more endondontist tend to use this ways because they are a minimally
      invasive solution in such cases.Endocrown is mainly made of glass-ceramics, which has the
      advantages of beautiful appearance, high hardness and good biocompatibility. However, ceramic
      materials are brittle and fracturable, and need to be sintered twice in the manufacturing
      process, which is relatively complex and time-consuming. Composite resin block material is a
      new type of composite material developed in recent years. It is used for chairside CAD/CAM
      restoration,It has beautiful and natural color, and its elastic modulus is close to dentin.
      Therefore, it is more compatible with natural teeth in performance.Moreover, In the process
      of making, the steps of secondary sintering and glazing are omitted and shortened. But, there
      was no sufficient data to verify which material was more effective. The main aim of this
      trial is to compare the clinical efficacy of ceramic vs resin-based bloc endocrown. Other
      objectives include looking for the prognostic and influence factors of the related effects.
