      conducted in 396 patients scheduled to undergo elective general anesthesia laparotomy or
      orthopedic surgery. Patients were randomly divided into three groups in radio 1:1:1 received
      respectively IV placebo, ibuprofen 400 mg or ibuprofen 800 mg. The first dose of study drugs
      was administered intravenously at the time of wound closure and then every 6 hours within 48
      hours after the operation. At the end of surgical suture, 5mg morphine was injected
      intravenously, and then the patient-controlled intravenous analgesia pump was connected.
      Efficacy was assessed by morphine dosage during the first 24 hours, pain intensity score, and
      area under the pain-time curve after surgery. Safety was assessed by the incidence of adverse
      events.
