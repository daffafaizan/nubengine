    
      The PaTH study is a 2-year, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the
      efficacy of combining hPTH (1-84) and alendronate for treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal
      women.

      238 women were randomized between 55 and 85 years of age to receive either: (1) PTH for 1
      year followed by alendronate for 1 year; (2) PTH and alendronate for 1 year followed by
      alendronate for 1 year; (3) alendronate for 2 years; or (4) PTH for 1 year followed by
      placebo for 1 year. The primary endpoints are changes in bone mineral density at several
      sites and changes in biochemical markers.

      In addition, we will assess specific biochemical markers of bone turnover (e.g., osteocalcin,
      deoxypridinoline, N-telopeptide, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and bone sialoprotein) to
      determine if they can predict the skeletal response to combination therapy. We will also
      determine whether PTH positively affects ultrasound measurements in the calcaneus.
