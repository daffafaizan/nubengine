    
      This is a Phase 2, multi-center, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of PBI-4050, and its effects on the pancreatic, pulmonary functions
      and on various biomarkers in Cystic Fibrosis patients with abnormal glucose tolerance.
      Patients with abnormal glucose tolerance have elevated glucose level either at 1 hour or 2
      hour during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).

      A total of 90 patients will be enrolled for study participation. A Data Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB) will continually review individual patients safety data obtained from the 90
      patients. When the first 15 patients have completed at least 1 month of study treatment, the
      DSMB will meet formally to determine whether additional patients may be enrolled, the study
      should continue with changes or if the study should be stopped. In addition, the DSMB will
      review the PK data and may recommend dose adjustment based on the PK results.

      The total duration of study participation for each patient is at least 32 weeks, including up
      to 4 weeks of a screening period, 24 weeks of study treatment and 4 weeks of safety
      follow-up.

      Patients who choose to participate in the open label extension will be in the study for an
      additional 24 weeks of study treatment and 4 weeks of safety follow-up (for a total of 56
      weeks).
