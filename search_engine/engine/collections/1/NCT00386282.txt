      mg mifepristone, followed by 800 buccal misoprostol. They later underwent clinic follow-up to
      determine if their medical abortions were complete. The study assessed the acceptability and
      feasibility of the above regimen and sought to determine the efficacy and acceptability of
      buccal administration of misoprostol as well as the acceptability of side effects experienced
      by women.
