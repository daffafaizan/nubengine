      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of bortezomib and fludarabine with or without rituximab
      in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in combination with fludarabine in
      these patients.

      III. Determine the biological effect of this regimen on apoptotic markers, cell cycle kinase
      inhibitors, and DNA repair in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and fludarabine IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1-3 or 1-5. Patients may also receive rituximab IV over 1 hour on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
