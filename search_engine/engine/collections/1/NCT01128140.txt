      functioning of military units, are compromised by the abuse of alcohol and/or other drugs.
      Rates of heavy drinking are higher among military personnel than in the general population
      and are even higher among recently deployed personnel.

      While counseling can be effective, most substance abusers do not tend to voluntarily seek
      treatment. Moreover, military personnel encounter more real and perceived barriers to seeking
      treatment.

      The substance abuse field is increasingly focusing on developing interventions for those at
      early stages of readiness to change, i.e., those contemplating but not yet committed to
      change. A brief, telephone-delivered motivational enhancement intervention (MET) called a
      "check-up," has shown promise in promoting self-initiated behavior change as well as
      voluntary treatment entry, enhanced retention, and more successful outcomes for substance
      abuse.

      Adapting the "check-up" for application with military personnel is warranted for three key
      reasons: (1) it has the potential of overcoming barriers to treatment-seeking, i.e., stigma
      and apprehension of a negative impact on one's military career; (2) it has the potential of
      attracting voluntary participation; and (3) protocols for disseminating this low cost
      intervention for use with deployed military can readily be developed and evaluated.
