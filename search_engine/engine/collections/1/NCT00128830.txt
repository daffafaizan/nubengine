    
      This is a Phase II, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), roll-over
      study (participants may go ahead and participate in another clinical study). Participants who
      were randomized (study medication is assigned by chance) to a etravirine (ETR) treatment arm
      in Phase II TMC125 feeder studies (TMC125-C203, TMC125-C209, TMC125-C223 and TMC125-C211),
      were treated for at least 48 weeks with etravirine, and who will derive continued benefit
      from etravirine therapy, as judged by the investigator, will be enrolled in this study. The
      final visit of the sponsor-selected Phase II ETR study will be the first (baseline) visit of
      this study. Approximately 300 participants will be enrolled in this study who will receive
      800 mg twice daily of etravirine (formulation TF035) until the formulation 200 mg twice daily
      (formulation F060) is available. Once this formulation becomes available all the participants
      will be switched to receive F060 which will be given in combination with an
      investigator-selected, optimized underlying therapy (nucleotide reverse transcriptase [NRTIs]
      and/or allowed protease inhibitors and/or enfuvirtide). Participants will continue to receive
      ETR until they are no longer benefitted or this medication becomes commercially available.
      Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination.
