      acute stroke admitted to the emergency department or stroke unit within 24 hours of symptoms
      onset and confirmed occlusion of either the proximal middle, distal M1-segment cerebral
      arteries, or distal internal carotid arteries (including carotid-T occlusion) by cerebral
      magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) or cerebral imaging computed tomography (cCT), including
      perfusion weighted (pw) imaging sequences, will be considered for the investigation.
