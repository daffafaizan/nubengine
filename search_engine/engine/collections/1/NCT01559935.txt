      developed, multiple myeloma remains an incurable malignancy. Given that obtaining a complete
      remission (CR) with therapy will allow patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma to
      enjoy a higher quality of life and longer duration of freedom from disease symptoms, finding
      an optimally effective and well-tolerated regimen is imperative.

      The robust overall response rate of 91% with the BiRD regimen for patients with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma is encouraging and we believe that by adding carfilzomib the
      overall response rate and CR rate can be improved. As carfilzomib has proven efficacy in
      myeloma and in patient's who have relapsed on bortezomib, we anticipate that it will
      synergize with the previous BiRD regimen to induce greater reduction of tumor burden overall.

      The primary endpoints include best response rate, toxicities, progression free survival,
      event free survival, and overall survival. In those patients who are eligible for autologous
      stem cell transplantation, we will also study the effect of carfilzomib on CD 34+ stem cell
      yield following mobilization.
