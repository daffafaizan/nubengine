      resistance, and possible reasons for how melatonin works on blood pressure and IR. Along with
      blood testing to measure adipokines, insulin resistance (IR), and platelet function (how well
      your blood clots), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) will be used to
      measure blood pressure, since ABPM is the gold standard (best method) for accurate assessment
      of blood pressure status and associated cardiovascular risk. Vascular (blood vessel)
      function, IR, adipokine levels and sleep quality will also be measured. All study endpoints
      will be measured at baseline and following 6 weeks of daily melatonin 9 mg dosing.
