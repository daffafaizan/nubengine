      I. To compare the efficacy and toxicity of two schedules of tipifarnib plus etoposide as
      induction therapy in older patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myeloid
      leukemia.

      II. To study mechanisms of leukemia cell resistance to tipifarnib in combination with
      etoposide.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive 600 mg of oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-14 and 100 mg of oral
      etoposide once daily on days 1-3 and 8-10.

      ARM II: Patients receive 400 mg of oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-14 and 200 mg of
      oral etoposide once daily on days 1-3 and 8-10. (closed to accrual as of November 2008)

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then every 90 days
      thereafter.
