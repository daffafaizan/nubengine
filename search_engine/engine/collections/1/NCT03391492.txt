    
      This prospective multicentre case-control registration study in Dutch and Belgian ICUs will
      assess the difference in incidence and outcome of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in
      ICU patients with severe influenza compared with influenza-negative control patients with
      severe community-acquired pneumonia during the coming three influenza seasons (2017-2020).
      The study will further assess the differences in clinical characteristics and risk factors
      between influenza patients with and without invasive aspergillosis.

      All consecutive patients aged 18 or older admitted to ICU during the inclusion period with
      respiratory distress due to influenza positive/negative community acquired pneumonia (CAP)
      will be included.
