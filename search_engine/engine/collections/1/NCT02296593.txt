    
      MAQUET Group offers a new device that gives real time blood lactate and glucose levels. It is
      a new central veinous catheter with a microdialysis system. It is planted in the superior
      vena cava. It has not yet been used and validated with a clinical purpose, and particularly
      in cardiac surgery.

      For now, reference method for determining blood lactate and glucose levels is co oxymetry.

      This new simple device could provide great fluency for determining blood lactate and glucose
      levels. It could allow medical teams gain time for diagnosis and treatment of both
      hyperlactatemia and hyperglycemia.

      The primary outcome of this study was to compare blood lactate and glucose absolute measures
      provided with the MAQUET new device (Maquet Critical Care AB, Solna, Sweden) and with co
      oxymetry.

      The secondary outcome of this study was to compare variations of these absolutes measures.
