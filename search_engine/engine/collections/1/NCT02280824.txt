      enabled transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in a small number of patients who have
      no good options for standard percutaneous femoral access or for standard surgical access to
      the cardiac apex or to the ascending aorta. In this prospective registry we will collect data
      from multiple medical centers as they offer transcaval TAVR to patients with extreme or
      prohibitive risk of conventional TAVR.
