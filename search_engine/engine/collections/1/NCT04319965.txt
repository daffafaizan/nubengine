      consists of a monitor device which is connected to two catheters. One is a catheter inserted
      into the superior vena cava (internal jugular or subclavian), which is a standard catheter
      commonly used in patients with acute circulatory failure. The other one is a
      thermistor-tipped arterial catheter, which is inserted through the femoral route (the tip
      stands in the iliac artery), which allows the measurement of blood temperature. Catheters
      designed for the radial, brachial and humeral arteries also exist. TPTD allows the
      computation of cardiac output from the thermodilution curve recorded by the thermistor-tipped
      femoral arterial catheter. As an advanced cardiac output monitoring technique, it provides
      several important haemodynamic variables. It can be used in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
      in the operating room (OR). Two TPTD systems are now on the market. The PiCCO2 system
      (Pulsion Medical Systems, member of the Getinge Group, Feldkirchen, Germany) and the
      VolumeView/EV1000 system (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, United States of America). This study
      is designed to investigate the incidence of complications and their risk factors in patients
      monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution.
