      cyclophosphamide will prolong the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) who have failed 2 or 3 prior lines of therapy for incurable or metastatic disease
      compared with chemotherapy alone. Patients will be randomized 2 to 1 into the
      viagenpumatucel-L arm and the chemotherapy alone arm, respectively.
