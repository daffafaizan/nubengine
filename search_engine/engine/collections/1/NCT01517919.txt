      leaders to facilitate longer-term empowerment-based interventions that, when led by health
      care professionals, have been associated with improved diabetes-related health and
      psychosocial outcomes.1-8 In phase two we will examine the impact of a sustained peer-led,
      empowerment-based self-management intervention on improving and maintaining diabetes-related
      health outcomes. We propose to develop and test the training and program simultaneously in
      two distinct cultural and linguistic communities with which the team already has strong
      working relationships and a track record of prior work: African-American (AA) adults in a
      community-based setting (Ypsilanti, Michigan) and Latino adults (Spanish- and
      English-speaking) in a clinic-based setting (Southwest Detroit). This will allow us to
      compare and contrast the translations of the training and program in these two different
      contexts and to better refine and understand effective methods and develop culturally
      tailored training and program materials in both English and Spanish.
