      3-week treatment cycle(s) and a follow-up period. The patients will be treated for 6 cycles
      in case no response is observed, and treatment may be continued beyond 6 cycles in case of
      partial response/complete response (PR/CR) or significant clinical benefit until progressive
      disease, unacceptable toxicity, willingness to stop the study treatment or until study
      termination by sponsor. After the completion of the study treatment each patient will be
      followed every 6 weeks until death or the study cut-off date, whichever comes first. For
      patients who went-off study treatment prior disease progression is documented, date of
      disease progression and further anticancer treatment will be collected in follow-up visit.

      The cut-off date corresponds to the date at which all the treated patients will have 3
      post-baseline tumor assessments or will early discontinue whatever the reason. Beyond cut-off
      date, patient can continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity
      or patient's refusal, provided clinical benefit is established.
