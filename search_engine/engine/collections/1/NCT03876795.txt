      through the use of scores for the clinical outcome, the study of imaging and biological
      samples for tissue regeneration and systemic effects, and the identification of BMC and
      patient characteristics predictive of better results.

      All patients will undergo an arthroscopic procedure to debride degenerated tissues (this can
      offer a temporary benefit but not long lasting results) before BMC intra-articular injection.
      Half patients will receive also the injection of BMC at the subchondral level (bone samples
      obtained to allow BMC placement will be sent to the Lab).

      The same minimally invasive incisions will be used for all patients, ensuring patient
      blinding. Evaluations, performed by medical staff not involved in the treatment to ensure
      double blinding, will document subjective clinical improvement, functional measurements,
      biomarker study, and imaging with the use of modern 3TMRI and qCT technology. BMC
      characterization and patient features will be analysed to identify factors predictive of a
      better outcome.
