    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the levels of proteins and/or cellular
      components of the synovial fluid that are indicative of microenvironment phenotypes of the
      osteoarthritic knee compared to unilateral unaffected joints pre-injection to 6 weeks
      post-Regenexx SD treatment (day 0).

      Secondary objective is an evaluation of possible direct and/or indirect associations between
      the measured levels of proteins and/or cellular components of the synovial fluid in the
      osteoarthritic knee joint with the administration of the Regenexx SD treatment. The secondary
      objective will include MRI evidence of cartilage repair; incidence of post-operative
      complications, adverse events, re-injections, and surgical intervention; change in pain score
      and use of pain medications.
