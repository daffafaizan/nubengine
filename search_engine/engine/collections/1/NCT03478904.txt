    
      Background:

        -  Enzalutamide is currently approved for the treatment of patients with mCRPC

        -  The marketed (reference) formulation of enzalutamide is a liquid-filled, soft gelatin
           capsule containing 40 mg enzalutamide dissolved in Labrasol; four such capsules are
           required to deliver a 160 mg dose

        -  The four-capsule regimen is inconvenient because of the number of capsules that must be
           taken, particularly in light of the fact that cancer patients usually have to take
           multiple drugs.

        -  Additionally, some patients may not be able to swallow pills; therefore, alternate
           methods of oral administration are necessary

      Objectives:

      -To evaluate the bioequivalence, safety, and tolerability of two oral formulations of
      enzalutamide following a single 160 mg dose in male subjects with prostate cancer under
      fasting conditions.

      Eligibility:

      -Male subjects with prostate cancer

      Design:

        -  Comparative, randomized, open-label, single-dose, 2-way crossover bioavailability,
           safety and tolerability study

        -  Subjects will be randomized in Period 1 to one of two sequences: AB or BA. Following a
           minimum 42-day washout period, subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to receive the
           treatment that they did not receive in Period 1.

        -  Treatment A will be the standard capsule (reference) formulation; Treatment B will be
           the liquid formulation (test product)

        -  Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis
