      language markedly in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), though little long term
      follow-up data exists. Few core characteristics that affect child change have been tested.
      Two potential core characteristics that invoke considerable debate among parents,
      professionals, and administrators are the delivery style of intervention: play-based versus
      discrete trial teaching, and the intensity (dosage) of intervention. This ACE treatment
      network conducted an RCTs to answer the following question: what are the effects of intensity
      and delivery style on developmental progress of toddlers with ASD?

      87 young children with ASD, mean age 23.4 months who live within a specified radius near the
      university at each site were enrolled in one of three national sites and randomized into one
      of four cells varying on two dimensions: dosage - 15 or 25 hours per week of 1:1 treatment;
      and discrete trial teaching or naturalistic developmental-behavioral intervention. Other
      aspects of intervention held constant were: use of the principles of applied behavior
      analysis, 1:1 adult:child ratios, parent coaching in the assigned treatment, and treatment
      location. Developmental progress was measured frequently allowing for growth curve analysis
      to examine fine-grained differences in groups as well as interactions among major child and
      family initial variables and these two experimental variables.
