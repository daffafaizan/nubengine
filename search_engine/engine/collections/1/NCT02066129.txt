    
      The study design is a double-blind, parallel-group trial, including a total of 250
      participants, ages 5-11 years, with a diagnosis of asthma and a history of at least 1 asthma
      exacerbation treated with oral corticosteroids in the prior year. All participants will be
      treated for 48 weeks with open-label fluticasone 44 mcg 2 puffs twice daily. During the
      48-week treatment period, participants will receive randomized blinded therapy for 7 days
      each time they enter the "yellow zone" (at the onset of symptoms previously associated with
      upper respiratory illnesses and subsequent asthma exacerbations). Yellow zone therapy will be
      fluticasone 44 or 220 mcg 2 puffs twice daily.
