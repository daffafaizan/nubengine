      of intensive care survivors. Limitation of muscle wasting might therefore improve physical
      performance and quality of life. Data on high protein nutritional intake in addition to a
      standardized exercise training program to prevent skeletal muscle wasting during critical
      illness are lacking.

      Objective: to determine whether early high protein intake, using an enteral whey protein
      supplement, in addition to a standardized exercise training program and standard enteral
      nutrition preserves: a) in vitro skeletal muscle function in critically ill patients during
      the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and b) short- and long-term in vivo
      muscle function and mass, clinical outcomes and quality of life in critically ill patients.
      Secondly, to determine whether high protein intake, in addition to standardized exercise and
      standard enteral nutrition, increases muscle protein synthesis and attenuates activation of
      the Ubiquitin-Proteasome pathway in critically ill patients.
