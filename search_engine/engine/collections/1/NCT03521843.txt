      Endovascular treatment has been the first-line treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive
      disease. However, the in-stent re-stenosis has been a major limitation of well long-term
      patency after stent implantation. The chronic inflammation induced by stenting could be a
      main reason of restenosis. Then the concept "leave nothing behind" is proposed, and some
      novel treatment methods and devices are developed. Here, the investigators propose the
      hypothesis that using local drug delivery with TAPAS balloon system can relieve the
      inflammation induced by the stent implantation and balloon dilation. Therefore, 40 patients
      of femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis will be randomly allocated into the group "balloon
      dilation+local drug delivery with balloon system" or "balloon dilation only". The 1-year
      patency rate,12-month late lumen loss, incidence of complications, imaging parameters will be
      compared between two groups.
