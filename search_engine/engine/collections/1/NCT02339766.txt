    
      This will be a randomized controlled double blinded trial.

      Seventy five female patients belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists status 1-3,
      age 18-45 yrs undergoing elective caesarean delivery will be included in this prospective
      study.

      After obtaining informed consent, they will be randomized to one of the three groups by a
      computer-generated randomization. All patients will receive standard spinal anesthetic. They
      will be randomized to one of the three groups (n=25 per group).

      Groups 1 and 3 will receive intrathecal morphine in addition to the spinal anesthestic. Group
      2 will receive equal volume of saline added to the intrathecal mixture.

      Ultrasound guided Quadratus Lumborum block will be done. Following negative aspiration, 25 mL
      of Ropivacaine 0.5% (Groups 2 and 3), or the same amount of saline (Group 1) will be injected
      in each side.

      All patients will receive routine postoperative analgesia, including analgesics and oral
      morphine.

      All patients will be assessed postoperatively by a blinded investigator at 6, 12 and 24h
      post-operatively.
