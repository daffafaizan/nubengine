    
      The aim of the study was to investigate a possible correlation between the intensity of a
      nociceptive stimulus and the magnitude of pupillary reflex dilation in patients anesthetized
      with propofol and remifentanil target-controlled infusion.

      Anesthetic protocol: 10 minutes of steady-state general anesthesia (before extubation during
      a scheduled gynecological surgery) with remifentanil target concentration of 1 ng/ml, and
      propofol target concentration adjusted to maintain bispectral index between 45 and 55.

      Study period: 6 tetanic stimulations of incremental intensities were applied to the patients:
      10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 milliamps Pupillary dilation in response to these stimulations was
      recorded.

      Then, propofol and remifentanil infusions were discontinued, and patients were extubated.
