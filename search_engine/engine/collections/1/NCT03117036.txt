        1. Registration after informed consent.

        2. Laboratory and radiological evaluation after registration including collection of serum
           and cell-free DNA from patients' peripheral blood

        3. Interim and final response evaluation including collection of serum and cell-free DNA
           from patients' peripheral blood

        4. Regular monitoring disease status and update of survival status

        5. Laboratory and radiological evaluation after relapse or progression including collection
           of serum and cell-free DNA from patients' peripheral blood
