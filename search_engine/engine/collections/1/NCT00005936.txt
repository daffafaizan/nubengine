      viruses also may cause hepatitis. One specific syndrome, post-hepatitis aplastic anemia,
      suggests that the same agent is responsible for both severe and sometimes fulminant hepatitis
      as well as profound bone marrow failure. In investigating the role of viruses in these
      diseases, we require small amounts of liver tissue for molecular studies. We request
      permission to obtain samples from patients undergoing 1) liver transplantation or 2) liver
      biopsy at the time of surgery for purpose of virus discovery, including obtaining control
      samples. For liver transplant samples, tissue will be obtained from the removed organ; in
      other surgical circumstances, small amounts of tissue will be obtained when the liver is
      biopsied for other medical indications. No additional risk to the patient should result from
      either procedure.
