      agonists have been shown to have properties similar to those of dopamine antagonists and
      there is a well characterized antagonistic interaction between adenosine and dopamine
      receptors in the ventral striatum1. Increased adenosinergic transmission has been
      demonstrated to reduce the affinity of dopamine agonists for dopamine receptors. It has been
      theorized that adenosine may exert some of its antipsychotic effects through modulation of
      glutamatergic transmission.

      Three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have showed statistically
      significant greater improvements in PANSS scores in the allopurinol groups vs. placebo
      groups. These empiric data, together with the theoretical and basic science background cited,
      provide the impetus for this proposed study.
