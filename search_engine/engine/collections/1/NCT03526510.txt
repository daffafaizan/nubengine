        -  Standard fractionation: Using 2 sequential IMRT plans, the pelvic lymph nodes and
           prostate will initially be treated to 46 Gy in 23 fractions, followed by a subsequent
           boost to the prostate to a total dose of 78 Gy.

        -  Hypofractionation: Using a one phase IMRT plan, the pelvic lymph nodes will be treated
           to a dose of 48 Gy in 25 fractions, while the prostate will be treated to a dose of 68
           Gy in 25 fractions concomitantly (simulataneous integrated boost).

      In addition, all patients receive 1.5- 3 years of androgen deprivation therapy.
