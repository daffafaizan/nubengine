      (15-24 years) same-sex male couples. This design tests the added benefits of adjunct
      intervention components delivered prior to receipt of CHTC-Assertive Communication Training
      (ACT) videos viewed by the individual or couple together and individually delivered
      Motivational Interviewing-based Communication Skills Training (MI-CST). These target the
      development of communication skills necessary to participate fully in HIV prevention and
      sexual safety discussions inherent to CHTC. Youth will be randomized to receive one of two
      conditions: Condition 1: watch videos on ACT, participate in Communication Skills Training
      (MI-CST), and complete an individual HIV test, or itf participating as a couple will receive
      CHTC, and Condition 2: Individual HIV Testing (IHTC) as usual. Youth have the choice of
      attending the baseline visit alone or with their partner and have the option to bring their
      partner in later after completing the baseline alone. Youth in this CET will complete
      follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months.
