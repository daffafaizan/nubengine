      in remission. Patients want to know that they truly need to take a medication, yet they don't
      want to have flares. As a biomarker, fecal calprotectin < 167 has a 100% negative predictive
      value for flare within the next 12 weeks (Gisbert, 2009). Adalimumab has low antigenicity,
      and can be safely stopped and restarted later with good clinical effect (Colombel, 2007).
      Patients want intermittent therapy, if it can be delivered in a timely fashion when
      pre-clinical inflammation starts, in order to avoid clinically-significant flares. This study
      will combine monitoring for pre-clinical inflammation with fecal calprotectin and as-needed
      dosing with Adalimumab to maintain remission in patients who have obtained remission with
      Adalimumab. This will be compared to two comparator arms: standard maintenance therapy and
      complete cessation of therapy (Step-Down approach).
