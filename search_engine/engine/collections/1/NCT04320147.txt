      experienced radiologist according to the PI-RADS version 2 scoring system. PI-RADS scoring
      system is used to assign a degree of doubt prostate cancer. Depending on the PI-RADS score,
      MR targeted biopsy is determined.

        1. MR-targeted biopsy using Artemis device fusion of MRI and ultrasound images would be
           performed. MR targeted biopsy would be performed by radiologist.

        2. Next conventional ultrasound-guided 12-core systematic biopsy would be performed by
           urologist. This portion will be performed without information of the MRI report.
