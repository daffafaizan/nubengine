      willing to participate in the Registry. Oocytes will be retrieved and cryopreserved from
      autologous or heterologous donors. When the subject decides she would like to get pregnant,
      oocytes will be thawed, fertilized and the resultant embryos will be transferred to the
      oocyte donor (for autologous use) or to another recipient (for heterologous use). The
      treatment regimen will be completed with births and well-baby follow-up of children at 12
      months of age. Information on children will be submitted by their parents to the
      Investigators. Data collection for the Registry will be active for a maximum of five (5)
      years, including three (3) years of enrollment and two (2) additional years to complete the
      well-baby follow-up for all the children.
