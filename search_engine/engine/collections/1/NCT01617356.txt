      symptom diminishment, especially in the elderly. However studies out to 2-8 years show
      residual symptoms in many and nearly 25% with unabated symptoms. Dextrose injection has been
      utilized empirically for many years and a marked reduction in pain and luxation after
      intraarticular and pericapsular dextrose injection has been reported in a recent RCT.
      However, small study size and lack of a non injection control have prevented any definitive
      conclusions as the additional efficacy of including dextrose in the injectate. The mechanism
      of action of dextrose injection was originally thought to be via a brief stimulation of the
      inflammatory cascade with resultant production of growth factors. However, non-inflammatory
      dextrose effects on growth factor production have been demonstrated, and, more recently,
      dextrose has been found to treat neurogenic inflammation (pain from upregulation of the TRPV1
      receptor on peptidergic nerves). This has the theoretical benefit of reducing pain,
      regardless of the status and position of the intraarticular cartilage or degree of
      degenerative change of the TMD. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of
      dextrose injection versus saline injection to reduce pain and improve functional complaints
      referable to the temporomandibular joint.
