      brain stimulation (DBS). It constitutes a minimally invasive approach for these challenging
      patients. The surgical procedure is reversible and proven to have acceptable side effects in
      the frail population of Parkinson's disease patients [Gorgulho, Hemorrhage and Infection].
      Improvement of functional stereotactic surgery methods is necessary however to the challenge
      of implanting DBS electrodes in the hypothalamus. Recently, a case report of a patient with
      DBS implanted in the hypothalamus for treatment of morbid obesity who reported side effects
      related to memory appeared in the literature. The authors used the side effect findings to
      suggest the location of their implant as a site for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This
      illustrates the need of betterment of our techniques of targeting in DBS surgery, especially
      for targets located in highly functional structures, such as the hypothalamus.
