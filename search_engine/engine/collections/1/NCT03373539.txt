      neurodevelopmental and respiratory outcomes. The ability to make such predictions would be
      beneficial for both making care decisions in the neonatal intensive care unit and for
      identifying infants who require earlier and more intense intervention. We intend to determine
      if neurotrophins can be utilized to predict an infant's long-term outcomes. Neurotrophins are
      a family of four proteins that support the growth and survival of neurons. Their levels have
      been shown to increase with brain development and decrease with brain injury. Neurotrophins
      have also been associated with development of airway injury in the neonate and later
      respiratory disease such as asthma. We plan to correlate serum neurotrophin levels with
      respiratory outcomes and neurological outcomes.
