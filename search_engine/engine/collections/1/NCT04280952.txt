      The prognosis of glioblastoma patients highly depends on resection extent. Various strategies
      have been introduced to overcome the dilemma of intraoperative tumor identification.

      In gastroenterology, confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) allows precise differentiation of
      tumor tissue from surrounding mucosa in various diseases. Combining high-definition white
      light endoscopy with CLE significantly increases sensitivity and specificity compared with
      the sole application of high-definition white light endoscopy.

      CLE was recently introduced to neurosurgical applications. Although still in an early stage
      of clinical application, this technique has proven to be capable of differentiating various
      tumor entities in animal models as well as human tissue samples. CLE allows visualization of
      the underlying tissue on a microscopic scale, receiving information on the microstructure as
      well as cellular components. However, the clinical importance of this technique for its
      application in neurosurgery still needs to be demonstrated

      Methods:

      Intravenous injection dose of fluorescein sodium. For every operation the investigators plan
      to take pictures with the CONVIVO system before taking the material for standard frozen
      section and definitive histopathology. These pictures will be evaluated by a pathologist
      afterwards.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate, that the CONVIVO system allows
      identification of tumor tissue. The secondary objectives are procedural aspects and handling
      issues covering the usability.
