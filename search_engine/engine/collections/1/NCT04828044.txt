      malignancy due to improvements in technology, reduced costs and reduced morbidity. The main
      objective of this protocol is to determine the extent of ablation based on time and power
      parameters of the MedWaves in breast cancers. This would be accomplished in patients
      diagnosed with breast cancer who are already scheduled for breast cancer surgery. Prior to
      the surgical removal of the cancer, the microwave antenna would be inserted into the tumor
      under ultrasound guidance (either percutaneously or open). The tumor would be ablated, and
      then surgically resected in a standard, curative fashion.
