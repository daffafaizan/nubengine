    
      Purpose: Under the hospital based, and in conjuction with the community, we try to target the
      young HIV MSM victims and develop the partnership networking to seek for the potential high
      risk couples to enroll into our intervention.

      Materials & Methods: At hospital, though HIV clinic has case manager, however the limitation
      of space and privacy, we just focus on the HIV patient itself and have limited time to
      educate patients' sex partners. Therefore, we aimed at enrolling more of the intimate
      partners thru young HIV MSM victims thru hospital base. We will provide the saliva OraQuick
      rapid test service to the partners, thus set up the relationship with the study subjects, and
      then communicate with them and educate them with knowledge of sexual transmitted diseases and
      sex health. We plan to enroll 200 study subjects till the end of this year. Our co-PI, Prof.
      Y.M. Chen will also perform HIV gene clustering analysis thru high throughput ultra-deep
      pyrosequencing among young MSM HIV victims. The other co-PI Prof. P.I. Chou will train the
      research assistant adopting MSM HIV victim partner follow-up model to approach the study
      subjects with structured questionnaires. Prof. Chou also collected the study subjects in the
      northern Taiwan with her own project, thus we can compare and analyze the difference from the
      locality (North area v.s. South area).

      Anticipated work: We aim at enrolling 300 young HIV MSM partners to this OraQuick rapid test,
      setting up the follow-up model and providing the intervention education of safe sex thru
      individual case management, group meeting, leader-finding plan and interactive MSM web
      networking to achieve the preventione of sexual disease transmission in the youth.
