    
      Pregnant women of all ages, gravidity and with gestational ages 16-30 weeks, living within 15
      km of the study center and presenting for antenatal care or diagnosed with uncomplicated
      malaria will be screened with P.falciparum rapid diagnostic test kits after obtaining
      consent. Those testing positive will have blood film microscopy done and only those with
      positive blood film microscopy will be recruited to participate in the study. Participants
      will be randomized to receive either dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine at an estimated total
      dosing of 6.75mg/kg of dihydroartemisinin and 55mg/kg of piperaquine for 3 days rounded to
      the nearest half tablet) or artesunate-amodiaquine(artesunate 4mg/kg and amodiaquine 10mg/kg
      in two twelve hourly doses daily for 3 days) after giving informed consent and a physical
      examination. This will be followed by home visits on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42
      post-treatment to assess occurrence of adverse events and to obtain blood samples for
      microscopy, filter paper blots for PCR analysis and haematology. The mentioned laboratory
      investigations will also be conducted at recruitment.

      Participants will be followed up to delivery and 6 weeks post-partum to gather data on
      maternal peripheral and placental parasitaemia, cord parasitaemia, maternal haemoglobin
      levels, low birth weights, stillbirths, preterm deliveries, neonatal jaundice, birth defects
      and infant deaths.
