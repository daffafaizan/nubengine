      patients is still at risk for new coronary events after experiencing an acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS). Detection of residual vulnerable plaques after ACS using OCT potentially
      identifies patients at high risk for new coronary events. However, no prospectively collected
      data on the prognostic power of OCT for plaque rupture are available at this moment. To
      design trials aimed to reduce events in patients with vulnerable plaques it is required to
      collect such prospective data on the relation between OCT derived characteristics of
      vulnerability and clinical outcome.
