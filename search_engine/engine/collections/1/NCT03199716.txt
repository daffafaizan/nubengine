      multiple daily injection regimen (MDI) or the insulin pump therapy, through monitoring the
      frequency of blood glucose measurements. Researchers are also trying to determine if the
      parent mentors can improve glycemic control, which is measured through HbA1c. Diabetic
      knowledge, responsibility for diabetes care, degree of diabetes related family conflicts, and
      major complications of diabetes will also be collected during the patient's routine clinic
      visit. The study hypothesis is that trained parent mentors can help families with children
      who have poorly controlled T1DM improve adherence to their diabetes regimen and improve their
      metabolic control.
