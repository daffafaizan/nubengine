      slow progression of glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Incisional procedures are indicated when
      medical therapy and/or laser procedures cannot adequately reduce IOP. Trabeculectomy is the
      most common glaucoma incisional procedure globally. On the other hand, glaucoma drainage
      devices that have been historically reserved for cases of glaucoma deemed at high risk of
      failure have increasingly gained popularity particularly in eyes with previous history of
      glaucoma surgery.

      There is still no agreement on the appropriate surgical procedure in those with prior
      glaucoma surgery. The five-year tube versus trabeculectomy (TVT) study, which evaluated the
      efficacy and safety of Baerveldt glaucoma implant versus trabeculectomy, showed that both
      surgical procedures had similar IOP reduction and use of anti-glaucoma medication; tube shunt
      surgery had a higher success rate than trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC); the
      trabeculectomy/MMC had higher incidence of early postoperative complications compared to tube
      shunt surgery; and rates of late postoperative complications, reoperation for complications,
      and cataract extraction were comparable in both treatment groups.

      In this study, the investigators compared three-year outcomes of re-trabeculectomy with those
      of Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation in secondary surgical management of patients with
      primary open angle glaucoma and a previous history of failed trabeculectomy.
