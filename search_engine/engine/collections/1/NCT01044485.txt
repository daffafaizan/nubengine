    
      Docetaxel is a major drug in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In HER2 negative
      tumor, the first line treatment is based on docetaxel containing regimen: docetaxel alone,
      docetaxel + anthracycline or docetaxel + capecitabine. The efficacy of docetaxel in
      combination with trastuzumab has been demonstrated in first line metastatic breast cancer
      overexpressing erbB2 receptor. The response rate (RR) and the time to progression (TTP)
      observed were even higher than those obtained with paclitaxel +trastuzumab. Docetaxel is more
      and more used in first line metastatic setting, becoming the first Taxane used in this
      setting.As trastuzumab may raise safety/tolerability concerns, and as its interest in
      trastuzumab refractory patients may be limited, there is a need to find new drugs to combine
      with docetaxel in breast cancer, and to address the specific interaction/safety profile of
      this combination.The association of lapatinib and docetaxel will be the key combination in
      metastatic breast cancer development for GSK.The conclusion of a phase I trial EGF 10021
      trial conducted in the US which assessed the combination of lapatinib and docetaxel showed
      that the acceptable optimal tolerated regimen (OTR) of docetaxel (75 mg/m²) was obtained in
      combination with lapatinib 1250 mg with systematic growth factor support.Data from an ongoing
      EGF100161 phase I study evaluating the OTR of lapatinib + docetaxel + trastuzumab shows that
      the association of lapatinib 1250 mg with docetaxel 75mg/m² is haematological toxic and has
      recently been amended to evaluate lapatinib 1250 mg with docetaxel 75 mg/m² with systematic
      growth factor support.A phase I/II EORTC study evaluating docetaxel plus lapatinib in
      neoadjuvant breast cancer patients has just started. The phase I part of this study will
      evaluate several lapatinib and docetaxel dose levels before conducting phase II.

      The phase I part will enrol patients (in cohorts of 3 or 6) to determine in a step-wise
      approach, the OTR of lapatinib and docetaxel. Patients should not be entered at a higher dose
      level until all patients in the previous cohort complete the first cycle of treatment, this
      first cycle is used to determine OTR. Dose modification of lapatinib will be based on any
      observed toxicity in the treatment period. The OTR will be defined as the dose level at which
      £ 1 of 6 patients experiences the DLT (dose limiting toxicity).If no DLT is observed in the
      first 3 patients at a particular dose level during the first cycle (3 week treatment period),
      recruitment will start at the next dose levelIf 1/3 patients experiences a DLT at a
      particular dose level, additional 3 patients will be enrolled at that dose level to a total
      of 6 patients if no DLT occurred againIf 1/6 patients experiences a DLT at a particular dose
      level, recruitment will start at the next dose levelIf ³ 2/6 patients experiences the same
      DLT at a particular dose level, the dose level is not considered to be tolerableIf ³ 2/6
      patients experiences two distinct DLT at a particular dose level, additional 3 patients will
      be enrolled at that dose level to a total of 9 patients. If one of the previously described
      DLT occurred again among the new enrolled patients, the dose level is not considered to be
      tolerableA total of 12 patients will be treated at the OTR.The OTR is defined as the dose
      level at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences a DLT.The DLT for this study is
      defined during cycle 1 for the dose escalation step as:· any grade 3-4 non hematological
      toxicity as defined by the Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3 (with the exclusion of
      alopecia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, infusion related that can be rapidly controlled with
      appropriate measures)· an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5x109 /L lasting for > = 7 day·
      febrile neutropenia defined as ANC < 1.0 x109 /L and fever at least 38.5°C· thrombocytopenia
      < 25, 000/µl or thrombocytopenic bleeding requiring transfusion· grade 3 or higher left
      ventricular cardiac dysfunction or a ≥ 20% decrease from baseline in left ventricular
      ejection fraction (LVEF) that is also below the institution's lower limit of normal (LLN),
      and confirmed by a repeat evaluation 1 to 2 weeks following the first evaluation.
