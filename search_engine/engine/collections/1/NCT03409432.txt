    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of brentuximab vedotin
      (BV) and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
      (CTCL)/peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the duration of response and 2 year progression-free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS) associated with the combination of brentuximab vedotin (BV) and
      lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL/PTCL.

      II. To define the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of the combination of brentuximab
      vedotin (BV) and lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL/PTCL.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate between the expression of CD30 in neoplastic cells by immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) and overall response rate (ORR) of the combination of brentuximab vedotin (BV) and
      lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory CTCL/PTCL.

      II. To determine T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell subset numbers, phenotype, and
      functional status in relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) CTCL/PTCL patients, and whether the
      combination of brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide alters these parameters during therapy.

      III. To determine changes in plasma cytokine levels and other biomarkers in this patient
      population during therapy with the combination of brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on day 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
