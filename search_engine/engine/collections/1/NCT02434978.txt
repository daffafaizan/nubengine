      treatment is associated with an improved outcome in term of lower rate of rebleeding and
      lower rate of bleeding-related mortality. A potential risk of increased risk of complications
      (in particular perforation) among patients treated with control endoscopy is also evaluated.
      Outcomes are prospectively registered based on patient records.
