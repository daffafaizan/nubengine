      central artery stiffness and cerebrovascular dysfunction. Large central artery stiffness is a
      risk factor for cognitive decline mediated in part by the development of cerebrovascular
      dysfunction. This study will investigate the degree to which improving nitric oxide
      bioavailability using dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation improves cerebrovascular
      function through reductions in large central artery stiffness in middle-aged and older
      adults.
