    
      This is a prospective registry including patient scheduled for a clinically-indicated
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of a de novo epicardial lesion with indication for
      drug-eluting stent implantation. Following study enrolment and PCI/stent with the Angiolite
      DES, patients will be scheduled for follow-up surveillance coronary angiography and OCT with
      the C7-XRTM Fourier Domain OCT system with C7 DragonflyTM catheter (St Jude Medical,
      Minneapolis, MN) or with the Terumo LunawayTM OCT system with fastview catheter (Terumo
      Medical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). An adaptive design component of the study will randomize
      patients to either 3-month or 6-month angio/OCT follow-up. Clinical follow-up will occur at
      30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post PCI.
