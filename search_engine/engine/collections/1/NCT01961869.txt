      I. To select an optimal black raspberry confection based on altered gene expression and
      chemical profiles in healthy individuals exposed to 3 black raspberry-based amorphous
      functional confections with modulated bioactive release rate at two doses (4 g and 8 g).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 6 arms after 2 weeks.

      ARM I: Participants receive black raspberry (BRB) confection 1 fast release orally (PO) 4-6
      hours apart thrice daily (TID) for 2 weeks.

      ARM II: Participants receive BRB confection 2 fast release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2
      weeks.

      ARM III: Participants receive BRB confection 1 intermediate release PO 4-6 hours apart TID
      for 2 weeks.

      ARM IV: Participants receive BRB confection 2 intermediate release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for
      2 weeks.

      ARM V: Participants receive BRB confection 1 prolonged release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2
      weeks.

      ARM VI: Participants receive BRB confection 2 prolonged release PO 4-6 hours apart TID for 2
      weeks.
