      in a variety of obesity related and non-obesity related surgeries. With the risk of an
      increasingly more obese society, complication rates that significantly differ based on
      patients' relative obesity may become increasingly unacceptable. The purpose of the proposed
      prospective study is to evaluate the role that vacuum assisted closure (VAC) may play in
      reducing these complication rates. Negative pressure or vacuum assisted closure was first
      introduced in 1997 as a way to control and potentially treat chronic wounds. Since that time,
      the indications have exploded to include a variety of chronic and acute wound healing
      problems. We have anecdotally been using VAC therapy (V.A.C.;KCI, San Antonio, Texas) in an
      effort to control the postoperative draining that is nearly ubiquitous in our morbidly obese
      orthopaedic trauma patients. The V.A.C. dressing is applied to the acute postoperative wound
      and maintained during the immediate postoperative period. Although a novel approach to the
      use of the V.A.C., this use has been previously reported in the orthopaedic literature as a
      case series. To our knowledge, there has not been a prospective study evaluating the efficacy
      of the immediate placement of a V.A.C. dressing on postoperative wound infection rates in the
      setting of the morbidly obese orthopaedic trauma patient. It is our hypothesis that obese
      patients treated with V.A.C. therapy after standard closure of trauma-related, operative
      orthopaedic incisions will have fewer postoperative wound complications.
