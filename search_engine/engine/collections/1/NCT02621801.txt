      Training Program -- Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP) to create the SMART-R
      resident wellness curriculum. The actual SMART-3RP is both a clinical program and research
      intervention. The three prongs of the SMART-R include 1) elicitation of the relaxation
      response through mind-body techniques 2) reducing overall stress reactivity and 3) increasing
      connectedness to self and others.

      In a waitlist-control design, the SMART-R was implemented into multiple residents programs at
      Mass General Hospital, NYU Langone Medical Center, and Weill Cornell Medical College. The
      primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the SMART-R in increasing coping skills and
      reducing stress among residents in the participating programs. Participants enrolled will be
      invited to complete 1) a brief questionnaire before, during (q3months) and after
      participation in the program (5 questionnaires total). The investigators will also collect
      continuous physiologic data using the Basis Peak Health Tracking device to correlate the
      physiologic data with self-report measures of stress.

      Additionally, objective indicators of daily workload (page frequency, and quantity of notes
      authored by a resident during a given period) will help control for residents' schedules and
      busyness, in evaluating perceived stress, wellbeing and other outcomes.
