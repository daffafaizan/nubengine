      polyarthritis. We want to know if we can use the length of telomeres in peripheral blood
      cells at baseline as a novel prognostic marker.

      In order to be able to interpret our observations in arthritis patients over time, we need to
      compare these results with those observed in normal human controls adjusted for gender and
      for age groups.

      These patients are first screened for the presence of acute or chronic severe diseases
      (cancer, cardiovascular, articular, et...). They then have genomic DNA extracted from
      peripheral blood at Baseline and at 3 months interval for a year than annually for a total
      duration of 5 years. A complete blood count is collected at each blood draw. At each blood
      draw, the appearance of acute or chronic diseases is noted.
