      group) or placebo (Control group). Equal randomization is accomplished using a
      computer-generated random allocation schedule. The method of allocation concealment is
      sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes technique. Both synbiotics and placebo
      preparations are in foil-sealed sachets stored in identical numbered containers. Both study
      products are white powders, identical in weight, smell, and taste. Thus, the identity of the
      specific product is blind to participants, support staff and investigators for the entire
      duration of the study period.
