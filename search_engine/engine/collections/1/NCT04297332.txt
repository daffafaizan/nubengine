      I. To quantify the main and interactive effects of the episodic future thinking (EFT) and
      future thinking priming (FTP) tasks on delay discounting rate, latency to relapse, and
      multiple abstinence and self-regulation measures among smokers (n=76) who call a busy
      Quitline to quit smoking.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I: Participants are provided with Forever Free relapse prevention booklets and receive a
      2-week supply of nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges. Participants also receive 1 proactive
      coaching call within 24 hours of quit date. Beginning on the quit date, participants complete
      an active episodic future thinking or active future thinking priming task once per week for
      12 weeks, alternating every week between tasks.

      ARM II: Participants are provided with Forever Free relapse prevention booklets and receive a
      2-week supply of nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges. Participants also receive 1 proactive
      coaching call within 24 hours of quit date. Beginning on the quit date, participants complete
      an active episodic future thinking or control future thinking priming task once per week for
      12 weeks, alternating every week between tasks.

      ARM III: Participants are provided with Forever Free relapse prevention booklets and receive
      a 2-week supply of nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges. Participants also receive 1 proactive
      coaching call within 24 hours of quit date. Beginning on the quit date, participants complete
      a control episodic future thinking or active future thinking priming task once per week for
      12 weeks, alternating every week between tasks.

      ARM IV: Participants are provided with Forever Free relapse prevention booklets and receive a
      2-week supply of nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges. Participants also receive 1 proactive
      coaching call within 24 hours of quit date. Beginning on the quit date, participants complete
      a control episodic future thinking or control future thinking priming tasks once per week for
      12 weeks, alternating every week between tasks.
