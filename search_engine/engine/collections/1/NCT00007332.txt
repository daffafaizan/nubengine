      affected populations. For this reason, the development of safe, effective vaccines to prevent
      HIV infections worldwide is needed. ALVAC vCP1452 and MN rgp120/HIV-1 have been shown to be
      well tolerated in Phase I and II studies. ALVAC vCP1452 given alone or in combination with
      subunit antigens [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: antigen] is a candidate vaccine to be evaluated
      for the ability to produce and express vaccine antigen in greater quantity for a longer time
      and with improved immunogenicity.

      Volunteers are randomized to 1 of 7 [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: 1 of 4] groups and stratified
      by risk status. Prior to immunization, evaluations and blood draws are done to monitor
      hematological, chemical, and immunologic parameters. Volunteers receive 2 injections of the
      following vaccines at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6:

      Group A: ALVAC vCP1452 and alum placebo [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: AIDSVAX placebo (aluminum
      hydroxide adjuvant)] at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6.

      Group B: ALVAC vCP1452 and alum placebo [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: AIDSVAX placebo] at
      Months 0 and 1 and ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/B at Months 3 and 6.

      Group C: ALVAC placebo and alum placebo. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: ALVAC vCP1452 and
      AIDSVAX B/B at Months 0, 1, and 6 and ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX placebo at Month 3.] Group D:
      ALVAC vCP1452 and alum placebo at Months 0 and 1 and ALVAC vCP1452 and MN rgp120 at Months 3
      and 6. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: ALVAC placebo and AIDSVAX placebo at Months 0, 1, 3, and
      6.] Group E: ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/B at Months 0, 1, and 6; ALVAC vCP1452 and alum
      placebo at Month 3. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Group E has been discontinued.] Group F:
      ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/B. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Group F has been discontinued.]
      Group G: ALVAC vCP1452 and alum placebo at Months 0 and 1; ALVAC vCP1452 and AIDSVAX B/E at
      Months 3 and 6. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Group G has been discontinued.] Following each
      pair of injections, volunteers are observed in the clinic for 30 minutes. Volunteers keep a
      record of body temperature and any other symptoms and report results to their AIDS Vaccine
      Evaluation Unit. Evaluations are performed by telephone or clinic visit on Days 1 and 2 after
      each vaccination. [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/12/00: Volunteers record all relevant signs and
      symptoms occurring 48 hours after each vaccination and provide that information at each
      clinic visit.] HIV testing is conducted every 3 to 6 months and volunteers are asked to
      complete social harms questionnaires once at Day 168 and once at the end of the study.
      Volunteers are followed on the study for a minimum of 18 months after the first immunization.
      Safety is evaluated by closely monitoring for local and systemic adverse reactions during the
      course of the trial.
