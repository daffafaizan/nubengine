    
      Aim: The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of CPP-ACP in reducing S. mutans,
      and compare that with fluoride alone, or combined use of fluoride and CPP-ACP.

      Materials and methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial involving 127 children
      ages between 4 and 5 years. They will be examined and chosen randomly for the study. One
      hundred and twenty seven children will be divided equally into three groups: Group 1 will use
      CPP-ACP twice daily, Group 2 will apply fluoride toothpaste twice daily, Group 3 will apply
      fluoridated toothpaste and CPP-ACP twice daily. Oral swabs will be collected from children to
      measure S. mutans levels in terms of Colony forming units (CFU) using Saliva Check Mutans
      kits (GCÂ© , Asia) for this purpose. Samples will be analyzed for S. mutans colonization
      before antibacterial agent application (baseline) and at 3, and 6 month intervals.

      Expected results: it is expected that all used anti-cariogenic agents will have the ability
      to reduce the S. mutans levels in different levels.
