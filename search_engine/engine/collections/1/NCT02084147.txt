      I. To assess and optimize image quality of PET and MRI focusing on technical artifacts and
      their correction.

      II. To assess the accuracy of PET quantification based on MR attenuation correction (MRAC)
      derived from various MRI sequences and reconstruction algorithms including the effect of
      routinely used Gadolinium-based contrast agents on MRAC.

      III. To determine the clinical and diagnostic accuracy of PET-MRI in comparison to
      standard-of-care diagnostic imaging.

      IV. To assess the efficacy and workflow in combining PET and MRI in one single examination as
      compared to separate imaging studies.

      V. To assess the potential for radiation dose reduction if PET-CT is substituted by PET-MRI,
      thus avoiding the radiation exposure from the CT-component.
