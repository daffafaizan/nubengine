      COVID-19 systemic infection. To overcome the uncontrolled inflammation leading to ARDS and
      respiratory failure, several drugs have been investigated in this situation with the most
      promising results coming from anti-inflammatory agents that directly or indirectly inhibit
      IL-6 and its counterparts of inflammation.

      Low dose radiation, as opposed to high dose, has documented anti-inflammatory effects that
      are exercised through various mechanisms including decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines
      such as IL-6.

      In this pilot clinical trial, the patients are carefully selected according to inclusion
      /exclusion criteria and the clinical judgement of the multi- disciplinary team.Their
      diagnostic CT scan will be used to plan an AP/ PA radiotherapy treatment to both lungs and
      the set-up positioning information is obtained from anatomical landmarks. The patient will be
      referred for a fraction of 0.5 Gy to both lungs and for the next 28 days the clinical
      para-clinical and radiologic variables of disease severity will be monitored closely. Should
      the patient's clinical course indicate and the multi- disciplinary team approves, they may be
      subjected to another fraction of 0.5 Gy to a maximum of 1 Gy in two fractions at least 72
      hours apart. All the patients will also receive the standard national protocol of COVID-19
      management.

      A total of 5 patients will be enrolled in the RT arm, providing favourable results seen in
      the first set of patients, the team will decide on recruiting a larger number for a phase II
      clinical trial.
