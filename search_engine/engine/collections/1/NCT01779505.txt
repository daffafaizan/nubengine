      status in patients with chronic HBV, with the weakest T cell responses in patients with
      untreated chronic active infection and the strongest T cell responses in patients who have
      achieved seroconversion or cure (4). We have generated a Tarmogen expressing well conserved
      regions of the HBV X, S, and core antigens (GS-4774). GS-4774 is immunogenic in murine models
      and has also been used to stimulate human immune cell samples ex vivo to elicit HBV specific
      T cell responses which could predict the immune responses in patients dosed with GS-4774.
      GS-4774 will be evaluated in this healthy volunteer study to assess its safety, tolerability,
      and ability to elicit HBV specific T cell responses. In the future GS-4774 could be used in
      combination with HBV antivirals, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in an attempt to
      improve HBsAg seroconversion (cure) rates in patients with chronic HBV infection.
