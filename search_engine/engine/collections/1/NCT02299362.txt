    
      This multi-center study will evaluate the long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of
      Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) and other Early Onset Spinal and Chest Wall Deformities in a
      large population of patients.

      The study will attempt to answer the following clinical questions:

        1. How do clinical parameters (e.g. height, weight, pulmonary function, incidence of
           complications) differ between:

             1. Age groups

             2. Etiologic groups

             3. Treatment types including operative and non-operative methods

             4. Patients who receive definitive spinal fusion versus those who do not

        2. How do radiographic parameters (e.g. curve size, spinal height, thoracic dimensions,
           sagittal profile, pelvic parameters, spinal balance) differ between:

             1. Age groups

             2. Etiologic groups

             3. Treatment types including operative and non-operative methods

             4. Patients who receive definitive spinal fusion versus those who do not

        3. How does health-related quality of life (HRQOL), using the EOSQ-24 outcomes tool, differ
           between:

             1. Age groups

             2. Etiologic groups

             3. Treatment types including operative and non-operative methods

             4. Patients who receive definitive spinal fusion versus those who do not

        4. What demographic, clinical, radiographic, and surgical factors contribute to the
           incidence of complications?

        5. For patients with a particular diagnosis, age and/or treatment type, what are the
           clinical, radiographic and HRQOL changes before and after treatment?

        6. What are the mechanisms that cause rod breakage in growing rod constructs? (This study
           question is a collaborative research study with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration).
