      Inclusion criteria are women aged between 20 and 50 years old and have willing to participate
      to this study. Subjects will be excluded as follows: (1) taking medications that affect
      weight or hormones; (2) fluctuation of weight exceeds 2 kg within 3 months before the
      enrolled in study; (3) any condition that causes the subject fail to complete the test paper,
      such as: cognitive problems; (4) diagnosed with mental illness; (5) pregnancy or menopause.
      The assessments include: obesity-related indicators (height, weight, waist and hip
      circumference, percentage of body fat), respiratory exchange ratio, heart rate variability,
      body image (multi-directional self-body relationship questionnaire (MBSRQ), figure rating
      scale (FRS)), physical activity (Seven-days Physical Activity Recall, 7-d PAR), eating
      behavior (Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, revised 18-item, TFEQ-18), and depression
      (Mongomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS). Statistical analysis will be performed by
      using SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc, Chicago: SPSS Inc.), and significant level would be set at
      0.05. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to examine the differences of all measured
      variables among different degrees of obesity groups. In addition, we will use multiple linear
      regression analysis to examine whether overweight and obesity are significantly related to
      respiratory exchange rate, heart rate variability and body image.
