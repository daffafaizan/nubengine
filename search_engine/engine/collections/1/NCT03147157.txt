      term survival is limited by acute and chronic rejection reaction and adverse reactions caused
      by immune inhibitors. However, effective guideline of immune inhibitors regimen after liver
      transplantation is lacking. Human major histocompatibility antigens (HLA) is crucial in renal
      transplantation, while the role in liver transplantation is unclear. It is reported that HLA
      matching was closely related to the occurrence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) after
      liver transplantation. And by reducing or removing the immune inhibitors can change the
      course of illness, improve prognosis, at the same time conduce to induce immune tolerance.
      Therefore, the investigators have the reason to believe that HLA matching rate has closely
      association with postoperative immune status of patients after liver transplantation, which
      may guide immune inhibitors regimen. The aim of this research is to design a randomized
      controlled clinical study, which is based on HLA matching rate to guide tacrolimus regimen.
      In this study, the possibility of tacrolimus regimen guided by HLA matching rate will be
      explored, the occurrence rate of GVHD and rejection reaction will be observed, and the
      occurrence time and degree of adverse reactions caused by immune inhibitors will be
      identified. In the meantime, providing a possible prospect for prevention of GVHD and
      reduction or removal of immune inhibitors.
