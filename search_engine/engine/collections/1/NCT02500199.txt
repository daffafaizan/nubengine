    
      This is an open-label, dose escalation study of repeated doses of pyrotinib in patients with
      HER2-positive advanced solid tumors, including breast cancer, non small cell lung cancer.

      Part 1 of the trial is dose escalation and is designed to enroll 3 to 6 patients in each dose
      group. Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and monitored throughout the study.
      Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed from the first dose of study drug through day
      28 in the first cycle of treatment.

      Part 2 of the trial will consist of two independent arms: arm A for HER2 positive mBC and arm
      B for NSCLC with documented HER2 mutation will be investigated to further evaluate safety and
      the preliminary effectiveness and clinical benefits of pyrotinib as a single agent.
