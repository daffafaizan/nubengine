      Infiltration plus immediately postoperative intramuscular Diclofenac and Bupivacaine
      peritoneal infiltration alone by using visual analogue score (VAS). The secondary objective
      is to evaluate the time to first dose and the total amount of morphine requirement after the
      operation in both groups.
