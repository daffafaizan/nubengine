      (Zithromax) plus CQ given weekly as a prophylaxis against CQ-resistant P falciparum in
      healthy adults. After signing informed consent, subjects will undergo screening procedures
      between Day -77 to Day -18. If enrolled, subjects who are still eligible at Study Day -18
      will be randomized to either the CQ/AZ group (Group 1 of 15 subjects: 2 g AZ (Zithromax) plus
      300 mg CQ base weekly for 6 weeks), or the CQ control group (Group 2 of 8 subjects: 300 mg
      chloroquine base weekly for 6 weeks) and start intervention on Study Day -17. The rationale
      for the CQ control group to receive CQ is to show that the strain utilized (7G8) is indeed
      chloroquine resistant in humans: we expect all of the subjects in the CQ control group to
      become symptomatically parasitemic. If 3 or more subjects in the CQ control group do not
      become symptomatic with malaria, the CHMI will be considered uncontrolled either due to 7G8
      not being CQ-resistant, or the parasite not being infective.
