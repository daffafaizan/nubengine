      trials with randomized treatment arms. Furthermore, previous randomized or observational
      trials have enrolled small numbers of subjects and thus often had non-definitive findings.
      One of the most common causes of osteomyelitis is Staphylococcus aureus. Over the past 10
      years, rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have risen dramatically. Vancomycin is
      currently the treatment of choice for treating MRSA. While vancomycin is effective, it is
      only available in intravenous formulation and has renal and bone marrow toxicities. There is
      a critical need for effective, oral, cheap drugs for the treatment of MRSA.
      Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a drug with several advantageous properties for
      the treatment of MRSA osteomyelitis. To address this question regarding optimal treatment of
      MRSA osteomyelitis, we designed a prospective, randomized trial comparing TMP-SMX with
      vancomycin for the treatment of MRSA osteomyelitis.
