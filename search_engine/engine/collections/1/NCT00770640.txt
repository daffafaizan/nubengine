      with contra-indications for metformin and sulfonylurea drugs are usually treated with insulin
      therapy only. While the prolonged pharmacokinetic insulin profile due to delayed renal
      insulin elimination already is a hurdle for a successful therapy, impaired kidney function
      results in increased oxidative stress and cardiovascular risk, especially in patients
      requiring dialysis. Several potential mechanisms may explain this increased cardiovascular
      risk, and one, frequent finding is coexistence of several other independent cardiovascular
      risk factors including dyslipidemia, hypertension and smoking. In addition, impaired kidney
      function is associated with elevated markers of inflammation and other putative risk factors
      for cardiovascular events.

      The focus of this study is to investigate whether pioglitazone may help improve overall
      metabolic and cardiovascular risks in patients with end stage renal disease, and if
      pioglitazone can potentially exert positive effects on kidney function in patients with renal
      failure requiring dialysis.

      The duration of treatment for patients completing the study is approximately 26 weeks.
