    
      The data for this retrospective clinical evaluation were collected from the files and
      radiographs of consecutive patients who had received surgical treatment of peri-implantitis
      between 2007 and 2009 and thereafter enrolled in supportive peri-implant treatment (SPT) .

      Between 2007 and 2009, 41 patients with at least 1 implant with peri-implantitis that
      underwent peri-implant surgery were enrolled in a supportive peri-implant therapy.

      At the 2-years follow up, two groups could be identified, one "responding group" (17
      patients) who did not present any implants with peri-implantitis and a "no-responding Group"
      (22 patients), presenting still peri-implantitis.

      Following the 2-years control visit, 17 patients of the responding group exited the
      supporting peri-implant therapy at the specialist clinic. They continued the routine controls
      at their referral clinics while the 22 patients of the no-responding group, continued the
      scheduled supportive peri-implant therapy (SPT) given at the specialist clinic.
