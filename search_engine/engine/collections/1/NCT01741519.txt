    
      12 subjects will be administered LDLL600 and Brevibloc in a double-blind, randomized,
      cross-over setting. PK, systemic cardiovascular and local tolerability and safety of 24-hour
      long infusions of three dose levels of both Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) during
      each treatment period will be assessed.

      Each treatment period will consist of:

      Dose level 1 (LOW) for 2 hours (h) Dose level 2 (MEDIUM)for 2 hours Dose level 3 (HIGH)for 2
      hours PK and tolerability observation at dose level 3, 2 or 1 will be continued for 18 hours
      in order to end up with a total infusion period of 24 h Post-infusion follow-up (FU)for 6
      hours after infusion termination

      The duration of the wash-out period between treatment periods will be at least two days. Each
      subject, if confirmed eligible, will complete two treatment periods in total.

      In case of poor tolerability, alternative dosing schemes will be followed.
