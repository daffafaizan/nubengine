      cancer, PFS is usually around 6-8 months and 2nd or 3rd line treatments are by far less
      effective. Well tolerated maintenance treatments with the potential to prolong PFS and even
      OS are urgently needed. This study evaluates the impact of the addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor
      to an anti-hormonal maintenance treatment of physiciansÂ´ choice.
