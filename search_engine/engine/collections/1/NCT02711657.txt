      Procollagen 1 and thereby show that these markers can be used to identify circulating
      fibrocytes. 2) To measure the levels of circulating CD45+, CD34+, CD11b+ cells in patients
      with RA, Fibrotic ILDs, severe asthma and in healthy controls (HC). 3) To compare the levels
      with number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that differentiate to mature
      fibrocytes in vitro.

      Method: The CD45+, CD34+, CD11b+ cells from 4 patients were isolated by cell sorting, and
      stained for Procollagen. 30 patients (10 of each RA, fibrotic ILDs: IPF or non-specific
      interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), severe asthma) and 10 HC were included. Current medication,
      disease activity, lung function and radiographic data were collected. In 100 ÂµL of lysed
      blood cells were enumerated by flowcytometry. Further, PBMC were isolated and cultured for 5
      days. Coverslips from two wells were stained and mature fibrocytes counted and reported as
      fibrocytes per 106 PBMC originally added to the well.
