effects of alkalosis on plasma concentration and urinaryexcretion of inorganic phosphate in manacute respiratory and metabolic alkalosis havebeen shown to depress plasma phosphorus con-centration in normal man.  the fall in plasmaphosphorus concentration is greater in respiratorythan in comparable levels of extracellular meta-bolic alkalosis.  this fall is not attributable to in-creased renal excretion or to migration into redblood cells.  the evaluation of low serum phos-phorus concentrations should always be carriedout with a knowledge of the ph and total co2content of the plasma.
