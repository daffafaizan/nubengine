      machine and back to the patient during therapy. There are three types of vascular access:
      Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), Central venous catheters (CVC) and Arteriovenous grafts (AVG).

      AVFs are associated with the best patient survival in individuals undergoing dialysis
      therapy. However, Up 30-50% of AVFs thrombose or fail to mature sufficiently to support
      dialysis.

      The aim of this database is to further research in the area of AVF outcomes using routinely
      collected clinical data..
