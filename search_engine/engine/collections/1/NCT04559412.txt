    
      This study is a Phase 1b proof-of-concept, open-label study to assess the safety and pilot
      efficacy of Enbrel administered by the Sofusa® DoseConnect™ delivery system (SOFUSA) for the
      treatment of patients with moderately active RA and an inadequate response to subcutaneous
      (SC) Enbrel. SOFUSA Enbrel will be administered once weekly to patients for 12 weeks.
      Patients will start on an Enbrel dose of 25 mg during the induction phase of the study and
      may be increased to an Enbrel dose of 50 mg during the dose escalation phase of the study
      based on the dose escalation criteria. Patients will remain on either the 25 mg or 50 mg dose
      for the final maintenance phase of the study.
