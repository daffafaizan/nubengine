      reconstruction after mastectomy. Improvements in technique and postoperative analgesia have
      decreased the length of hospital stay required after this procedure. Early discharge
      following a range of procedures has been consistently shown to increase patient satisfaction,
      decrease perioperative complication rates, and improve hospital cost-effectiveness.
      Specifically, early discharge after breast reconstruction using another pedicled myocutaneous
      flap, the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, was shown to be safe,
      patient-centered, and associated with significant hospital cost-savings by another Canadian
      group.

      The balance between financial savings and patient safety/comfort has been studied vigorously
      across many medical disciplines. With increasing pressure from hospital administrators to
      weigh financial considerations into treatment decision making, clinicians must empirically
      test cost-saving strategies in order to ensure patient satisfaction and safety.

      Here, we evaluate patient safety, satisfaction and cost efficacy in ambulatory breast
      reconstruction using the pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap.
