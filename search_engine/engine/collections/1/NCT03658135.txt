    
      This is a phase 1b randomized, double-blind, safety, and tolerability clinical trial of an
      investigational drug, called BIIB092 in patients with four different primary tauopathy
      syndromes: amyloid PET (-) corticobasal syndrome (CBS), nonfluent variant primary progressive
      aphasia (nfvPPA), symptomatic patients with autosomal dominant genetic forms of
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD) due to the presence of a mutation in the
      microtubule-associated protein tau gene (sMAPT), and traumatic encephalopathy syndromes
      (TES). Primary tauopathies are neurodegenerative brain disorders in which tau is the only
      protein that accumulates at autopsy. While Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common
      tauopathy, it is considered a secondary tauopathy, because tau protein accumulates along with
      another pathogenic protein, amyloid beta. Primary tauopathies are rare diseases for which
      there is no treatment or cure. The purpose of the this study is to characterize the safety
      and tolerability profile of intravenous BIIB092 in four primary tauopathies.

      A basket design will be used for a parallel evaluation of BIIB092 in four heterogenous
      clinicopathological syndromes that share a common molecular target (tau).
