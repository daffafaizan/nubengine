      their disease.

      The fundamental key to the management of coagulopathy of cirrhotic patient is the knowledge
      that hepatic dysfunction results in impairment of both pro-hemostatic factors as
      anti-hemostatic factors in a disproportionate manner which can lead to a clinical picture of
      both bleeding and thrombosis.

      Routine tests of coagulation as prothrombin time (PT, INR) and activated partial
      thromboplastin time (APTT) although prolonged in cirrhotic patients cannot predict bleeding.

      Global viscoelastic test of whole blood (TEG / ROTEM) produce a dynamic composite image of
      the entire coagulation process and have the potential to provide clinically relevant
      information in patients with liver disease allowing rational use of blood products during
      liver transplantation.
