      anaesthesia. Perioperative pain management consists of paracetamol and naproxen
      preoperatively, opioids during surgery and local wound infiltration at the end of surgery
      with 10cc Bupivacaine 0.25%. Postoperative pain management consists of paracetamol,
      occasionally combined with Naproxen, and if necessary Piritramide 0.2 mg/kg i.m.

      Alternatively there is the possibility to perform breast surgery under a thoracic
      paravertebral block (PVB) with or without general anesthesia.

      A PVB according to Eason and Wyatt (1) can be performed preoperatively with insertion of an
      end-hole catheter T3-T4. With this technique we expect a better pain relief postoperatively.
