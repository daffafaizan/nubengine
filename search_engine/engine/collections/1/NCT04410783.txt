      mechanically ventilated ED patients at three academic medical centers. Patients in the before
      phase of the study will receive usual care after the initiation of mechanical ventilation.
      After 172 patients have been enrolled in the before phase, the investigators will begin
      educational initiatives to implement ED-based sedation protocols and order sets. The research
      team will educate providers on the importance of sedation protocols on patient outcome so
      that the existing protocols begin to be used effectively in the ED. This educational
      initiative will allow targeted sedation to be effectively used in the ED as well, allowing
      the intervention to be tested under real-world conditions. Participants in the after phase
      will also receive standard post-intubation care at the discretion of the treating team,
      though it will be after the educational initiative aimed at improving post-intubation
      sedation.

      In order to more effectively use sedation in the ED, the investigators will collect voluntary
      and anonymous surveys from ED nurses and physicians to assess the potential facilitators and
      barriers to adherence to guideline-recommended sedation.
