      injury that can be used both to quantify and predict injury severity inhalation injury in
      adults over 18 years of age. A model will be developed based on clinical, radiographic,
      bronchoscopic, and biochemical parameters that will predict the severity of inhalation injury
      with greater than 80% predictive accuracy
