      In the United States 30% of Firefighter deaths are the result of a myocardial infarction that
      occurred while on duty. Certain occupational tasks expose firefighters to a higher risk of
      myocardial infarction (high physical load, inhalation of products). There is no
      recommendation on how to assess cardiovascular risk in French firefighters. In the absence of
      consensus, the Loire Departmental Fire and Rescue Service has constructed a scale for
      collecting cardiovascular risk factors (expert working group) to identify firefighters at
      high cardiovascular risk. A maintenance visit (mandatory every two years until the age of 38
      and then once a year) is the best way to assess this cardiovascular risk, with a biological
      assessment and an electrocardiogram after the age of 40. If cardiovascular risk factors are
      present and the cardiovascular risk is high, the resting electrocardiogram should be
      supplemented by an exercise test. An exercise test can directly or indirectly quantify the
      endurance capacities of firefighters and reveal cardiac abnormalities sometimes absent at
      rest. Half of all myocardial infarctions occur without any prior symptomatology and remain
      totally asymptomatic, discovered during routine examinations. If the risk of myocardial
      infarction in activity is widely demonstrated to date for firefighters, and the realization
      of a stress test in those at high cardiovascular risk included in the practice habits, no
      study has evaluated the contributions and limits of the realization of a stress test in this
      specific population of firefighters at high cardiovascular risk for the prediction of
      cardiovascular events.
