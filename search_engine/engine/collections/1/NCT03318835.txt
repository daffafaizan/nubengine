      increased expression of MYC and BCL-2 and/or BCL-6 by immunohistochemistry. Patients with
      double-expressor lymphomas have a poor prognosis when treated with standard
      chemoimmunotherapy and have increased risk of progression and recurrence. The investigators
      conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of Thalidomide combined with R-CHOP(RT-CHOP) in
      newly diagnosed double-expressed, untreated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients (DLBCL).
      Thalidomide is a kind of glutamate derivatives, which can inhibit angiogenesis by blocking
      bFGF and VEGF, and it can also modulate the immune system by co-stimulating T cell
      proliferation. In addition, thalidomide can also inhibit the IKK activity and block the
      activation of NF-kB. In this open-label, randomized, phase III study, we are aiming to
      compare Thalidomide combined with R-CHOP(RT-CHOP) and R-CHOP in newly diagnosed
      double-expressor Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients (DLBCL), in order to find a potential
      promising way to treat this subtype of lymphoma.
