      will be recruited for the study. Baseline measurements will include usual pain over the past
      week, current pain, and worst pain experienced over the past week using the VAS pain scale.
      Hand function will be assessed using the Functional Index of Hand Arthropathies measure. The
      patients will be provided with a free neoprene hand orthosis (Hely and Weber CMC controller).
      They will be instructed to wear the device as needed for pain. After 1 month, the
      investigators will call the patient to assess pain, function, and satisfaction with the
      device using the Quebec User Evaluation of Assistive Technology Questionnaire.
