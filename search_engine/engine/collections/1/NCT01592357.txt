      clinical outcomes. Many older cardiac patients even if they initially participate do not
      maintain regular exercise for a number of reasons. As the population ages there is a need to
      evaluate other forms of exercise training that may be used alone or in conjunction with
      standard approaches. Tai Chi is a potentially beneficial exercise for older cardiac patients
      because it is low-intensity exercise especially suited for unfit and elderly patients. There
      has been little rigorous evaluation, especially in the cardiac populations, of Tai Chi.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the effects of Tai Chi compared to "sham
      exercise" in cardiac patients that have completed a program of cardiac rehabilitation. The
      investigators hope to show that six months of Tai Chi training compared to "sham exercise"
      (with all participants instructed to maintain their standard exercise program), will improve
      gait speed, exercise capacity, health related quality of life, cognitive function and
      balance.

      This is a single blind randomized controlled trial of 200 cardiac patients, great than or
      equal to 60 years of age, who have completed six months of cardiac rehabilitation at the
      Hamilton Health Science Cardiac Health and Rehabilitation Centre. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either the short and simple 8-forms Tai Chi routine or "sham exercise".
      The participants in the study will train for a period of six months.
