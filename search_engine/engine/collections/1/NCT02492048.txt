      harvesting system as an outpatient skin grafting system for selected patients versus
      inpatient skin graft harvest. This is multi-center prospective, longitudinal case series with
      comparison to historical controls. In this study, all subjects will receive the same
      treatment protocol regardless of institution. This will include routine wound photography.
      Ongoing healing process will be recorded and reviewed. The secondary objectives of this study
      are to establish an ideal donor site size, recipient site size and ideal patient population
      (especially high operative risk patients) that would benefit from the use of CelluTome™
      Epidermal Harvesting System.
