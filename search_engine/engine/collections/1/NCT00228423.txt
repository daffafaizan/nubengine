      surgery (CABG). The process of saphenous vein intimal hyperplasia is mediated by platelet
      aggregation and begins just days after surgical revascularization. Subsequently, areas of
      intimal hyperplasia in turn develop graft atherosclerotic disease and its sequelae.
      Clopidogrel improves outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic disease, and is effective at
      reducing intimal hyperplasia in animal models of thrombosis. Therefore, the goal of this
      study will be to evaluate the efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin therapy versus aspirin
      alone in the prevention of saphenous vein graft intimal hyperplasia following one year after
      CABG.

      Patients undergoing multi-vessel CABG and in whom at least two saphenous vein grafts will be
      used are eligible for the study. Patients will be randomized to receive daily clopidogrel 75
      mg or placebo, in addition to daily aspirin 162 mg, for the duration of one year starting as
      soon as postoperative bleeding has been ruled out on the day of surgery. At the end of one
      year, all patients will undergo coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound assessment
      of one saphenous vein graft as selected by randomization. The study will be powered to test
      the hypothesis that clopidogrel and aspirin will reduce vein graft intimal hyperplasia by 20%
      compared to aspirin alone at one year following bypass surgery.
