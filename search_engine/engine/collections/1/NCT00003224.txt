      I. Determine the safety of peptide 946 melanoma vaccine (peptide 946), peptide 946 combined
      with tetanus peptide melanoma vaccine, or peptide 946-tetanus peptide conjugate in patients
      with high risk melanoma.

      II. Determine the immunogenicity of peptide 946 melanoma vaccine (peptide 946), peptide 946
      combined with tetanus peptide melanoma vaccine, or peptide 946-tetanus peptide conjugate in
      patients with high risk melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 6 treatment
      arms: Arm I: Patients receive peptide 946 melanoma vaccine (peptide 946) emulsified with QS21
      subcutaneously (SQ). Arm II: Patients receive peptide 946 emulsified with Montanide ISA-51
      (ISA-51) SQ. Arm III: Patients receive peptide 946 combined with tetanus peptide melanoma
      vaccine (tetanus peptide) emulsified with QS21 SQ. Arm IV: Patients receive peptide 946
      combined with tetanus peptide emulsified with ISA-51 SQ. Arm V: Patients receive peptide
      946-tetanus peptide conjugate emulsified with QS21 SQ. Arm VI: Patients receive peptide
      946-tetanus peptide conjugate emulsified with ISA-51 SQ. Initially, 4 patients are randomized
      to Arm I and 4 patients are randomized to Arm II. If no dose limiting toxicities are observed
      in these patients, then additional patients are randomized to arms III-VI. Patients in each
      arm receive vaccine on day 0 and at months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients are followed at 6
      and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
