        -  Determine the confirmed complete and partial response rate in women with progressive
           stage IV adenocarcinoma of the breast treated with imatinib mesylate and capecitabine.

        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression
           with estrogen and progesterone receptor status, response, survival, and time to disease
           progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate* once daily on days 1-21 and oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *If the patient tolerates the starting dose of imatinib mesylate in course 1, the dose
      will be increased in subsequent courses.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-70 patients (25-45 patients with measurable disease and 25
      with non-measurable disease) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
