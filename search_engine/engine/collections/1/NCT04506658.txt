        -  To evaluate the effectiveness of the course treatment with the apparatus for continuous
           capacitive resistive monopolar electrotherapy with a radio frequency of 448 kHz in
           patients with organic erectile dysfunction.

        -  Assess the safety and tolerability of continuous capacitive resistive monopolar
           electrotherapy with a radio frequency of 448 kHz in patients with organic erectile
           dysfunction.

        -  To evaluate the duration of the effect of continuous capacitive resistive monopolar
           electrotherapy with a radio frequency of 448 kHz.
