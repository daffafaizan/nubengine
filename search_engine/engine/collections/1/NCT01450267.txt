    
      150 eligible patients will be enrolled on the basis of inclusion criteria. Patients will be
      divided in two groups: 1) Group 1 age between 6 and 18 years; 2) Group 2 older than 18 years.
      Patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment or placebo arm.Patients randomized in the
      GSH arm will receive a dosage of 10 mg/kg bid over a 12 months period.

      Clinical visits will take place at the beginning (visit 0, enrolment visit) and after one
      month (visit 1), three months (visit 2), six months (visit 3) nine months (visit 4), and
      twelve months (visit 5, end of treatments).

      Follow-up clinical visits will take place one month (visit 6), three months (visit 7), six
      months (visit 8) after the end of treatments.

      At visit 0, all eligible patients will inhale GSH (10 mg/Kg) and a dynamic spirometry will be
      performed before, 10 and 60 minutes after inhalation. Patients showing a decrease in FEV1
      greater than 15% after GSH inhalation will be excluded from the study.

      At visit 0 and at each following visits (visit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) will be performed
      and evaluated:

        -  Physical examination, measurement of vital signs, body temperature,BMI,and Spirometry;

        -  6 minute walking test;

        -  MMRC dyspnoea scale;

        -  Chronic cough impact questionnaire;

        -  Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life Questionnaire;

        -  Number of pulmonary exacerbations;

        -  Number and duration of hospital admissions for pulmonary exacerbations;

        -  Number, duration and route of administration of antibiotics;

        -  Blood sampling for haematological and biochemical analysis;

        -  Brushing of nasal epithelial cell, exhaled breath condensate with evaluation of markers
           of oxidative stress (H2O2), and blood sample for the measurement of markers of oxidative
           stress in serum will be performed in a subgroup of patients at visits 0, 3, and 5.
