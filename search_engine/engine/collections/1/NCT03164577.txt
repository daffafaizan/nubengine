      significant health issue in the United States as rates of AOD use among AI/ANs have
      continually been high since national data were collected among AI/ANs beginning in the
      1980's. In 2013, AI/ANs had the highest rate of AOD dependence and abuse compared with other
      racial groups.

      However, very few AOD abuse treatments utilizing traditional based healing, such as drumming,
      have undergone rigorous scientific research. Drum-Assisted Recovery Therapy for Native
      Americans (DARTNA) is a new AOD use intervention integrating AI/AN drumming, 12-step
      philosophy, and concepts focused on the Medicine Wheel. In a recently completed National
      Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)-funded study (R21AT005360), the PI
      completed key components of DARTNA development (stage 1a) including demonstrating feasibility
      and acceptability, establishing procedures for therapist adherence procedures, developing a
      treatment manual, and conducting a pretest among ten AI/AN men (n=5) and women (n=5) with
      promising preliminary findings.

      This study is focused on conducting a stage 1b feasibility pilot trial among 60 AI/AN men and
      women (for a final sample of 48 at follow-up) in an urban outpatient treatment setting to
      analyze the potential benefits of Drum-Assisted Recovery Therapy for Native Americans
      (DARTNA). Dr. Dickerson, Principal Investigator, is collaborating with Dr. Elizabeth D'Amico,
      co-Investigator, with Sacred Path Indigenous Wellness Center, a community-based organization
      providing consultative services for American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs).
