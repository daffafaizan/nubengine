      in patients with stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC can increase overall survival compared to exclusive
      radical chemoradiation treatment.

      The major handicap of all studies addressing the role of surgery in IIIA-N2 NSCLC is the
      difficulty of recruiting patients. Therefore, multicenter studies are necessary to confirm
      the hypothesis generated by the INT 0139.
