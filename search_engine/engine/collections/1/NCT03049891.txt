      cohort study to examine care outcomes among pediatric patients 0-14 years of age initiated on
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2004-2013 at a larger peri-urban health facility in the
      Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The study will be conducted at Dora Nginza Hospital
      (DNH). The outcomes measured in the study will include retention and mortality, as well as
      virologic suppression rates for children initiated on ART. In addition to reporting outcomes
      for all children with available data, the study will compare outcomes for children retained
      in care at DNH (where they initiated ART) to those children who were referred out after
      initiation for routine follow-up at community health clinics and primary care clinics ("down
      referred"). A second part of the study will trace pediatric patients in the community who
      have been lost to follow-up (LTF) to ascertain their outcomes after they left care at the
      health facility.
