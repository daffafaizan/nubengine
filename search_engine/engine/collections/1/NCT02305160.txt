      of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It has decreased the mortality
      among premature infants with RDS, determining changes in the children mortality rates among
      the developed countries. High cost, however, has been a major handicap for its wide use in
      developing and underdeveloped countries. Based on that, Butantan Institute (Sao Paulo,
      Brazil) has developed a new porcine pulmonary surfactant preparation at lower production
      cost. Initial animal studies showed similar improvement in lung mechanics and histopathologic
      findings to those observed with commercially available preparations.

      Comparison(s): The new surfactant developed and produced by Butantan Institute will be
      compared to the commercially available pulmonary surfactants in Brazil, regarding to the
      efficiency to maintain a good arterial oxygenation, low airway pressures after treatment,
      similar mortality rates, and similar rates of complications like bronchopulmonary dysplasia
      and pulmonary hemorrhage.
