      remains dismal in patients with relapsed tumor. The outlook for infants and young children is
      also poor, primarily because of the limited use of radiotherapy, although a recent report
      suggested that vigorous combination chemotherapy alone improved the survival of young
      children without macroscopic metastases at diagnosis. The prognosis is also not satisfactory
      when a large residual tumor remains after surgery or when leptomeningeal seeding is present
      at diagnosis. Given the above situation, we plan to explore the possible efficacy of
      high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in patients with high-risk embryonal
      tumors, relapsed brain tumors and in infants and young children with brain tumors.High-dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue has improved the survival of children with
      high-risk solid tumors. this treatment strategy is based on the hypothesis that a dose
      escalation might improve the survival of children with high-risk solid tumors.Many
      investigators demonstrated that further dose escalation using sequential high-dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue might result in additional improvements in the
      survival of patients with high-risk tumors. As embryonal brain tumors are a chemosensitive
      tumors, a strategy using high-dose chemotherapy might be effective in the treatment of
      high-risk embryonal brain tumors and relapsed brain tumors. In addition, it might defer or
      eliminate irradiation in infants and young children with brain tumors
