      SCLC will relapse after 1st line chemotherapy. For the chemo-resistant patients (eg those
      that have relapsed during or less than 3 months after 1st line chemotherapy the sole agent
      approved for 2nd line chemotherapy is topotecan. Docetaxel has shown some activity as 1st
      line treatment (ORR 17%). The low dose metronomic chemotherapy that is administered in short
      intervals has been shown in vitro an in vivo to have antiangiogenic effects. Bevacizumab is a
      well known anti-angiogenic agent. Recently, a phase III study of 1st line treatment in
      patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC showed that the addition of bevacizumab to a
      platinum-based regimen provided a survival benefit. A number of phase II studies are
      currently evaluating the addition of bevacizumab to 1st line chemotherapy in SCLC patients
      with promising results of safety and efficacy. Given the poor results of 2nd line
      chemotherapy in SCLC we feel that the evaluation of the combination of metronomic docetaxel
      and bevacizumab (2 anti-angiogenic agents) in such patients is justified. This study will
      evaluate the combination of metronomic docetaxel and bevacizumab as 2nd line treatment of
      SCLC.
