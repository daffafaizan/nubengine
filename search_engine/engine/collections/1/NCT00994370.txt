      standard of care. This procedure is known as Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), a
      procedure designed for the treatment of cancer in the liver. This includes cancer that has
      started in the liver as well as cancer that has spread to the liver. The purpose of the study
      is to collect blood samples to assess for "biological markers," or substances within the
      blood that may promote cancer growth by causing new blood vessels to form. This study will
      also use a new method of analyzing medical imaging (CT scan, PET scan) to try and better
      understand how cancer in the liver forms new blood vessels. SIRT is standard therapy and not
      part of this study. This study involves blood draws only.
