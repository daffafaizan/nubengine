      I. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of
      carfilzomib in patients with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL) / Small
      Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) and Prolymphocytic Leukemia (PLL).

      II. To evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of carfilzomib in relapsed or refractory
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL)/prolymphocytic leukemia
      (PLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate efficacy of carfilzomib therapy in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL)/prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) to justify
      future phase II studies.

      II. To determine the degree and duration of cellular proteosome inhibition induced by
      carfilzomib and relationship of this to pharmacodynamics, response and toxicity.

      III. To determine the pharmacokinetics (plasma and cellular) of carfilzomib and relationship
      of this to proteosome inhibition, pharmacodynamics, response, and toxicity.IV. To examine the
      effect of carfilzomib on pharmacodynamic parameters including cytokines, changes in
      downstream targets including NF-kappa B (p50/p65 binding; I-kappa B level, P-I-kappa B
      level,select target genes), p53 (p53 nuclear levels, p53 nuclear binding, and select target
      genes), ER stress proteins, and p73.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of carfilzomib.Patients receiving carfilzomib
      intra-venous(IV) over 30 minutes once daily, on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
