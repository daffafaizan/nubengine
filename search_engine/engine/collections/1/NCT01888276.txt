      gamblers and healthy volunteers compare to those of PD patients with and without
      hyper-dopaminergic behaviors collected during another study.

      2 groups of subjects will be recruited for the study: 20 compulsive gamblers and 20 healthy
      volunteers

      Each subject will realize twice each test during 2 sessions with one hour in between :

      During the session 1 :

        -  The test of words generation, which is to produce action verbs in response to 40 nouns,
           and noun in response to verbs.

        -  The test of Stroop that assesses selective attention

      During the session 2:

        -  The test of words generation, which is to produce action verbs in response to 40 nouns,
           and noun in response to verbs.

        -  The task of the casino (Iowa Gambling Test)

        -  The task of landing

        -  The test of Stroop

      We supposed that the performance of compulsive gamblers in words generation test will be
      higher than those of healthy volunteers, themselves superior to those of PD patients with a
      hyper-dopaminergic behavior, themselves superior to those of PD patient without
      hyper-dopaminergic behavior.
