      novel path to obtain a durable and long-lasting response in cancer patients. NK and NKT cells
      are expanded conventionally from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by addition of a variety
      of cytokines in vitro culture. Our previous studies demonstrated that the expansion of NK and
      NKT cells in a clinical usage scale from peripheral blood mononuclear cells is feasible.
      Those expanded NK and NKT cells exhibit antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo against a
      variety of tumor cells. The current study proposes a 3-course treatment of doses administered
      at one week intervals with monitoring at each administration plus 4 weeks after the last
      dose. The total study time (apheresis through last follow-up) is estimated at 3 year.
