      linear probe (10-12 MHz, with a footprint of 52 mm).

      For each participant, maximum voluntary IKFS was measured from the non-dominant side in the
      prone position with foot and ankle stayed outside of the bed. Maximum IKFS (20 limbs) was
      measured by an HHD (A Lafayette Model 01165) (Lafayette, IN) at 15Â° knee flexion in prone
      lying position
