      System for Platelets device performs safely and maintains adequate platelet performance in a
      clinical setting. This will be achieved by comparing the platelet corrected count increment
      measured 1 hour post transfusion and the incidence of serious adverse events in response to
      the infusion of platelet concentrates treated with the device (test product) versus untreated
      (reference product) in thrombocytopenic subjects requiring platelet transfusions. The
      performance, safety, and tolerability profile of the device will be further assessed by
      monitoring and comparing the incidence of discontinuations due to adverse events in relation
      to platelet transfusion up to 4 weeks after transfusion, including the incidence of
      transfusion associated infections, and the number and time between transfusions.
