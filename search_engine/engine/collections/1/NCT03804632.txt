      referred by health care providers in Malaysia, the control of asthma is still a critical
      challenge. According to National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011, the prevalence of asthma
      in Malaysia is at 6.3%. Based on self-rated health status, 5.5% of patients were reported to
      be in good health whereas 9.9% reported poor health status although medications such as
      inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta agonists (LABA) are widely available for
      effective asthma management. There is limited data to assess the level of asthma control at
      the Primary Care Setting in Malaysia which includes current clinical manifestation and future
      risk of exacerbation. Given the lack of data on Asthma control level, the awareness on the
      current disease control level will assist to properly characterise the patients based on GINA
      control level thus leading to appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The specific objective of
      the study is to assess, in real-life clinical practice in Malaysia, the level of GINA-defined
      asthma control and the potential risk factors for uncontrolled disease in asthma patients.
