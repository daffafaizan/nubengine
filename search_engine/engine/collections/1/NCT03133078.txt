      settings or include tasks that are difficult to standardize. One of the tests to fatigue the
      leg muscles is the leg extensor fatigue test using a unilateral weight machine. There are
      drawbacks to this testing including the clinician having access to the equipment, testing
      only fatigued a single muscle group, and it is less sport/task specific compared to jump
      testing. Our previous work has incorporated the use of a side hop task that is performed by
      hopping over two lines 40 cm apart for 30 seconds. While this does induce fatigue and
      decreases single leg forward hop performance the overall decrease was relatively small (<10
      cm). It is likely necessary to induce a greater amount of fatigue; thus further limiting
      single leg forward hop performance.
