      high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (86%) and has a positive predictive value of 68% and
      negative predictive value of 98% for single readings. In addition, the modified device was
      also able to accurately classify the majority of the anomalous non-AF rhythms, although the
      specificity was highly variable, dependent upon the rhythm. However sinus rhythm was detected
      with a specificity of 97%. However, we do not currently know if the device would demonstrate
      a similar sensitivity in detecting AF in patients with paroxysmal AF.

      Therefore, the present study will assess the sensitivity and specificity of the automated
      oscillometric device using a new AF algorithm among pacemaker patients with fast AF and
      atrial high-rate episodes and evaluate the effect of the specific rhythm abnormalities on the
      specificity for AF.
