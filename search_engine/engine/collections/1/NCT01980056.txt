      in subjects with INT-2 or high risk MDS who have failed prior hypomethylating agent based
      therapy. The study will utilize a standard 3+3 design to estimate the MTD [maximum tolerated
      dose] for vosaroxin administered to subjects with MDS. MTD will be defined as the highest
      dose level at which no more than 33% of the subjects observed at a given dose level
      experience a DLT [dose limiting toxicity]. Subjects will be assessed for safety and DLT in
      the first cycle of vosaroxin. Subjects will be enrolled into the study in cohorts of 3. Three
      eligible subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts at increasing dose levels until at
      least 1 DLT is observed during the first cycle of vosaroxin therapy. Subjects who receive
      both doses of vosaroxin will be evaluated for the MTD, DLTs, and safety profile during the
      first cycle of therapy. Once the MTD has been determined, an expanded evaluation of safety
      and hematologic response or improvement rate at this dose level will be conducted in
      additional subjects so that the total number of subjects exposed to this dose level is up to
      15 subjects, inclusive of those treated at this dose level in the dose-escalation phase. The
      exposure of additional subjects at the MTD will provide a better estimate of the toxicity
      rate. Subjects with a documented response of Complete Response, Partial Response, or
      hematologic improvement at the end of Cycle 2 may continue to receive vosaroxin for
      additional cycles at the discretion of the treating investigator and after discussion with
      the medical staff at Sunesis Pharmaceuticals. There will be a 30-day follow-up period
      following the termination of study drug treatment.
