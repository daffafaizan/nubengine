      LungBrella marker can be accurately implanted into a predetermined position in the lung
      assisted by JediVision software and successfully marked the pulmonary nodules which needs to
      undergo Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The study is expected to enroll 90 patients.
      Finally, the effectiveness and safety of the method will be evaluated. This method not only
      can complete pulmonary nodule localization in the operating room without occupying the
      resources of radiology department, but also can let patients receive pulmonary nodule
      location after anesthesia. Thereby the risks during transportation are avoided and the
      suffering of patients is reduced.
