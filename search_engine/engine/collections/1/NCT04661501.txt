      deemed appropriate for alloplastic breast reconstruction involving the use of an ADM with two
      stage tissue expander (TE) reconstruction. The ADMs used will be determined by random
      assignment to one of four available products being utilized within the study: AlloDerm,
      AlloMax, DermACELL and FlexHD. Each ADM product will comprise of an individual treatment arm.
      Participants undergoing bilateral reconstruction will have the same ADM used in each side.
      The four treatment arms will be compared to assess their impact on our primary outcome:
      proportion of clinically significant post-operative seroma requiring intervention. Analysis
      will be performed per surgeon to prevent post-operative outcomes from being confounded by the
      principle operator. The trial will initially be conducted as an internal pilot study. The
      study will initially target a study population of 40 patients for recruitment as a means to
      assess the feasibility of the study. In doing this, the pilot study will be able to establish
      the necessary protocol and administrative infrastructure that is needed to complete the trial
      in its entirety. This create a sample population for initial outcomes.
