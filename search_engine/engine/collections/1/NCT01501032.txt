      system)automated insulin management system using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and
      subcutaneous insulin pump infusion in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The study will
      include 3 inpatient admissions (12-24 hr), which will include overnight sleep, over-bolus
      meal, under-bolus meal and exercise. During the the visits, meal boluses will be
      semi-automated, with manual meal announcement by the physician/nurse, automated bolus
      recommendation by the system, and automated delivery of the bolus following confirmation of
      the recommendation. Between-meal insulin dosing will be fully automated. Bolus confirmation
      by the physician/nurse will be requested by the closed loop controller only when it
      determines that carbohydrates may be necessary to avoid hypoglycemia following the bolus.
