      have low testosterone levels. This can lead to 1) Low muscle mass; 2) more fat mass; 3)
      insulin resistance; 4) low sperm count and 5) increased inflammation (that increases the risk
      of heart disease). This project will study these consequences in detail and also the
      possibility of reversing them with treatment. Information from this project will be useful in
      planning of future studies that will evaluate the effect of treatment of low testosterone on
      mortality, heart disease and stroke.
