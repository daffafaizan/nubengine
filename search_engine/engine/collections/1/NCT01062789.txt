           accurate and reproducible breath-hold levels that correlate with internal target
           position in human volunteers. Hypothesis: The OBC system is as good as or better than
           the currently used IBC system with regard to accuracy and reproducibility of a reference
           breath-hold level.

        2. Specific Aim #2: To compare the use of 2 optical-based belts (wrapped around the chest
           and abdomen) versus 1 optical-based belt (wrapped around the chest or abdomen, depending
           on which region expands the most during respiration) with regard to accuracy and
           reproducibility of a pre-determined reference breath-hold level in a subset of patients
           (prone and/or obese). Hypothesis: The use of 2 optical-based belts allows increased
           accuracy and reproducibility of a pre-determined reference breath-hold level compared
           with the use of only one belt in this subset of patients.

        3. Specific Aim #3: To test the clinical feasibility of the new OBC system in patients
           undergoing CT-guided biopsy of the lung or upper abdomen where respiratory motion is a
           problem. Hypothesis: The OBC system is as good as or better than the currently used IBC
           system with regard to the accuracy and reproducibility of the reference breath-hold and
           ease of use.
