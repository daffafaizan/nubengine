      levels of drinking who are considering treatment for their alcohol use. These participants
      will be randomized to one of three conditions: a condition that applies active tACS during an
      MI session (MI+tACS), a condition that applies sham stimulation during an MI session
      (MI+sham), or a waitlist control condition (MI-only). Only participants the MI+tACS and
      MI+sham conditions will be included in the brain imaging portion of the study. One month
      after their intervention session, all participants will report their use of alcohol in the
      prior 30 days via an online assessment battery. This will allow us to test the effects of
      tACS on within-session client speech and outcomes.

      Participants will have magnetoencephalography (MEG) scans including rest and an alcohol cue
      task to measure the acute effects of brain stimulation. Participants will also have MRI scans
      including structure and rest. The Motivational Interviewing Skill Code (MISC 2.5) and the
      CASAA Application for Coding Treatment Interactions (CACTI) will be used to assess counselor
      and participant speech in the recorded MI sessions and to ensure that sessions comply with
      the principles of MI.
