      novel rehabilitation interventions, MT was found to be beneficial and comparatively low-cost.
      MT reduced motor impairment possibly in part of recruiting the premotor cortex or balancing
      the neural activation within the primary motor cortex toward the affected hemisphere.
      However, the benefits in certain aspects of outcomes are under debate. Another treatment, MG,
      can be used to normalize muscle tone, suppress muscle spasticity, enhance residual volitional
      activity of hand and arm, or even increasing walking speed. In addition, providing MG
      stimulation might result in plastic changes in the primary motor cortex, and induced a
      long-lasting modulated effect on motor cortical excitability. The possible mechanism of brain
      plasticity underlying MG is collective with the mechanism behind the MT. Adding MG to MT
      might augment the cortical reorganization. In sum, combining MT with MG may supplement the
      disadvantage or uncertain effects of MT and broaden the benefited outcomes.
