    
      The trial is conducted as an open multi-center phase III study, in a two-factorial study
      design and according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to a total of 4 study groups in a 1:1:1:1 assignment ratio. Several stratification
      criteria will be used in order to ensure balanced distribution of known risk factors.

      A total of 1.803 patients will be enrolled in 4 arms. Patients will either be treated with
      anastrozole (1mg daily for 3 years) or tamoxifen (20mg daily for 3 years), and will
      additionally receive either zoledronate (8mg q4 weeks for 3 years) or no zoledronate (arm A:
      Nolvadex alone; arm B: Nolvadex plus zoledronate; arm C: Arimidex alone; arm D: Arimidex plus
      zoledronate).

      Zoledronate will be administered by i.v. injection at a dose of 4 mg/month for the treatment
      period of 3 years. Five Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measurements will be performed in a
      subgroup of patients (404 patients, enrolled in 3 centres).
