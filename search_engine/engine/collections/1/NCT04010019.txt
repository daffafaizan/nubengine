      chronic pain. Currently, more than 100,000 individuals with chronic pain (ICPs) participate
      in Facebook groups, seeking support from others in similar situations. There are currently
      some online self-management programs for ICPs; however, most lack a peer support aspect, as
      they are individualized, self-directed, and focus on instructing patients in how to manage
      their pain. The goals of the proposed online pain support group are: 1) to provide
      peer-to-peer social support for individuals with chronic pain; and 2) to disseminate
      psychosocial pain management techniques using a social media platform. Screened participants
      will be assigned to one of two conditions: a Facebook group similar to the groups that are
      occurring naturally (control condition) or an enhanced Facebook group that is moderated by
      clinicians and offers psychosocial pain management techniques (experimental condition). Both
      conditions involve peer-to-peer healthcare and support, but the experimental group
      additionally includes components such as psychoeducation about pain neuroscience, emotional
      validation training, guided emotional disclosure, and activities to overcome emotional and
      behavioral avoidance. Findings from this study will offer important information about the
      impact of Facebook support groups on pain outcomes, and test whether psychosocial pain
      interventions can be disseminated using a social media platform.
