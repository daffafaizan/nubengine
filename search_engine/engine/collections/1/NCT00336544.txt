      Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance and newer, more pervasive pneumonia-causative
      pathogens contribute to this statistic. Currently available macrolide antibiotics for the
      treatment of community-acquired pneumonia are slowly losing effectiveness, resulting in the
      need to develop newer drugs to fight resistant infections. In this study, we compare the
      safety and efficacy of a common macrolide, clarithromycin, to a new ketolide, cethromycin.
