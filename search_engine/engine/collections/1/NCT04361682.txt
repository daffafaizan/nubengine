    
      Data from a prospective collected database of 317 consecutive PDs performed at the University
      Campus Bio-Medico di Roma during the years 2005-2019, have been retrospectively analyzed.
      Local Ethical Committee approved the study.

      Patients undergoing PD for periampullary neoplasms were included in the study. All patients
      underwent to PD with pancreaticojejunostomy reconstruction. Two surgical drains were always
      placed at the end of the surgery.

      Data regarding PIBs, as full blood count including white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocytes,
      neutrophils and platelets counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (d-NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and POD1-d.a.
      levels were collected and Positive Predictive Values (PPV) and Negative Predictive Values
      (NPV) were computed to investigate the probability to develop PF combining PIBs and drains
      amylase values.
