      Owing to its acute onset, rapid progress, and high mortality, it has become a hot clinical
      study spot and one of the toughest medical problems. Markers of inflammation, such as
      high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), are predictive of the severity of acute pancreatitis and may
      be useful in identifying patients with severe acute pancreatitis in the early phase after
      onset.

      Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are important biomarkers for the autoimmune disorder. ANA may
      contribute to the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and ANA positivity is associated with the
      presence of autoimmune pancreatitis. Cortisol is released into the blood due to stimulation
      of corticotrophin receptors in the adrenal cortex. Thus, serum cortisol can be measured.
      Although the association between serum levels of some inflammatory marker and acute
      pancreatitis revealed, the relationship between ANA, cortisol, hs-CRP and with the severity
      of acute pancreatic lesions have not evaluated yet.
