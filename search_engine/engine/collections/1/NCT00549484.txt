      problem in the neonatal period. Multiple etiologies are known to be associated with
      thrombocytopenia in neonates. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is known to be the central regulator of
      megakaryocyte and platelet production in adults and infants. However, the role of TPO in
      neonatal platelet regulation is not well understood. TPO levels have been shown to be higher
      in neonates with thrombocytopenia, with a decrease in TPO after resolution of the
      thrombocytopenia. The response of TPO levels in neonates after platelet transfusion has never
      been studied. In addition, the optimal volume of platelet transfusions has never been studied
      in neonates. This study will evaluate the response to 2 different volumes of platelet
      transfusion.

      We hypothesize that a decrease in plasma TPO levels will be seen following a platelet
      transfusion in a population of neonates with thrombocytopenia. We also hypothesize that a
      platelet transfusion of 15 mL/kg will result in a greater rise in platelet count than a
      transfusion pf 10 mL/kg of platelets.
