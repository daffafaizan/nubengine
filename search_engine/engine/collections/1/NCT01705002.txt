      of 0.25mg/min followed by gradual increase to a maximal rate of 2mg/min until completion of
      dosing, if absence of infusion reactions is established and in line with most updated version
      of IFU available for this study.

      For each subject, subsequent dosing will take place 28 days after the previous treatment,
      provided they are deemed fit to be dosed again.

      Patients will return to the study center on days 8, 15, 22 of cycle 1, and on day 15 of
      cycles 2 and 3, for monitoring assessments.

      All patients will be followed-up for survival and post-Promitil treatment. Patients who did
      not received 3 cycles of PROMITIL will be followed up only until PD.

      For the 3 weekly cohort Promitil will be administered at 3 week interval together with
      Bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg). Patients will return to the study center on days 8 and 15 of cycle
      1, and on day 15 of cycles 2 and 3, for monitoring assessments.
