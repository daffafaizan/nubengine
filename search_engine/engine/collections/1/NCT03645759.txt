      self-management program (I'm Whole) for Veterans with stroke and psychological distress
      (e.g., symptoms of anxiety and/or depression). This will be done using expert input from a
      multidisciplinary team of a clinical psychologist, nurse practitioner, exercise physiologist
      and social role functioning expert will be used to create the I'm Whole patient workbook and
      clinician manual.

      The second aim is to pilot the I'm Whole treatment by delivering the intervention to 5
      Veterans suffering from stroke and comorbid depression and/or anxiety symptoms. The
      feasibility (barriers and facilitators to completing I'm Whole and acceptability of the
      intervention) will be assessed through qualitative interviews posttreatment. Veterans'
      feedback about ways to improve I'm Whole will be analyzed and used to improve treatment.

      The third aim is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of I'm Whole on quality of
      life (primary outcome) physical functioning, physical activity, social role functioning,
      psychological distress, and satisfaction with I'm Whole (secondary outcomes). To test the
      feasibility and efficacy, a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 30 Veterans (15 I'm
      Whole and 15 education+usual care) with stroke and psychological distress will be conducted.
