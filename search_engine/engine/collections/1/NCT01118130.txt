    
      PURPOSE: To investigate whether genotypic differences can be identified between MS patients
      who develop liver injury compared to those who do not develop injury in response to
      beta-interferon therapy.

      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether elevated liver enzyme tests (ALT > 5 times the upper limit of
      normal) in response to beta-interferon therapy in MS patients is associated with genetic
      polymorphisms.

      METHOD OF RECRUITMENT:

      Patients will be identified through a clinic database and chart reviews. An introductory
      letter will be mailed to potential participants, inviting them to volunteer. A follow-up
      phone call will be made to determine interest and consent into study.

      PROCEDURES:

      Saliva will be collected for genetic analyses and a questionnaire will be administered
