    
      Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), the second most common primary liver cancer and
      constitutes 10% of primary liver malignancies.

      Current therapies for the treatment of ICC are ineffective and the role of liver
      transplantation is not well defined.

      This study reviews our experience with this tumor and looks for preoperative and pathologic
      indices that may help determine long term prognosis
