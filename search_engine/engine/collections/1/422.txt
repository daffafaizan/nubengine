2406. profound hypothermiathe aim of hypothermia is protection of vitalcerebral structures from hypoxiaduring aneurysm repair; profound hypothermiais also valuable in operating oncertain cardiac defects which cannot be repairedeven with whole body perfusion.since the time needed for aneurysm repair oftenexceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12minutes without circulation afforded by surfacehypothermia of 29  to 30  c., theauthors have investigated the drew (open-chest)technic, the closed-chest method,and isolated cerebral perfusion.  the drew technicconsists of substituting twopumps for the heart while the patient's lungs actas the oxygenator.  because of itsdisadvantages (the large amounts of blood neededand the morbidity due to intra-cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), aclosed-chest method was developed,using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenatorto provide the perfusion andextracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy.in cerebral perfusion, bloodis taken from one artery, pumped through a heatexchanger, and returned to anotherartery.  the authors describe anesthetic technics,offer comparisons of the threemethods, give instructions pertaining to the productionof hypothermia, and list theproblems encountered in the management of these cases.
