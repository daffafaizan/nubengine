      and red cell transfusion requirements associated with chemotherapy. This trial will study the
      combination of pegfilgrastim and darbepoetin alfa administered once per cycle of
      chemotherapy. Prior experience with growth factors in this setting provides historical data
      for comparison of safety and activity of these newer longer acting growth factors in reducing
      the incidence of febrile neutropenia requiring antibiotics and anemia requiring transfusions.
      The once dosing per cycle would simplify the patient management and would improve patient
      convenience and compliance.
