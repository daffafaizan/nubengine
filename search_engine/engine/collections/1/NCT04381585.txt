      Distraction osteogenesis relies on the body's ability to generate bone as two segments of
      bone are "distracted" apart. The osteotomies are created and the distraction device is
      placed. Typically, there is a latency phase of one week were a Ô¨Åbrovascular bridge is formed
      in the osteotomy site. This provides a template to generate new bone as the segments are
      distracted apart during the activation phase. Once the desired distraction has occurred, the
      device is left in place for a period of time. Once consolidation (typically 2 to 6 months)
      has occurred, the distraction device can be removed and implants can be placed. Chiapasco
      compared GBR to DO and found that both are equally effective in alveolar bone augmentation
      for implant placement and further stated that the long-term prognosis of vertical bone gain
      in DO is more predictable.
