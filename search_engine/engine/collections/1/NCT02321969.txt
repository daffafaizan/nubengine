      polypectomy have been enrolled since June 2010. They were then randomized into two groups as
      follows: supplementation group (0.9 g GTE per day for 12 months) or control group without GTE
      supplementation. Follow-up colonoscopy was conducted in 12 months. A structured 72-h recall
      at baseline and the 1-year follow-up was used to assess dietary factors, and to evaluate
      rectal mucosal proliferation index (RMPI) using known proliferation markers (Ki-67/PCNA), at
      least 2 random biopsies of rectal mucosa were taken. A sample size of 176 patients (88 per
      each group) was calculated to give the study 80% power to detect a difference, assuming a
      two-sided significance test at the 0.05 level.
