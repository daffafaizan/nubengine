      or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases.

      Dysmenorrhea is estimated to occur in 45% to 90% of women of reproductive age. It is a common
      cause of absenteeism and reduced quality of life in women.

      Treatment for dysmenorrhoea aims to relieve pain or symptoms either by affecting the
      physiological mechanisms behind menstrual pain (such as prostaglandin production) or by
      relieving symptoms.

      First line treatment for dysmenorrhoea is oral contraceptives, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol or aspirin. However these present side effects and some
      women have contraindications to these treatments. Consequently, itÂ´s necessary to study
      alternative treatments to drug treatments. Alternative treatments like heat, massage therapy,
      acupuncture also are used.

      The Kinesiotaping uses an adhesive elastic cotton tape color invented by Dr. Kase in the
      1970s. It is water resistant and retains its properties up to 5 days.

      It has the characteristic to cause elevation of the epidermis and thereby reduce the pressure
      on the mechanoreceptors below the dermis. This would have the effect of reducing nociceptive
      stimuli.
