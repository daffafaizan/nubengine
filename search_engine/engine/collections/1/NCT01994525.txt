    
      This is a Phase 1 open-labeled study. In addition to safety and tolerability of Plasmodium
      falciparum Sporozoites (PfRAS), this study is a comprehensive, systems biology-based effort
      to identify and validate biomarkers of protection with PfRAS immunization, comparing
      sterility protected to nonprotected study subjects. The goal of the trial design is to
      achieve approximately 50% sterile protection in order to facilitate the identification of
      biomarkers and correlates of protection.

      Following true-immunization or mock-immunization, study subjects and nonimmunized infectivity
      controls will receive a challenge via the bites of 5 An stephensi mosquitoes carrying
      infectious P falciparum sporozoites within a controlled clinical environment (controlled
      human malaria infection, CHMI) to determine the level of sterile protection.
