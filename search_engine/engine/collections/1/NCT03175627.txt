      restorations will be evaluated for their clinical performance. The study will investigate the
      survival and efficacy of a bulk-filled composite resin restorative material for a period of 2
      years. The bulk fill composite will be used according to indication and applied in approximal
      two- or three-surface restorations in permanent teeth.
