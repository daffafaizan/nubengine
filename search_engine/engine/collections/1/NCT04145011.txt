    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single-blind comparison study examining the
      outcomes of subjects with osteoarthritic knee pain undergoing a procedure to create a
      radiofrequency lesion of the genicular nerves with either Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation
      (CRFA) or Conventional (Standard) Radiofrequency Ablation (SRFA). Approximately 148
      participants from up to 15 sites will be enrolled into this study, with subjects undergoing
      either CRFA or SRFA in a 1:1 randomization scheme. Follow-up will be conducted for 24 months
      post-treatment, with the primary endpoint being completed at month 12. Pain, overall outcome,
      quality of life, pain medication use, and adverse events will be compared between the two
      treatment groups to determine success.
