      serious problem in cardiac surgery. Despite the recent developments with the use of new
      surgical techniques (mini-extracorporeal circulation, off pump surgery) the perioperative
      morbidity and mortality are relatively high. Therapeutic solutions with the use of inotropic
      drugs, as adrenergic agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, have offered important
      improvement to the hemodynamic status of these patients, but they have not considerably
      decreased mortality. These drugs owe their positive inotropic action to the increase of
      intracellular calcium and thereafter they improve the myocardial function.

      Levosimendan (SIMDAX) is a new calcium sensitizer which increases the myocardial
      contractility without particular promotion of the intracellular calcium accumulation.
      Contemporary experimental and clinical data demonstrated the effectiveness of this drug in
      the reduction of surgical mortality to the patients with low left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF) who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

      This is an original prospective randomized controlled study focused on the preoperative use
      of this drug in patients with impaired left ventricular function which is associated with a
      high operative risk (i.e. EuroSCORE). Perioperative myocardial stunning is particularly
      evident in this cohort of patients. Prophylactic administration of levosimendan the day
      before the operation could be translated in improved myocardial performance intraoperatively
      and during the early postoperative period.
