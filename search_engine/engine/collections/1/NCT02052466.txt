    
      The Specific Aims are:

        -  Determine the relationship between lateral glenoid offset and the development of
           scapular notching following reverse TSA

        -  Determine the ability of 3-D preoperative planning tools to define areas of scapular
           bony impingement on kinematic simulated shoulder range of motion that predict the
           development of scapular notching

        -  Compare the precision and accuracy of plain radiographs (2-D) versus CT (3-D) for
           measurement of scapular notching and postoperative implant position following reverse
           TSA (2-D versus 3-D)

        -  Determine the implant and anatomic factors that best correlate with clinical outcome
           following reverse TSA by retrospective analysis
