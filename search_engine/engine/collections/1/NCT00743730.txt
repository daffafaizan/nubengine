      management. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) allows patients to administer opioids by
      pushing a PCA button when needed. This eliminates the delay of waiting for a nurse to obtain
      and administer pain medication. PCA has been shown to be safe, effective, and superior to
      intramuscular, intermittent opioid dosing for pain management in children. Often, children
      with developmental delays cannot operate a PCA independently, can not self report their pain
      and are often given pain medication "as needed" through an IV. Parent/Nurse Controlled
      Analgesia (PNCA) allows parents and nurses to push the PCA button for patients who are not
      able to do so themselves. This way of giving pain medicine has not been thoroughly studied.
      Some healthcare professionals use PNCA for these children, others do not. This study is being
      done to compare PNCA & intermittent opioid administration. Participants will be randomized
      into one of the three study groups:

        1. Parent/Nurse controlled Analgesia (PNCA) with a continuous intravenous (IV)infusion of
           pain medicine.

        2. PNCA without continuous IV infusion of pain medicine.

        3. Pain medicine given through IV administered on an "as needed" basis(PRN) by the nurse.

      The Acute Pain Service will follow all three groups of patients throughout the study. This
      team specializes in the management of children's pain. Pain team is also available 24 hours a
      day, 7 days a week. The study will continue until child can tolerate pain medication in
      his/her stomach.

      Data will be collected regarding safety, efficacy, parent & Nurse satisfaction.
