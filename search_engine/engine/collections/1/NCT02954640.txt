    
      The Primary Immuno-Deficiencies (PID) are a set of rare diseases (estimated incidence of
      1/5000). Today, more than 320 PID are described, and for 301 of them, the genetic cause has
      been identified, which underlines the huge diversity of all PID.

      The genetic diagnosis of PID is very important for the comprehension of PID physiopathology,
      their treatment and the genetic patient information.

      The characterisation of the clinical and immunological phenotype of patients allowed to
      identify a known morbid gene in 30% of cases, but for other patients, the genetic cause
      remains unknown, due to, inter alia, the lack of efficient tools for genetic exploration.

      In this context, each year, around 600 French and foreign patients are explored at the Necker
      hospital CEDI (Center for Immuno-Deficiencies Explorations), for whom are identified, in 30%
      of cases, a known genetic cause.

      Their treatment and the diagnosis of these patients is slow, partially because these studies
      are dependants of research fundings. In addition, in the current practice, the investigators
      sometimes discover incidental findings via the non-targeted high throughput genetic analyzes.

      The aim of the gene-panel is to improve the diagnosis procedures of these known diseases, by
      generalizing a rapid and targeted method of sequencing, on 301 genes, known to be involved in
      PID.
