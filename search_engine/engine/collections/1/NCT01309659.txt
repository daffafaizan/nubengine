      increasing proportion of elderly adults underscores the population's attributable risk of
      anemia. As a potentially modifiable factor, an urgent need exists to delineate the impact of
      anemia correction in the elderly. The Partnership for Anemia: Clinical and Translational
      Trials in the Elderly (PACTTE) consortium has been created to focus on treatment strategies
      for anemia in elderly patients. The data presented in this protocol provides a compelling
      rationale to evaluate the impact of a well-tolerated IV iron preparation in community
      dwelling older anemic adults with intermediate serum ferritin values.

      Subjects will be 65 years or older adults with unexplained anemia and a serum ferritin
      between 20 and 200 ng/mL.

      Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either receive a 5 week course of treatment
      with intravenous iron immediately or to a waitlist control group who will receive treatment
      with intravenous iron following a 12 week observation period. Both groups will ultimately
      receive 200mg of intravenous iron sucrose weekly for 5 weeks to determine if this can lead to
      improvement in 6 Minute Walk Test results. The primary endpoint is change in 6 Minute Walk
      Test distances from baseline to 12 weeks. The procedures in this protocol will include the
      use of outcomes tools that have been selected for their ability to show improvement in
      quality of life in this patient population. Blood samples will also be collected for analysis
      both at the local lab (safety tests - eg hemoglobin or Hb) or at a central lab for research
      purposes.
