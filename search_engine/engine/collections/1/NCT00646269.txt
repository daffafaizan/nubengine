      of non pharmacological treatments on the progression rate of dementia: Three non
      pharmacological treatments are being studied: cognitive training therapy, reminiscence
      therapy and a "made-to-measure" program. Nearly 40 "Memory Clinics" are participating. 800
      patients suffering Alzheimer's Disease in the mild to moderate stage of the disease will be
      included. For each therapy, a standard intervention protocol has been defined. The main
      objective is to determine whether any or several of these non pharmacological treatments can
      delay the severe stage of dementia during a 2-year follow-up. The secondary outcomes assess
      cognitive abilities, functional abilities in activities of daily living, behavioural
      disturbance, apathy, quality of life, depression, caregiver burden and resource utilization
