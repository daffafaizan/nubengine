    
      This study is a randomized, evaluator-blind, single dose, three-arm, crossover, PK study, to
      be conducted in ~18 healthy, male and female, adult volunteers. PK will be studied at two
      dose strengths (Arm T1 and Arm T2). A currently marketed, non-labeled, Epinephrine CFC-MDI
      will be used as a Reference Control (Arm C).

        -  At the Screening Visit and the beginning of each Study Visit, each subject will be
           trained on the correct self-administration of MDI. The following three randomized
           treatments will be self-administered, at three Study Visits:

             -  Treatment T1: Ten (10) inhalations of the low dose E004(125 mcg/inhalation),
                totaling 1.25 mg of epinephrine;

             -  Treatment T2: Ten (10) inhalations of the high dose E004 (160 mcg/inhalation),
                totaling 1.60 mg of epinephrine;

             -  Treatment C: Ten (10) inhalations of Epinephrine CFC-MDI (220 mcg/inhalation,
                totaling 2.2 mg of epinephrine base equivalent).

        -  PK blood samples will be taken from a vein at scheduled time points.

        -  Safety parameters and adverse drug events, if any, will be monitored and documented at
           each study visit. An End-of-Study (EOS) safety evaluation will be conducted.
