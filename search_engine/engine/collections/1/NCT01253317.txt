      intensive 4-week pharmacokinetic study which will require 3 inpatient stays and 4 half-day
      outpatient visits. During in-patient sessions, an IV line will be placed for frequent blood
      samples. A lumbar puncture will be performed by a physician at the beginning and again at the
      end of the MAD. The primary goal of the MAD is to determine the safety of IGF-1 therapy for
      girls with RTT. As such, the investigators will ask that you monitor your child's blood sugar
      levels using a glucometer. At the end of the MAD, you will have the option of enrolling your
      daughter in an additional 20 weeks of open-label IGF-1 treatment.
