    
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study
      evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of a recombinant
      live-attenuated RSV vaccine, RSV LID ΔM2-2 1030s, in RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months
      of age.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV LID ΔM2-2 1030s
      vaccine or placebo (administered as nose drops) at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants could be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 14 (outside of RSV
      season) and remained on study until they completed the post-RSV season visit between April 1
      and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration
      was between 6 to 10 months, depending on when they enrolled in the study. Participants
      attended several study visits throughout the study, which included blood collection, nasal
      washes, and/or physical examinations. Participants' parents or guardians were contacted by
      study staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.
