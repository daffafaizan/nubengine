kidney cell proliferation after unilateral nephrectomy as relatedto age.the effect of unilateral nephrectomy on thenumber of cortical kidney cells undergoing dnasynthesis and mitosis was measured by tritiatedthymidine autoradiography in both weanling andadult rats.  among the unoperated control animals,the weanling rat group showed a base line labelingindex of 0.59%, and the adult animals, one of 0.11%.the response to unilateral nephrectomy resultedin a peak value of 3.6% in the weanling animals and1.2% in the adult animals, both occurring at 36 hr.mitotic indices were 0.056% in the weanling controlanimals and 0.0062% in the adults, with a peakof 0.30% and 0.088%, resp., at 36 hr. separatecounts of tubule and stromal cells in the cortexrevealed that the maximum increase in % labeled cellsoccurred later in the stromal cells than in thetubule cells; the stromal cells not reaching amaximum until 57 hr after nephrectomy.  the findingsindicate that, although the relative proliferativeactivity is much lower in adult animals, a similarresponse, qualitatively, is obtained in both groupsafter unilateral nephrectomy.
