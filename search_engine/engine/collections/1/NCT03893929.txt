      diagnosed prostate cancer in Hong Kong male population with more than 1600 new cases
      diagnosed per year. Even with widely used serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) diagnostic
      testing, more than 50% men with newly diagnosed PC are deemed to have highrisk disease. 1
      However, the current use of serum PSA as a diagnostic marker is unsatisfactory. Many patients
      has elevated serum PSA is actually due to other causes and also the level of serum PSA do not
      correlate with the staging and grading of prostate cancer. 2 Moreover, the current risk
      stratification system, based on PSA, clinical staging and Gleason score is of only limited
      value, as a significant proportion of patients with high-risk nonmetastatic PC have incurable
      disease due to locally advanced and/or occult metastasis, whilst others with indolent disease
      may never suffer morbidity or mortality from PC. Furthermore, high-risk (non-metastatic)
      prostate cancer (thus defined) exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity of response to current
      treatment protocols. Lastly, the characteristics of prostate cancer in our Chinese population
      might not be the same as those in Caucasian. 3,4 Several single biomarkers have been
      introduced in an attempt to address the clinical need for better prognostic tests in prostate
      cancer. For example, increased pre-operative PSA velocity (â‰¥2ng/ml/per year) has been
      associated with increased risk of recurrence after prostatectomy5 and mortality6, as have
      increased serum levels of Kallikrein-2 and [-2]-pro PSA.7-10 Pre-operative levels of prostate
      cancer gene 3 (PCA3) have been found to be elevated in tumours >0.5cc, 11 however these
      findings could not be confirmed in recent work.12 Therefore, in order to improve patient
      management and outcome, there is therefore an urgent need to improve our ability to identify
      newer markers and also validate some potential markers in our population.
