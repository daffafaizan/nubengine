      visit. They will also have an electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) which are
      often a required part of their annual visit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams of the
      heart, liver, and surrounding abdominal organs will be done on all participants using a
      method of scanning that involves a closer study of these organs (called R2* MRI).
