    
      The present study is a post-market, prospective, international, two-center, single arm study
      involving 60 patients with single, de novo non-complex coronary lesions.

      Enrolled patients will be asked to return for follow-up clinical evaluation at 1, 6, 12 and
      24 months. At 3 months there will be an additional follow-up by phone contact.

      Furthermore, the first 15 patients should undergo angiographic and OCT follow-up at two
      months. The remaining 45 patients should undergo angiographic and IVUS follow-up at 8 months.
