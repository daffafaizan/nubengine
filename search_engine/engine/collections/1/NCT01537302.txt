      System to provide OCT-assisted orientation while simultaneously crossing chronic total
      occlusions (CTOs) in femoropopliteal arteries. The Ocelot Catheter is a minimally invasive
      percutaneous device that is designed to traverse arterial occlusions through the use of
      spiral wedges contained in the distal tip of the device. The device is also equipped with an
      OCT (optical coherence tomography) imaging fiber that provides directional orientation and an
      intravascular view of the vessel wall and target lesion. The Ocelot Catheter is used in
      conjunction with standard endovascular devices and as an adjunct to fluoroscopic guidance.
