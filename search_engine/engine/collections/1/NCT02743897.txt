    
      Open-labelled pilot clinical trial of Zepatier (Grazoprevir + Elbasvir), Mavyret (Glecaprevir
      + Pibrentasvir), Epclusa (Sofosbuvir + Velpatasvir), or another appropriate DAA in at least
      75 HCV-negative subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving a kidney transplant from a
      HCV-positive donor. Eligible subjects will receive a kidney transplant from a deceased-donor,
      and then will receive DAA treatment after kidney transplantation when infection with HCV is
      confirmed in these kidney transplant recipients. Treatment will be complete after 12 weeks
      for most subjects.
