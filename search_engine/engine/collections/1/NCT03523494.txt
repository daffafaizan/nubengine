      edema, and this change progresses to reticulation pattern.

      Authors will develop a digital subtraction technique for the extraction of
      lympho-proliferative reticulation using the Housfield unit of non-reticulation structure
      (bones, muscles, tendons, vessels, nerves) in the axial image of CT.

      Based on the medical records, authors will develop an early diagnosing tool by checking the
      correlation of the values derived the new technique with circumference, multi-frequency
      bio-electric impedance analysis, ISO sub-stage, and lymphascintigraphy, and qualify the
      cut-off values showing high sensitivity and specificity through the receiver operating
      characteristics (ROC) curve analyses.
