    
      Pediatric subjects with indication for H.pylori testing, will be tested with both stool
      antigen as a reference standard and a urea breath test using the BreathID速 Hp and BreathID速
      Hp Lab Systems. The BreathID速 Hp system continuously measures breath via a nasal cannula and
      the BreathID速 Hp Lab System measures breath collection bags before and after ingestion of a
      solution with enriched carbon 13 urea and citric acid. The stool sample will be provided
      within a week of the breath tests and will be analyzed by a central laboratory. Safety and
      overall efficacy will be assessed.
