    
      Patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer who may or may not have had prior
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be eligible to enroll in this dose escalation study to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine to be delivered locally to the pancreatic
      tumors using the RenovoCath R120 catheter. Patients enrolled may receive up to 8
      catheterizations for delivering gemcitabine directly to the pancreatic tumors starting at a
      reduced dose( 1/4 of standard i.v. gemcitabine dose), then every two doses, increase the dose
      by 25% if there are no toxicities up to a maximum dose of 1000 mg/m2. There are four cycles,
      with two doses per cycle. Imaging studies will be conducted as well as assessment for
      standard, myelosuppresive and gastric toxicities will be assessed. Pain will also be measured
      throughout the study.
