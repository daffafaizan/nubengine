      cover the skin, keeping the skin moist. Keeping the skin moist will ease the local signs and
      symptoms, such as skin redness, scaling, and itching in patients with plaque psoriasis.
      Researchers are testing 074-6751 Lotion in clinical subjects with moderate plaque psoriasis
      to see if it can act as a protective barrier for the skin so the skin remains moist and heals
      over time.

      074-6751 Lotion is an investigational device. Eligible clinical subjects will be enrolled in
      the study and apply 074-6751 Lotion twice daily to all psoriasis plaques in the assigned
      Treatment Area for 28 days. Efficacy will be assessed in the Treatment Area by Investigator's
      Global Association (IGA) score, clinical signs of psoriasis, pruritus, and percent BSA
      affected. Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AEs).
