      systemic therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. It is metabolised to a pharmacologically
      active metabolite, SU012662, which is of equal potency to the parent compound. At a standard
      50mg daily dose, variability in plasma levels between patients is approximately ten-fold. In
      clinical trials, over 30% of patients require a dose reduction due to toxicity. However, some
      patients can tolerate up to 100mg without excessive toxicity. It is unknown if sunitinib
      clearance changes with time. Pre-clinical experiments observed tyrosine kinase inhibition at
      a plasma concentration of 50-100ng/ml.

      Design: This is a prospective non-randomized, Phase II clinical study. Decision to treat
      patients with single-agent sunitinib is pre-determined by treating specialists before
      entering this study. Toxicity and trough sunitinib/metabolite levels will be measured every
      six weeks during treatment.

      Aim: This study will prospectively examine the relationship between steady-state trough
      levels of sunitinib/metabolites and the time on treatment, in addition to changes in trough
      levels over time. Trough levels will also be correlated with other measures of efficacy and
      treatment-related toxicity. Furthermore, we aim to confirm that the putative target of
      50ng/ml correlates with toxicity and time on sunitinib.
