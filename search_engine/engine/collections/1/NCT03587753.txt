      visit volunteers will then undertake the first two 'study days'. There will be two study days
      on separate occasions that will be up to 3 weeks apart. Each study day will be approximately
      7 hours in duration. On each study day participants will be given a standardised 'test' meal
      that contains specially labelled fat molecules (stable-isotope tracer) and then repeated
      breath and blood samples will be taken over the course of the next 6 hours. The test meal
      consumed on each 'study day' will be identical in composition with only the specially
      labelled fat molecules being different (either unsaturated or saturated fat) and these will
      be given in a random order.
