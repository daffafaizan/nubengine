    
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase I/II dose-escalation clinical trial investigating
      the safety of zalutumumab in combination with radiotherapy. The safety of zalutumumab doses
      in combination with radiotherapy (RT) will be investigated using 3 patient cohorts in a
      dose-escalation / de-escalation design based on Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT). The
      dose-escalation starts at 8 mg/kg zalutumumab in combination with RT. Initially, three
      patients will be treated at a dose level and observed for DLTs. If none of the three patients
      experience a DLT, then the next cohort of three patients is treated at the next higher dose
      of zalutumumab. If one of three patients treated at a dose level experience a DLT, then three
      more patients are treated at the same dose level. If two or more of the three patients
      experience DLTs, then the next cohort of three patients should be treated at the next lower
      dose of zalutumumab, unless at least six patients on that dose have already been dosed.
      Furthermore, if 1 or fewer DLTs are observed among six patients at a given dose level, then
      the next cohort of three patients is treated at the next higher dose of zalutumumab. The
      maximum tolerated dose will be decided by Genmab based on the recommendations made by the
      IDMC on the basis of their review of the aggregated safety data.
