      floor disorders, both anatomically and functionally. The STARR procedure is a new approved
      procedure for patients with obstructive defecation, who have failed conservative therapy of
      medications and aggressive pelvic floor retraining. Most patients have also been screened for
      colonic transit problems. The traditional study for evaluating these patients was defecating
      proctograms. With the advent of the dynamic pelvic MRI, we are now beginning to understand
      the interaction of the entire pelvic structure in the complex act of defecation. This study
      is providing us a different view of the pelvic structures to better understand the
      pathophysiology of this disorder. The defecating proctogram, though informative in certain
      cases, lacks information outside the rectum. We wish to evaluate and compare our preoperative
      dynamic pelvic MRI with a six month dynamic pelvic MRI in 10 patients. We also will compare
      pre and post op obstructive defecation scores (ODS). We expect this small sample to direct us
      to a much more pointed evaluation of this disorder.
