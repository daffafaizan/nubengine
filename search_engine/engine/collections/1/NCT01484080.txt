      tolerability of oral (PO) BIBF 1120 administered with intravenous (IV) paclitaxel (80 mg/m2
      on days 1, 8 and 15 every 3 weeks) to patients with breast cancer (see Figure 1 for the study
      flow chart). BIBF 1120 will be administered twice daily PO for 21 consecutive days (Days 1 to
      21) in 3-week cycles (morning dose is skipped on the paclitaxel administration days)
