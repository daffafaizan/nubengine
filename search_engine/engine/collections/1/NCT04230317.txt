      Therefore, in this study, non-enhanced protocol CT was taken with low dose protocols with
      three different radiation doses to acquire raw data and drive VBN, and compared with the VBN
      result driven with raw data obtained with standard protocol. The primary endpoint of this
      study is to verify the consistency and accuracy of the VBN results driven by the raw data
      obtained with the low dose protocol CT.
