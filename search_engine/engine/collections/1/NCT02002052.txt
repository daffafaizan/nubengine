      of functional lung volumes. Two radiotherapy treatment plans will be generated prior to
      randomization: one standard plan using anatomical lung avoidance, and one functional lung
      avoidance plan. After approval of both plans, patients will be randomized, and both patients
      and physicians will be blinded to treatment allocation.
