        1. EHR-based decision support and performance feedback interventions will be more effective
           in improving hypertension control for South Asian patients than standard care;

        2. A combined EHR-CHW intervention will be more effective in improving hypertension control
           for South Asian patients compared to standard care and the EHR-based intervention

      Investigators hope to implement and assess the efficacy of CHW-led coaching through promotion
      of team-based care and use of culturally tailored education to improve hypertension control
      and mitigate risk factors related to CVD among South Asian patients with uncontrolled
      hypertension. Study findings can provide translatable and scalable models for other limited
      English proficient communities.
