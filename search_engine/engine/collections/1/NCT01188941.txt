    
      This project is a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to improve linkage to HIV
      and TB care for South Africans undergoing HIV testing. Subjects undergoing HIV testing will
      be enrolled at three sites in the greater Durban area. These sites comprise two
      hospital-affiliated outpatient departments and primary health clinics served by a mobile
      health van. Routine TB screening, regardless of signs or symptoms, will be offered to all
      HIV-infected participants. HIV-infected participants will be randomized to determine whether
      they will be assigned to a health system navigator or will receive the current standard of
      care in Durban. Block randomization will be stratified by site and gender, with blocks of
      varying length.

      The health system navigator will help patients identify barriers to entering care and devise
      solutions, optimize use of available resources, and serve as a trusted social supporter who
      is knowledgeable about the health care system but remains outside of it. The health system
      navigator will help subjects engage the HIV and TB care system through face-to-face contact,
      telephone conversations, and short messaging service SMS text reminders which are free for
      patients to receive. These phone contacts and SMS will follow a standardized protocol. We
      will evaluate the efficacy of the intervention, as measured by increased rates of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and, for those with TB co-infection, TB treatment
      completion. We will also evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.
