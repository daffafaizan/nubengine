      few years. Premature labor is a particularly stressful birth. It is recognized that the level
      of parental stress is greater at a premature birth compared to a term birth. The
      neuro-developmental consequences of premature birth are important. A possible association
      between prematurity and the onset of mental disorders such as hyperactivity, inattention,
      emotional problems, conduct disorders, autistic disorders and social difficulties has been
      shown. It has been shown that parental presence, holding and skin to skin during
      hospitalization would be beneficial for the child's motor development and psychological
      well-being by reducing the stress of the child.
