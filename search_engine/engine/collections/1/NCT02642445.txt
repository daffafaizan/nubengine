      method for the treatment of resistant hypertension, but renal sympathetic nerve are mainly
      located in the adventitia, and there is no report about renal sympathetic denervation from
      the renal adventitia. Primary aldosteronism is an important factor of secondary hypertension,
      tumor aldosterone in unilateral adrenal can increase the concentration of plasma aldosterone,
      in some patients blood pressure control is still not desirable after resection of tumor
      aldosterone.

      This study intends to conduct renal sympathetic denervation ablation（RDN）from the adventitia
      to observe its efficacy and safety on blood pressure of patients with primary aldosterone.
