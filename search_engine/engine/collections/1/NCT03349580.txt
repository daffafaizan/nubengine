      spine fusion. The patients were randomized in to two groups. The strength training group
      started rehabilitation 3 weeks after surgery. The patients exercised two times per week, over
      9 weeks. The focus was on muscle activation of lumbopelvic muscles stabilization. The control
      group followed a standard postoperative protocol, where no exercises were performed at the
      rehabilitation stage. The functional outcomes and the plain radiographs were evaluated after
      3 weeks and subsequently after 3 and 18 months after the surgery.
