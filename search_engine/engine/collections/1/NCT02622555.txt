      treatment of overactive bladder syndrome has been antimuscarinics as first-line
      pharmacotherapy. 60-70% of women report improvement with treatment but the therapy is limited
      by the adverse events, for example dry mouth, obstipation and urin retention. In Sweden,
      prescription of antimuscarinics has increased by 69% during the period of 2000-2007 which
      implies an increasing desire to seek treatment.

      Mirabegron is a b3-adrenoreceptor agonist which induces detrusor relaxation. Earlier studies
      have demonstrated similar efficacy when comparing Mirabegron with antimuscarinics but a
      significant reduction of adverse events. Clinical phase I-III trials have registered an
      increased pulse rate and effects on blood pressure in some patients. The aim of the present
      study is to survey cardiovascular adverse events with treatment with Mirabegron in the
      general population suffering from overactive bladder syndrome.
