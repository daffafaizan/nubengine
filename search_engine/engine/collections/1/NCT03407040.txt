    
      Background:

      -T cells are potentially curative for patients with metastatic cancer, but many patients with

      cancer have T cells that are terminally differentiated , a condition associated with

      treatment failure. We have observed that less differentiated T cells have a greater

      capacity to proliferate, persist and destroy large cancer deposits. Advances in

      regenerative medicine might allow the generation of rejuvenated T cells from induced

      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).

      Objectives:

      -To reprogram patient specimens into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and

      differentiate them into different types of somatic cells with the goal to produce cancer

      antigen-specific T cells.

      -To make stored specimens and/or data available to approved research laboratories and

      investigators.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients enrolled on the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) Cell

      Harvestin protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch Adoptive

      Cell Therapy Protocols).

      -Patients willing to be consented on this protocol

      Design:

        -  Cells and tissue obtained previously under protocol 03-C-2077

        -  Reprogramming of cells and tissue into iPSC lines

        -  Derivation of iPSC lines into T cells and iPSC progeny capable of supporting T cell

      differentiation

        -  Generation of an iPSC-derived thymic organoid

        -  Screening of tumor antigen specificity for regenerated T cells

        -  In vivo analysis of regenerated T cells
