    
      Trial 1: Evaluation of the abrasion behavior of the orthodontic surface sealants Pro Seal®,
      Opal®Seal, and Protecto®CaF2Nano. The quadrants of 20 participants will be randomly assigned
      to four study groups. Using a split mouth design three commonly used orthodontic surface
      sealants (Pro Seal®, Opal®Seal, and Protecto®CaF2Nano) and a bonding primer (Transbond XT)
      which is used as a control will be applied to the labial surfaces of the teeth of the
      respective quadrants. The thickness changes of the orthodontic surface sealants and the
      development of enamel demineralization will be monitored at the day of the application and
      five additional time points (t1= 1 month, t2= 3 months, t3= 6 months, t4=9 months, t5= 12
      months) using OCT.

      Trial 2: Evaluation of Adverse effects of orthodontic surface sealants. 15 quadrants of the
      trial group described above (Trial1) will be randomly selected and gingival crevicular fluid
      (GCF) will be sampled in the respective quadrants at the day of bracket bonding prior (t0)
      and at three additional time points (t1= 30 min, t2= 60 min, t3= 90 min) after the
      application of surface sealants or the bonding primer, respectively. Analysis will be
      performed using magnetic Luminex screening assays for IL-8 (Interleukin 8), and IL-10
      (Interleukin 10) and examined for inflammatory cytokines after the application of surface
      sealants.
