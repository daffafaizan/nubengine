      containing protein over expressed in cancer (KOC1) were identified as new targets of tumor
      associated antigens using cDNA microarray technologies combined with the expression profiles
      of normal and cancer tissues. Furthermore, anti-angiogenic therapy is now considered to be
      one of promising approaches for treating cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      1 (VEGFR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) are essential targets
      for tumor angiogenesis. Epitope peptides for these targets are able to induce cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes (CTL) restricted to HLA-A *2402 in vivo. On the other hand, chemotherapy (CDDP,
      5-FU) plus radiation therapy has been to be a standard treatment for unresectable advanced
      esophageal cancer. In this clinical trial, we evaluate the safety and immune responses of
      different doses of multiple peptides (URLC10, TTK, KOC1, VEGFR1, and VEGFR 2) emulsified with
      Montanide ISA 51 in combination with chemotherapy (CDDP, 5-FU) plus radiation therapy in
      treating patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer.
