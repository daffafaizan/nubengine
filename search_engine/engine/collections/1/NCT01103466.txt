      people with a stoma and cause one third of all visits to a stoma care nurse. Stoma effluent
      in contact with the peristomal skin (leakage) appears to predispose patients to peristomal
      skin problems. To protect the skin against effluent, the appliance used for collection of
      stoma effluent should completely cover the peristomal skin close to the stoma. Coloplast has
      developed a new base plate (SSH) to improve security and increase comfort by minimizing
      leakage (seeping under the base plate) risk and thereby also the leakage related peristomal
      skin problems.

      The purpose with this clinical study is to evaluate the effect of the new base plate on the
      degree of leakage under the base plate compared to two existing base plates on the market.

      The study is a randomised controlled cross-over intervention study, where all study
      participants will test all three test products (SSH, Conform 2 and Sensura). Each test period
      will last 14 days. If 4 changes of base plates is not obtained during the 14 days, the test
      period will be prolonged until 4 base plate changes is obtained. However, the max test period
      of one type of product is 21 days. The participants will visit the study investigator at
      study start and at every shift to a new type of test product. At these visits they will
      answer questions about the tested product, have a peristomal skin examination and be
      instructed in how to use the next test products for the next treatment period. Evaluation of
      leakage and handling will occur via questionnaires the participants take home.

      80 healthy participants with an ileostomy will be included in the study.
