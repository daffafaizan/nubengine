      the choledochotomy technique have not been adequately studied in the literature. Therefore,
      this study aimed to retrospectively analyze and compare the impact of choledochotomy
      techniques during LCBDE among patients with choledocholithiasis during the early and late
      postoperative periods.

      Methods: from March 2014 to February 2018, 85 patients with choledocholithiasis (52 females
      and 33 males) were enrolled in this study. These patients were treated by LCBDE using various
      choledochotomy techniques, including scalpel or scissor (28 patients, 33%) in group I, using
      diathermy hook (35 patients, 41%) in group II, or using an ultrasonic device (22 patients, 26
      %) in group III. Postoperative follow-up was done for assessment of all possible
      complications either early (within 3-6 months postoperatively), or late (2-6 years
      postoperatively) with meticulous observation and study of any relevant postoperative event.
