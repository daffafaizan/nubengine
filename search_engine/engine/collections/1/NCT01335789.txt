      individuals. Several studies indicate that hypothalamic neuropeptides may mediate behavioral
      response to stress. For example, preclinical and clinical investigations have indicated that
      the neuropeptide oxytocin exerts anxiolytic effects in stress paradigms. Several studies have
      indicated that oxytocin promotes trust, social bonding, and calmness; however, little is
      known about the potential anxiolytic affects of oxytocin in marijuana-dependent individuals.
      A preclinical study investigating the effects and mechanism of lithium on cannabinoid
      withdrawal in rats had positive findings, with increasing oxytocin levels hypothesized to
      moderate this effect (Cui et al, 2001). Given the anxiolytic nature of oxytocin, it may have
      a therapeutic role in ameliorating the negative affect commonly observed prior to relapse in
      marijuana-dependent individuals, as well as the anxiety associated with marijuana withdrawal.
      This pilot protocol will provide important preliminary data on the effect of oxytocin on
      stress in marijuana-dependent individuals.
