      is the most common disorder among patients seen at several centers specializing in diseases
      of the autonomic nervous system. It affects an estimated 500,000 people in the United States
      alone. POTS (excessive increase in heart rate [>30 min-1] on standing associated with
      orthostatic symptoms [including palpitation, chest pain syndrome, dyspnea on standing, mental
      clouding and difficulties with concentration], in the absence of orthostatic hypotension) can
      produce substantial disability among otherwise healthy people. Patients with POTS typically
      feel tired and run down. Many also report a myriad of symptoms that are hard to categorize,
      often involving fatigue. One study, from the Mayo Clinic, found that patients with POTS had a
      diminished quality of life when measured using a standard health status instrument (SF-36).

      In this pilot study, we will test the hypothesis that breathing through an inspiratory
      resistance device will improve orthostatic tolerance and reduce orthostatic tachycardia in
      patients with postural tachycardia syndrome.
