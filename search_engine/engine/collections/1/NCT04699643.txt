    
      This is a phase I/II, single arm, multicenter study of EVER4010001 combination with
      Pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumor patients. The primary endpoint of phase I will be
      Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in combined administration of EVER4010001 and
      Pembrolizumab. And the primary endpoint of phase II will be the ORR per RECIST v1.1 in all
      treated patients.

      Patients will be treated until progression requiring discontinuation of further treatment,
      unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death, whichever comes first. Tumor response and
      progression will be assessed using RECIST v1.1 and assessment by investigator at the trail
      center will be sufficient for decisions on continuation of treatment. All patients will visit
      the investigator at regular intervals for assessment of safety parameters and AEs.
