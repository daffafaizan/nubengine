    
      The proposed study is a single center study consisting of no more than 10 subjects who are
      undergoing scheduled esophagectomy for reasons unrelated to the study. Subjects will be
      divided into 2 Groups in a sequential fashion based on the time of enrollment (Subject 1 in
      Group1, Subject 2 in Group 2, Subject 3 in Group1, Subject 4 in Group 2, etc). Potential
      study subjects will be referred from clinical practice. After entry into the study with
      written informed consent, subjects will be scheduled for the EGD with cryospray ablation
      treatment 7 days prior to the expected esophagectomy date.

      All subjects will receive narcotic analgesics to control symptoms.

      Endpoints related to pathology will be assessed by two independent reviewers, one from the
      Institution's Department of Pathology, and one from an independent Pathology lab chosen by
      the sponsor. The reviewers will evaluate the pathology slides to assess maximal extent of
      depth of injury, side effects, and pathological changes associated with CSA. All reviewers
      will be blinded to the treatment conditions of the specimens.
