      vessel vasculitis and presence of autoantibodies, ANCA. It can be a life-threatening disease
      with renal/respiratory failure. Current standard therapy in induction remission for
      ANCA-associated vasculitis is combination of high-dose glucocorticoid and
      IV-cyclophosphamide. This regimen is effective (remission rate; 80-90%), but often cause
      various glucocorticoid-related side effects. Especially, infection is related to death. Thus
      a new regimen reducing glucocorticoid dose is required.
