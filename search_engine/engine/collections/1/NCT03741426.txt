    
      A Phase 2, multi-arm, multicentre, non-randomised, proof-of-mechanism (single and combination
      IMPs) trial using a Bayesian adaptive design.

      A multi-centre trial. 2 centres initially planned - this may be reduced or increased in order
      to recruit the required number of participants.

      Up to sixty (60) patients with surgically resectable renal cell cancer (Stage M0/M1). Up to
      twelve (12) participants will be registered for each of the single treatment arms and up to
      twenty (20) participants for the combination treatment arm(s) as per the Bayesian adaptive
      design.

      The trial duration consists of a 28 day screening period, a minimum of 2 weeks oral IMP
      (Olaparib and/or Cediranib) treatment or a single dose of durvalumab alone or in combination
      in the window-of-opportunity period prior to surgery (nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy)
      performed as standard of care.

      Participants will continue oral IMP treatment up until surgery (stopping when indicated for
      surgical safety reasons). As such treatment duration will be variable and an optional 21 day
      telephone assessment will take place for patients who remain on IMP. Patients will then be
      reviewed in the surgical follow-up clinic at 6 weeks and 3 months post-surgery as standard of
      care.

      For patients on monotherapy or combination Olaparib and Cediranib IMP, response will be
      measured using DCE-MRI (Ktrans), defining reduced tumour capillary permeability.

      For patients on monotherapy Durvalumab, or combination Olaparib and Durvalumab, response will
      be measured using CD8 positive T cells.

      Additional safety outcomes will be assessed, along with the tumour response and various
      biological measures that would indicate drug mechanistic response.
