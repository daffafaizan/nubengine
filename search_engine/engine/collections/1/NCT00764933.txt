    
      The trial is designed as a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial including an
      intervention and a control group. The control group receives an unspecific conversation. The
      intervention group receives a standardized information program with specific procedural,
      sensory and coping information about the ICU. Anxiety will be measured with a VAS during ICU
      stay and with a questionnaire after ICU discharge.
