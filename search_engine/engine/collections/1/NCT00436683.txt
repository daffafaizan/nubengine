      imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium
      deposits in the body, and blood-vessel disease.

      Current guidelines indicate that blood phosphorus levels should be maintained between 1.13 to
      1.78 mmol/L in patients who receive hemodialysis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the range of dosages which are tolerated by
      patients with hyperphosphatemia, undergoing haemodialysis.
