    
      ACP is a process that allows patients to communicate their wishes and preferences or medical
      care, when they are seriously ill, to their medical providers. The study investigators would
      like to assess whether a home-ACP video can improve patient-clinician communication about
      patients wishes for their medical care and lead to more patient-centered care.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial of a Home-ACP intervention among 500 adult patients
      with serious illness receiving medical care at home with the Clover Health House Calls
      Program. Study participants will be assigned to one of two groups. In one group, participants
      will continue to receive usual care with their home-based care team. In the second group,
      participants will continue to receive their usual care with their home-based care team and
      also view an ACP video that helps them understand ACP and provides education about ACP and
      hospice care.
