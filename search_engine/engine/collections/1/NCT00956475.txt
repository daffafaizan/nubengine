        -  To collect preliminary data to determine the extent to which there is impairment in
           quality of life of young adult survivors of hematologic malignancies.

        -  To identify the most common areas of concern in these survivors.

        -  To explore patterns of quality-of-life impairment associated with age, gender, and type
           of treatment (transplant vs non-transplant) in these survivors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assessed in a telephone interview using a brief demographic and
      clinical data form. Patients then undergo quality-of-life assessment by the Cancer
      Patient/Cancer Survivor Version questionnaire via telephone.
