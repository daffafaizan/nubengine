      Daytona Beach, Florida. Screening will be done within 35 days prior to the first dose of
      study drug (first Dosing Period). Each subject will complete two 10-day Dosing Periods, one
      using once daily dosing and the other twice daily dosing. The interval between the Dosing
      Periods will be 7 to 17 days. Patients will be randomly assigned to which regimen is
      administered the first Dosing Period. Safety laboratory tests will be performed at screening,
      and prior to and after each Dosing Period. End-of-Study (EOS) visit, the final study event,
      will be performed 14 to 21 days after the last dose of study drug.
