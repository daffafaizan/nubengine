      worldwide. Artificial sweetener consumption is considered safe and beneficial owing to their
      low caloric content. However, many emerging evidences showed artificial sweeteners may induce
      glucose intolerance. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of sucralose
      on glycemic response, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, incretin response, gut
      microbiota and food behavior in healthy subjects.
