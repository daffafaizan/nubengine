        -  Determine the response rate of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with
           monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF.

        -  Determine the additional measures of clinical efficacy of this drug, in terms of
           progression-free survival, overall survival, and time to treatment failure, in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody ABX-EGF IV over 1 hour weekly on weeks 1-8. Treatment
      repeats every 8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1
      year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-100 patients will be accrued for this study.
