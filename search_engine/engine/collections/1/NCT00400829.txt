      I. Evaluate the antitumor activity of E7389 (eribulin mesylate), in terms of objective
      response rate, in patients with recurrent or progressive stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      II. Evaluate the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      III. Evaluate the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed once monthly for at least 6 months
      and then periodically thereafter.
