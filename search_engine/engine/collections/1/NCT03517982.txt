      retrospective data collection for 12 de novo renal transplant patients. Ten patients were
      prospectively followed for 12 months after receiving MyOra® (mycophenolate mofetil) and two
      patients were previously on MyOra® (mycophenolate mofetil), thus their data was
      retrospectively collected from their hospital records and all relevant workup tests results.
      Outcomes include occurrence of AEs and proportion of patients with normal graft function.
