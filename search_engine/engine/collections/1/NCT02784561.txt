      relapsed/refractory acute leukemia. Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide (BuCy, Cytarabine, Busulfan,
      Cyclophosphamide) has been a classical conditioning regimen for allo-SCT. Substitution of
      Cyclophosphamide in the BuCy regimen with Fludarabine (BuF) resulted in reduced toxicity and
      similar efficacy. FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) is
      a chemotherapy regimen that has been proved to be effective for relapsed/refractory acute
      leukemia as salvage therapy. To reduce the relapse and improve the survival of those patients
      with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia who receive allo-SCT, the novel conditioning regimen
      consisting of Busulfan/FLAG was developed. The combination of Bu and FLAG without interval
      shortens the duration of conditioning and the pneutropenic period of the patient compared
      with successive administration of FLAG followed with BuF. In addition, regarding the
      established safety and efficacy of BuF and FLAG, it is reasonable to expect similar safety
      and enhanced antileukemic efficacy for Bu/FLAG compared with BuF. In this study, the safety
      and efficacy of this regimen in patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia undergoing
      allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation was investigated.
