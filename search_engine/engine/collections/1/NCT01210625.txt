      natural specific fermentable carbohydrates will maintain and promote gut health by changing
      the gut microbiota [prebiotic effect], by increasing "protective and growth promoting"
      factors such as butyrate, and enhancing intestinal barrier function. These health-promoting
      functions may prevent and treat a wide range of disorders associated with an abnormal
      microbiota (dysbiosis) and/or disrupted gut barrier function. Examples of disorders
      associated with dysbiosis and disrupted gut barrier (leaky gut) are allergic disorders,
      inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular disease, colon polyps and cancer, alcoholic liver
      disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH- the most common liver disease in the USA), and
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS, the most common GI illness in the US with a high loss of
      productivity and a high rate of utilization of health care resources).

      Nutrabiotix fiber is a prebiotic and is able to promote gut health through changes in the
      stool microbiota composition favoring saccharolytic bacteria like Bifidobacteria and
      diminishing proteolytic bacteria like Clostridia. This change in the intestinal microbiota
      composition should result in increases in the products of carbohydrate fermentation [SCFA]
      and decreases in the products of protein breakdown [indoles and phenols] in the stool. Also,
      the fiber is well tolerated and without side effects and is an effective fiber that increases
      stool bulk and regulates bowel movement.
