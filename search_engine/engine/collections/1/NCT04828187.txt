      using state of the art deep learning encoder-decoder neural architectures (DLED). The
      sequence of the segmented frames is post-processed to calculate the distance between the
      eyelids of each eye (palpebral fissure) and the corresponding iris diameter. Theses
      quantities are temporally filtered and their fraction is subject to adaptive thresholding to
      identify blinks and determine their type, independently for each eye. The two DLEDs were
      trained with manually segmented images and the post-process was parameterized using a
      4-minute video. After DLED training, the proposed system was tested on 8 different subjects,
      each one with a 4-10-minute video. Several metrics of blink detection and classification
      accuracy were calculated against the ground truth, which was generated by 3 independent
      experts, whose conflicts were resolved by a senior expert. Two independent blink
      identifications are assumed to be in agreement, if and only if there is sufficient temporal
      overlapping and the type of blink is the same between the DLED system and the ground truth.
