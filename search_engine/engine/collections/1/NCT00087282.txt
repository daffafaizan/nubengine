      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
           treated with irinotecan and flavopiridol.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes and flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
