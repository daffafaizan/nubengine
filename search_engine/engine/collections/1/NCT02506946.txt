    
      PCOS is a common condition that frequently presents in adolescence and young adulthood and is
      defined by the presence of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. Affected individuals
      are at increased risk of insulin resistance, NAFLD and dyslipidemia, which are features
      associated with the metabolic syndrome, a major public health concern. The associations
      between PCOS and both insulin resistance and dyslipidemia have been extensively described;
      however, its association with NAFLD has only recently been noted and superficially studied in
      adolescents and young adults. Additionally, it has not yet been fully elucidated why
      seemingly healthy nonobese adolescents with PCOS are predisposed to insulin resistance and
      its related complications. The susceptibility of certain PCOS patients to developing NAFLD is
      theorized to be due to the following potentiating factors: insulin resistance,
      hyperandrogenemia, and a genetic predisposition.
