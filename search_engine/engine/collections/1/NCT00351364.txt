      pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. We hypothesize that patients admitted to hospital
      with acute coronary syndromes will have markedly abnormal endothelial function as measured by
      peripheral vasomotor responses to forearm ischemia. Patients with myocardial infarction and
      unstable angina have markedly increased renal excretion of the cysteinyl leukotriene
      metabolite LTE4 as observed in patients with asthma. Observations that coronary vessel tone
      is negatively affected by leukotrienes C4,D4 and E4 which influences the atherosclerotic
      process in these arteries. Studies that isolated the epicardial coronary arteries and
      challenged the vessels with an LTC4 and LTD4 concentration showed that coronary arterial
      myocytes were found to produce cysteinyl leukotrienes which lead to responsive
      vasoconstriction. The continued stimulus of vasoconstriction over time leads to endothelial
      dysfunction and disruption of the endothelium integrity which then leads to stressors that
      encourage a disease state and atherosclerosis.In this study we will specifically assess
      peripheral endothelial function by measuring brachial artery diameter changes and PAT
      responses to temporary forearm ischemia in patients that have had an acute coronary event
      before and after receiving Montelukast. As well we will measure leukotriene assays both in
      blood and urine .
