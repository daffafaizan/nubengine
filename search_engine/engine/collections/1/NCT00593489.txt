      sustained glycemic control targeting an glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) < 7%. The guideline
      target however is not achieved in 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes in the Canadian family
      practice setting. Family physicians are not comfortable initiating and managing insulin for
      their patients the Diabetes in Canada Evaluation (DICE) study found that only 12% of the 2473
      patients audited were prescribed insulin; 6% insulin alone and 6% in combination. Harris et.
      al. found 20% of patients prescribed insulin, 15% insulin alone and 5% in combination. A
      strategy to increase physicians' knowledge, skill and comfort with insulin prescription is
      needed to better achieve glycemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes in Canada.

      Purpose - The purpose of AIM@GP is to increase family physicians clinical experience and
      comfort with insulin prescription and better achieve glycemic control for patients with type
      2 diabetes in Canada.

      Primary Objective - To determine the effectiveness of a Basal Insulin Initiation strategy on
      family physician insulin prescribing behaviour. The strategy, using a multifaceted behaviour
      facilitation approach, includes diabetes specialist consultation support, and community
      pharmacy insulin initiation support.

      Study Design - The study design is a stratified, parallel group, randomized control
      effectiveness study. All physicians will attend an insulin education workshop where they will
      receive a Diabetes Practice Profile and randomly allocated in a 1:1 manner into the
      intervention or control group.
