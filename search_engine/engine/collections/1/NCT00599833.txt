      Primary

        -  To evaluate the progression free survival rate in patients treated with cetuximab and
           radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate, toxicity of the combined regimen, and clinical benefit
           response in patients treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once weekly for 6-7 weeks. Patients
      also undergo concurrent 3-dimensional image-guided conformal radiotherapy in 28-30 fractions
      over approximately 5.5-6 weeks (2-4 hours after administration of cetuximab).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for up to 3 years.
