      PFMs were measured. The angle was measured using ImageJ application (1.50 n, National
      Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The long axes were formed by a line extending
      parallel to the center of the tooth in an occluso-cervical manner. The vertical angle was
      defined as (-) or (+) according to Sun et al.The angles between the occlusal lines of the
      PSMs and the PFMs were measured. The horizontal angle was defined as (-) or (+) according to
      Sun et al.

      Assessment of PSM Root Resorption The distal root resorption level of the PSM was determined
      using Barberia-Leache et al.'s classification2 as follows; Grade I: mild-limited resorption
      of the cementum or with minimum dentin penetration Grade II: moderate-resorption of the
      dentin without pulp exposition Grade III: severe-resorption of the distal root leading to
      pulp exposure Grade IV: very severe-resorption that affects the mesial root of the PSM.

      Assessment of PFM Mesialization Ratio The mesiodistal size of the PFM and the amount of
      mesialization were measured by the Image J application to evaluate the differences between
      reversible and irreversible ectopic eruption. The mesiodistal size was measured from the
      largest part of the crown, and the amount of mesialization was measured using the distance
      between the drawn tangent on the distal wall of the PSM and the mesial convexity of the PFM.
      Afterwards, the amount of mesialization was proportioned to the mesiodistal size of the PFM.
