      computerized cognitive training, 4 hours per week, plus aerobic exercise, 150 minutes per
      week. The Cognitive Training Intervention includes the same systematic cognitive training.
      The first 12 weeks involve neurocognitive training, using training exercises from Posit
      Science Brain HQ. The second 12 weeks involves social cognitive training, using the Posit
      Science SocialVille modules. Aerobic exercise occurs as two 45-minute sessions at the clinic
      and two 30-minute sessions at home weekly. Intensity of aerobic exercise is tailored to
      maintain an individualized target heart rate zone and is monitored by a heart rate recorder.
      A weekly one-hour Bridging Skills Group with other members of the treatment condition is
      designed to aid generalization of training to everyday life situations. The immediate target
      is brain-derived neurotrophic factor. The primary treatment outcomes are overall cognitive
      deficit level and global functioning level.
