    
      The purpose of this study is to prevent the spread of S. aureus, a dangerous bacterium,
      within the operating room and between patients undergoing surgery. The investigators will
      combine several approaches in a "bundle" of activities to achieve this goal. The bundle will
      include removal of bacterial pathogens from patient skin sites before surgery, from provider
      hands before, during, and after surgery, from environmental surfaces before and after
      terminal cleaning, and from the injection ports of patient intravenous catheters. The
      investigators will use a new surveillance system to evaluate how well the bundle, and each
      component of the bundle, is working. Surveillance will identify S. aureus transmission
      events, and movement of S. aureus between reservoirs before, during, and after surgery
      (perioperative). Surveillance will map transmission events to identify actionable steps to
      improve the bundle. An infection control perioperative team will act on the surveillance
      reports to proactively address the action items, and to measure the effect of their efforts
      for the treatment group. The investigators will compare perioperative S. aureus transmission
      events for patients receiving the bundle to perioperative S. aureus transmission events for
      patients receiving usual care.
