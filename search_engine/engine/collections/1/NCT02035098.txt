      availability of effective analgesic drugs, published guidelines and educational programs for
      Health Care Professionals the symptom is still under-diagnosed and its treatment is not
      appropriate in many patients.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Pac-IFicO programme in
      improving the quality of pain management in hospitalised cancer patients.

      This is a before-after cluster phase II study. After the before assessment, the Pac-IFicO
      programme will be implemented in ten medicine, oncology and respiratory disease hospital
      wards. The same assessment will be repeated after the completion of the intervention.

      The Pac-IFicO programme is a complex interventions with multiple components. It includes
      focus group with ward professionals for identifying possible local obstacles to optimal pain
      control, informative material for the patients, an educational programs performed through
      guides from the wards, and an organisational intervention to the ward.

      The primary end-point of the study is the proportion of cancer patients with severe pain.
      Secondary end-points include opioids administered in the wards, knowledge in pain management,
      quality of pain management. We plan to recruit about 500 cancer patients from ten hospital
      wards. This sample size should be sufficient, after appropriate statistical adjustments for
      clustering, to detect an absolute decrease in the proportion of cancer patients with severe
      pain (the primary end-point) from 20% to 9%.
