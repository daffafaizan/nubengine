      concerns about 1.35% of total population. It is characterized by an affective, emotional,
      social and professional instability and an important association with comorbidities like mood
      disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, addictive problems and suicide mortality.
      Hallucinations seem to be frequent in this personality disorder, but are not often taken in
      consideration by nursing staff because of massive need of attention of this kind of patient.
      At this moment there is no study of prevalence of this trouble in France in free environment.
      In the same way, there is no qualitative study about hallucinations. That is why we can do a
      lot of progress in this part of psychiatry.

      This research is an observational study of descriptive type. Patients will be recruited in
      the different services. In this study, patients will have to pass different questionnaires
      (DIB-R, DES II, THQ, PCL-S, PSAS, qualitative questionnaire) in order to compare the
      characteristics between BDL patients with and without hallucinations.

      For that, the investigator will meet each patient twice, after information by the medical
      staff of the service and consent. During the first meeting, the investigator will get the
      socio-demographic characteristics, the verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria,
      and the DIB-R questionnaire to know if the patient has really BPD and hallucinations or not.
      This is the same interview for all patients. During the second meeting, we will look for
      dissociative symptoms with DES II questionnaire, then traumatic symptoms and post-traumatic
      stress disorder with THQ and PCL-S. The PSAS and qualitative questionnaire will be used for
      BPD patients with hallucinations.
