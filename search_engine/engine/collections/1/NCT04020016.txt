    
      The study is a three-center study that will include both a single-ascending-dose (SAD)
      portion and a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) portion. The PK, safety, and tolerability of
      single ascending doses (SAD) of NAL ER (4 dose levels) will be evaluated in subjects with
      mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment.

      The purpose of the SAD will be to assess the safety and PK parameters of the given dose
      levels in hepatic impaired subjects relative to a selected healthy subject control population
      as part of the overall NAL ER development program. The SAD will also allow a better
      understanding of the safety, tolerability and expected steady state PK characteristics in
      mild and moderate hepatic impairment prior to undertaking safety and itch suppression
      efficacy studies in this patient population.

      In the MAD portion of this study, PK assessment will be carried out at steady state at each
      respective dose level at steady state during the titration over 13 days up to the highest
      planned therapeutic dose of 162 mg. It is well documented, in clinical practice and the
      opiate literature, that gradually increasing the dose of drug with a structured titration can
      reduce the frequency and severity of the expected AEs associated with initiation of therapy.
      The NAL ER clinical program utilizes this type of structured titration strategy, starting
      with once per day dosing at the 27 mg dose of NAL ER, and increasing the dose in a stepwise
      manner over the next 13 days to the target investigational dose of 162 mg twice daily.
      Pharmacokinetic steady state is reached
