      cost of acute and follow-up care in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Following a stroke,
      the restoration or improvement of walking is a high-ranking goal among patients, but only
      about half of the population is able to return to typical levels of community ambulation. The
      resultant decrease in independent mobility is strongly associated with a decline in quality
      of life. Gait instability is a common contributor to limited mobility through either an
      increased fall-risk or fear of falling, but current interventions to address post-stroke gait
      instability have had limited success. This project will conduct initial testing of a novel
      elastic force-field designed to improve post-stroke gait stability through targeted motor
      learning. The results of these experiments will serve as the basis for the development of
      novel gait rehabilitation techniques, which have the potential to increase the quality of
      life of thousands of Veterans and save millions of dollars.
