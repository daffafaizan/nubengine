      the first arm R-DA-EPOCH-21 the second arm R-BL-M-04 the third arm R-DA-EPOCH-21 + auto-SCT
      the fourth arm of R-BL-M-04 + auto-SCT Patients who achieved complete remission after 6
      cycles of R-DA-EPOCH-21 or 4 cycles of R-BL-M-04 immunochemotherapy continue to be under
      observation (1st and 2nd arms) or continue treatment with Rituximab +
      BCNU+Etoposid+Ara-C+Melphalan (R-BEAM) followed by auto-SCT (3rd and 4th arms).

      Patients who did not achieve complete remission with PET-CT data (4-5 Deauville points) are
      removed from the protocol and undergoing second-line therapy.
