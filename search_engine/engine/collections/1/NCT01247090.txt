    
      This pilot study originally enrolled a group of 12 subjects (4 subjects per arm) in order to
      demonstrate feasibility with the primary outcome measure, interdialytic 44-hour ambulatory
      systolic blood pressure. Data on the original subjects is complete and results are posted.

      The data from this study will be used to design and conduct additional study
      enrollment/extension (24 subjects) in order to make some initial statistical comparisons
      between groups, which will help establish greater confidence in our novel method for
      controlling blood pressure in dialysis patients.
