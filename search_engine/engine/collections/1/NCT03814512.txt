      and retention of adolescents with overweight/obesity, pre-diabetes, and inadequate sleep into
      a sleep extension intervention; 2) assess adherence of a sleep extension intervention to
      increase total sleep time in adolescents with overweight/obesity, pre-diabetes, and
      inadequate sleep; 3) determine estimates of mean and variability of potential intervention
      outcomes including metabolomic, body composition, and substrate oxidation. The investigators
      propose to deliver a 4-week sleep extension intervention to adolescents to evaluate
      feasibility of the protocol and obtain preliminary data on intra-individual changes in
      metabolic parameters induced by sleep extension.

      This proposal is the first step to demonstrate feasibility in delivering the intervention in
      a research setting, measure the effect of the intervention on changing sleep duration, and
      examine changes in obesity-related IR metabolites that would lead to improved IR in an
      adolescent population with pre-diabetes. The long-term goal is to disseminate an effective
      and feasible T2D prevention program that can be sustainably implemented in clinical weight
      management settings.
