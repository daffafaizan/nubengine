    
      One hundred and twenty five (125) subjects with a chronic DFU ranging in size from 0.5cm2 and
      25 cm2 will be randomized 1:1 to either NuShield® and SOC or SOC alone following the 14 day
      screening period. Following screening and randomization, subjects shall be seen weekly for up
      to 24 weeks. For subjects that heal prior to week 24, a healing confirmation visit shall
      occur two weeks later to confirm maintenance of complete wound closure.

      Subjects that are randomized into the SOC group whose DFU has not healed by week 12 may be
      crossed over to receive NuShield® and followed for an additional 12-14 weeks.
