      the viral replication of the HIV. Licensing for the children was obtained in June, 1992. The
      main problem of the didanosine is its poor bioavailability: although gastro-resistant
      capsules were developed, its bioavailability remains dependent on alimentation. Taking a meal
      1-2 hours before the administration of ddI leads to a reduction of 50% of its bioavailability
      as well for the child as for the adult. It is therefore recommended to take ddI during
      fasting period. This regimen in some cases can decrease therapeutic observance. A
      pharmacokinetic study of ddI will be conducted during the meal with 240 mg/m2/day during
      fasting period compare to 400 mg/m2/day during the meal. 26 patients, aged more than 6 years
      old, will be included and randomised in 2 groups. The first group will take the standard dose
      of ddI during 28 days during fasting period (phase A), then the high dose during the meal
      during 28 days (phase B). The second group will take first the phase B and secondly the phase
      A. Patients will be sequentially evaluated both after the first and the second period of
      treatment for pharmacokinetics and biological analysis.
