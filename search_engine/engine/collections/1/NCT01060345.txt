      cancer cells and animal models of breast cancer. Some studies have found that Asian women who
      drink many cups of green tea have lower rates of breast cancer. Green tea may have an effect
      on proliferative and inflammatory pathways. Women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have
      been found to have inflammation in the breast tissue surrounding DCIS lesions. Inflammatory
      pathways are being studied for a possible link to cancer. This study is designed to evaluate
      changes in biomarkers of proliferation, inflammation, and angiogenesis in response to green
      tea intake.
