    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral prednisone on days 0-10.
      Beginning on day 1, patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)
      transplantation receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily until leukapheresis is
      completed. Leukapheresis begins on approximately day 4 and continues until adequate CD34+
      PBSC are collected.

      PBSC are collected from syngeneic donors in a similar manner. Patients undergo total-body
      irradiation twice daily on days -5 and -4. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -3
      and -2 and anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 5. Patients undergo
      autologous or syngeneic PBSC transplantation on day 0. Following PBSC transplantation,
      patients receive oral prednisone on days 7-30 and G-CSF IV daily beginning on day 0 and
      continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed at 30, 80, and 90 days, monthly for 6 months, and then at 1 and 2
      years.
