      schizophrenia get older, resources for effective health care and social services may become
      more limited. There is a need to develop effective rehabilitation programs that are sensitive
      to the special needs of older persons with schizophrenia.

      Patients are randomly assigned to either 1 of 2 groups. The FAST group will involve 24
      sessions of group intervention designed to enhance daily functioning of older patients with
      schizophrenia. The placebo group will involve participation in a psychosocial support group
      for an equivalent amount of time. Treatment is followed by 6 monthly maintenance sessions.
      Patients will be assessed at 6, 12, and 18 months after the study start. Assessments include
      clinical and functional measures.
