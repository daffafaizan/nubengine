      risk for suicidal patients. While it might be hoped that hospitalization would address and
      resolve suicide risk, a review of international studies shows the risk of suicide is up to
      200 times higher among individuals recently discharged from hospitals vs. the general
      population. In response, some health care systems use an "urgent care" or "next-day
      appointment" (NDA) clinics for follow-up. NDAs serve as short-term crisis intervention at a
      specific appointment time and location so patients do not "fall through the cracks" in the
      care transition. Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) is a promising
      outpatient treatment framework that merits rigorous study as a potentially effective
      intervention to reduce short term suicidal risk in the transition from inpatient to
      outpatient treatment. Pilot data suggest that CAMS decreases suicidal ideation and
      psychological distress while increasing hope, patient satisfaction, and retention more than
      NDA treatment as usual (TAU). CAMS in the NDA clinic has the potential to fill three key
      targets highlighted in the 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention: (1) prevent
      suicidal behavior, (2) increase clinician confidence and willingness to see suicidal
      patients, and (3) are sufficiently feasible, trainable, adaptable, and flexible to scale up
      across health systems. To this end, this study has the following study aims: (1) Evaluate
      whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients results in less suicidal behavior than TAU, (2)
      Evaluate whether CAMS for suicidal NDA patients results in less suicidal ideation and intent
      as well as improved mental health markers than TAU, and (3) Evaluate whether CAMS for
      suicidal NDA patients is more satisfactory to patients than TAU.
