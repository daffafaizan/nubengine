      ED. Previous studies have shown that a comprehensive assessment by a geriatric specialist at
      the time of discharge from the ED along with extensive integration with home services and/or
      referral to community services can decrease functional decline and return visits to the ED as
      well as increase patient satisfaction, but this intervention is resource intensive requiring
      a geriatric discharge specialist to be available to the emergency department 24 hours a day/
      7 days a week. It is also known that in other patient populations telephone reminders to make
      follow up appointments can increase rate of follow up and that comprehension of discharge
      instructions is the primary barrier to compliance with discharge instructions. It has been
      shown that telephone follow-up interviews are feasible for geriatric patients discharged from
      the ED, and that many elderly patients discharged from the ED do not understand their
      discharge instructions or attend follow-up appointments. However, there are no published
      studies evaluating whether a follow up telephone call after discharge from the ED can improve
      patient compliance with the medical treatment plan including obtaining follow - up
      appointments and obtaining prescribed medications as well as using them appropriately. We
      seek to determine if we can increase compliance with medications and outpatient follow up
      with a phone call from a nurse provider 1-3 days after discharge.
