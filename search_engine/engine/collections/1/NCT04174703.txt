    
      The study consists of two phases. In phase one, participants will be randomly assigned to a
      two-week daily letter-writing intervention condition or a two-week control condition; phase
      one will occur two to four weeks prior to the start date of group ED treatment. Participants
      will complete a brief set of online questionnaires pre-, mid-, and post- two-week condition
      (i.e. baseline, after one week, and after two weeks).

      Following these two weeks of intervention/control condition, all participants will complete a
      25-week group treatment program as scheduled by the Eating Disorders Program. For phase two
      of the study, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires after 5 weeks, after 11
      weeks, and post-group treatment. Data that is routinely collected as part of patients'
      clinical care pre- and post-treatment (i.e. on the first day and last week of group
      treatment) will also be collected.
