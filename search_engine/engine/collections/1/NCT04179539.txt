      radionuclide, using the same carrier molecules as conventional V/Q imaging. Ventilation
      imaging can be performed with 68Ga-carbon nanoparticles using the same synthesis device as
      Technegas. Perfusion imaging can be performed with 68Ga-macroaggregated albumin
      (68Ga-MAA).Technical advantages of PET compared to SPECT include higher sensitivity, higher
      spatial and temporal resolution and superior quantitative capability. This offers the
      opportunity to improve the accuracy of V/Q imaging in patients with suspected PE, while
      decreasing the acquisition time.

      The aim is to perform a formal diagnostic accuracy study of V/Q PET/CT for PE, using CTPA as
      a reference standard.

      Patients with suspected acute PE undergo CTPA and V/Q PET/CT imaging within 24 hours.

      V/Q PET/CT images are not used for patients management.

      After completion of inclusion, central readings of scans will be conducted independently.
