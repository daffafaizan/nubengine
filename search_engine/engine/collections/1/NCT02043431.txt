    
      Patients between 18 and 80 years old with heart failure diagnosis of different etiologies and
      left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% in the past 2 years will be eligible for enrollment
      on the cohort. After consent, patients will be submitted to clinical baseline,
      echocardiographic, cardiography impedance and biochemical evaluation. Study data will be
      collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools. The follow up
      will take place every 6 months to assess cardiovascular outcomes (all-cause mortality,
      cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization for worsening heart failure and current medication
      use). Initial analytical strategy will focus on the establishment of the accuracy of
      electronic medical records extraction protocols for main predictor factors of morbidity and
      mortality in heart failure.
