      alcohol consumption. It appears to be significantly more effective in the group of heavy
      drinkers, while the mean alcohol consumption in studies conducted in cirrhotic patients is
      greater than 120 g/day.

      No data are available concerning nalmefene in alcohol-dependent patients with alcoholic
      cirrhosis. However, nalmefene could represent an attractive alternative to reduce heavy
      drinking in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, with potential improvement of liver function.
      No comparator is available for nalmefene, as all other molecules require abstinence prior to
      starting treatment.
