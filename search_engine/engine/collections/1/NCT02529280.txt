    
      This study features a cohort design with random assignment of 112 Latina breast cancer
      patients from the CTRC to an intervention (56) or usual care control group (56). The
      intervention group will receive three components: 1) a culturally sensitive and individually
      tailored, 30-minute computer-based BCCT educational video; 2) a bilingual, low literacy
      booklet that encourages patients to communicate with family and friends; and 3) support from
      a patient navigator. The usual care control group will receive usual care breast cancer
      clinical trial information materials offered by the CTRC to its eligible patients. The
      intervention is based in two proven theories - Stages of Change and Social Cognitive Theory -
      and will feature basic components of individual empowerment, including knowledge, attitudes,
      skills and self-efficacy beliefs and expectations.

      The study has three main phases: Phase 1: Formative Research; Phase 2: Intervention; and
      Phase 3: Evaluation.

      Purpose:

      To empower Latinas to make informed decisions about breast cancer clinical trials (BCCTs) by
      enhancing their knowledge, attitudes, skills and self-efficacy required to support discussion
      of CT as a treatment option with doctors and family members.

      Specific Objectives:

        1. Increase patient education and awareness, positive attitudes and self-efficacy to
           enhance their decision-making skills to participate in BCCTs.

        2. Provide decisional support to make an informed decision regarding participation in BCCTs
           by encouraging discussion of BCCTs as a treatment option with medical team, family and
           friends.

        3. Test the efficacy of a multi-communication intervention to assist Latina breast cancer
           patients in their decision making process regarding participation in BCCTs.
