      with mild Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) disease.

      In phase 1, firstly 3 patients with moderate COVID-19 disease will receive MTX-LDE IV 15mg
      each 7 days, up to 3 times, during hospitalization. After that, 9 patients with moderate
      COVID-19 disease will receive MTX-LDE IV 30mg each 7 days, up to 3 times, during
      hospitalization. Follow-up assessments will occur daily following randomization during in
      hospital treatment and 2 weeks after discharge for evaluation of the occurrence of adverse
      events.The purpose of this phase will be evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics.

      If no objection by data and safety monitoring board (DSMB), will be authorized to start the
      second phase.

      In phase 2, 88 patients with moderate COVID-19 disease will be randomized to receive MTX-LDE
      IV 30mg or placebo-LDE IV each 7 days, up to 3 times, during hospitalization. Follow-up
      assessments will occur daily following randomization during in hospital treatment and 2 weeks
      after discharge for evaluation of the occurrence of any trial endpoints or other adverse
      events.The primary endpoint of this phase will be reduction in duration of hospitalization
      stay between groups.

      Patients will undergo clinical and laboratory safety evaluations daily. An algorithm for drug
      suspension based on clinical and laboratory finding will be followed.
