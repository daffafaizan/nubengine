      and produces longer lasting post-stimulation effects in the cerebral cortex (4). It has been
      shown to be effective in inducing synaptic plasticity and has similar or better efficacy in
      treating depression compared to rTMS (4).Newer accelerated TBS (aTBS) protocols that condense
      stimulation sessions down to several days rather than weeks have shown similar response rates
      when compared to prolonged TBS protocols, also with similar tolerability and safety. In order
      to develop aTBS as an effective treatment for MDD, future research should focus on
      identification of reliable predictors for better outcome to TBS. The main objectives were: 1)
      To directly compare multiple different brain-based measures (neuroimaging and
      electrophysiology) to identify which has the most power in accurately predicting response to
      TBS compared to sham. 2) To track both short and long-term longitudinal electrophysiological
      (EEG) changes related to the therapeutic effects of TBS.
