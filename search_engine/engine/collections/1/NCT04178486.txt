      Free Will, the decision of action is taken before being acknowledged and is made following
      the reconstruction of previous experiences. It can be inhibited immediately (max 100ms) after
      awareness. The investigators want to intervene based on this model using hypnotic suggestions
      to change eating behaviors. Participants were found through social media announcements. Three
      groups receive one session of hypnosis with induction and different suggestions and the
      control group receives only induction. The eating behavior is measured through computer tasks
      in which participants have the option to choose pictures of food. The task is performed
      before, during and after hypnosis and the measurements of eating behavior are taken at all
      three times.
