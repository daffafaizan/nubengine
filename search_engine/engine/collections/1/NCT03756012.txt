    
      The proposed study is a prospective, multi-center, two-arm, randomized, crossover design to
      be conducted at up to 10 sites. The study will enroll up to 100 subjects in order to include
      up to 10 subjects in the study per site. Subjects selected to participate in the trial have
      back and/or leg pain, have been evaluated as a candidate for SCS and have agreed to undergo a
      temporary SCS trial using the AlgovitaÂ® system with percutaneous leads. Each subject will be
      followed during the trial period of approximately 7+/-2 days. The study will end when the
      last subject has completed the trial period and exited. The expected enrollment period for
      this study is approximately six months. After exit from the clinical study, subjects will
      continue to be followed by their physician per usual care. All device and procedure-related
      AEs will be collected and reported per the study protocol.
