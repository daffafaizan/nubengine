    
      The overall goal is to study the effectiveness of SPECT imaging Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non
      Hodgkin Lymphoma Using technetium-99m labeled 1-thio-D-glucose.

      Phase I of the study:

      Biodistribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non Hodgkin
      Lymphoma.

      The main objectives of the study:

        1. To evaluate the distribution of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose in normal tissues and tumors in
           patients with Lymphoma at different time intervals.

        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose based on the pharmacokinetic parameters
           of the drug after a single intravenous administration.

        3. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose after a
           single intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.

      Additional research tasks:

      1. To conduct a comparative analysis of the diagnostic information obtained in the
      visualization of Lymphoma by SPECT using 99mTc-1-thio-D-glucose with data obtained by CT
      and/or positron emission tomography (PET) and immunohistochemical (IHC) research of
      postoperative material.

      Methodology:

      Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of
      the labeled tracer.
