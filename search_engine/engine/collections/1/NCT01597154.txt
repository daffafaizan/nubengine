    
      Youth between the ages of 10-20 years living with type 2 diabetes and not currently on
      insulin therapy will be randomly assigned to either a lifestyle intervention group or a
      control group. The lifestyle intervention group will meet 2-3 times per week for 16 weeks to
      take part in healthy living education sessions involving physical activity, healthy cooking,
      healthy gardening and how to start and sustain a healthy lifestyle change. At the beginning
      and end of the 16 weeks the investigators will measure the participants' blood sugars,
      height, weight, cholesterol, triglycerides and liver enzymes. The investigators will also
      take a picture of their kidney, heart and blood vessels using ultrasound. Those youth
      assigned to the control group will receive the 16 week intervention following their 16 week
      control period.
