      infection for more than six months. Sustained viral replication and ongoing liver
      inflammation can eventually lead to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis or even hepatocellular
      carcinoma. Chronic viral hepatitis infection causes at least 80% of all liver cancers.

      Though chronic viral hepatitis is a major global health concern, there is still a lack of
      evidence in high quality about the management of chronic viral hepatitis and the long-term
      outcome of patients. The concept of real-world data and research has been officially
      introduced into China since 2010. Real-world evidence, based on real-world data, can help
      practitioners have better understanding of the characteristics of the patients with different
      treatment strategies.

      This study is aimed to collect and analyze clinical data of patients with chronic viral
      hepatitis in the real world, to investigate the long-term outcome of these patients and to
      optimize treatment options based on these data.
