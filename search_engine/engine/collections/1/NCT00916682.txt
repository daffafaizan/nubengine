      direct anatomic relation to the airways, provides a window on the composition and nature of
      the disease-specific response in the bronchial, sinus, and nasal airways. By examining
      proteins created in saliva, we hope to validate that saliva is an important diagnostic tool
      for for rapid analysis of respiratory status. We further propose that rapid salivary
      diagnostics will improve patient care in prevalent respiratory diseases with frequent health
      care utilization and high morbidity, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF).
