      over 48 weeks. Investigators will use a state-of-the-art accelerometer, to analyze minutes
      walking per day as the primary outcome, rather than vector magnitude units (VMU) or estimated
      steps per day. Investigators will explore potential factors influencing this important
      outcome, including baseline activity levels, demographic variables, changes in exercise
      capacity, psychological variables, and self-efficacy scores. Finally, Investigators will
      evaluate the rate of change (trajectory) in physical activity over approximately six months
      after pulmonary rehabilitation. There are limited data suggesting it takes time for the
      translation of increased exercise capacity into increased physical activity to occur.
