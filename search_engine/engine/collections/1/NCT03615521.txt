      is most suitable for physiotherapies working on knee osteoarthritis in clinics as well as
      demonstrating the efficacy of PNF which has been studied in the literature very few times.

      As a result of this study, the evidence value of the PNF technique will be determined in the
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation program of patients with knee osteoarthritis, and the
      efficacy of this technique, which is theoretically adopted, will be demonstrated
      scientifically. It will also determine the most ideal of the two PNF techniques to be applied
      in patients with knee osteoarthritis
