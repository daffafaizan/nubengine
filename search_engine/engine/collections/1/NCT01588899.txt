    
      This study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided
      High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) in ablating uterine tissue associated with
      symptomatic leiomyomas. The importance of this therapy is that it offers a non-invasive,
      uterine sparing procedure for the treatment of uterine fibroids in pre- and peri- menopausal
      women.

      MR-HIFU uses ultrasound to heat and thermally ablate fibroid tissue. The MRI system
      identifies the ultrasound path and monitors heat rise in the fibroid tissue. The goal of the
      study is to show treatment safety and effectiveness of the Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU device
      for uterine fibroids marketing approval in the Chinese market. MR-HIFU will be performed in
      100 patients who pass inclusion/exclusion criteria. Safety, quality of life, and imaging
      endpoints will be evaluated in all study patients at baseline and at 6 months post-treatment.
      All patients will be followed up for 12 months post-treatment for safety.
