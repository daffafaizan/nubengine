        1. Ibuprofen 400mg by mouth three times daily. Patients will also receive the standard
           opiate medication (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10mg/325mg) for the UCSF orthopaedic clinic
           for postoperative pain control.

        2. Placebo tablet by mouth three times daily. Patients will also received the standard
           opiate medication (hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10mg/325mg) for the UCSF orthopaedic clinic
           for postoperative pain control.

      Patients will be screened for the study at the preoperative clinic vist and randomized on the
      day of surgery if they meet our inclusion criteria.

      Postoperatively, they will be seen at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2
      years. Pill counting will be done at the 1 week postoperative visit. VAS pain scores will be
      assessed at every visit. Functional shoulder outcomes including shoulder range of motion and
      the American Shoulder and Elbow Society (ASES) survey will be completed at these visits as
      well. The SF-12 health and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) survey will be
      completed at the preoperative visit and final follow-up visit only. We will assess rotator
      cuff repair integrity with ultrasound study at 1 year after surgery
