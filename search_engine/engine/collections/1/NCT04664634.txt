      dysphagia in patients with PD. The first phase of the program involves engineering goals
      relating to increasing the battery life of this sensor to 48 hours between charges and
      reducing the overall form factor size. The second phase of the program is to conduct focus
      groups with PD patients to assess sensor usability, set up burden, and design feedback. The
      third phase of the study will assess the feasibility of the sensor to detect and cue
      swallowing in a small cohort of PD patients.
