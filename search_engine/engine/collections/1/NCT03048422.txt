      HIV-1-infected pregnant women: dolutegravir (DTG) plus emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide
      (FTC/TAF), DTG plus emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF), and
      efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (EFV/FTC/TDF). The study will also
      compare the safety of these regimens for their infants.

      At study entry, mothers will be randomly assigned to either receive DTG plus FTC/TAF (Arm 1),
      DTG plus FTC/TDF (Arm 2), or EFV/FTC/TDF (Arm 3) during pregnancy, through delivery, and for
      50 weeks postpartum.

      Mothers will complete study visits at study entry and every four weeks during pregnancy.
      Study visits for mothers and their infants will occur at delivery and at 6, 14, 26, 38, and
      50 weeks postpartum. Visits for mothers and infants will include physical examinations and
      blood collection. Select study visits may include breast milk collection from mothers who
      breast feed, hair and urine collection, ultrasound scans, pregnancy testing, contraception
      counseling, and, for a subset of participants, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans
      for mothers and their infants.
