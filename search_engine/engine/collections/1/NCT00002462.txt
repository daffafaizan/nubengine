      III/IV Hodgkin's disease randomly assigned to adjuvant involved-field radiotherapy vs. no
      adjuvant therapy following remission induction with MOPP/ABV (nitrogen
      mustard/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone/doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine). II. Evaluate
      the therapeutic efficacy of MOPP/ABV hybrid chemotherapy in advanced Hodgkin's disease. III.
      Evaluate the prognostic significance of an early response to MOPP/ABV in patients with
      advanced Hodgkin's disease.

      OUTLINE: Study randomized for adjuvant radiotherapy. All patients receive Induction
      chemotherapy on Regimen A, following which those in CR are randomized on Arms I and II.
      Regimen A: 7-Drug Combination Chemotherapy. MOPP/ABV Hybrid. Mechlorethamine, NM, NSC-762;
      Vincristine, VCR, NSC-67574; Procarbazine, PCB, NSC-77213; Prednisone, PRED, NSC-10023;
      Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Bleomycin, BLEO, NSC-125066; Vinblastine, VBL, NSC-49842. Arm
      I: Radiotherapy. Involved-field irradiation using megavoltage equipment. Arm II: No further
      therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 321 evaluable patients will be required; an annual accrual rate of 80
      patients is anticipated.
