      I. Determine the prostate-specific antigen response to SB-715992 in patients with
      hormone-refractory, androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer that failed prior
      taxane-based chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the median overall survival and median progression-free survival of patients
      treated with this drug.

      II. Determine the objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial
      response) in patients with measurable disease treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      IV. Determine, preliminarily, the pharmacokinetics and mechanism of activity of this drug in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.3-2.7
      months.
