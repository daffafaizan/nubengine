      people who have advanced hematological malignancies. This study determined the dose-limiting
      toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the
      body) for alisertib when given once or twice a day for 7 to 21 days.

      This open label study enrolled 58 patients. Participants were enrolled in one of 3 treatment
      groups:

        -  Part 1: Powder-in-Capsule (PIC) Dose Escalation (alisertib 25 mg PIC, orally twice daily
           [BID] on Day 1 [loading dose] and then alisertib 25 or 35 mg PIC once daily [QD] for 21
           days (D), or alisertib 35, 45, 65 or 90 mg PIC, orally, QD for 14D) in 28-day cycles

        -  Part 1: Enteric-coated Tablet (ECT) Dose Escalation (alisertib 40 mg, ECT, orally, QD
           for 14D or alisertib 30, 40 or 50 mg, orally, BID for 7D) in 28-day cycles

        -  Part 2: Participants with Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) (alisertib 50 mg ECT,
           orally, BID for 7D) in 21-day cycles

      All participants received treatment for 12 months or until their disease progressed or they
      experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity. This multi-center trial was conducted in
      the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 422 days. Participants
      made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 30 days after receiving their
      last dose of alisertib for a follow-up assessment.
