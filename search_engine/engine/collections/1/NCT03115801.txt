    
      The trial is open to patients who have metastatic renal cell carcinoma/urothelial (bladder)
      carcinoma with at least 2 measurable sites of disease. All eligible patients will be randomly
      assigned to immunotherapy(nivolumab/atezolizumab/pembrolizumab) versus immunotherapy
      (nivolumab/atezolizumab/pembrolizumab) plus radiotherapy, 10 Gy x3 (conformally or by
      IMRT/IGRT to maximally spare normal tissue), to one of their measurable lesions. For patients
      assigned to the immunotherapy plus radiotherapy arm, immunotherapy treatment starts with the
      first radiotherapy fraction. Nivolumab will be given every 2 weeks for patients with
      metastatic renal cell cancer and atezolizumab/pembrolizumab will be given every 3 weeks for
      patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Patients will be re-imaged at 9 week (year 1) or
      12 week (years 2-3) intervals and evaluated for response (defined as an objective response of
      measurable metastatic sites outside the radiation field). This response will be evaluated
      with CT scans in non-irradiated measurable metastatic sites per RECIST version 1.1. Patients
      will continue to receive their respective immunotherapies for up to three years or until
      disease progression or until a dose limiting toxicity is reached.
