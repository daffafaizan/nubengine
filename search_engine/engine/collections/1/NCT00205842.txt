      function and a slowing down of movement of contents of the intestines. Patients undergoing
      major abdominal surgery are at highest risk for developing POI, occurring in nearly all
      cases. Signs and symptoms of POI may include abdominal distention and bloating, persistent
      abdominal pain; nausea and/or vomiting; variable reduction of bowel sounds; delayed passage
      of or inability to pass flatus or stool; and inability to tolerate a solid diet. This study
      will test the ability of alvimopan 12 mg given 30 to 90 minutes before the scheduled start of
      surgery to hasten the recovery of GI function in patients having partial small or large bowel
      resections.
