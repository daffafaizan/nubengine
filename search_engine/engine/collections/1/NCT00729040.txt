    
      Stepping Up to Health with eCommunities is a study that takes what we already know about
      motivating sedentary, chronically ill people to walk, and begins to explore what it takes to
      keep people motivated to exercise over time: the ability to self-monitor behavior with
      accurate ecological momentary assessments.

      We have theorized that peer support, monitoring and competition are ways in which people can
      stay motivated to meet their walking goals; thus, we have built into this intervention online
      forums for participants to communicate with each other and garner support, as well as a pilot
      one-to-many competitive game based on the percent of an individual's goal met.

      Our research question is whether online community participation can increase adherence to an
      Internet-mediated walking program, which consists of an uploading pedometer, and going to a
      website to receive graphical and textual feedback as to whether participants are meeting
      gradually increasing walking goals. Three hundred participants will spend four months in this
      randomized, controlled trial to compare the intervention alone to the intervention plus
      online community support.
