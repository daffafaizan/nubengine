      The two types of blood components are obtained from whole blood, pre-storage leukoreduced and
      suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM). One method of preparation consists of
      the whole blood leukoreduction with subsequent plasma removal. The other method first
      separates plasma, buffy coat, and RBCs, and then the RBCs are leukoreduced. The two methods
      mainly differ in the final haemoglobin (Hb) content: the Hb level is lower (-13%,
      approximately) in the second method that also shows the advantage to produce platelets from
      the buffy coat. A PRBCs unit is not as strictly defined as a therapeutic medication dose
      (pill or vial): individual PRBCs units may substantially differ in their Hb content, much
      more than the average difference between the two types of preparations. The aim of this study
      is to document the extent of the average difference between the two types of preparations,
      and its impacts on the transfusion indices of ÃŸ-Thalassaemia transfusion-dependent patients.
      All patients will receive each blood component for a period of 6 months (crossover design),
      for a total of 12 months of transfusion treatment per patient.
