    
      The overall goal of this study is to test whether providing in-person assistance in enrolling
      in private health insurance or Medicaid for the first time, changing to a different insurance
      plan, or understanding how to use current insurance policies following HIV testing will (1)
      increase the proportion of participants who obtain health insurance; (2) result in better
      health outcomes among participants; (3) improve the linkage and retention rates of
      participants, especially those diagnosed with HIV; and (4) increase linkage and retention
      rates sufficiently to justify the cost of implementing the intervention (cost-benefit
      analysis).
