      correct and relevant diagnoses are recognized or excluded, any therapy provided is
      appropriate, and all steps that minimize risk have been taken.

      But quality also refers to pre-procedure and post-procedure quality issues such as
      information, booking, choice, privacy, dignity, aftercare and satisfaction of patients. All
      those issues can negatively affect the willingness of patients to perform the test and the
      possibility of preparing adequately. And what is more, it can diminish the quality of the own
      exploration, the satisfaction of the patients and their adherence to programs of endoscopic
      follow-up.

      An action on these colonoscopy non-technical issues with a telephone educational intervention
      performed by the gastrointestinal endoscopy nurse can positively improve all (pre, intra and
      post-procedure) colonoscopy quality indicators.
