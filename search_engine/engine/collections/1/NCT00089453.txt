      using combination chemo- and immunotherapy comprising sequentially: 1) lymphoid suppressive
      conditioning to avoid rejection of the donor NK cells, 2) adoptive transfer of purified
      KIR-ligand mismatched Natural Killer cells from a haplo-identical donor, and 3) autografting
      two weeks after infusion of NK cells to ensure autologous reconstitution.
