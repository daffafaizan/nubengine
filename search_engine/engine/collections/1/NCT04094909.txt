      NSCLC. Squamous NSCLC receives rh-endostatin at a dose of 15mg/m2 for 5 days and 200 mg of
      pembrolizumab at day 1 in each cycle, repeating every 3 weeks till to PD or unacceptable
      toxicities. all the patients with squamous NSCLC also receive carboplatin (5U/AUC) or
      cisplatin ( 75mg/m2) and [nab]-paclitaxel (100mg/m2) for the first 4 cycles. For non-squamous
      NSCLC, rh-endostatin at a dose of 15mg/m2 for 5 days, 200 mg of pembrolizumab at day 1 and
      pemetrexed (500mg/m2,d1) are given in each cycle, repeating every 3 weeks till to PD or
      unacceptable toxicities. Non-squamous NSCLC also receive carboplatin (5U/AUC) or cisplatin (
      75mg/m2) and pemetrexed (500mg/m2,d1) for the first 4 cycles. The radiographic evaluation
      will be taken place at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks after treatment and every 9 weeks thereafter
      based on Recist 1.1, till to PD or unacceptable toxicities. After that, survival follow-up is
      going on every 3 months till to the death. The safety evaluation is based on CTCAE 4.0. In
      addition to the above, the examination of ct DNA and PD-L1 for tumor sample and peripheral
      blood is taken at the baseline, and also examination of ct DNA and PD-L1 for peripheral blood
      at week 6 and 12 of treatment and at the time of PD.
