      bioavailability of a single dose of APL-130277 sublingual thin film with subcutaneous (s.c.)
      APO-go® and s.c. APOKYN® in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). The dose of APOKYN® (≤ 5
      mg) will be based on the subjects' current prescribed dose. The study is designed as an
      open-label, randomized, three-way crossover. Subjects will receive all three treatment arms
      with a minimum 1-day wash-out between each visit (excluding the screening visit) and will be
      randomly assigned to one of the six sequences
