      successful treatment, children remain immunodeficient and usually die by age 2 years. In
      infants with complete DiGeorge anomaly and no T cells, cultured thymus tissue implantation
      (CTTI) without immunosuppression resulted in diverse T cell development and good T cell
      function. Some infants with no thymus have some T cells that presumably developed
      extrathymically; these T cells can reject a thymus graft.

      The purpose of this study is to tailor immunosuppression use for complete DiGeorge anomaly
      subjects who have some T cells and different T cell function levels. This protocol includes
      tailored immunosuppression regimens to allow subjects with different T cell function levels
      to be suppressed adequately.

      Patients with complete DiGeorge often have hypoparathyroidism, a life threatening condition.
      Successful CTTI does not result in improvement of the hypoparathyroidism. The patients must
      go to the clinic for frequent calcium levels and to the hospital for calcium infusions. These
      infants are at risk for seizures from low calcium. This study had a parental parathyroid
      transplant arm for subjects with hypoparathyroidism who require calcium replacement.

      Whether or not a subject was enrolled in the parathyroid arm, the immunosuppression regimen
      the subject received was dependent on the immune findings as stated in the clinical protocol.
