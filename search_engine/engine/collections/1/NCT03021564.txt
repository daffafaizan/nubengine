      cardiopulmonary resuscitation technique (external cardiac massage and / or electric shock).
      They account for about 0.5 to 5% of admissions to intensive care units. Even if they benefit
      from a technical environment conducive to prompt diagnosis and rapid management, Resuscitated
      patients suffer from chronic diseases and organ failure (s) that darken the prognosis.
      Etiologies of unexpected cardiac arrest in ICU are rarely described in the literature. Their
      specificity comes from the fact that they can be related to patient's medical
      characteristics, but also to deleterious effects of supportive techniques in place at the
      time of circulatory arrest (respiratory assistance, vasopressor drugs, extracorporeal
      circulation ...). These same techniques may also reduce the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (cardiorespiratory interactions of respiratory assistance, pro-arrhythmogenic
      effect of vasopressor drugs, haemodynamic repercussion of extracorporeal circulation).
      Although cardiac arrests have been published extensively out of or in-hospital, there are few
      studies specifically concerning unexpected cardiac arrest in ICU (none in France). The
      prognosis is different: after an unexpected cardiac arrest in ICU, 50% of the patients
      recover a spontaneous cardiac activity but only 15% leave alive from the hospital (3 to 4%
      with a good functional autonomy). A prospective description of risk factors, circumstances
      and consequences in the medium term would identify (and prevent) risky situations and
      identify, among those at risk for unexpected cardiac arrest, those for whom a cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation is justified.
