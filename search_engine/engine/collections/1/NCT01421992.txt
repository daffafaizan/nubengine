      myotonia, and the involvement of several systems. Hypersomnolence is one of the most
      frequently reported symptoms in patients with DM1 and often lead to handicap such as
      cessation of employment and withdrawal from social activities.The current investigation
      represents a prospective, double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study
      designed to evaluate the efficacy of methylphenidate for the treatment of excessive daytime
      sleepiness (EDS) in adults with DM1.
