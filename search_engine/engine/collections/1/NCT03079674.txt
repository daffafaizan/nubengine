      progression. TIA and minor stroke exhibit the common substantial risk factors for early
      stroke recurrence and epidemiological characteristic. Since TIA and minor stroke may leave
      impermanent or mild neurological deficit, they are termed as non-disabling ischemic
      cerebrovascular disease (NICE).

      The results of the China Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance (CCDRFS) 2010 showed
      that the age-standardized prevalence of TIA is 2.27%. Estimated 23.9 million people may have
      experienced a TIA in China. The TIA knowing-rate is approximately 3.08% in Chinese adults,
      only 5.02% received treatment and 4.07% received guideline recommended therapy. The Second
      China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-II) indicated that minor stroke accounted for 42.23% of
      all the hospitalized patients of ischemic stroke, which is much higher than that showed in
      CNSR-I (2007-2008). Thus, it is imperative to develop new strategies to improve the
      diagnosis, risk prediction and appropriate management of NICE.

      NICE is an attractive researching area globally. According to the large quantities of NICE
      patients in China and the low standardized therapeutic rate, the awareness of NICE is largely
      insufficient. The purpose of the present study is to establish a multi-center national
      prospective database of NICE, including clinical information and biological samples library
      and, to further explore the epidemiology, new biomarkers, risk factors, and prognostic
      models.
