      Primary

        -  To determine, in a prospective fashion, if the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for
           patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and "good" pathologic predictive features
           is significantly higher than a historical, unselected patient population.

      Secondary

        -  To determine, in a prospective fashion, the response rate to high-dose IL-2 for patients
           with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and "poor" pathologic predictive features and to
           compare this response rate to the response rate of patients with "good" pathologic
           predictive features.

        -  To determine if components of other predictive and prognostic models (e.g MSKCI or UCLA
           criteria) can help to further define the optimal population to receive high-dose IL2 for
           metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

        -  To identify features of the baseline immune function (arginine, arginase, T cell zeta
           chain) of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma that are associated with
           response to high-dose IL-2.

        -  To identify new proteins or patterns of gene expression that might be associated with
           high-dose IL-2 responsiveness in order to further narrow the application of IL-2 therapy
           to those who will benefit the most.
