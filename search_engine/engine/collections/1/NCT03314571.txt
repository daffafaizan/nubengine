    
      The observation shall be conducted at 3 major points of measurement throughout labor:

        1. Pre-, i.e. at the systematic visit for anesthesia, during the 3rd trimester of
           pregnancy. The collected variables will be: demographic, morphometric, socioeconomic,
           psychometric. The latter shall consist in a short questionnaire-based assessment by:
           Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 5-points Mental Health Inventory, Life
           Orientation Scale. As soon as it will be validated, a Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire
           shall be added.

        2. Intra-, i.e. clinical data from the anesthesia file: conduction of epidural analgesia,
           labor pain, drug consumption, obstetrical outcomes.

        3. Post-, i.e. maternal satisfaction assessed by a set of seven 11-point numerical rating
           scales at day2 post childbirth, along with a written short qualitative assessment.

      Different multivariable statistical models shall be used to identify the patients profiles
      and the possible determinants of satisfaction: descriptive (factorial analyses) and
      inferential (GLM or longitudinal).
