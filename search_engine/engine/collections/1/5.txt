free fatty acid concentration in maternal plasma and fetal body fatcontent .subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p. units of heparin into femalesprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasmafree fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose . a group ofpregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times dailythroughout pregnancy . the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than thefetuses from uninjected mothers . the hypothesis is presented that thematernal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fataccumulation . it is proposed that the body composition changes noted inbabies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormallyhigh maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations .
