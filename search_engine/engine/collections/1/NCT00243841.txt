      hepatocellular carcinoma may benefit from radical therapies. Liver transplantation offers the
      best chance for cure. Surgical resection has been the only other potentially curative option,
      but the majority of patients are not candidates for resection. This reflects the usual
      comorbidity of severe underlying liver disease that either precludes surgery or makes the
      surgical approach extremely dangerous.
