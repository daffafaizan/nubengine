      depression (TRD) across 7 clinical sites and provide three IV ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg,
      infused over 100 minutes) and measure their depressive symptom responses. Biomarkers will be
      developed using blood samples from study subjects, taken prior to (predictive biomarkers) and
      following ketamine treatment (change biomarkers). The investigators will begin by studying
      the predictive value of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) target engagement by ketamine
      using a white blood cell (WBC) assay for antidepressive response to ketamine (Aim 1);
      however, samples will be used to develop multiple blood-based biomarkers for ketamine
      antidepressive effects (Aim 2). The investigators will also examine the effect of combining
      multiple blood-based biomarkers for predicting antidepressive response to ketamine in adults
      with TRD (Aim 3).

      Baseline WBC markers of impaired cellular energy regulation will be associated with measures
      of clinical response to ketamine (predictive biomarker). Changes in WBC markers of impaired
      cellular energy regulation will be associated with clinical response to ketamine (change
      biomarker).
