      Infectious disease practice in West Palm Beach, FL. This chart review will assign patients
      into one of two groups based on their antiretroviral regimen: single tablet regimen (STR)
      versus multi tablet regimen (MTR). Up to 650 patient charts will be reviewed but only about
      500 patients are needed for statistical analysis.

      The primary objective is to look at the proportion of patients with an adherence rate greater
      than or equal to 95% in subjects prescribed STR versus a MTR.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Differences in emergency room visits, hospitalization and readmission in patients taking
           a STR vs. a MTR

        -  Proportion of patients with HIV viral load less than 50copies/microliter

        -  Incidence of new onset or worsening hyperlipidemia in patients taking a STR versus a MTR

        -  Incidence of acute renal insufficiency

        -  Compare the absolute CD4 number increase between a STR and a MTR

        -  Compare monthly copay amounts in patients taking a STR versus a MTR

        -  Identify the incidence of opportunistic infections in patients taking a STR versus a MTR
