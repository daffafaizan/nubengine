      SEBUMETER SM 810- this is the device we will use to measure sebum exertion before and after
      injecting botulinium toxin. The measurement is based on grease-spot photometry. A special
      tape becomes transparent in contact with the sebum on the skin surface. For the determination
      of the sebum, the measuring head of the cassette is inserted into the aperture of the device,
      where the transparency is measured by a light source sending light through the tape which is
      reflected by a little mirror behind the tape. A photocell measures the transparency. The
      light transmission represents the sebum content on the surface of the measuring area. A
      microprocessor calculates the result, which is shown on the display in µg sebum/cm² of the
      skin.
