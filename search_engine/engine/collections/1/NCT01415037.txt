      technology for rapid, high-definition imaging. The study will assess high frequency
      ultrasound (HFU, 40 & 20 MegaHertz) annular arrays in imaging posterior vitreous detachments
      (PVDs) associated with diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in the US
      working-age population according to Prevent Blindness America. Current HFU instruments do not
      use linear arrays for such applications because of a variety of technical and cost reasons.
      Instead, current HFU instruments use mechanically scanned, single-element transducers, which
      provide fine-resolution images over a very limited depth of field (DOF). For ophthalmic
      applications, a shallow DOF causes most ocular anatomy to be imaged with poor definition
      compared to the in-focus region; therefore, because only a small portion of the eye is in
      focus at a given time, detection and assessment of ocular conditions such as PVD are prone to
      inaccuracies and false-negative determinations. Annular-array transducers offer a promising
      approach to significantly extend DOF and to increase the depth range over which fine-lateral
      resolution is provided. The investigators will validate system performance using animal
      experiments and human-subject examinations. First, in vivo animal experiments will be
      conducted to evaluate a 40-MegaHertz (MHz) annular array for anterior-segment imaging and a
      20-MHz annular array for posterior segment and full-globe imaging. The investigators will
      test the hypothesis that 20-MHz annular arrays improve detection of PVD. Validation of this
      hypothesis will significantly improve our ability to assess disease status in diabetic
      retinopathy.
