      (CKD) has shown that the incidence of IJ thrombosis after short term catheter access occurred
      in only 1/26 subjects or 4%. The current study is being done to compare this experience with
      the incidence of thrombosis from PICC lines. A secondary aim will be to determine if
      variables such as level of renal function, prior history of thrombosis or atherosclerosis
      contribute to the risk of thrombosis when PICC lines are placed. This data will provide the
      first comparison of the incidence of thrombotic complications from short term IJ catheter
      access versus PICC lines.
