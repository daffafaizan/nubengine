      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose Sarasar (SCH66336, lonafarnib) when combined with
      Temodar (temozolomide) in an alternating week schedule.

      II. To describe the toxicities of the Sarasar and Temodar combination treatment using this
      dosing schedule.

      III. To evaluate response as measured by 6-month progression-free survival and objective
      tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lonafarnib.

      Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 and 15-21 and
      lonafarnib PO twice daily (BID) on days 8-14 and 22-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
