      procedure. Once enrolled in the study impressions were realised and the radiographic stent
      prepared, with radio-opaque references fixed in the positions where the implants should be
      inserted. Pre-surgical CT scan was executed after placing the stent in its proper position in
      patient's mouth. If no surgical contra-indications were detected at CT evaluation, patients
      were involved in the study.
