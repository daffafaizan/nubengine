      with gene therapy. The patients are chosen from a population of patients who would normally
      be candidates for standard deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for PD. These patients
      respond to medical therapy, but develop substantially reduced responses over time, often with
      severe fluctuations in their condition between a functional and severely non-functional
      state. Some patients also develop dose-limiting side effects from medication, including
      involuntary movements called dyskinesias and nightmares. When there are no medical
      contraindications, DBS is often performed in these patients to try to quiet hyperactive brain
      regions such as the subthalamic nucleus (STN). In PD, the STN is overactive due to a loss of
      GABA inputs to this region, which normally reduces neuronal firing. In turn, the STN drives
      other brain regions, including the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra (SNr), which
      are also hyperactive and which also have reduced GABA inputs. The goal of this gene therapy
      trial is to introduce the gene for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) into the STN using an
      adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, in order to permit the STN to produce it's own GABA, as
      well as release GABA into the GPi and SNr targets, which also have reduced GABA inputs. This
      is anticipated to restore a more normal pattern of information flow from this basal ganglia
      circuit to the thalamus and higher cortical structures in order to reduce the motor symptoms
      of PD, while eliminating complications arising from inserting DBS electrodes and batteries
      into the human body.
