      glands outside of a bone marrow transplant (BMT). BMT has developed over several decades of
      research as an effective treatment of various malignant and nonmalignant hematologic
      diseases.

      This research is being done to learn more about reduced-intensity bone marrow transplantation
      (BMT), also known as a "mini" transplant for patients with blood cancers, using bone marrow
      from a relative. The bone marrow for this transplant comes from a relative who is a
      half-match or "haplo" match to you. Possible donors include parents, siblings, and children.

      "Mini" transplants have been given to many people with various cancers but are considered
      experimental. Over 200 people at Johns Hopkins have received mini transplants with high doses
      of cyclophosphamide after the transplant. However, the chemotherapy combination and other
      treatment given before those transplants were different from what is in this study. Although
      all of the chemotherapy and immune-lowering drugs used in this study are approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA), the combination of medications used in this study are not FDA
      approved and are experimental.
