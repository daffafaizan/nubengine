      treat people who have AML. This study will compare the improvement in EFS in Arm A:
      pevonedistat + venetoclax + azacitidine combination arm group when compared with Arm B:
      venetoclax + azacitidine.

      The study will enroll approximately 150 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned in
      1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups in 28-day treatment cycles and which will remain
      disclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study:

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + Venetoclax 400 mg (ramp-up dose, Cycle 1 only: 100-400mg) +
           Azacitidine 75 mg/m^2

        -  Venetoclax 400 mg (ramp-up dose, Cycle 1 only: 100-400 mg) + Azacitidine 75 mg/m^2

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 4 years. Participants will attend the end-of-treatment visit 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy
      if that occurs sooner. Participants who discontinue study treatment without evidence of
      progressive disease (PD) will enter EFS follow-up or response follow-up (study visits every 3
      months) or overall survival follow-up (contacted every 3 months to document subsequent
      therapies and survival status).
