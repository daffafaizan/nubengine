      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo on the change in
      secretin-stimulated peak bicarbonate concentration in the pancreatic fluid at 6 months
      post-treatment in patients with a history of at least two episodes of acute pancreatitis in
      the past 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from
      baseline (study visit

      1) on: Ia. Change in the endoscopic ultrasound score (EUS). Ib. Change in serum and
      pancreatic fluid levels of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules.

      Ic. Change in pancreatitis-related readmissions. Id. Change in quality of life score as
      measured by the Quality of Life (QLQ)-Core (C)30 and QLQ-Pancreatic modification
      (PAN)28(Chronic Pancreatitis [CP]).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days.
