    
      A Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of induction therapy with TDË—1473 in subjects
      with moderately-to-severely active CD. This study includes 3 phases: Screening, Induction,
      and Active Treatment Extension (ATE). The Induction phase of the study is a randomized,
      double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study evaluating 2 oral dose levels of
      TD-1473 compared to placebo for 12 weeks in subjects with moderately to-severely active CD.
      Subjects who complete Induction will continue to receive TD-1473 in the ATE, for up to 48
      additional weeks.
