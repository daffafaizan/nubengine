      treatment in Cohort 1 will occur at least 6 days prior to the start of treatment for Cohort
      2. In each cohort, eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical facility on Day -1, the
      day prior to the start of dosing in Period 1, and will remain in the clinic until completion
      of study procedures on Day 18, the last day of Period 2 (an approximately 18-night inpatient
      stay). In Period 1, all subjects will receive a single oral dose of digoxin 0.25 mg on Day 1.
      In Period 2, subjects will receive repeat oral doses of eliglustat 150 mg BID (or 100 mg BID
      if a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer) from Day 11 to Day 17 and a single oral dose of digoxin 0AA mg
      on Day 15. For Cohort 2, co-administration of digoxin and eliglustat on Day 15 will occur
      only after review of safety data (including telemetry data) through at least Day 16 for all
      subjects in Cohort 1. The decision to proceed with concomitant dosing of subjects in Cohort 2
      will be at the discretion of the Investigator, with consultation of the Sponsor, as
      appropriate.
