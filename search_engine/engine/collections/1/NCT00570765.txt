      parallel group phase, followed by a long-term safety extension (LTSE). The planned duration
      of the LTSE phase was country-specific, ranging from 108 months to indefinitely. On-site
      visits occurred at least every 6 months.

      Following completion of the 3-month DB phase, participants who continued to meet protocol
      requirements were given the opportunity to enroll in the LTSE phase of the study at selected
      study sites. The participants who enrolled in the LTSE phase started OCA administration, from
      a starting dose (10 or 50 milligrams [mg]) based on the dose of OCA or placebo received in
      the DB phase or on the timing of entry into the LTSE phase.

      Because the LTSE phase was not planned in the original study design, participants had varied
      gaps between the end of the DB phase and the start of the LTSE phase. Moreover, some
      participants initiated ursodeoxycholic acid during the course of that break.
