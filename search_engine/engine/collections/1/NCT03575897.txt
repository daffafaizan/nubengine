      known to the clinicians caring for them (including reference data). Infants in the control
      group will also undergo serial measurements of infant body composition, but this information
      will not be available to the clinicians.

      If parent agrees, stool "dirty" diapers will be collected 2 times (at the time of hospital
      discharge and at 3 months of corrected age).
