      (osseodensification preperation technique) for patients with horizontal bone deficiency based
      on radiographic findings (CBCT).

      Alveolar ridge width will be measured intraoperatively before and after osteotomy site
      preparation to assess the amount of ridge expansion. Implant stability will be measured
      immediately after implant installation and 16 weeks later.
