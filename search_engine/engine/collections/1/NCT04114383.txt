      wasting of skeletal muscle known as "sarcopenia". Crucially, sarcopenia is more than just a
      symptom of weakness and poor functional capacity; it exposes people to an increased risk of
      falls and fractures, impacting quality of life, independence, health status and ultimately
      lifespan. Muscles represent the largest organ in the body, making up over 50% of total body
      weight. Most people know that skeletal muscles are important for movement and to support the
      skeleton, but not everyone is aware of how important muscles are for whole-body health. For
      example, muscles represent a vast protein store containing amino acids (the building blocks
      of protein) which can be broken down in times of fasting, infection and disease in order to
      provide energy to help other vital organs. Because of the detrimental effects on health, and
      the associated health costs, sarcopenia is of grave concern. Therefore, there is a
      significant clinical need to pre-identify at-risk older individuals who have low muscle mass
      so that they can be offered an intervention (of diet, exercise or drug-based) before they
      suffer any of the potential problems outlined above. Current techniques for measuring
      whole-body muscle mass, including MRI and CT are time-consuming, expensive and in huge demand
      in hospital settings, meaning that muscle wasting conditions such as sarcopenia often go
      undiagnosed. In this project we propose a potential solution to this problem by developing a
      diagnostic of sarcopenia that requires only a single drink and subsequent urine collection.
      In addition, throughout this project we aim to explore the mechanisms underlying muscle
      wasting by assessing the muscle of those with low and 'normal' muscle mass.
