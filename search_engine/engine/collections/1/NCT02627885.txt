      Standard Medical Treatment. ICBT will be compared to Standard Medical Treatment alone (SMT).

      A secondary aim is make a preliminary evaluation of the ICBT-program with less and less
      active therapist support. It is hypothesized that both active treatments will be superior to
      SMT in improving quality of life and functioning and that ICBT with full therapist support
      will be superior to ICBT with lower level of therapist support.
