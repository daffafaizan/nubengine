      patients undergoing TAVI with the self-expandable MCV prosthesis compared to the
      balloon-expandable ES valve. However, this collaboration may also be used to compare various
      outcomes.

      Studies were included if they complied with the following requirements: original prospective
      studies, including patients with aortic valve stenosis treated with transfemoral TAVI of
      native valves and reporting of 30 day stroke outcomes according to VARC criteria or other
      specified corresponding criteria . Moreover, to be included studies had to report both the
      use of self-expandable MCV prosthesis and the balloon-expandable ES valve in more than 50
      patients in each arm to ensure experience in use of the valves. Studies were excluded if they
      only addressed patients undergoing valve-in-valve and re-do procedures or bicuspid valves or
      included the same study population. Principal Investigators of these studies were approached
      for collaboration.
