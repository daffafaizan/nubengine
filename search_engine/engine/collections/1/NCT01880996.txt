    
      Tai-chi/Qi-gong is a complementary medicine technique that synergizes the mind-body
      connection. The technique employs a series of positions and movements that are performed in a
      slow, flowing manner to help a person concentrate on breathing and motion.

      The effect of Tai-chi/Qi-gong on fatigue, quality of life, and quality of sleep will be
      assessed in gynecological cancer patients. This trial will recruit 60 patients with
      gynecological malignancies, who receive first or second line chemotherapy. The patients will
      be allocated according to their preference to either the study or the control group. The
      Tai-chi/Qi-gong classes will take place once a week, for 10 consecutive weeks, at the
      facilities of the gyneco-oncology department. All patients will fill out the questionnaires
      at the beginning of the study, after 5 weeks, and upon the completion of the study (10
      weeks).
