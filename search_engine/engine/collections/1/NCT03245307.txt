    
      This open-label study consists of a drug interaction phase that (part A) and a
      drug-continuation phase (part B). Patients will receive CYP450-probe drugs, and PK
      assessments will be performed before apatinib-administration and a≈øter once-daily
      administration of apatinib for 5 days (the predicted time point when steady-state plasma
      apatinib concentrations will have been achieved).
