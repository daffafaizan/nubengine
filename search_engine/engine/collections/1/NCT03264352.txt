      patients will be recruited over three years with a median follow up of 3.5 years. IPAD tests
      the hypothesis that antihypertensive medical therapy in adult patients with type 2 diabetes,
      whose seated BP ranges from 130 to 149 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic, results in
      35% reduction in the incidence of stroke, which is the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints
      of this study include: a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI,
      hospitalization for heart failure and hospitalization for unstable angina; each single event
      listed above; all-cause mortality; renal dysfunction; diabetic retinopathy that needs
      interventional operation; peripheral arterial diseases; new on-set atrial fibrillation or
      flutter; cancer; change of health-related quality of life; cost-effectiveness of medications.
      Inclusion criteria for the study include T2DM patients aged between 35 and 75 years within
      the aforementioned BP ranges. The sitting systolic BP should decrease by at least 10 mm Hg
      systolic and to ≤130 mm Hg, using titration and combination of the double-blind study
      medications consisting of an angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker Allisartan (240 mg/day), a
      dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (amlodipine 5-10 mg/day), and a hydrochlorothiazide
      (12.5-25 mg/day). In the control group, placebo tablets will be used. Across the whole study,
      282 primary endpoints are expected to occur. Interim analyses will be carried out on an
      intention-to-treat basis at the accumulation of every 100 primary endpoints. At the
      completion of the trial, both an intention-to-treat and a per-protocol analysis will be
      performed.
