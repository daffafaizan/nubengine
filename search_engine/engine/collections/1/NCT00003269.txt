      following cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin therapy in patients with hematologic
      malignancies and adult solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive intravenous amifostine over 15 minutes
      daily 30 minutes prior to high dose chemotherapy on days 0-2. Cyclophosphamide is
      administered over 3 hours on days 0 and 1, intravenous etoposide over 4 hours on days 0, 1,
      and 2, and cisplatin over 4 hours on days 0, 1, and 2. All patients receive sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) beginning on day 4. Patients receive a maximum of 2 courses of treatment (with 35-42
      days between chemotherapy courses). Patients are followed for 1-5 months after treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
