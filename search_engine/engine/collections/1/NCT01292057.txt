      recruited through advertisement and paid for their participation. Subjects will have blood
      drawn for DNA analysis of various brain dopamine system genes. Alcoholics, after baseline
      evaluation, will be assigned through urn randomization to one of two experimental groups,
      depending on their baseline level of impulsivity, in which they will receive either
      aripiprazole (up to 15 mg/day) or an identical placebo. Subjects will take the study drug or
      placebo for 8 days (day 1-6 being the natural observation period). After a minimum of 24
      hours of abstinence from alcohol (day 7-8) they will undergo an alcohol administration
      (priming dose) and motivated free choice drinking procedure (on day 8). Alcoholic subjects
      will receive a brief counseling session at the end of the study to enhance their awareness of
      problem drinking and to motivate them to seek treatment. Referral for treatment will be
      offered.

      Each subject will undergo a functional MRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) brain scan
      with cue stimulation on day 7, on the evening before the alcohol administration paradigm.
      fMRI (functional magnetic resonance) imaging brain imaging technology will be used to
      determine if alcoholics treated with aripiprazole differ in alcohol cue-induced activity in
      the nucleus accumbens. It is hypothesized that aripiprazole will reduce nucleus accumbens
      activation to alcohol cues compared to placebo.

      Whether dopamine system genetic differences will be predict drinking, nucleus accumbens
      activity, and aripiprazole response will be explored.
