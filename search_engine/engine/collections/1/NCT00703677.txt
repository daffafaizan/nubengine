      adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of
      hyperphosphorylated tau. Symptomatic treatment is of minimal benefit to individuals with PSP
      or CBD, and there are no effective disease modifying agents.

      Tau phosphorylation is regulated in part by the enzyme GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase-3
      beta ). Inhibition of this enzyme may benefit individuals with PSP or CBD by decreasing the
      levels of phosphorylated tau. Lithium is known to inhibit GSK-3β and, thus, may be a rational
      therapeutic approach.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of lithium in
      people with PSP or CBD. Additionally, this study will evaluate potential biomarkers and
      clinical outcome measures as well as assess study drug compliance.

      In this multicenter, open label study, 45 eligible participants with PSP or CBD will receive
      the study drug, lithium. The dosage of lithium will be titrated over a 5-week period, and
      participants will then be followed prospectively for 6 months. Participants will be evaluated
      at the screening visit, baseline visit, and weeks 2 and 5 during the titration phase. Clinic
      study visits will then occur on alternate months through week 28. Telephone visits will occur
      between clinic study visits.
