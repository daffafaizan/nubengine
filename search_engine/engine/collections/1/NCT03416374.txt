      people who have RRMM. This study will look at the effectiveness and safety of IRd in
      participants with RRMM previously receiving an injectable proteasome inhibitor-based therapy.
      This study consists of two treatment periods, Treatment Period I and Treatment Period II.

      The study will enroll 47 patients. All participants will receive following treatment:

      - Combination therapy with Bortezomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (VRd) or combination
      therapy with Carfilzomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (KRd), standard recommended dose
      according to the package insert of each drug, as Treatment Period I, followed by Combination
      therapy with Ixazomib 4.0 mg + Lenalidomide 25 mg + Dexamethasone 40 mg (IRd) as Treatment
      Period II

      At start of this study, combination therapy of VRd or KRd will be decided by investigator as
      Treatment Period I after the baseline evaluations. After the start of Treatment Period I, a
      participant's eligibility for Treatment Period II is then determined 3 cycles. Participants
      who meet these eligibility criteria II subsequently continue into Treatment Period II and
      receive IRd.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. It is anticipated that the treatment
      phase of this study will last up to 39 months, including 18 months for enrollment.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in treatment period, and follow-up
      period including a follow-up assessment after last dose of study drug.
