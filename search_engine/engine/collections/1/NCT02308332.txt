      (HIV-1) infections, is known for its neurological and psychiatric adverse events. Efavirenz
      is part of Atripla®, a single tablet regimen (STR), currently the most prescribed
      antiretroviral drug in the Netherlands. Recently, a new STR has become available, Eviplera®
      containing a successor of Efavirenz, named Rilpivirin. It has been shown in the phase-3 ECHO
      and THRIVE studies that Atripla as well as Eviplera have excellent and comparable
      antiretroviral efficacy in naive HIV-infected patients. Furthermore, data from these studies
      have shown that Eviplera was associated with fewer neurological and psychiatric adverse
      events than Atripla over 48 weeks. However, this was only patient reported adverse events,
      not neuropsychological evaluation. Furthermore, they were treatment naïve for HIV. Moreover,
      there might be a bias in these kind of switch studies due to the fact that those patients who
      switch will mostly regard their new combination better than the old one. Contrary, data on
      the long term impact of Efavirenz on neuropsychological performance and symptoms are
      conflicting.

      Objective: This study aims to investigate the effect of switching from Atripla to Eviplera on
      neurocognitive performances (neurocognitive testing) and imaging (functional MRI scanning) in
      virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients.
