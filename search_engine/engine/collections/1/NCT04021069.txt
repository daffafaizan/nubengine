      pre-treatment core biopsies that are predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, (2)
      determine patterns of metastasis from primary breast cancer to other distant sites, (3)
      determine the rates of local recurrence in breast cancer patients, and (4) to determine if
      there are significant radiomic, pathomic, and clinical markers for recurrence and distant
      metastasis.
