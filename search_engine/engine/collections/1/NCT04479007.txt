      determine the appropriate treatment. Histopathology would help treatment decisions, however
      is in the fast majority of this critically ill patient-group not available. CLE is enables
      near histology/microscopic analysis during bronchoscopy, by tissue illumination with a
      low-power laser. Optical Coherence Tomography is the optical equivalent of B-mode
      ultrasonography, that consists of a small rotating optical fibre. Both the CLE and OCT
      techniques are minimally invasive and little time consuming. Therefore different areas of the
      lung can be sequentially imaged. With this pilot study the investigators aim to describe
      normal alveolar areas and areas with abnormalities in critically ill patients with non
      resolving acute respiratory failure mandating a standard bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy with or
      without bronchoalveolar lavage.
