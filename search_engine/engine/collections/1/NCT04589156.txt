      infectious and non-infectious triggers. It is a major cause of sudden cardiac death, with
      also long-term adverse outcomes in survivors. The incidence and predictive factors of
      recurrent AM (RAM) are unknown.

      Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a genetically-determined or acquired arrhythmogenic
      disorder of the myocardium. With an incidence of 1/5000, genetic ACM is the consequence of
      pathogenic variants in genes encoding for desmosomal and cytoskeleton proteins. Originally
      described as a right ventricular disease (ARVC), genetic ACM is increasingly recognized as a
      left (ALVC) or biventricular entity. Genetic ACM may manifest with various clinical
      presentations, with a predisposition to acute and chronic heart failure, ventricular
      arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Pathophysiology of genetic ACM at early stages remain
      widely elusive.

      Myocardial inflammation has been consistently reported in patients with genetic ACM, but the
      exact nature of their association is a matter of debate. The temporal association between RAM
      episodes and the later diagnosis of genetic ACM is speculative, and it has been hypothesized
      recently that RAM episodes might reflect early active phases in the development of a genetic
      ACM.

      The investigators aim to study the temporal association between RAM episodes and the later
      diagnosis of an ACM.

      Consecutive patients with at least two episodes of AM and referred to a tertiary university
      referral center (pop. 1.500.000 inhabitants) for clinical expertise, follow-up and
      etiological work-out were prospectively included in this registry.
