      type 2 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has promoted a race against the clock for the search on
      treatment against the disease related with coronavirus (COVID-19). There are no current
      approved therapeutic options against the virus, although there is a rush for the development
      of drugs, vaccines and even the passive immunization through plasma from convalescent
      patients. This passive immunization is made with the administration of antibodies from
      patients that went through the infectious state of the disease and progress to clinical
      remission.

      SARS-CoV-2, and its predecessor SARS-CoV-1, have great similarities between their genes and
      proteins; tis allow to hypothesize that the antibodies developed against SARS-CoV1 can
      recognize the antigens of SARS-CoV-2. In this manner, the transfusion of convalescent plasma
      to patients with the infection brings the probability on eliminating the infection, in this
      case SARS-CoV-2. There are evidence of this phenomenon observed in previous pandemics caused
      by SARS-CoV-1, Influenza AH1N1 and Ebola virus.

      The objective of the study is to develop a therapeutic strategy based on the administration
      of plasma from patients with COVID-19 with clinical remission to patients that are coursing
      with the infection. The expected results hopes to establish an effective treatment and
      satisfactory recovery of patients with COVID-19. Also, we expect to describe the respective
      antibodies related against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
