    
      The aim of this study is to monitor the long-term safety profile of patients who have
      previously received at least one dose of NI-0501, including survival at several time points
      after the administration of NI-0501.

      Moreover to study the elimination profile of NI-0501 and to assess the immunogenicity of
      NI-0501.

      Furthermore in the event that patients, upon request of the treating physician, will be
      maintained on NI-0501 treatment beyond the foreseen 8 weeks, NI-0501 safety, tolerability,
      efficacy and PK profile will be closely monitored in these patients until treatment
      discontinuation.
