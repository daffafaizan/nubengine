      propofol-remifentanil-rocuronium anesthesia and surgery in informed, consenting adults,
      during their surgical operations in Tampere University Hospital. The patients will be
      informed about the possibility to participate during their preoperative visit, and the
      approval will be asked on arrival in the day of surgery, before premedication.

      The course of anesthesia will not be changed. The monitoring of the anesthetic state will be
      conventional: Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation of blood, Entropy Index,
      neuromuscular blockade will be monitored, as is the case in all surgical patients under
      general anesthesia in Tampere University Hospital. Any further monitoring will apply
      depending on the specific needs of the particular patient. Entropy Index data, EEG data and
      neuromuscular blockade data will be recorded on computer and analyzed later at GE Healthcare
      R&D Department, Helsinki, Finland, by Dr. Mika Särkelä. All data leaving Tampere University
      Hospital will be anonymized.

      Anesthetic induction will be given in a conventional way (intravenous propofol and
      remifentanil, followed by intravenous rocuronium). EEG waveform is monitored with Entropy
      module. Neuromuscular blockade will be monitored with EMG-NMT module (GE-Healthcare). The
      data collection (Entropy, EEG, neuromuscular transmission (NMT) data) will last at least
      until skin incision.
