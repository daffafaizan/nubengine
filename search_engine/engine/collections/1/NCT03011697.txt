      brought a heavy burden to the world. However, the prevalence and prognosis of valvular heart
      disease are not so clear, especially in the developing countries such as China etc. Because
      of the slow and progressive nature of VHD, symptoms might not be too severe to be diagnosed
      on time. Our retrospective survey (Int J Cardiol. 2016 Nov 25) indicated that severe valvular
      diseases are very common in China. Hence, we design a prospective, observational cohort study
      to provide contemporary information on the prevalence, characteristics, risk
      stratificationï¼Œcost-effective ,treatments and prognosis of Chinese hospitalised adult
      patients with valvular heart disease.
