    
      This is an open-label, multicenter trial composed of 2 parts in which Sym013 will be
      evaluated when administered by intravenous infusion in patients with advanced epithelial
      malignancies without available therapeutic options.

      Part 1 is a Phase 1a dose-escalation evaluating weekly (Q1W) and every second week (Q2W)
      schedules of administration in separate dose-escalation cohorts to determine the recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) and regimen of Sym013.

      Part 2 is a Phase 2a dose-expansion at the RP2D and regimen. Four (4) dose-expansion cohorts
      will be evaluated in this part of the trial and will be selected based upon findings from
      Part 1, additional preclinical data, and additional clinical data available at that time from
      other agents inhibiting these targets. Patients will be entered, depending upon either a
      defined molecular profile or profiles, or their underlying malignancy, to 1 of 4
      corresponding expansion cohorts: Cohort A, Cohort B, Cohort C, or Cohort D.
