      education programs for patients undergoing colostomy and ileostomy.

      The study is a randomized controlled experimental research with a pre-test post-test control
      group design. The study group of the research consisted of individuals, who have an abdominal
      stoma procedure at a Training and Research Hospital operating under the Ministry of Health in
      Turkey. 35 individuals were enrolled to the experiment and control groups (N=70). The study
      group of the hospital was determined as a result of the power analysis performed on an
      average number of 150 patients, on whom a stoma is opened within a year, with an estimated
      effect rate of 0.824 and a SD of 0.45, the power being 0.80 and confidence interval p:0.05,
      as a total of 50 patients, 25 in the experiment group and 25 in the control group. Taking
      into consideration the data loss that may be experienced, it was planned to enrol 35
      individuals to the experiment group and 35 individuals to the control group. The patients
      were randomly assigned to each group. Homogeneity of patients randomized to the experiment
      and control groups was checked with a t-test. The stages of the research design were
      determined completely in accordance with the CONSORT diagram. Data were collected using an
      Information Form, Stoma Complications Assessment Form and City of Hope-Quality of Life-Ostomy
      Questionnaire and Stoma Care Knowledge Assessment Test. The study data were analysed with
      average, standard deviation, frequency, student t test, paired sample t test, variance
      analysis, Fisher's exact chi-square test, Fisher-Freeman-Halton test and Yates continuity
      correction test. Significance was assessed at a level of p<0.05.
