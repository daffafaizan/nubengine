      circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes in the absence of known causes of CD4+ lymphocytopenia. ICL is
      defined as an absolute CD4+ T cell count of less than 300 cells/microL in a patient with no
      human immunodeficiency virus infection or known immunodeficiency syndrome. The causes and
      frequency of the disorder remain unknown. The condition is typically diagnosed when patients
      present with a serious infection. In this natural history protocol, we will evaluate patients
      with CD4+ T cell counts below 300 cells/microL. We propose to follow 300 ICL patients for a
      minimum of 4 and maximum of 20 years, with a particular focus on the association between ICL
      and autoimmune disease. In addition to the ICL patients, we will enroll blood relatives and
      household contacts to better understand pathogenesis and etiologies of the syndrome. We will
      collect blood and other tissues for immunologic, rheumatologic, and genetic testing in an
      effort to identify and understand the underlying defects that cause ICL and follow its course
      in a cohort of patients who will receive best standard therapy for opportunistic infections.
