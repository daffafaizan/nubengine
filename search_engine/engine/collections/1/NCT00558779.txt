      (CABG) with an overall incidence ranging from 2.0 % to 3.2 %. The presumed etiology for the
      majority of strokes after CABG is atheroembolism from the diseased aorta ascendens caused by
      surgical manipulation. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) allows the
      construction of bypass grafts without surgical manipulation of the aorta. Yet a trial
      comparing different surgical strategies with stroke as the primary end point would require
      several thousand patients to achieve an adequate statistical power. The number of patients
      can be substantially reduced, if cerebral damage is assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic
      resonance imaging (DW-MRI). Using DW-MRI we have recently demonstrated that 25% of a patient
      population undergoing CABG without an increased risk of stroke showed new cerebral
      infarctions. These new cerebral lesions all showed an embolic pattern, became visible at
      T2-weighted images and were clinically silent, e .g. did not cause a new focal neurologic
      deficit. Given the much higher frequency of cerebral lesions assessed by DW-MRI than
      clinically apparent stroke, DW-MRI is an ideal surrogate parameter for the assessment of
      cerebral damage in patients undergoing CABG.

      The aim of the study is therefore, to investigate the influence of the surgical technique on
      the occurence of new ischemic cerebral lesions as assessed by DW-MRI in patients undergoing
      CABG in a prospective randomized setting. We hypothesize that OPCAB, which enables sparing of
      aortic manipulation, will reduce cerebral infarctions in patients with an increased risk for
      perioperative stroke.
