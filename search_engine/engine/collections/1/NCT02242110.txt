      (ERRT) on chronic nightmares in trauma-exposed adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder
      (B-ERRT), as these individuals have been excluded from past clinical trials. Eligible
      participants will be assessed prior to starting treatment. B-ERRT will be conducted once a
      week for approximately five consecutive weeks for approximately two hours per session. Each
      treatment session focuses on one of the following topics/skills: psychoeducation regarding
      trauma, nightmares, and sleep disturbances on bipolar disorder, relaxation techniques,
      exposure to the trauma-nightmare, and relapse prevention. Participants will then be asked to
      complete two to three follow-up assessments, 1-week, 3-months, and potentially 1-year after
      the end of the treatment.
