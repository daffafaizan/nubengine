      medication regimen. The low dose (low-FBT) group will receive FBT at a dose of 100 mcg, as
      well as an oral (pill) placebo preparation. The low dose (low-control) group will receive an
      "inactive comparator" (lansoprazole rapidly-dissolving buccal 15mg, " FBT placebo") and a
      dose of 5/325 Percocet tablet (oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325). The high dose (high-FBT) group
      will receive 200 mcg FBT plus 2 placebo tablets. The high dose (high-control) group will
      receive the "FBT placebo" and a dose of 2, 5/325 Percocet tablets.
