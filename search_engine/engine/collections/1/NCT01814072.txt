      supported intervention for obesity that minimizes expense and burden to participants, while
      achieving 6 month weight loss outcomes comparable or superior to those achieved by the
      current full cost, full burden form of INLIs. All intervention components to be examined were
      selected based on the Opt-IN model's prediction that they enhance behavioral adherence to
      weight regulation via the designated pathways. The five components to be tested will be: (1)
      coaching intensity (12 vs. 24 phone sessions), (2) text messaging (No vs. Yes), (3) progress
      report to participant's primary care provider (No vs. Yes), (4) recommendation to use meal
      replacements (No vs. Yes), (5) training participants' self-selected buddies to be supportive
      (No vs. Yes).
