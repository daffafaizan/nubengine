      promoting health and fitness among women. The program involves a 30-minute circuit training
      program and a weight management program involving periods of moderate caloric restriction
      (1,200 to 1,600 calories per day) followed by short periods of higher caloric intake (2,600
      calories per day). The program is designed to promote a gradual reduction in body fat while
      increasing strength and muscle mass/tone. Researchers in the Exercise & Sport Nutrition
      Laboratory (ESNL) at Texas A&M University have conducted an extensive study on the
      effectiveness and safety of the Curves fitness and diet program. Results of this initial
      study have shown that the program promotes weight loss, improves markers of health, and
      improves fitness. However, we feel that the program may be even more effective with some
      additional nutritional interventions. Calcium has been shown to slow bone loss and more
      recently has been found to help promote fat loss. If this is the case, supplementing the diet
      with calcium may promote greater benefits in women participating in the Curves fitness and
      diet program. The purpose of this study is to determine whether following a high
      carbohydrate/low fat diet or high protein/low fat diet for 30-days several times during six
      months of participating in the Curves fitness and diet program with or without dietary
      calcium supplementation promotes stepwise reductions in body weight, improvements in body
      composition, and/or improvements in markers of fitness and health.
