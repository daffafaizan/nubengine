      voriconazole improves outcomes in fungal keratitis. Patients presenting to the Aravind Eye
      Hospitals in Pondicherry, India for treatment of fungal keratitis will be recruited for the
      proposed study. Approximately 70 patients will be enrolled in the study. Subjects presenting
      with fungal keratitis will be randomized to receive topical natamycin plus intrastromal
      voriconazole or to receive topical natamycin alone. Subjects may also receive oral
      antifungals after day 3 at the discretion of the treating clinician. All study subjects will
      be followed for 3 months to evaluate response to treatment.

      Investigators from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) will assist Aravind Eye
      Hospital with the study design, implementation, and analysis of the research, and will help
      fund the study. The investigators will visit Aravind to help with the study implementation.
      UCSF will play an important role in this study by assisting with the study design,
      implementation, analysis, and funding.
