    
      Aim: The current study aims to investigate the acute effects of commercially available
      interesterified fat versus versus application appropriate non- interesterifed alternative fat
      on 8 h postprandial cardiometabolic outcomes.

      Hypothesis: Interesterified fat will induce a different cardiomtabolic response compared to a
      non interesterifed, application appropriate fat.

      Subjects: Participants will include 40 healthy male and female volunteers aged between the
      ages of 35 and 75 years (since during this age metabolic changes start to take place).

      Power calculation: Based on previous studies carried out by our group at King's College
      London, a sample size of 20 participants (males and females separately) will allow a 2.16%
      (percentage unit) difference in FMD to be detected (90% power, 0.05 alpha, SD 2.9. 50
      participants will be recruited allowing for a 20% dropout rate.

      Expected value:The study will provide novel information on the acute effects of commercially
      relevant processed fats on postprandial lipaemia.
