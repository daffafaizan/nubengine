    
      A maximum of 426 adult subjects with moderate to severe chronic, intractable, pain of the
      lower limbs due to CRPS types I and II will undergo a trial of the Axium or Proclaim
      Neurostimulator System across up to 45 study sites in the United States. Only subjects who
      report a 50% or greater reduction in overall pain intensity through direct patient-reported
      percentage of pain relief will receive the permanent implant. Subjects will then return to
      the office for follow-up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-permanent implant.
