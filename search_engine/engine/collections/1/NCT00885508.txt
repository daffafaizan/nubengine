    
      Patients will receive lenalidomide combined to DNR- AraC chemotherapy. The first 31 patients
      will receive DNR 45 mg/m2/d, during 3 days, and AraC 200mg/m2/d CI during 7 days.

      Progression or not to the next cohort DNR 60 mgm2/d x3d and AraC 200mg/m2d x7d , or on the
      contrary reduction to the lower cohort DNR 30 mgm2/d x3d and AraC 200mg/m2d x5d will be
      decided after inclusion of fixed numbers of patients ,after review of toxicity and efficacy
      by an independent safety review committee (SRC).

      Efficacy would be defined as a response rate ≥50%. After inclusion of the first 31 patients,
      the SRC will choose the cohort dose the last 33 patients will receive, based on toxicity and
      efficacy criteria.

        1. Induction treatment Lenalidomide 10 mg once daily PO during 3 weeks . DNR 30-45-or 60
           mg/m2 /d (depending on the cohort during 3 days (IV push)- AraC 200mg/m2/d during 5- 7
           or 7 days (continuous infusion)+ G-CSF (lenograstim): 263 ug/d from day 9, until
           recovery from aplasia (maximum 30 days).

           Evaluation will be performed after recovery from aplasia, on day 40 at the latest (with
           marrow aspirate and karyotype).

           Patients in hematological CR, CRi or marrow CR will proceed to consolidation treatment

           :Once the cohort dose has been decided by the SRC, a second cohort of 33 patients will
           be enrolled

        2. Consolidation treatment (in patients who achieved CR, Cri, or marrow CR) 6 monthly
           courses of : DNR (at the daily dose required to achieve CR) day1, combined to AraC 60
           mg/m2/12h SC during 5 days will be given.

           Lenalidomide 10 mg/ d during the first 2 weeks of the course.

        3. Maintenance treatment Lenalidomide 10 mg/d 2 weeks every month until relapse (dose
           reduced if cytopenias) In patients still responding after 52 weeks, the drug will
           continue to be supplied, and follow up until death will be continued in all patients.

      SECOND PART OF THE TRIAL AFTER AMENDMENT Treatment schedule of the 2nd Part of the trial

      In dose level 4, 20 patients will receive lenalidomide 25 mg/d during 21 days combined to
      DNR- AraC chemotherapy (DNR 60 mgm2/d x3d and AraC 200mg/m2d x7d) during induction. During
      consolidation, patients will receive Lenalidomide 25 mg/d during 14 days, combined with DNR
      60 mgm2/d x1d and AraC 60 mg/m2 x2/d x5d. finally, during maintenance, patients will receive
      Lenaidomide 25 mg/d x14d every months, until relapse.

      Progression or not to the next cohort (Lenaidomide 50 mg) will be decided after inclusion of
      20 patients, after review of toxicity and efficacy by an independent safety review committee
      (SRC) (Briefly, given median times to reach ANC and platelets > 500 and 50000/mm3,
      respectively of about 27 days in our previous trial with chemotherapy alone (Gardin, Blood),
      DLT would be defined by having greater than 3 of 10 patients recovering those levels after
      more than 40 days, or the occurrence of unexpected grade III-IV non hematological toxicity).
      Efficacy would be defined as a response rate ≥60%.

      In dose level 5, 20 patients will receive lenalidomide 50 mg/d during 21 days combined to
      DNR- AraC chemotherapy (DNR 60 mgm2/d x3d and AraC 200mg/m2d x7d) during induction. During
      consolidation, patients will receive Lenalidomide 50 mg/d during 14 days, combined with DNR
      60 mgm2/d x1d and AraC 60 mg/m2 x2/d x5d. finally, during maintenance, patients will receive
      Lenaidomide 50 mg/d x14d every months, until relapse.
