      which the team collected and verified the biological radiological and clinical data).

      Relations between Aspergillus fumigatus or Candida albicans and lung function or clinical
      outcome of patients will be longitudinally analyzed taking as output variable FEV1, according
      to bibliography data available.

      To assess the attributed fungal risk, the team will focus on the 57 patients de novo
      colonized by fungi at the second visit. Three physician experts will determine the impact of
      such fungal colonization on the patient clinical and respiratory parameters.

      The expert conclusion concordance and statistical significance will be evaluated using the
      kappa score.

      This project will be realized in collaboration with the groups of Prof. R. Thiebaut
      (Methodology and Epidemiology Service Bordeaux University Hospital, INSERM U1219 / INRIA
      SISTM) and Prof. M. Fayon (Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric reference centre) University
      Hospital of Bordeaux.
