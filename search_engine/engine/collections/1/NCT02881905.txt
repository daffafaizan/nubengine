      less technique sensitive if compared to bar attachments. However, ball attachment require a
      prosthetic space of 12 mm and could show tremendous wear if implants were mal-aligned. CM LOC
      attachment is newly introduced into market with very good expectations regarding its
      properties and effect on the periimplant soft tissue. CM LOC attachment, which combes
      titanium patrix and resin matrix made from polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), is a very promising
      material regarding the wear and the prosthesis retention it provides, even with mal-aligned
      implants. However, the clinical performance of this attachment was not tested yet. Therefore,
      in this randomized controlled trial it was decided to compare between CM LOC and the commonly
      used ball attachment regarding the soft tissue health and marginal bone loss.
