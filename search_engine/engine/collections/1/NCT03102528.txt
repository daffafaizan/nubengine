      surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient
      outcome in this population. The investigators sought to examine the risk factors associated
      with the development of AKI and renal recoveryin patients undergoing cardiac surgery at San
      Bortolo Hospital, Italy during November 2014 - October 2015.
