      be randomized to receive either topical LHA510 ophthalmic suspension or vehicle in a 1:1
      ratio for 84 days. Patients with recurrence of active CNV in the study eye during the study
      will receive rescue IVT Lucentis® injections. Following the treatment period, subjects will
      return for a follow-up visit and a disposition visit. Only one eye (designated as the study
      eye) will be dosed with either topical LHA510 or vehicle per patient.
