      therapeutic levels of hypericin. Pharmacokinetic modeling studies have demonstrated that
      daily oral dosing should produce a trough level in a desired range without excessive peak
      levels.

      Cohorts of six patients each receive escalating doses of oral hypericin daily. Blood is
      sampled for peak and trough levels the second week of therapy. A computer modeling algorithm
      will use these levels to determine the appropriate dose needed for each patient to achieve
      the desired trough level. When three of six patients at a given dose have completed 3 weeks
      of therapy without evidence of dose-limiting toxicity, data will be reviewed to determine
      whether subsequent patients should be entered at the next higher dose. The MTD is defined as
      the dose level immediately below that at which grade 3 or worse toxicity is seen in three or
      more of six patients.
