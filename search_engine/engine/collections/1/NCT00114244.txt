      I. To determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
      treated with concurrent gemcitabine and BAY43-9006 and sequential BAY 43-9006 followed by
      gemcitabine/BAY 43-9006 at progression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the six month overall survival rate, 3 month progression free survival rate,
      time to tumor progression and overall survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
      treated with concurrent gemcitabine and BAY43-9006 and sequential BAY 43-9006 followed by
      gemcitabine/BAY 43-9006 at progression.

      II. To determine the safety profile of gemcitabine and BAY43-9006 in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer and compared to those treated with single agent BAY 43-9006.

      III. To determine whether mRNA expression levels of genes involved in the gemcitabine pathway
      (RR, dck, dcd) and genes involved in the Raf pathway (cyclin D, VEGFR2, p21) will predict for
      time to progression, overall survival, and response, in patients with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer treated with concurrent gemcitabine and BAY43-9006 and sequential BAY 43-9006 followed
      by gemcitabine/BAY 43-9006 at progression.

      IV. To determine whether genomic polymorphisms of genes (measured in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells) involved in the gemcitabine pathway (RR) and genes involved in the ras
      pathway (VEGFR2, cyclin D, p21) will predict for time to progression, overall survival, tumor
      response, and toxicity in patients with advanced cancer of the pancreas treated with
      concurrent gemcitabine and BAY43-9006 and sequential BAY 43-9006 followed by gemcitabine/BAY
      43-9006 at progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Patients experiencing
      disease progression cross over to Arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral sorafenib as in Arm I and gemcitabine IV over 100 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
