      rest, heat, electrotherapy, physical therapy, and analgesics to surgery. Currently, there are
      two main surgical techniques for treatment of disc degeneration: (1) nucleotomy or
      diskectomy, i.e., excision of part or all of the degenerated disc, which is typically
      performed for treatment of radicular syndrome in the case of disc herniation; and (2) spinal
      fusion, i.e., grafting bone between the vertebrae adjacent to the degenerated disc to
      eliminate articulation at the damaged segment, which is typically performed for treatment of
      degeneration together with instability and reduction of the intervertebral space. Rigid
      internal fixation may also be used to promote fusion.

      The CHARITÉ Artificial Disc is designed to provide a new therapeutic option for treatment of
      degenerative disc disease as an alternative to spinal fusion to preserve function in the
      lumbar vertebral region. Each institution participating in the study was to treat the first 5
      consecutive study participants with the CHARITE to as it involves a modification to the
      technique used for anterior fusion. Data will be collected on these "training" cases but will
      not be included in the comparison with the control (fusion) treatment.

      Comparison: Outcomes for patients treated with the CHARITÉ Artificial Disc will be compared
      to outcomes for patients treated with anterior lumbar interbody fusion.
