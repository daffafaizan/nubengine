    
      Prior to surgery, each patient will undergo a baseline bilateral TCD examination in supine
      position. If the Doppler's results are satisfactory, the patient will then be randomized and
      proceed to the next step. In case of inadequate results, the patient's participation to the
      study will be terminated.

      The interscalene nerve block and the insertion of the interscalene catheter will be performed
      according to randomization. In the interscalene nerve block and catheter group, the attending
      anaesthesiologist will assess the success of the block and record the presence or absence of
      Horner's syndrome. The transcranial Doppler operator will be blinded to these observations.
      Following the insertion of the interscalene catheter, the patient will undergo a second
      bilateral TCD in supine position before induction of anesthesia.

      The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. After the induction of
      anesthesia, a bilateral TCD will be performed with the patient in supine position. Another
      examination will be performed under general anesthesia immediately after and 30 minutes
      following the installation of the patient in the beachchair position. A last TCD will be
      performed after a reduction of end-tidal carbon dioxide at 30 mm Hg.

      For each examination, the arterial blood pressure must be stabilized for at least 5 minutes
      before the Doppler can be initiated. Arterial blood pressure will be measured during each
      examination. Type, duration of surgery and beachchair position will be recorded. Vasopressor
      therapy will be noted. Body temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide and minimum alveolar
      concentration of desflurane will be collected during each examination performed under general
      anesthesia.
