    
      This is an open-label phase II study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors
      with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMD). Patients may have received any number of prior
      therapies for their respective solid tumors, but must not have received prior anti-PD-1
      therapy and developed progressive disease. Approximately 18 subjects in this study will
      receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4 doses.
      In patients who derive clinical benefit from therapy, pembrolizumab may be continued until
      documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that
      prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the
      subject, subject withdrawal of consent, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure
      requirements, or for administrative reasons.
