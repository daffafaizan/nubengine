    
      This is a randomized prospective study that will compare the pain levels of urethral
      catheterization in men randomized to requesting to urinate while inserting a urethral
      catheter to normal catheter insertion.

      Males aged 18 years and older who will be referred for multichannel Urodynamic study in order
      to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms will be included.

      Patients will be randomized to 2 groups: (1) Patients who will be requested to urinate while
      catheterising the urethra to its full length; (2), Patients who will be requested to lie
      while catheterising the urethra, without further instructions from the medical professional.
      In both groups, prior to catheterisation, 10 ml of lidocaine gel will be inserted into the
      urethra. The randomization technique will be employed by a computerized random number
      generator.

      A 12F Tieman urethral catheter will be introduced in order to measure post-void residual
      volumes. Subsequently, multichannel Urodynamic testing (Duet Encompass System - Mediwatch
      Group Plc) will be performed using a dual lumen 6F urethral and 9F rectal catheters. Filling
      will be carried out using room temperature saline at a filling rate of 50 ml/min.

      Patients will be requested to fill out a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) visual
      analog pain scale (VAS) in different time points: before the procedure (baseline),
      immediately after gel instillation, immediately after the introduction of the Tieman
      catheter, 15 minutes after the catheter will be taken out.

      Time frame of the study: 30 minutes before the test and 1 hour after the test. Since the
      study evaluates pain during the procedure the time frame of the study and assessment is very
      short. longer follow-up is not needed.
