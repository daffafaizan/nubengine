        1. to reduce the time between the first signs and diagnosis in ALS patients for therapeutic
           treatment earlier and

        2. to exclude rapidly non ALS in their avoiding unnecessary investigations and anxiety of
           being infected with a terrible prognosis disease. It is currently accepted that
           neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS begin before the first clinical signs and the
           patient could benefit from a more efficient care if it was early.

      Conduct a prospective study with 400 patients.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. attempt to improve the predictive power of markers assays by adding new parameters

        2. to check whether the assayed molecules in other environments more accessible (blood,
           urine) would provide equivalent diagnostic power of those assayed in the CSF

        3. identify metabolic pathways disrupted early that could be related to the pathogenesis of
           neurodegeneration.
