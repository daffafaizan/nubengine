      establishing IBT's neurocognitive treatment targets: hostile interpretation bias and response
      in the neural threat-learning system.

      The design is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial of IBT on its targets. The study
      will have four arms, with 25 participants in each arm for all four conditions of training
      (active versus sham) and scanning (in MRI or out of MRI scanner). During IBT, participants
      judge as happy or angry facial expressions which are on a continuum between happy and angry.
      The point at which judgments shift from predominantly happy to angry on this continuum is the
      indifference point. During training feedback encourages no change in the indifference point
      or a change in the indifference point towards more happy judgments of ambiguous faces. A
      shift in indifference point towards more benign judgments is interpreted as a reduction in
      hostile interpretation.

      The design will test whether active relative to sham IBT shifts the indifference point
      towards more benign judgments. Neural response to active versus sham IBT will be measured in
      half the sample.
