      ovulation. Progressive recruitments of blood vessels to the tumor site are thought to result
      in a self perpetuating loop helping to drive the growth of tumors. This new vasculature also
      allows competent tumor cells to find access to the vascular system and facilitate distant
      spread of tumor cells. Neovascularization is apparently an absolute prerequisite for physical
      expansion of solid tumors to grow beyond the volume of about 1-2 mm in diameter. Several
      molecular and cellular mechanisms have been identified by which tumor parenchyma may exert
      its angiogenic effect on host endothelial cells. There is also evidence that endothelial
      cells themselves, like other stromal cells, may act reciprocally to alter the behavior of
      adjacent tumor cells in a paracrine or cell contact mediated fashion. There is now known to
      be a diverse family of angiogenic growth factors, foremost among them being basic FGF and
      VEGF. Several angiogenic peptide genes have been sequenced and cloned. The degree of
      vascularization has acquired importance as an independent prognostic indicator in various
      types of solid tumors. More recently, it has been noted that increased angiogenesis may also
      be an important feature in hematologic malignancies, e.g. leukemia.
