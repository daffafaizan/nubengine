      autologous stem cell transplant followed by non-myeloablative allogeneic transplant for
      patients with poor risk lymphoma. Patients will be enrolled onto the trial when eligible and
      undergo standard high-dose chemotherapy with the combination with busulfan, cyclophosphamide,
      and etoposide followed by autologous stem cell transplant. After recovery of counts and
      clinical status, patients will then proceed to non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell
      transplant using a fully matched related or unrelated donor.
