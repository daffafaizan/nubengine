      rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all
      malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant
      tumor that threatens the health of our residents. We designed a multi-center, randomized
      controlled, phase II clinical study of camrelizumab with or without radiotherapy for the
      treatment of recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer that has progressed after
      chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      camrelizumab with or without radiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer.
