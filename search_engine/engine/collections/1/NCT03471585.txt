      negative, neutral, and positive memories. The study used a placebo-controlled,
      within-subjects, crossover design with 24 participants. In each experimental arm,
      participants attend a session to encode stimuli, a second session 48 hours later in which
      their memories are tested for the stimuli from the first session followed by the encoding of
      object-scene stimuli and a working memory test, and a third session 48 hours later in which
      memory for the object-scene stimuli is tested. In the second session, two hours prior to
      memory testing, THC or placebo is administered. On the first and second sessions subjects
      complete mood questionnaires.
