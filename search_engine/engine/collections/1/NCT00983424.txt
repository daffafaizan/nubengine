      nab-paclitaxel. Nab-paclitaxel is a special preparation of paclitaxel inside a protein layer
      of albumin. Other studies have shown Cyclosporine A (CsA) may block the progression of
      advanced breast cancer. The combination of nab-paclitaxel and CsA is considered
      investigational which means it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration,
      FDA. Participants on this study will receive nab-paclitaxel through a vein in the arm weekly
      3 weeks out of 4, in the outpatient clinic. On the same day as the first infusion of
      nab-paclitaxel, participants will begin taking CsA tablets twice a day by mouth. Participants
      will continue to receive study treatment as long as their tumor responds. If the tumor does
      not respond or the participant experience severe side effects from study treatment, she will
      be removed from the study and offered other therapies, if that is appropriate.
