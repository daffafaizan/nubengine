      evidence of effectiveness. The optimal physiotherapy intervention is currently unclear.
      Consequently, more research in this area combining different techniques in patients with a
      specific clinical profile is needed. It has been previously shown that participants prefer
      self-care measures for the management of neck pain. The aim of this study was to investigate
      the effects of a 4-week active exercising program in patients with chronic neck pain.
