      treatments that target pain in these children will lessen the risk of opioid exposure and
      continued pain and disability into adulthood. We plan to recruit a large multicenter sample
      of 260 children and adolescents (ages 10-19 years) with CP/ARP and their parents from
      INSPPIRE 2 (INSPPIRE:INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a
      cuRE) centers and pancreatitis community groups (e.g. NPF) to evaluate the efficacy of
      WebMAP, a web-based cognitive behavioral pain management program (CBT). The study design is a
      two (group) x three (time point) randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive online access to either pain education (WebED) or CBT
      (WebMAP) over an 8-10 week treatment period. The primary study outcome is abdominal pain
      symptoms measured at pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 6-month follow-up.
      Secondary outcomes include pain-related disability, health-related quality of life,
      depression and anxiety symptoms, and medication use. This project represents a significant
      advance in pain management for children with CP/ARP by evaluating the first ever
      nonpharmacologic pain intervention in these patients, which may guide future developments in
      the management of chronic pain associated with CP/ARP.
