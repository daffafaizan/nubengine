      I. To evaluate the feasibility for assessing oral mucosa in vivo with wide-field and high
      resolution images obtained using new optical imaging devices composed of cameras and
      microscopes, and with a topically administered contrast agent.

      II. To develop and evaluate algorithms to classify tissue as normal (including
      hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia, and inflammation) or abnormal (any grade of dysplasia or cancer)
      based on quantitative parameters extracted from the optical images.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percentage of subjects and lesions that can be successfully imaged with
      wide-field and high-resolution optical microscopes after topical application of contrast dye.

      II. To identify qualitative and quantitative features within images that differ between
      pathologically normal, dysplastic, cancerous and inflammatory lesions.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo evaluation of oral cavity using a widefield multispectral imaging device and
      a high-resolution optical system (high-resolution microendoscope [HRME]) at baseline, after
      induction of general anesthesia, and prior to surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 months.
