      stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of depression among patients with Alzheimer's disease.
      tDCS causes an excitatory effect on the anode side and suppressing effect on the cathode side
      through sculp with very week currents (2 mA in this project). The investigators aim to
      ameliorate depressive symptoms among patient with Alzheimer's disease, by anodal stimulation
      on left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cathodal suppression on right supraorbital area.
      Active stimulation will be compare to sham condition in 20 patients (10 in each groups) from
      outpatient clinic in National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Japan.
