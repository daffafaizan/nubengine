      midostaurin when given with ATRA and CLAG chemotherapy. Midostaurin is an investigational
      drug. It is a drug that inhibits FLT3 that is mutated or overexpressed in a significant
      proportion of AML patients. Research has shown that midostaurin and drugs like midostaurin
      may work better in combination with chemotherapy, like CLAG. ATRA is known to promote myeloid
      differentiation and has also been shown to augment cancer cell death in combination with
      chemotherapy. CLAG is a combination of cladribine, cytarabine, and G-CSF which is approved by
      the FDA and used to treat AML. This study will look at how safe this combination is, how you
      tolerate the treatment, and to see what dose of midostaurin is appropriate.
