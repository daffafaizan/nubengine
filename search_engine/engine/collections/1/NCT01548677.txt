    
      This is a randomized phase II trial for patients with HER2 negative primary BC who after
      completing (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery have detectable CTC(s) in peripheral blood
      (see eligibility criteria for details). Eligible patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to
      either the trastuzumab arm or the observation arm. Patients randomized to the trastuzumab arm
      will receive a total of 6 intravenous (IV) administrations every 3 weeks (loading dose 8
      mg/kg IV and 5 cycles at 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks). Patients randomized to observation arm shall
      be observed for 18 weeks. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment (MUGA and/or
      ECHO) will be done at baseline for all patients to be randomized. The next LVEF assessments
      of weeks 9 and week 18 will be done only in patients randomized to trastuzumab arm. Patient
      registered but with CTC negative result will not be followed-up.
