    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct an initial early phase clinical study utilizing a high ar-risk and underserved
      Appalachian population who are former oral cancer patients to determine the practicability of
      long-term daily freeze-dried black raspberry (BRB) (BRB lozenge) administration and to gain
      insights into the potential prevention of recurrent oral cancer by BRBs.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate numerous parameters (recruitment, tolerability, adherence to study guidelines,
      collection of biological samples, and demographics) that will be helpful in designing a
      future definitive, randomized, Phase II or III clinical trial structured to assess the
      potential effects of long-term BRB administration.

      II. Evaluate the temporal modulation of BRB-responsive gene expression that favor oral cancer
      chemoprevention in high at-at risk normal tissues before and after BRB administration.

      III. Assess the temporal modulation of BRB-responsive gene expression and biological levels
      of fruit components in post-surgical oral cancer patients not exposed to BRBs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive freeze-dried black raspberry lozenges orally (PO) 4 times daily (QID)
      for up to 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients do not receive freeze-dried black raspberries lozenges.

      After completion of study treatment, patients in Arm I are followed for up to 5 years and
      patients in Arm II are followed for up to 1 year for oral cancer recurrence.
