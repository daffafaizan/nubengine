    
      This is a randomized controlled pilot study of a post discharge community based patient
      engagement program for stroke patients discharged with a new carer after a period of
      in-hospital rehabilitation. Potential cases are identified within 2 weeks after admission
      into rehabilitation wards and randomized into either intervention group or usual care
      (control) group. Patients undergo the usual pre-discharge planning while in ward with
      predischarge assessment carried out by an independent (blinded) assessor. The control group
      are referred to receive the usual post-discharge community and rehabilitation backup. The
      intervention group has access to a special telephone hotline, home visits by team member
      within 1 week after discharge, patient diary to record home monitoring and back up of a
      specialist lead patient engagement clinic located in Kowloon Hospital. After 12 weeks,
      another home visit will be arranged for a repeat assessment by an independent (blinded)
      assessor. The outcomes to be measured include service parameters such as unplanned medical
      readmissions, AED attendances, length of stay at acute and rehabilitation units. Patient
      related parameters such as mortality, institutionalization, functional outcomes, mood,
      quality of life and complications will be measured as well as a carer strain and satisfaction
      survey.
