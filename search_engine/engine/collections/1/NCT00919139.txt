    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Maintain and expand tissue repositories of myeloma specimens from uniformly treated
           Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) patients with multiple myeloma, smoldering myeloma,
           Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, amyloidosis, or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
           significance.

        -  Utilize scientific information generated from intergroup and collaborative studies to
           assist the SWOG Myeloma Committee in the development of new and more effective treatment
           regimens for these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive treatment as directed by the treatment protocols on which they are
      registered. Specimens of blood and/or marrow are submitted to the Myeloma Repository. The
      status of the patient (e.g., pre-study, post-remission, or relapse) will be recorded prior to
      specimen collection.
