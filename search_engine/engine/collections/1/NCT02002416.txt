      resection of both primary diseases and metastatic lesions during January 2006 and December
      2012. Patients are collected based on the following criteria: (1) pathology proven advanced
      gastric adenocarcinoma; (2) the paraffin-embedded tissues of the primary and metastatic
      lesions were available (3) full information of follow-up. There are 100 patients suitable for
      the analysis. c-MET protein expression and amplification are assessed in paraffin-embedded
      tissues of the primary and metastatic diseases obtained from 100 patients by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The clinical
      pathologic data of the patients are also collected for analysis, including: gender, age,
      Karnofsky performance score (KPS), chemotherapy regimens, tumor locations, Lauren
      classification, histology subtypes, metastatic sites.

      In order compare c-Met expression and amplification between early and advanced stage, we will
      match 100 early stage (stage I and stage II) patients based on the following criteria (1)
      pathology proven gastric adenocarcinoma with radical resection; (2) the paraffin-embedded
      tissues of the primary lesions is available (3) full information of follow-up MET IHC will
      employ the Dako MET IHC assay and supplied assay protocol and pathology scoring guideline.

      MET FISH will also employ the Dako MET FISH assay supplied assay protocol and pathology
      scoring guideline.
