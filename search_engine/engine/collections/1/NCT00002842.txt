        -  Evaluate the efficacy of hepatic resection followed by portal vein infusion of
           floxuridine plus systemic fluorouracil/leucovorin calcium in patients with metastatic
           colorectal cancer.

        -  Study the toxic effects of adjuvant chemotherapy following hepatic resection.

        -  Evaluate mRNA expression of enzymes that may be important to the cytotoxicity of
           fluoropyrimidines in tumor cells, including thymidylate synthase, ribonucleotide
           reductase, and folylglutamyl synthetase, by polymerase chain reaction and
           immunohistochemistry.

      OUTLINE: Following resection of the liver and all extrahepatic colorectal cancer, patients
      receive floxuridine via portal vein infusion from days 1-14. Systemic chemotherapy consists
      of leucovorin calcium on days 8-14 and fluorouracil on days 9-13. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks for a total of 12 weeks.

      If biopsy-proven metastatic disease develops, treatment may be stopped at the investigator's
      discretion. Continuation of regional therapy should be considered for extrahepatic failure.
      No concurrent radiotherapy is permitted.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, then every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 50 patients will be entered over approximately 5
      years.
