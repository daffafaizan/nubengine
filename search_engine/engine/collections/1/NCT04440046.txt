    
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the combination of manual therapy and
      therapeutic exercise achieves better results in the management of the patient with shoulder
      pain.

      For this, manual therapy techniques in the thoracic region and in the shoulder together with
      a therapeutic exercise program will be applied.

      The investigators will compare this intervention protocol with placebo manual therapy
      techniques and the same therapeutic exercise protocol.
