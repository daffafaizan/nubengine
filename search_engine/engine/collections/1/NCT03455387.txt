      It is a major cause of mortality, mainly in the developing country. His incidence tends to
      increase in the developed countries. In the absence of adapted coverage, the pre-eclampsia
      can evolve into severe maternal and\or foetal complications (eclampsia, foetal intra-uterine,
      dead HELLP syndrome, lung acute oedema, stunting in utero).

      The pre-eclampsia is a part of placental vascular pathologies. Several studies showed that
      these pathologies are due to a defect of trophoblastic invasion, secondary in an imbalance in
      the balance of factors pro and antiangiog√©niques (PlGF, sFlt1).

      Studies also demonstrated that, for a patient presenting a placental vascular pathology, the
      rate of PlGF is decreased and conversely for the rate of sFlt1. Studies show that the
      duration of the pregnancy, of a patient presenting a placentary vascular pathology, is
      correlated at the rate of these markers.

      There is at present no reliable predictive examination to estimate the arisen of severe
      complications for a patient presenting a placental vascular pathology. The purpose of the
      study will to estimate the relevance of the serum markers sFlt1 and PlGF to predict the
      arisen of severe complications for these patients.
