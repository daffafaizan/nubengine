      surgery. Subjects will receive an identical pain control regimen. Participants will undergo
      TMS motor threshold assessment at the ETSU Innovation Lab prior to the planned surgery. At
      this appointment a baseline Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Center for Epidemiological
      Studies 10-item Depression scale (CES-D) and visual analog scale (VAS) ratings of pain and
      mood will be obtained.VAS ratings will also be done each evening over the following week. One
      day after surgery, the subject will return to the Innovation lab for TMS. A total of 22
      subjects will be recruited for the study. At the return visit, 11 will receive 40 minutes of
      10 Hz repetitive TMS at 120% of rMT (4-second stimulation trains with 26-second interstimulus
      intervals). The other 11 participants will receive sham treatment under identical settings.
      Participants, medical staff providing clinical care to patients and raters will not know
      whether participants receive real or sham TMS. Patients will keep a log of pain medications
      used over the following week in addition to the VAS ratings. Follow-up will occur one week
      after the TMS therapy. The subject will turn in logs and repeat BDI and CES-D scales.
