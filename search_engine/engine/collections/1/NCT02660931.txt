      predict risk for acute kidney injury in pediatric intensive care unit and pediatric ward
      patients into the electronic medical record system, enabling personalized decision support.
      Real-time surveillance using the risk prediction models will identify pediatric inpatients at
      increased risk for acute kidney injury. When patients exceed the threshold risk for acute
      kidney injury, the electronic medical record system will notify providers. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to be in the intervention group, for whom the notification will be
      implemented, or in the control group, for whom the notification will not display. The risk
      notification will be assessed for its impact on outcomes including rates of screening for
      acute kidney injury and the severity of acute kidney injury.
