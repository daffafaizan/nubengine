      disorders. This scale could be used as a practical tool to define chewing disorders as a
      common language for professionals due to its quick and easy to use features. However, its
      reliability in other professions has not been verified. The study will investigate to verify
      whether pediatric dentists could determine chewing performance level by using Karaduman
      Chewing Performance Scale in children.
