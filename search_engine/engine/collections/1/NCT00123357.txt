      Approximately 11,000 veterans annually are hospitalized with a newly acquired incident
      stroke. Based on American Heart Association ratios of stroke incidence and prevalence, up to
      80,000 veterans may be stroke survivors. The assessment of outcomes in stroke survivors is
      important for clinical practice and research, yet there is no consensus on the best measures
      of stroke outcome in either clinical practice or research. We have developed a new
      stroke-specific outcome measure, the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), to capture physical function
      and other dimensions of health-related quality of life.

      Objectives:

      The major research questions in this investigation are: 1) Does the SIS have concurrent and
      discriminate validity in a veteran stroke population when compared to the FIM, Rankin, and
      the SF-36V? 2) What effect does mode of administration have on response rates, bias, data
      quality, reliability and validity, SIS domain scores, and cost of data collection? 3) What
      factors differentiate responders and non-responders? 4) Will the SIS scores predict health
      care costs and utilization?

      Methods:

      Using ICD-9 discharge codes and electronic medical records, patients were screened for a
      valid diagnosis of stroke. At three months post-stroke, patients were randomly assigned to
      receive a mailed SIS instrument or SIS via telephone interview. At four months post-stroke,
      all respondents were evaluated using the Functional Independence Measure and SF-36V by
      telephone.

      Status:

      Completed.
