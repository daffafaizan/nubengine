mitotic lymphocytes in primary tissue cultures of normal and neoplastichuman lung .normal and tumor tissue explants from 33 resected human lungs werestudied in vitro . lymphocyte mitoses were observed in tissue culturesderived from 12 of the lungs . the ability of lymphocytes to undergomitotic division in human lung tissue culture has not been reportedpreviously . in the autologous systems used lymphocyte mitoses were muchmore common in cellular outgrowths derived from non-neoplastic tissuethan they were in the outgrowths derived from cancer-bearing explants .no differences were observed in the total number of nondividinglymphocytes present in the non-neoplastic and neoplastic preparations .the in ritro systems employed are promising tools for furthercontributions to an already well established clinicopathologicrelationship between lymphocytes and cancer cells .phase contrast and time-lapse cinephotomicrographic records wereobtained of the mitotic process and special attention was paid to thestructural details . certain findings were of particular interest,namely the formation of a dense chromatin ring during telophase, thevariable occurrence of cytoplasmic bubbling, and the death oflymphocytes during early metaphase (/exploding/ metaphase) . anelaboration and discussion of these findings have been presented .
