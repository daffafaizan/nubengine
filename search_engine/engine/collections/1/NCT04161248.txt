      effects when receiving R-GDP or an equivalent regimen. This is done by starting at a dose
      lower than the one that is tolerated in patients when given on its own. Participants are
      given the new drug together with R-GDP and are watched very closely to see what side effects
      they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side effects are not
      severe, then new participants will be given a higher dose of the new drug. Participants
      joining the study later on will get higher doses of the new drug than participants who join
      earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side
      effects. Doses higher than that will not be given.
