      Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) Questionnaire) and medical history, concomitant medication, vital
      signs, body mass index (BMI) and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) will be assessed, and a
      physical examination will be performed. Saliva samples will be collected for cotinine and
      nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) measurement, urine samples for urinary anabasine,
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), nicotine metabolites, tobacco-specific
      nitrosamines (TSNA), and VOC, and blood samples for genotyping, blood lipids, creatinine, and
      glucose.

      After randomization the open system vape device and the nicotine salt e-liquids will be
      distributed to the participants of the two active arms. Use of e-liquids in the active arms
      will be ad libitum during three months and will be monitored by returned empty e-liquid
      bottles and by documentation of pods use by the participants using a diary.

      All groups will receive smoking cessation counseling at baseline, week 1, week 2 and week 4.
      Visits at the center at baseline, week 4, and 3 months will include questionnaires regarding
      TC and EC use, respiratory symptoms, liking, and adverse events, measurement of heart rate,
      blood pressure, BMI, plasma HDL, LDL, creatinine and glucose, and measurement of urinary
      TSNA, VOC and nicotine metabolites. For participants self-reporting TC abstinence, exhaled CO
      validation and urinary anabasine and NNAL will be collected to verify tobacco abstinence.

      Follow-up visits also assessing TC abstinence will take place at 6 and 12 months.
