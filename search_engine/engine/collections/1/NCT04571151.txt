    
      This is a single-center, double-blind study. Approximately 30 qualified subjects will be
      enrolled into a 8 weeks study.

      The study drugs that will be used in this study are Lexette® (0.05% Halobetasol propionate
      foam) and Sorilux® (calcipotriene foam). Both Lexette and Sorilux are approved by the United
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat psoriasis.

      Subjects will be randomized to study treatment at a 1:1 ratio: of Lexette plus Sorilux for 2
      weeks versus Lexette plus vehicle for 2 weeks. Those subjects who are clear or almost clear
      at the end of 2 weeks will be re-randomized into Sorilux for 6 weeks versus vehicle for 6
      weeks at 1:1 ratio.

      Subjects will attend a Screening Visit/Baseline visit and if found eligible will be
      randomized to study treatment. Total study period is 8 weeks. Study visits will be,
      screening/baseline, week 2 and week 8. Study assessments will be at each visit: BSA, PGA,
      Itch VAS, DLQI, and TLSS in addition to standard medical assessments. There will be a
      standard prohibited medication/treatment and washout periods.
