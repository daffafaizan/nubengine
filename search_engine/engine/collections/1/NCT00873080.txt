      practice as in the research, for the diagnosis and physiotherapy treatment planning. The
      photogrammetry has been used as a valuable resource for the physiotherapist's diagnosis and
      verification of measuring postural changes, but the lack of standardization of anatomic
      references, the used angles between them and their meaning embarrasses comparison among
      studies.
