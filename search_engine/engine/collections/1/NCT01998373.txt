      The improvement in the signs of recovery for physical and mood symptoms in the patient
      training intervention group were seen (p < 0.05). The score of quality of life had
      significantly improved in the two groups (Mean difference was 9.31Â±3.03 and P<0.003). This
      improvement was significantly higher in the patient training intervention group (P=0.008).
      After adjustment for education level, the score of quality of life in patient training
      intervention group had a higher improvement, but the difference between the two groups was
      not significant (P = 0.1).

      Conclusions:

      This study showed the important role of training and the patients' educational level on
      better treatments. The appropriate training in the patient could create a change in the
      treatment process and has a better effect on quality of life.
