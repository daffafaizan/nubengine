    
      This is a Phase II trial, with a one year observational/baseline phase followed by a one year
      double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized, treatment phase. Approx. 137 grass
      pollen-allergic subjects and 20 non-allergic subjects will be enrolled in the baseline phase
      of the study. The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the relationship between
      allergy symptoms experienced by subjects (allergic and non-allergic) upon exposure to grass
      pollen-allergen in the EEC and the allergy symptoms experienced by subjects during the grass
      pollen season.
