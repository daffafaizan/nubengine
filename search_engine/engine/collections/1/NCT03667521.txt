      in this part of the body is often associated with the dissection of nerve bundels, a
      procedure which may finally lead to transient defecatory dysfunction. In a earlier study we
      could show that ~17.8% of patient with laparoscopic sacrocolpopexie developed postoperative
      constipation within 3-6 months. In november 2010 the Frauenklinik Aarau introduced a novel,
      nerve-sparing technique of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexie. In this study we assess the pre-and
      postoperative differences in defecatory dysfunction between the two procedures trough the
      analysis of our standard of care pelvic floor questionnaire.
