      available for viral infections and concern essentially allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
      These infections are associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. Data concerning AML
      are essentially retrospective, pediatric and with a little number of patients. Respiratory
      viral infections incidence is not known. These infections may be responsible for a higher
      mortality rate. Different risk factors are found: age superior to 65 years, lymphopenia,
      co-infections. Treatment is subject to a controversy: surveillance or starting an antiviral
      therapy. This study aims at understanding viral infections epidemiology during long term
      aplasia and optimizing their management.
