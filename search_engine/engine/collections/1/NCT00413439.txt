      immunosuppression susceptible to infections, including fungal infections. As the failure rate
      in the treatment of invasive fungal infections is high, prophylaxis is frequently
      recommended. This open label study investigates the safety and tolerability of two different
      dosages of a water soluble azole antifungal, as well as the efficacy in prevention of
      invasive fungal infections and pharmacokinetic data.
