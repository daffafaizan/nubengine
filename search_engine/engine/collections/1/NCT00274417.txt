      patients undergoing GreenLight Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate. PVP is a growing,
      outpatient surgical treatment for BPH. The addition of dutasteride may potentially improve
      both the short and long term outcomes. Use peri-operatively may improve visibility during
      surgery, shorten operative time, lessen bleeding both intra and post-operatively and hasten
      post-op recovery. Continued use long-term (12 months following the procedure) may improve
      overall symptomatic scores as combination therapy with PVP. The addition of dutasteride to
      PVP may decrease the occasional occurrence of continued post-op irritative symptoms and
      lessen the likelihood of the need for re-catheterization with overall improvement in quality
      of life.
