      until the retinitis progresses (observation group), or to intravenous HPMPC at the higher
      dose for two consecutive weekly induction doses, followed by the lower dose every other week
      for maintenance. In Stage 2, up to 70 patients are randomized to observation or to HPMPC at
      the higher dose for two consecutive weekly induction doses followed by either dose every
      other week for maintenance, for a total of three treatment groups. Concomitant saline
      hydration and probenecid are administered to patients receiving HPMPC.
