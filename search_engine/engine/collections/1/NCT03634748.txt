      proven to be safe and effective using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, in most of
      the thrombolyzing hospitals worldwide MR imaging is not available. We hypothesize that
      pragmatic non-contrast CT (NCCT)-based WUS/SUO thrombolysis may be feasible and safe.

      Methods: TRUST-CT is an international multicenter registry-based study. WUS/SUO patients
      undergoing NCCT-based thrombolysis with NIHSS ≥ 4 and initial ASPECTS ≥ 7 are included and
      compared to propensity score matched non-thrombolyzed WUS/SUO controls. Primary endpoint is
      symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH); secondary endpoints include 24-hour NIHSS change
      of ≥ 4 and modified Rankin Score (mRS) at 90 days.
