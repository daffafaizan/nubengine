      most likely visits are defined as "Inclusion visit" at which treatment with Tarka® is to be
      initiated, and then "Follow-up visit Week 4-6", "Follow-up visit Month 3 " and "Follow-up
      visit Month 6", although dates will depend only on the decision of the physician. For these
      reasons, the most likely visits are defined as "S/V" (Screening Visit), "F1" (Follow-up 1),
      "F2" (Follow-up 2), "F3" (Follow-up 3). The end point is compliance with Tarka® treatment by
      number/percentage of patients continued on fixed combination Tarka therapy after six months.
