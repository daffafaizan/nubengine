      to decrease food intake and subjective appetite feelings, to increase production of the
      satiety hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and cholecystokinin
      (CCK), and diminishes gastrointestinal (GI) motility. Amongst oils with different degree of
      fatty acid saturation, safflower oil (high in linoleic acid, C18:2) was found the strongest
      inducer of the ileal brake. When ingested orally, however, the major part of dietary lipids
      will be digested and absorbed in the proximal small intestine and are not likely to induce
      the ileal brake mechanism. Incorporating small lipid droplets into millimeter-sized calcium
      (Ca)-alginate gel particles has shown promising results for ileal brake activation. Oral
      intake of these lipid containing gels have proven to reduce food intake in humans without
      inducing gastrointestinal symptoms. Contrastingly, to date little is known about repetitive
      activation of mechanisms of satiety and the effect on food intake. It is not known whether
      repetitive ileal brake activation provides a stronger brake or whether this will lead to a
      blunted response and adaptation.
