      factors involved in the impact of COVID-19. WP that correspond to University Hospital
      Fundacion Jimenez Diaz are described in this register across different objectives:

      WP 3 (Dr Ayuso Garc√≠a) is aimed to analyze the genetic markers of host susceptibility
      associated with clinical evolution of COVID-19.

      WP 6 (Dr Ruiz Hornillos) will study the socio-economic and bioethical repercussions of
      COVID-19.

      WP 7 (Dr Perales) will analyze the complexity of the spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 mutants and their
      possible association with the evolutionary course of COVID-19

      This project will guide and individualize the clinical and therapeutic approach to COVID-19
      and mitigate the health and social impact of the pandemic.
