      (GDFM) protocols have been shown to decrease the length of hospital stay in various kinds of
      surgical procedures. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of conventional fluid
      management with Pleth Variability Index (PVI) guided on blood lactate, serum creatinine
      levels, postoperative kidney injury and the duration of hospital stay. Patients will be
      randomized to one of the study arms: group1 (conventional fluid management arm) will receive
      0.9 % NaCl at a rate of 4- 8 mL/kg/h, a 250-ml bolus crystalloid/ colloid injection will be
      administered when the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decreased below 65 mmHg.; group 2
      (GDFM); group 2 (GDFM group) will receive 0.9 % NaCl at rate of 2 mL/kg/h, a 250-mL bolus
      crystalloid/colloid injection will be administered when PVI is higher than 13 % over 5 min.
      In both groups, when MAP is still < 65 mmHg after fluid bolus infusion, 5 mg i.v. bolus
      ephedrine will be administered. The groups will be compared concerning postoperative blood
      lactate, serum creatinine levels, postoperative kidney injury and the duration of hospital
      stay.
