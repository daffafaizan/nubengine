      little data on the effect that different types and rates of intravenous (IV) fluids have
      during labor. Exercise physiologists have shown that increased fluid intake and carbohydrate
      replacement improve skeletal muscle performance in prolonged exercise. In a 1992 randomized,
      controlled study comparing IV fluid rates, Garite et al. showed a lower frequency of
      prolonged labor, and possibly a decreased need for oxytocin, with higher IV fluid rates in
      labor. Inadequate hydration may contribute to dysfunctional labor and possibly an increased
      rate of cesarean section.

      We propose that inadequate carbohydrate replacement in labor may also contribute to
      prolongation of labor and increased need for operative delivery. Glucose is the main energy
      supply for the pregnant uterus. Physiological requirements for glucose during labor are
      approximately 10 grams per hour. Adequate supplies of glucose are needed to maintain exercise
      tolerance and muscle efficiency, which are important factors in the progress of labor.
      Dysfunctional labor or dystocia, which is the leading indication for primary cesarean
      delivery, is caused by uterine forces insufficiently strong or inappropriately coordinated to
      efface and dilate the cervix. Dystocia can also be a result of inadequate voluntary muscle
      effort in the second stage of labor. It contributes to increased risk for chorioamnionitis,
      which is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Supplying
      carbohydrate fuel for working uterine and skeletal muscle may improve progress in labor and,
      therefore, diminish risk for chorioamnionitis and need for cesarean delivery.
