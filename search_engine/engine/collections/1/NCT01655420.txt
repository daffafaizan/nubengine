      the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), the Department of Defense, and
      the National Eye Institute (NEI). This project examines patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
      following LASIK surgery. This three-phased project is part of FDA's ongoing effort to better
      monitor and improve the safety and effectiveness of lasers used in LASIK surgery. PROWL-2 is
      the third phase of the larger LQOLCP project. The primary objective of PROWL-2 is to explore
      the psychometric properties of a computer-based questionnaire assessing the patient-reported
      outcomes of satisfaction and ophthalmic-related quality of life before and over a period of 3
      months following LASIK. This questionnaire initially developed and examined in PROWL-1 (a
      military population) will be examined psychometrically in a civilian population. PROWL-2 is a
      prospective, multi-center, observational study in which a participant's pre-operative status
      will serve as the baseline for one-month and three-month post-surgical comparisons. Three
      hundred (300) participants planning to undergo refractive surgery using LASIK for myopia,
      hyperopia, or astigmatism will be enrolled in this study from five (5) clinical sites across
      the United States. Additionally, routine clinical data will be collected pre- and
      post-operatively (e.g., best corrected visual acuity, manifest refraction, wavefront
      aberrometry, conreal topography, and other clinical assessments) and questionnaires will be
      independently administered pre-operatively and at the one-month and three-month
      post-operative visits.
