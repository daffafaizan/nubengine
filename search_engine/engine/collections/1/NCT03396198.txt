      development. As we all know, the gut microbiota can influence gut maturation, metabolic,
      immune and brain development in early life. Host genotype, gestational age, antibiotic use,
      mode of delivery, diet and the context in which the infant is born (rural vs urban, presence
      of siblings, pets and other factors) can influence the development of infant gut microbiota.
      In the early life stage, intestinal flora disorders may alter the host immune function and
      increase the susceptibility to immune or metabolic diseases.

      This research intends to establish a birth cohort of healthy newborns. The influence factors
      of gastrointestinal microbiome will be investigated by means of questionnaire survey,
      specimen collection and high throughput sequencing analysis. What's more, the correlation of
      gut microbiome, infant growth as well as related diseases will be explored either. The
      results will provide constructive suggestions for the establishment of infant normal
      intestinal flora and play an indispensable role in exploring the occurrence, development and
      prevention of related diseases.
