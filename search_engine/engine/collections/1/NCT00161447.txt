      suppressive effects of acyline when administered in combination with Testosterone (T) and the
      progestin depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA).

      We will be administering combinations of three drugs: Testosterone (T) by gel, Depot
      Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and Acyline to see their effects on sperm production. The
      T/DMPA/Acyline combination will allow us to determine if the more rapid and complete
      gonadotropin suppression mediated by the early addition of a GnRH antagonist will accelerate
      and enhance suppression of spermatogenesis.

      In prior studies with testosterone and DMPA these drug, which are hormones, have been found
      to be safe, and to reversibly suppress sperm counts to zero in about 80% of men. We hope to
      improve this to 100% of men by adding another drug, Acyline.

      Acyline is an GnRH antagonist which blocks the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary. DMPA
      is approved by the FDA for use as a female contraceptive. The endpoint will be suppression of
      spermatogenesis to zero (azoospermia) by the end of the treatment phase.
