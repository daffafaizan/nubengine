      crystalloid and colloid solutions on outcome remain unknown.

      Previously, a high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch, HES 200, was used, but this was
      found to cause acute kidney failure in patients with severe sepsis. As kidney failure is an
      independent risk factor for death in these patients, HES 200 is not used anymore. In stead a
      lower molecular weight starch, HES 130, has been developed. Presently, this is the preferred
      colloid in Scandinavian intensive care units (ICU), but the effects of HES 130 in ICU
      patients are currently unknown. The proposed Scandinavian multicentre study will be conducted
      to assess if HES 130 contributes to acute kidney failure in patients with severe sepsis. As
      HES 130 is widely used, the trial will provide important safety data to clinicians who
      resuscitate septic patients.
