      responds to conventional hormonal treatment. When hormone therapy is no longer successful,
      chemotherapy is a treatment option. However, current single-agent treatment has shown to have
      limited benefit. In this clinical trail, investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of
      Zoledronate(Zometa) combined with Estramustine and Docetaxel (Taxotere) in the treatment of
      patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer. Zometa is a bisphosphonate, and may reduce
      or delay skeletal complications caused by bone metastases. Estramustine and Taxotere are
      chemotherapy drugs that have shown activity in hormone refractory prostate cancer. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to receive Estramustine and Docetaxel (Taxotere) in combination
      with Zometa or Zometa given alone.
