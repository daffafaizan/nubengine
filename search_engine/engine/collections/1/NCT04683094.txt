      Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE), which was developed in the 1980s for
      predicting mortality, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS), and Mortality Probability
      Model (MPM). Although these scoring systems use different variables and weights for the
      classification of disease severity, they commonly monitor parameters such as heart rate,
      blood pressure, neurological state, and clinical data as these factors significantly deviate
      from physiological normality in the progression of critical disease. Old age and chronic
      disease are also captured by the scoring systems. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
      score, which is based on organ failure over time to evaluate morbidity and multiple organ
      dysfunction is also used.
