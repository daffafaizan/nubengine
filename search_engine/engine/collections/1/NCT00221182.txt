      atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. Prognosis of chronic MI is poor, and no effective
      treatments have been established in patients who are not eligible for the traditional
      revascularization therapies such as angioplasty and bypass procedures due to the
      inappropriate anatomy of the coronary arteries or frequent reocclusion following
      revascularization. Therefore, it is necessary to establish novel revascularization treatment
      to improve prognosis of the no-option patients. We will study the safety and clinical
      efficiency of vascular regeneration by means of transplantation of autologous peripheral
      blood endothelial progenitor cells (CD34 positive cells) in patients with severe chronic
      coronary artery disease (CAD) who are not eligible for traditional revascularization
      treatments. The primary endpoint is the severity of myocardial ischemia identified by
      sestamibi SPECT stress myocardial scintigraphy and the evaluation of adverse effect rates,
      while the secondary endpoints are evaluation of CCSAS and NYHA classification, regional
      myocardial blood flow as revealed by PET scan, and various left ventricular function indices.
