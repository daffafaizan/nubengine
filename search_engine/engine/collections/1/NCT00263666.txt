      mildly symptomatic (WHO stages I and II) of disease will be enrolled. The study will have two
      groups: Group HRV and Group Placebo. Three-dose immunisation will be administered at
      approximately 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Routine EPI (Expanded Program on Immunisation)
      vaccinations will be administered concomitantly with the study vaccines. At the time of first
      dose, subjects will be aged 6 to 10 weeks. This study will evaluate safety, reactogenicity
      and immunogenicity of the HRV vaccine relative to the placebo.
