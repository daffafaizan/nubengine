      from upper airway brushing. A previous prospective study (I-IsBac) showed a change in ciliary
      beat (in terms of coordination and frequency) in bacterial rhinosinusitis. The study of
      ex-vivo ciliary movement appears to be an interesting tool to understand the pathophysiology
      of CSRs and to guide and evaluate treatment.

      A new tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the ex-vivo lash beat has been developed. This
      tool measures shear stress by tracking balls along the ciliary margin.

      This measurement of ex-vivo shear stress by bead tracking is a validated technique. However,
      microbead tracking is limited by its low spatial and temporal resolution, long measurement
      time and heavy post-processing of acquisition data, making this method difficult to use in
      clinical routine. Monitoring ex-vivo fluorescent nano-batons could represent a simpler
      alternative for the clinician. This measurement is now made possible by Phosphate Lanthanum
      Lanthanum Nano-batons (LaPO4) whose luminescence is directly proportional to the shear.

      The objective of this research project is to validate this new tool in patients with CSR by
      comparing it to a group of control subjects free of nasal inflammation.
