    
      This is a prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial involving 4 orthopedic surgeons who
      perform Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty (RTKA), including Trevor Murray (PI), Viktor Krebs,
      Robert Molloy, and Carlos Higuera. A total of eighty subjects scheduled for RTKA, who meet
      all inclusion criteria and exhibit none of the exclusion criteria will be invited to
      participate in the study. Only subjects who sign the Institutional Review Board-approved
      Informed Consent Form will be entered into the Study.

      In the forty treatment Subjects, VG will be applied to each surgical site. The forty control
      subjects will receive the surgeon's standard of care, without the use of any other hemostatic
      agents. The subjects will not be informed of their assignment, and the research investigator
      making the determination on blood transfusion requirements for all study subjects will also
      be blinded to the subject assigned arm of the study. The research investigator performing
      RTKA will remain blinded to the study arm until the randomization envelope is opened, which
      will take place during surgery, after hemostasis is achieved using bovie electrocautery, and
      prior to closure of the knee capsule.

      Assessments will be made per the Time and Events Schedule.

      Subjects will be evaluated for intra- and post-operative complications, and all such events,
      should they occur, will be recorded during the course of the study. Details describing the
      event, cause of event, its treatment and resolution will be documented.
