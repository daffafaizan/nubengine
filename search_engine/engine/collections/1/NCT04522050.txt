      confirmed as a differentiated or undifferentiated non-keratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
      the patient is eligible to participate in the study. Patients receive gemcitabine (1000mg/m²
      d1,8) and cisplatin (80mg/m², d1) every 3 weeks for 2 cycles before radiotherapy. And then
      intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is given a total dose of GTVnx 70Gy, GTVnd 66Gy, CTV1
      60Gy and CTV2 54Gy for 33 times in total, concurrently with gemcitabine. The initial dose of
      gemcitabine is 25mg/m² once a week for 6 times. The patients are divided into 9 groups
      (25mg/m², 50mg/m², 100mg/m², 200mg/m², 300mg/m², 350mg/m², 400mg/m², 450mg/m², 500mg/m²) with
      6 patients in each group. Considering about 20% of the cases of dropout, withdrawal, and loss
      to follow-up in clinical trials, a total of 65 cases are needed in this study. The efficacy
      is evaluated according to the European Solid Tumor Efficacy Evaluation Standard (RECIST1.1).
      After induction chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and 3 months after radiotherapy, nasopharyngeal
      endoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging of the would be reviewed for 1 year, 2 years, and 3
      years to evaluate the curative effect. The chest CT, abdominal B-ultrasound, bone scan or
      PETCT examinations are reviewed to exclud distant metastases. Biopsy diagnosis can be
      performed for patients suspected of local residual and recurrence.
