      Technology. The GEMS-H is worn around the waist and fastened at the waist and thighs by a set
      of belts with velcro to assist motion at the hip joints. The device weighs 2.1kg, and has 2
      brushless direct current motors running on a rechargeable lithium ion battery. The normal
      operation time for the device is 2 hours. The GEMS-H is available in three sizes to fit
      various waist/hip sizes: small, medium, and large. The width of each version can be adjusted
      further to fit individual body size within the circumference range. Also, the thigh frames
      are available in three sizes (large, medium, and small) for different leg lengths. It is
      controlled through a custom built application on a hand held tablet.

      Participants will be normal adults with community-dwelling older adults aged 19-85.

      Participants will be scheduled for 24 training sessions of training plus 3 sessions of
      testing (pre-training, mid-test after the 12 sessions of training, post-training).
