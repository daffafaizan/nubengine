      developing world. Reduced rates of these diseases have been measured during intensive,
      home-based handwashing interventions. We evaluated a school-based handwashing program for 1st
      grade students to determine whether a more scalable intervention could also reduce illness
      rates, and impact hygiene knowledge and attitudes.

      Thirty schools from each of 3 counties in Fujian Province, China, were randomized to one of
      the following groups: a) control; b) standard intervention, which included a handwashing
      program (1 hour of hygiene instruction and 1 soap sample kit per pupil); or c) expanded
      intervention, which included the handwashing program, soap for school sinks and 1 peer
      hygiene monitor per class. Teachers collected illness symptom information from students
      weekly and recorded student absences daily between January and April, 2005. Mean illness and
      absence rates were calculated for each school. Students were given a knowledge, attitudes,
      and practices questionnaire before the intervention and again 5 months later.
