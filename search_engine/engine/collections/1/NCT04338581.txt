    
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy of interleukin-15 (IL-15)
      inhibition with AMG 714 at inducing facial repigmentation in vitiligo.

      The secondary objectives are to:

      -Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 714 in vitiligo- -Determine the efficacy of
      IL-15 inhibition with AMG 714 at inducing total body skin repigmentation in vitiligo-

        -  Assess the durability of the skin repigmentation achieved by AMG 714 in vitiligo, and

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of AMG 714 followed by narrow band UVB (nbUVB) phototherapy.
