      purpose, they utilize a wide range of interventions for the management of Low back pain.

      The rhythmical movement is thought to modulate pain and muscle spasm by stimulating receptors
      within the mobilized structures while, In recent years, neurodynamic test procedures, have
      also been used as interventions to potentially resolve abnormal physiology within the nervous
      system.
