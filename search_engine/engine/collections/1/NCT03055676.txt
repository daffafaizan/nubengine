      association between the time of removal of drain after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and
      incidence of major complications (grade 2-4 complications). The investigators unite six
      pancreatic surgery center in Beijing. Patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or
      pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) with low to moderate risk of post-operative
      pancreatic fistula (POPF) are recruited into the study. After obtaining informed consent,
      eligible patients are randomly allocated to early or late drain removal group on POD 3. In
      the group A, drain(s) are removed on POD 3, whereas in group B drain is removed on POD 5 or
      beyond. The primary outcomes are the incidence of sum of grade 2-4 complications, the
      secondary outcomes include grade B/C POPF, intra-abdominal infeciton, delayed gastric
      emptying, post-operative bleeding, in-hospital stay, total medical cost and comprehensive
      complication index (CCI).
