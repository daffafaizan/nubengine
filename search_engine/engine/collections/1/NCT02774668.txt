      Such a diet with low carbohydrate lowers the serum uric acid concentration which is a factor
      associated with obesity and also represents a particular metabolic risk in women compared to
      men. The present weight loss study will determine whether women benefit more than men to
      short-term weight loss occurring during restriction of simple sugars.

      Specifically, this study is designed to cause weight loss acutely through consumption of a
      diet that is restricted in calorie and simple sugars. Both men and women will be studied and
      their results compared to determine whether women benefit more with respect to arterial
      stiffness. Upon finishing the four-week diet intervention, body weight and blood lipids will
      be assessed two and four weeks later to compare the longer term effect on blood pressure.
