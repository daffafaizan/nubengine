      but in 20% of patients surgery is not feasible due to vascular invasion or poor general
      conditions. These patients with stage III pancreatic cancer (locally advanced or borderline
      resectable) may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The HybridTherm
      probe is a new, minimally invasive device that can be safely applied under EUS guidance to
      locally ablate the pancreatic tissue adding a local efficacy to the systemic activity offered
      by chemotherapy and could give these patients a bigger chance of survival. The present study
      is an interventional randomized controlled phase II/III trial (device), that assigns patients
      into two groups: patients receiving standard chemotherapy alone and those receiving
      chemotherapy plus EUS-guided HybridTherm ablation. The randomization is performed at the time
      of EUS diagnosis and staging.
