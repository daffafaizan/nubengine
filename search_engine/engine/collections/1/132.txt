the action of metal ions on tobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid .added transition metal ions stabilize the secondary structure oftobacco mosaic virus ribonucleic acid (tmv-rna) as evidenced by areduction in the absorbancy change of heated nucleic acid solutions . inspite of this stabilization of secondary structure, heating in thepresence of metal ions results in the loss of biological activity due tothe hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds . thus, all heavy metal ions ofthe iib and first-transition elements studied caused a rapid loss ofbiological activity of tmv-rna at ph 6.5 and 65 . calcium and magnesiumions, while not affecting secondary structure at 65 and ph 8.5, caused arapid loss of biological activity . at ph 5.8 and room temperature leadions catalyzed the hydrolysis of rna to i'(3')- mononucleotides,. onlong standing, nucleosides were formed .
