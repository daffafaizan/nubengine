      thoracic surgery, despite receiving effective thoracic epidural analgesia. This pain has been
      described as constant, aching in quality, unrelated to position change or respiration.
      Possible causes of shoulder pain includes injury of the phrenic nerve, the lateral decubitus
      position, transection of major bronchus or preexisting arthritis condition. The possibilities
      of prevention and management of PISP are taken into consideration. Thoracic epidural block
      will be performed in all patients before general anesthesia.
