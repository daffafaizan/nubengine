      I. Determine the safety and efficacy of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced with
      the anti-CD19 (cluster of differentiation antigen 19 ) vector (referred to as CART-19 cells)
      in elderly patients with MCL.

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-19 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-19 TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-19 cell
      infusions.

      Estimate relative trafficking of CART-19 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.

      Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-19 (loss of engraftment).
