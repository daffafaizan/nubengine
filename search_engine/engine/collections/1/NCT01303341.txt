      I. To define a safe dose of sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) to combine with riluzole in the
      treatment of patients with all types of solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or for
      whom no standard therapy exists.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the correlation of clinical or radiologic response with signaling through the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B
      (AKT) pathways.

      II. To determine if response to therapy with riluzole and sorafenib correlates with
      expression levels of B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2, myeloid cell leukemia (MCL)-1, or BCL2-like 11
      (apoptosis facilitator) (BIM).

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the combination of riluzole with sorafenib and
      determine if any drug-drug interactions exist.

      IV. To evaluate the microvesicle (an inter-cellular communication approach which may cargo
      proteins, ribonucleic acids [RNAs] and deoxyribonucleic acids [DNAs] to its host cell)
      quantification difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment peripheral blood samples
      of patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sorafenib tosylate.

      Patients receive riluzole orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and sorafenib tosylate PO once daily
      (QD) or BID on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for approximately 2-3 years.
