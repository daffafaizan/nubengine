      the assessments visits with clinical scores, MRI TMS and EEG recordings. These are made
      before the training (V1), immediately after the 6 weeks of training (V9) and 6 weeks after
      (V10) V5 is a visit where the investigators will clinically assess the patients at three
      weeks of the training.

      The other visits (V2, V3, V4, V6, V7, V8) consist in recording an EEG while patients are
      under training each week during six weeks.
