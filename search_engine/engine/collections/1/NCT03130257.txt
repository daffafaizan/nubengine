      clinic, home, and kiosk BP testing to 24-hour BP ambulatory monitoring. The investigators
      will look at the impact of the study on outcomes that matter to participants: their BP and
      whether participants feel better or worse overall, worry about BP, and change health
      behaviors (e.g., lowering salt intake).

      Our study team includes patients. The study team also has patient and stakeholder advisors to
      ensure our study is conducted properly and is not a burden to patients and providers. The
      investigators will share study results with patient participants and publish papers in
      scientific journals.
