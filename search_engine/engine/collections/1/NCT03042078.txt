      arrhythmias. As we all know,fluoroscopic radiation is harmful both to the patients and the
      operation staffs. Recently,three-dimensional navigation systems have been developed and
      implemented in electrophysiological procedures for guiding catheters inside the heart
      chambers. Among the three-dimensional navigation systems, Ensite NavX is a promising system
      used for zero-fluoroscopic approach for performing catheter ablation of paroxysmal
      supraventricular tachycardia. This study is aimed to compare the feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of a zero-fluoroscopic approach using Ensite NavX with conventional fluoroscopic
      approach using Ensite NavX plus fluoroscopy for the ablation of paroxysmal supraventricular
      tachycardia.
