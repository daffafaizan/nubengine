    
      In order to determine how many participants must be recruited to detect 95% of the
      anticipated use errors, two groups of participants (naives or informed to the type of device
      under evaluation) will take part to usability test of a demo version of an auto injector pen
      in one of two test environments (realistic or laboratory-like). The combination of the 2
      types of users and the two types of environment composes 4 arms.

      By default, 15 participants will be recruited per arm (in conformity with usual guidelines).
      If, in a given group, 95% of anticipated errors are detected, no more participants will be
      recruited in the arm. Otherwise, 5 other participants will be recruited till the 95%
      threshold is reached with a maximum of 40 participants per group.
