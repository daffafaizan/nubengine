      describe the incidence of clinical features in adults with internal ventriculoperitoneal
      shunt infections, to determine the validity of laboratory parameters in adults with internal
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections and to evaluate the relationship between the timing of
      shunt re-implantation with the rates of relapse and secondary infection.
