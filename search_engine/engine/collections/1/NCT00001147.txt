      dysautonomia, pheochromocytoma, hypertension, or neurogenetic diseases involving
      catecholaminergic systems. The blood is used to establish normal values for plasma levels of
      catechols and related neurochemicals; test for abnormal neurochemical patterns in patients;
      and establish a "bank" of DNA samples from normal volunteers and from patients, to be used in
      future studies about mutations or polymorphisms of catecholamine-related genes.
