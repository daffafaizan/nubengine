    
      This is an open-label, dose escalation study designed to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of GNKG168 in patients with B-CLL that has
      relapsed or is refractory to all prior standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy
      exists.

      As secondary objectives, baseline TLR-9 intracellular staining of B-CLL cells, and in vitro
      assays to assess the potential of B-CLL cells to undergo apoptosis in conjunction with
      GNKG168 therapy will be examined. Baseline characteristics of B-CLL will be examined
      including interphase genetics, FISH CLL, IgVH mutational status, expression of ZAP70,
      β2-microglobulin and the expression of the prognostic marker CD38 in peripheral blood cells
      (at baseline and during treatment) and baseline immune SNPs (FcγRIIIa, FcγRIIa, TNF-α, IFN-γ,
      CD40 and others). As pharmacodynamics parameters, the expression of B-cell and T-cell
      activation markers (including IL-21 receptor upregulation), NK cell markers, and cytokines
      will be investigated.

      This clinical trial will also assess the ability of B CLL patients treated with GNKG168 to
      elicit anti pneumococcal antibodies in response to adjuvant vaccination with the Prevnar™
      vaccine.
