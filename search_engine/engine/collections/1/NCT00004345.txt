      Arm I (adipose tissue study): Adipose tissue is collected from the buttocks of patients with
      Usher II retinitis pigmentosa (RP), patients with non-Usher RP, and control subjects. Dietary
      histories are obtained from all patients and subjects.

      Arm II (isotope study): Patients meeting the same criteria as in arm I receive oral
      D5-labeled linolenic acid and oral D4-labeled linolenic acid that is dissolved in oil and
      incorporated into foods. Subjects must avoid eating fish and shellfish during the 35 days of
      the isotope study. Blood samples are collected at 0, 8, 24, and 48 hours, daily on days 3-7,
      and then on days 10, 18, and 35.

      Arm III (flaxseed oil feeding): Patients with all types of RP and control subjects receive
      flaxseed oil, a form of linolenic acid, for 12 weeks. Subjects may also receive high oleic
      safflower oil or olive oil as a control fat for 12 weeks. Subjects complete a diet history at
      the end of each fatty acid supplementation period. All subjects must follow a diet free of
      seafood and fish oil supplements.
