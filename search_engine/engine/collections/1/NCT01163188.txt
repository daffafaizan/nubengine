      birthweight) and their controls of the Bavarian Longitudinal Study (BLS) at the age of 24-27
      years. All probands have been assessed previously, neonatally and at additional six time
      points, the last time at the age of 12-13 years. The focus will be the identification of
      risk, protective and resiliency factors for cognitive and behavioural development and quality
      of life. On the basis of previously assessed data statistical modelling of child development
      until age 8.5 years will be conducted across the total range of gestation from 26-42 weeks to
      identify social factors amenable to intervention which could be associated with a positive
      development especially in moderate prematurity. In addition, cross-validation of the findings
      is planned by means of comparisons with three international studies (Millenium Cohort, GB;
      POPS, NL; EPICure, GB). MRIs of the central nervous system will be conducted to examine
      aberrant activation patterns during the "attention network task" in stratified subgroups.
      Data driven MRI methods will be evaluated in relation to clinical, behavioural and
      developmental parameters. In line with the objectives of funding there will be a further
      follow-up of the BLS to answer important questions regarding health and development of very
      small preterms.
