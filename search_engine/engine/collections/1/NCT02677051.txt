      improves core symptoms in autism. It is designed to try to replicate a previous trial
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01474993) which reported that the isothiocyanate,
      sulforaphane treatment led to improvement by multiple metrics. Significant improvement was
      seen in behavior as measured by the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC) and by the Social
      Responsiveness Scale (SRS). In addition a significantly greater number of participants
      receiving sulforaphane had improvement in social interaction, abnormal behavior, and verbal
      communication as per the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). In addition The investigators will
      attempt to account for some variability in response to sulforaphane treatment by testing
      alleles of genes that are relevant in sulforaphane metabolism. The investigators will also
      measure glutathione levels, which are also important in sulforaphane metabolism and are in
      part regulated by sulforaphane..

      Sulforaphane is the most potent naturally occurring inducer of mammalian cytoprotective
      enzymes known. Therapeutic potential is based at least in part on their ability to
      up-regulate genes responsible for alleviation of oxidative stress and to regulate both the
      immune system and the inflammatory response

      40 Males with autistic disorder will be randomly selected to receive either sulforaphane or
      placebo. Seven visits are required by the subjects including enrollment ,screening, baseline,
      weeks 4, 10 and 18 and a follow up visit at seek 22.
