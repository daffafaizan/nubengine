      effects of BPA on reproduction are limited. Animal and in vitro studies indicate that BPA
      exposure can lead to disrupted oocyte maturation, E2 suppression and early pregnancy loss
      caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In the woman, studies about the consequences of BPA
      exposure on reproduction is a very difficult task since gametogenesis in the woman spreads
      over decades, from the intra-uterine life where meiosis is initiated to the end of the
      reproductive period at menopause. Recently, a decreased survival of human foetal oocytes
      cultured in vitro in the presence of BPA has been shown suggesting that in vivo exposure in
      foetal life could affect the ovarian reserve. Furthermore, a negative association between
      urinary BPA level and serum peak E2, oocyte yield and blastocyst formation has been suggested
      on a limited population of women performing ART. These results suggest that, in adulthood,
      both quantity and quality of human oocytes could be affected by BPA exposures. The study aims
      to respond to these questions by evaluating the relationships between BPA exposition levels
      and embryo implantation rates (as a marker of oocyte quality) and anti-Mullerian hormon (AMH)
      levels (as a marker of ovarian reserve) in large population of young adult women performing
      ART. BPA exposure will be assessed at two times in both blood and urine: 1°) before the
      ovarian stimulation at the time of ovarian reserve tests and 2°) at the end of the ovarian
      stimulation the day of the ovarian puncture for IVF.
