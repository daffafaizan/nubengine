      quality-of-life and health economic data to evaluate the benefits of two types of minimally
      invasive weight-loss surgery; and to support multi-disciplinary bariatric sites in Germany by
      providing structured procedure guidelines and training, therefore facilitating procedural
      adoption, increasing safety and shortening the learning curve for weight-loss surgery.
