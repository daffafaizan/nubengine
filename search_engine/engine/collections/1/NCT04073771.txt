      ill patients. Patients with septic shock combined sepsis-associated Acute kidney injury
      (AKI)have even poorer outcome.

      Endotoxin activity, inflammation and immune dysfunction, have been consider relevant to their
      pathogenesis of sepsis. High levels of Inflammation are associated with worse clinical
      outcomes. However, all studies of anti-inflammation treatment in sepsis patient are failed
      and anti-inflammation treatment of sepsis still remains controversial.

      oXiris is a new filter with adsorptive membrane, which removes endotoxin and inflammatory
      mediator from plasma. But current evidence of oXiris is limited, and only some small sample
      studies have proved that it can improve the haemodynamics and the sepsis-related organ
      failure assessment(SOFA) score.

      Our hypothesis was that oXiris would be associated with better clinical outcomes, such as
      decreased SOFA score, improved survival rate, better hemodynamic, and improved of organ
      function.
