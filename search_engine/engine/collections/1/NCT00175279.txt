      clinical practice, there have been few controlled studies of their effect, and almost none
      have attempted to change prescribing in the community for chronic conditions such as
      congestive heart failure (CHF) or ischemic heart disease (IHD). These two conditions are
      common and there is very good evidence about how to best prevent morbidity and mortality -
      and very good evidence that quality of care is, in general, suboptimal. Practice audits have
      demonstrated that about half of eligible CHF patients are prescribed ACE inhibitors (and
      fewer still reaching appropriate target doses) and less than one-third of patients with
      established IHD are prescribed statins (with many fewer reaching recommended cholesterol
      targets). It is apparent that interventions to improve quality of prescribing are urgently
      needed.

      HYPOTHESIS: An intervention that consists of patient-specific one-page evidence summaries,
      generated and then endorsed by local opinion leaders, will be able to change prescribing
      practices of community-based primary care physicians.

      DESIGN: A single centre randomized controlled trial comparing an opinion leader intervention
      to usual care. Based on random allocation of all physicians in one large Canadian health
      region, patients with CHF or IHD (not receiving ACE inhibitors or statins, respectively)
      recruited from community pharmacies will be allocated to intervention or usual care. The
      primary outcome is improvement in prescription of proven efficacious therapies for CHF (ACE
      inhibitors) or IHD (statins) within 6 months of the intervention.
