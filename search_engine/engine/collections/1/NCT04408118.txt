    
      Men and women age ≥ 18 years with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that is not amenable to resection with
      curative intent regardless of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status.

      The number of patients to be included is 100 patients. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the efficacy -in terms of progression-free survival (PFS)- of first line atezolizumab in
      combination with paclitaxel and bevacizumab (Avastin®) in patients with unresectable locally
      advanced or metastatic TNBC.

      After signing the ICF and confirmed eligibility, patients will begin treatment on 28 days
      cycles: Atezolizumab (840 mg) intravenously on days 1 and 15; Paclitaxel (90 mg/m2) via IV
      infusion on days 1, 8 and 15; Bevacizumab (Avastin® 10mg/kg) intravenously on days 1 and 15.

      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason.

      Patients discontinuing the study treatment will enter a post- treatment follow-up period
      until death, withdrawal of consent, patient is lost to follow-up, or study termination.
