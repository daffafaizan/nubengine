      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose, or MTD) of AZD2171 when
      combined with WBRT in patients with brain metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the objective response rate (ORR) in the central nervous system (CNS),
      neurologic progression-free survival (N-PFS), overall survival, and cause of death, and to
      explore the vascular normalization window using serial, noninvasive imaging parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral cediranib maleate on day 1. Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy 5
      days a week for 3 weeks beginning on day 3. Treatment continues treatment in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
