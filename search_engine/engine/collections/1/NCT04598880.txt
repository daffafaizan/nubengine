    
      This study will be performed in 1104 patients with a scheduled colonoscopy for any
      indication, who need a bowel preparation for the colonoscopy.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups with a 1:1 allocation using
      block sizes of 6 cases in each center. The treatment assignment will be open to the
      participant and the physician. The investigator who performs the colonoscopy and assesses the
      primary outcome (digestive endoscopist) will be blinded.

      In both treatment groups, participants will receive instructions about colonoscopy
      preparation. Laxative treatment (PEG1A/PSCM) will be administered in two doses, at 9 pm on
      the day before intervention and 5 hours before colonoscopy, on an outpatient basis.

      The day of the colonoscopy appointment will be the final visit of the study. The participant
      will be asked through a questionnaire about adherence to instructions, tolerance and
      acceptability to the preparation, and the appearance of side effects. No follow-up period is
      considered after intervention.
