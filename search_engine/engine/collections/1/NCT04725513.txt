      participants will be randomized into one of three treatment arms: 1) physical therapy only;
      2) physical therapy and shockwave therapy; 3) physical therapy, shockwave therapy and
      photobiomodulation. At 3 months, patients can choose to switch to a different treatment arm
      than they were initially randomized.
