    
      This is an open cohort study design where the investigators will analyze existing data that
      have been prospectively collected in the Swedish Hernia Registry (SHR), which covers > 95% of
      all groin hernia repairs in Sweden. The very large cohort of more than 38,000 TEP (totally
      extraperitoneal) and TAPP (transabdominal preperitoneal) repairs enables assessment of the
      relative risks for recurrence depending on complex combinations of plausible risk factors, in
      particular mesh, mesh fixation, hernia size and hernia type, with fulfilling statistical
      power.

      Each participant was entered at the date of surgery, when demographic and intraoperative data
      were registered. Reoperations were registered in the SHR in the same manner as index repairs,
      and were used as endpoints.
