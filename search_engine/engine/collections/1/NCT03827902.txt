    
      This is a two-arm non-randomized convenient pilot trial to assess impact of an active
      glycemic management model through remote glucose monitoring technology amongst patients with
      DFUWI and poor glycemic control at the Parkland Diabetes Foot & Wound clinic. The plan is to
      implement a remote glucose monitoring technology to facilitate improved glycemic management
      and control. A cellular enabled glucose meter that will upload blood glucose measurements to
      a cloud server accessible by providers who can remotely review glycemic trends and remotely
      provide patients with proactive recommendations for treatment adjustments will be used.
      Patients receiving services in the integrated care model (same day visits in the Foot Wound
      and Diabetes Clinics at Parkland) will be eligible for inclusion in the intervention arm
      which includes proactive glucose monitoring guided by remote glucose monitoring technology.
      Patients receiving usual care services (non-integrated care model clinic days where Foot
      Wound and Diabetes Clinic visits are on separate days) will be eligible for inclusion in the
      control arm. The expectation is that patients in the intervention arm will experience greater
      improvements in glycemic control, compared to the usual care model. The hypothesis is that
      improved glycemic control in these patients will result in faster healing of diabetic foot
      wound, infections or ulcers. The effectiveness of the technologically facilitated integrated
      model of care will be evaluated compared to the usual care using metrics for diabetic foot
      ulcers and wound healing, glycemic control, patient reported outcomes, health resource
      utilization and medication adherence after 6 months of intervention. The Telcare 2.0 BGM for
      remote self-blood glucose monitoring(FDA Cleared) will be used.
