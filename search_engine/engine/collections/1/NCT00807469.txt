    
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

        -  Local inflammation before and after cigarette smoking assessed by exhaled breath
           condensate, microprobe sampling and bronchial biopsies.

        -  Systemic inflammation before and after cigarette smoking assessed by the expression of
           established and newly developed markers on innate immune cells associated with
           pre-activation.

        -  Extensive clinical characterisation including life style factors, lung function, CT
           scanning of the lung.

        -  Corticosteroid responsiveness of epithelial cells in vitro.

        -  Distribution of candidate genes (SNPs) for COPD between the 5 different groups ( see
           description below) and associations with the inflammatory responses on acute smoking.
