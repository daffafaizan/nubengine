      planning clinics in Atlanta integrating PrEP into their services and evaluating the
      multi-level factors associated with PrEP reach, level of adoption, and implementation (e.g.,
      PrEP screening and prescription) within and across these clinics while also evaluating the
      effect on PrEP uptake, continuation, and adherence over a six-month follow-up period.
      Variation exists among types of family planning clinics, and this variation could have an
      impact on how clinics decide to implement, integrate, and even sustain PrEP services. This
      study will evaluate three family planning clinics as they adopt and sustain PrEP into their
      routine services to capture details of the implementation process unique to each clinic type,
      as well as commonalities across the clinics, with the ultimate aim to evaluate the impact of
      the implementation on the primary outcome (PrEP uptake, adherence, and continuation).
