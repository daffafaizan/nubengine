      dentifrice arm. Enrolled subjects will also be randomly assigned to either right or left side
      mandibular stent.

      During the induction phase (i.e., day 0 to day 21), participants are instructed to refrain
      from all hygiene procedures in the stent area. During this time period, participants evenly
      distributed 2mL of their assigned dentifrice into their stent, allowing it to come into
      contact with the areas of experimental gingivitis for two minutes twice daily while
      traditional tooth brushing was performed in the non-stent areas. Clinical measures, saliva,
      gingival crevicular fluid and plaque samples will be collected at days 0, 14, 21, and 35
      study visits. A randomization chart will be used to identify which two sites (teeth and tooth
      surface) will be used at the specific study visit for collection of gingival crevicular
      fluid(GCF) and plaque.
