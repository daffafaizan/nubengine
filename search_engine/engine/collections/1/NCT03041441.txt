    
      Subjects with known intracranial hypotension who are scheduled to undergo standard-of-care
      CSF pressure measurement using lumbar puncture prior to planned epidural patch treatment will
      first undergo a research MRI of the brain in order to estimate ICP. The imaging protocol is
      listed in Appendix 1. All research scans are performed without intravenous contrast.
      Approximate scan time per session will be 20-22 minutes.

      Subjects will then undergo lumbar puncture according to the standard-of-care treatment plan.
      Estimated values of CSF pressure derived from MRI will be compared to values measured during
      lumbar puncture. Patients will then undergo standard-of-care epidural patching. A repeat
      research MRI after epidural patching will be performed to assess for differences in pre- and
      post-treatment scans.
