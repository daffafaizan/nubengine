      antigen in severe trauma patients (Injury severity score > 15) within the first ten days.
      Investigators then modelize hyperfibrinogenemia profiles according to severity of injuries
      and physiopathologic mechanisms. Finally, investigators determine predisposing risk factors
      to develop hyperfibrinogenemia and assess the impact of fibrinogen replacement therapy in
      initial phase of management of major trauma.
