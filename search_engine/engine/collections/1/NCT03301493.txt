      researchers and companies and the simultaneously present high number of uncertainties, the
      establishment of an independent registry for patients undergoing any type of comprehensive
      genomic profiling offers many advantages.

      In particular, an overview of the speed of development, the "market penetration", the use of
      the technology in specific indications (tumor types, stages and in specific situations of
      unresponsiveness to certain drugs), the frequency by which treatment decisions will
      definitely follow the result of comprehensive genomic profiling and the reasons for this, the
      treatment outcome of such patients, the platform technologies applied (in-house (which
      types), vs. commercial) and the development of these parameters over time and in relation to
      the development of novel drugs will be analyzed.

      The registry proposes to cover the time period from the years 2016 to 2019, which will allow
      for assessment of both the current and emerging landscape of genomic/molecular testing
      practice in Austria and effect of molecular profiling on patient care and outcome.
