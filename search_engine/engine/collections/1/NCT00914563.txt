      degree burns, with TBSA above 15%, with or without inhalation injury will be included to the
      study within 2009-2010. The patients meeting inclusion criteria but with an adverse critical
      prognosis from the beginning of the hospitalization, with surgically insoluble extent of
      burns or the dialyzed patients will be excluded.The patients will be routinely monitored. We
      will use the continuous real-time hemodynamic monitoring through transpulmonal lithium
      dilution additionally. The monitor Lithium Dilution Cardiac Output (LIDCO) Plus permits
      through analysis of the arterial blood pressure trace to acquire items about CO, SVR and DO2
      . In fluid resuscitation, we will use a combination of the balanced crystalloids and
      synthetic colloids (of the middle molecular weight) in the ratio 2 ml/kg/% TBSA : 1 ml/kg/%
      TBSA. The control group will be composed of the patients supervised in a standard way, volume
      resuscitated according to the Brooke or Parkland formulas. MAP > 65 torr, urine output 0,5
      ml/kg/h, CI 2,5 - 4,0 l/min/m2, DO2I 500 - 600 ml/min/m2 are the goals.We will measure the
      levels of proANP (pro Natriuretic peptide) and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) at
      artificial ventilated patients. The plasma ACE and proANP concentrations were measured by
      commercially available ELISA immunoassays.

      Conclusions: We will evaluate the total fluid balance at day 1, 2 and cumulative fluid
      balance at day 7, reversal of organ dysfunction according to SOFA score at day 3 and 7 in
      both group. The days of invasive ventilatory support, length of ICU stay, ICU survival, total
      length of hospital stay and hospital survival are the additional endpoints.
