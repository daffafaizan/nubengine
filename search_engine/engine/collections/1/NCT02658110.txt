    
      A randomised crossover design shall be implemented, whereby all participants complete 4
      trials separated by a minimum of 3 days. On all visits participants shall consume a
      standardised mixed-macronutrient breakfast meal, followed 180 minutes later by consumption of
      a standard lunch meal. The timing of additional protein supplementation shall vary by trial,
      with participants consuming a shake containing 20g whey protein isolate either as a preload
      (15 minutes prior to breakfast), alongside the breakfast meal, or 15 minutes following
      breakfast consumption. A control trial shall also be completed without additional protein
      supplementation. At all supplementation time points participants shall consume either a
      flavoured whey protein shake or a flavoured water isovolumetric beverage ensuring that they
      remain blinded to the condition. Venous and capillary blood samples and visual analogue
      scales (for determination of subjective appetite sensations) shall be taken at regular
      intervals following both meals while the participant is rested.
