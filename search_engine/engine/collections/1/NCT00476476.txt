      Primary

      â€¢ To determine the clinical efficacy of erlotinib in reducing the size of vulvar squamous
      cell cancer and /or metastatic lesions.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of oral erlotinib.

        -  To evaluate apoptosis and assess the Ki67, phospho-EGFR, EGFR mutation and EGFR
           amplification status of the vulvar cancer prior to and after therapy and correlate
           observed changes with response to therapy.

        -  To evaluate the impact of medical treatment on the subsequent surgery for vulvar cancer
           when surgery is chosen as the definitive therapy.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This study used a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy of erlotinib based on response
      determined prior to definitive surgery or chemoradiation (cohort 1) or after every 2 cycles
      of erlotinib (cohort 2). The null and alternative response rates defined as achieving partial
      response (PR) or better were 3.5% and 15%. If 1 or more patients enrolled in stage one (n=17
      patients) achieved PR or better than accrual would proceed to stage two (n=24 patients).
      There was 0.55 probability of stopping the trial at stage one if the true OR rate was 3.5%.
      If 3 or fewer responses were observed by the end of stage two, erlotinib would be deemed
      ineffective. The significance level of the study design was 0.0495 with a power of 85% to
      rule out a poor response rate of less than 3.5%.
