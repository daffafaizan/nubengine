      use of synthetic grafts to augment vaginal repair procedures to obtain more durable results.
      In 2005, the investigators began to perform modified pelvic floor reconstruction surgery with
      mesh. The nation-wide multicenter prospective clinical trial data showed that it was safe,
      efficient and cost-effective. No severe intraoperative complications were recorded and the
      recurrence rate after 1 year follow-up was 8.1%. Quality of life improved significantly from
      the baseline, while the sexual function did not change.

      Sacral colpopexy has long been regarded as the gold standard. Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy
      could offer durable result and low morbidity compared with open procedure.

      In clinical practice, many women have symptomatic POP-Q Stage III-IV uterine or vault
      prolapse, which requires surgical correction. The aim of this multicenter, prospective and
      randomized study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these two procedures in the
      treatment of symptomatic apical prolapse Stage III-IV in China.
