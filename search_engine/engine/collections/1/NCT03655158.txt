      due to its antimicrobial, biocompatibility and healing properties, the effects of ozone
      therapy on surgeries that heals with secondary intention were not studied. In the lights of
      these informations, the aim of present study was to evaluate effects of ozone therapy on
      wound healing after gingivectomy and gingivoplasty operations as a model of secondary wound
      healing. Twenty three systemically healthy individuals participated in this study. All
      periodontal examinations were performed by one experienced examiner and non-surgical
      periodontal treatment of the patients were performed within two weeks after initial
      examination by the same clinician.Gingivectomy and gingivoplasty operations were performed by
      another examiner who was unaware of the study protocol.After gingivectomy and gingivoplasty,
      right quadrants of the surgical areas were assigned to receive ozone therapy in all patients.
      Ozone therapy was also performed by an experienced periodontist. As placebo application, left
      quadrants received regular air from the ozone generator.Postoperative pain was assessed at
      3rd, 7th, 14th days after surgery with a visual analog scale At baseline and 3rd, 7th, 14th
      days after surgery, surgical area was disclosed by a plaque disclosing solution to visualize
      the epithelization degree of the surgical areas. Solution provided a clear vision to
      distinguish normal gingiva from the areas in which the gingival epithelium is absent, abraded
      or lacking sufficient keratinization. In order to evaluate epithelization degree of the
      wounds, standardized photographs were taken from each patient.In the photographs of the
      wounds, the difference in color were evaluated and darkly stained areas were considered as
      lack of enough epithelization. These measurements were performed at the baseline, 3rd, 7th,
      14th days after surgery. The determinations were done by a calibrated examiner who was blind
      to test and control sites
