      This protocol was activated on April 04, 2018. As of September 28, 2020 12 patients have been
      enrolled: 2 at Duke, 8 at the Durham VA, and 2 at the Richmond VA. Patients were randomized
      equally to treatment arms within each institution. Physician or patient reluctance regarding
      randomization has impacted enrollment. The trial is, therefore, being amended, effective
      October 28, 2020 to allow physician/patient choice of Interventional Radiology Liver Directed
      Therapies or HIGRT delivered as part of routine medical care. The randomization for patients
      already enrolled will be ignored. This record reflects the information for the interventional
      portion of the study.
