    
      Technique development: In first step, the different available techniques will be evaluated
      for specificity and sensibility using serial dilutions of cell lines with or without GNAQ
      mutation.

      Validation: The tumor DNA detection rate will be estimated from metastatic uveal patient's
      blood. The investigators will study 40 patients to obtain at least 15 patients bearing a GNAQ
      mutation in the primitive tumor or in metastasis. With those 15 patients, the investigators
      will determinate the most sensitive technique and the best cost/efficiency ratio.
