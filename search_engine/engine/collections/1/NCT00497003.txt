      chronic heart failure. Treatment with carvedilol improves survival in patients with chronic
      heart failure compared to treatment with metoprolol. Carvedilol improves metabolic glucose
      control in patients with diabetes compared to metoprolol.Carvedilol compared to metoprolol
      also decreases the number of patients with new onset diabetes among patients with chronic
      heart failure. The mechanism behind these findings has not been fully understood.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate if carvedilol compared to metoprolol has a
      favourable effect on endothelial function and insulin stimulated endothelial function, in
      groups of patients with either diabetes or chronic heart failure.
