      eradication of oral Candida isolates in 40 cancer patients referred by radiation oncologists
      during the course of his/her treatment. An estimated 35 patients will be evaluable at the end
      of the study. Candida infection is defined as positive clinical signs (white plaques) with
      positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation and positive cultures. Colonization is defined
      as a positive culture without signs of clinical infection.
