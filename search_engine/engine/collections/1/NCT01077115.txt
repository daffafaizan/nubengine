      and blood: adrenalin, noradrenalin, metabolites of corticosteroid hormone - 17- hydroxyl and
      17- keto steroid (HPLC method), C reactive protein and albumin, glycemia, creatine
      phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, sedimentation of erythrocytes and serum concentration
      of potassium.
