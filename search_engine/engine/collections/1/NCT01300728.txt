      dosing. Screening labs and assessments will be performed during the screening period. A brain
      MRI will be obtained as standard of care within 6 months prior to the screening period. The
      first dose of study drug is administered on Day 1. Visits 2 through 6 have a ±1 day window
      and occur every 14 days over two months. The investigator will determine if a subject is
      suitable to continue following the missed infusion. Visits 7 through 12 (Month 4 through
      Month 24) have a ±7 day window.

      All study screening data from Visit 1 including laboratory results must be reviewed for study
      eligibility prior to receiving first dose of study drug. Visit 2 physical exams and
      neurological exams prior to infusion may occur within 72 hours prior to the first infusion.
      Prior to infusion, a review of concomitant medications and adverse events takes place to
      ensure that no excluded medications have been added or medication discontinued or dose
      changed that were required to have been stable. If the subject continues to be eligible for
      enrollment, the subject will be randomized, infused with study medication and will remain in
      the infusion clinic for at least 4 hours following the start of the infusion for safety
      assessments on Visit 2 (Day 1).
