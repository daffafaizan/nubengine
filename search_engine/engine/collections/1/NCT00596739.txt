      blood samples prior to undergoing weight-reduction surgery.

      Those with normal pre-operative sperm samples will be invited to continue participating in
      the study by providing subsequent post-operative semen samples and hormonal testing over a
      two year time period.

      It is estimated to take approximately one year to enroll the desired 60 subjects. The study
      will conclude two years from the last enrollment.

      The main analysis will be a comparison of sperm concentrations over time.
