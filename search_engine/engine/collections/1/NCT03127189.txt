      (study medication is assigned by chance), parallel-group, sequential study in healthy adult
      participants to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of rilpivirine (RPV) after
      intramuscular (IM) injection of RPV LA nanosuspensions with different particle size
      distributions (PSD), in healthy adult participants. A total of 110 healthy adult participants
      will be enrolled in this study. The study will consist of 2 treatment sessions in a fixed
      sequential order: Session 1- all participants will receive a single oral dose of rilpivirine
      25 milligram (mg) as oral immediate release solution on Day 1; Session 2- the participants
      will be randomized in session 2 on Day 1 in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to Treatments A, B, C, D and E.
      Each treatment group will receive a single IM injection of RPV LA on Day 1 of session 2.
      Session 1 and 2 will be separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. The total study
      duration for each participant will be approximately 9.5 months. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
