      characterization of device agreement using SP cutoffs for colonic and whole gut transit
      (59hrs and 73 hrs respectively) derived from the above mentioned study. The cutoffs are
      derived from the 95th percentile of the healthy subjects in the study. Demonstration of
      agreement will also serve to validate these SP cutoffs. Device agreement will be evaluated by
      comparing the percentage of subjects identified with slow transit versus normal transit with
      SmartPill to the percentage of subjects identified with slow versus normal transit with ROM
      in the study population. The colonic transit time results will serve as the primary measure
      for slow versus normal transit for SmartPill. For ROM test we will employ the Metcalf
      protocol which provides a measure of whole gut transit to compare the SmartPill results to.
      Additionally, we will characterize gastric emptying and small bowel transit time of the
      SmartPill in this population. The SmartPill test will be administered simultaneously with
      ROM. A modified Metcalf procedure will be employed for characterization of slow transit by
      ROM.

      The SmartPill GI Monitoring System offers an alternative non-invasive method for
      characterizing disorders of the stomach. The system consists of an ingestible capsule that
      houses sensors for pH, temperature, and pressure, a receiver for receiving and storing
      signals from the capsule, and software for displaying data on a personal computer. The
      capsule samples at regular intervals and transmits the sensed pH, pressure, and temperature
      data to a portable receiver worn by the subject. After test completion, the recorded data is
      downloaded to a personal computer for subsequent evaluation. This trial is for subjects 18
      years of age to 80 years of age.
