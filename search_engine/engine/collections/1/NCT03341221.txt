    
      Definition : Ascites is the pathologic fluid accumulation within the peritoneal cavity .

      causes of ascites in infants and children :

        -  Hepatobiliary disorders (cirrhosis, congenital hepatic fibrosis, acute hepatitis B,C
           ,Budd -chiari syndrome, Bile duct perforation)

        -  Serositis (crohn's disease, eosinophilic enteropathy , Henoch- Shonlein purpura )

        -  Neoplasm (lymphoma, wilm's tumor ,Glioma, Germ cell tumor, Ovarian tumor,mesothelioma,
           Neroblastoma )

        -  Cardiac (Heart failure )

        -  Metabolic disease

        -  Gastrointestinal disorder (Nephrotic syndrome, peritoneal dialysis ). Diagnosis of
           ascites :History of abdominal distention, increasing weight, respiratory embarrassement,
           jaundice, bleeding (haematemsis, melena, and epistaxis ),Pruritus ,Growth failure
           ,abdominal pain, fever,Cyanosis, ,dyspnea during suckling, Orthopnea, Buffy eyes, lower
           limb swelling, Haematrruria .

      By examination : Tachycardia ,Tachypnea ,Hypertension ,cyanosis, jaundice, clubbing of
      fingers ,limb edema ,Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, dilated abdominal wall veins.

      Investigations :

      Laboratory tests :complete blood count , complete urine examination, liver function tests,
      plasma proteins, renal function tests, clotting screen, tuberculin test.

      Imaging studies :chest and abdominal plain films, abdominal ultrasound, upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy CT, MR I, Abdominal paracentesis for ascitic fluid analysis :cell
      count / cytology ,Gram 'stain and culture, Total proteins (albumin /globulin ratio ),
      Glucose, Amylase, lactase dehydrogenase, Triglycerides,Bilirubin.

      Serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG )is the best single test for classification of ascites
      into portal hypertensive (SAAG >1.1g/dl) and non-portal hypertensive (SAAG <1.1g/dl) causes.
