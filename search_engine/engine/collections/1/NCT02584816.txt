      vaccine by testing the vaccine in infants in order to demonstrate equivalence in the
      induction of specific anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies across three production lots. The study
      will also examine the potential interference of vaccine with UIP vaccines that will be
      administered concurrently by assessing non-inferiority in the immune responses to those
      vaccines when administered with / without the study vaccine.
