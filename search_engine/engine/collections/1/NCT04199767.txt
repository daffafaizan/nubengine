    
      The aim of this study is to determine the ability of an intranasal delivery device to
      increase levels of insulin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

      A growing body of evidence suggests that insulin plays a role in normal memory processes and
      that insulin abnormalities may contribute to cognitive and brain changes associated with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, insulin administered to the nasal cavity is
      transported within a few minutes into the brain, but does not affect blood sugar or insulin
      levels.

      The study will consist of a single site, randomized, double-blind trial comparing the acute
      effects of INI 20 International Units or 40 International Units delivered with one of three
      nebulizer-like devices on CSF insulin levels, AD biomarkers and memory. At study entry,
      participants will be randomized to receive either 20 or 40 IU insulin first, and the opposite
      dose on a second visit. Participants who are cognitively normal or who have aMCI (n=30) will
      be enrolled. The primary outcome measure will be to establish which device and which dose
      provides the greatest increase in CSF insulin which will provide important evidence to be
      used in the design of future trials.
