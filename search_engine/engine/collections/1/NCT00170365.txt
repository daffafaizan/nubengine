      restorative yoga class as a method of stress reduction for the HFA Addiction Medicine Clinic
      staff. Working in a busy clinic can be very stressful. While it is not always possible to
      completely eliminate stress from our lives, it is known that stress reduction techniques help
      to diminish the negative consequences of stress. This study was designed to answer the
      following question "How much change in perceived stress is obtained through weekly
      Restorative Yoga sessions?" Study population were members of the HFA Addiction Medicine
      Clinic. All staff completed the Spielberger Job Stress Survey and the State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory at baseline and at six months following intervention onset. Volunteers from the
      Addiction Medicine Clinic attended weekly restorative yoga sessions 45 minutes in length held
      over the noon hour. Serial State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and weekly questionnaire regarding
      the perceived effects of the restorative yoga on aspects fo patient care were completed by
      study volunteers.
