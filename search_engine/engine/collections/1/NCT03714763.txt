      some cases of other subtypes of pituitary tumors. It had been showed that dopamine agonists
      inhibit prolactin secretion by binding to and activating dopamine D2 receptors. PET-MR
      combined MR images with PET function images is substantial to evaluate the expression of
      dopamine D2 receptors.The aim is to study the in vivo expression of dopamine D2 receptors in
      prolactinoma and the predictive role of dopamine D2 receptors PET-MR imaging in the
      therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists.
