    
      EA is characterized by dissociated state of consciousness, in which the children are
      inconsolable, irritable, uncooperative, thrashing, crying, moaning or incoherent.

      Several predisposing factors for EA include post-operative pain, rapid emergence from general
      anesthesia, use of volatile anesthetics, type and site of operation (usually head & neck
      surgeries), agitation on induction, airway obstruction, hyperthermia or hypothermia.

      The effect of anesthetic depth on the EA has rarely been evaluated in pediatric population,
      even though postoperative delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD)corresponds
      to the EA identically.

      In this study, the concentration of anesthetics was not managed on purpose to lower the BIS
      score. Patients were allocated to each group based on the result of average BIS score during
      the operation.
