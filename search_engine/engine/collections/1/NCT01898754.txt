      individuals, (2) to reducing HIV transmission to sexual partners and from mothers to their
      infants, and (3) to maintaining the effectiveness of the current 1st-line non-nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)- based ART. Across multiple trials, individuals with
      NNRTI-resistance, even at low-concentrations, have substantially greater virologic failure
      when treated with NVP- vs PI-ART. A cost-effective strategy is needed to detect and manage
      ARV-resistant HIV infections. A simple low-cost innovative assay the investigators developed
      and successfully transferred to Asian and African countries (oligonucleotide ligation assay
      (OLA)) can detect NNRTI+lamivudine (3TC) resistant HIV using reagents that costs
      <$7.00/person. Furthermore, detection of NNRTI-resistance by OLA is highly (P<0.001)
      associated with virologic failure of nevirapine (NVP)-ART in two retrospective studies; one
      of Thai women who had been previously randomized to single-dose NVP and the second of
      ARV-naÃ¯ve Kenyan adults.

      The investigators hypothesize that implementation of OLA into routine care will allow Kenyan
      clinicians to appropriately target protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART and improve rates of
      durable suppression of viral replication, and thus improve CD4 cell gains and individuals'
      health, reduce the transmission of ARV-resistant HIV within the community, and maintain the
      utility of NNRTI-ART. In addition, the investigators hypothesize that programmatically
      OLA-guided ART will be more cost-efficient compared to the current strategy of empiric use of
      NNRTI-ART as initial treatment.
