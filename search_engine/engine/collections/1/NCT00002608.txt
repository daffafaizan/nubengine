        -  Determine the feasibility and efficacy of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and tamoxifen (CAT) in
           patients with soft tissue sarcoma, glioma, mesothelioma, hepatoma, thyroid cancer, or
           adrenal cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours followed immediately by doxorubicin IV
      over 15-30 minutes on days 1-3 and oral tamoxifen twice daily on days 4-17. Treatment
      continues every 3 weeks in the absence of the total cumulative doxorubicin dose reaching at
      least 500 mg/m2, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve partial
      remission (PR) undergo local surgery or radiotherapy, if feasible, to convert PR to complete
      remission.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
