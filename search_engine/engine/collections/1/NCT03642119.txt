      investigators will validate the technology in 12 perimenopausal women ages 45-60 y and BMI
      18.5-40 kg/m2 who experience greater than or equal to 4 hot flashes per day. First, the
      investigators will validate the iButton® technology against self-report (subjective) hot
      flash incidence in a real world, ambulatory condition (via a hot flash journal). Next, the
      investigators will validate the iButton® technology during a controlled,
      laboratory-stimulated hot flash using a tube-lined suit that circulates warm water uniformly
      around the lower limbs (Med-EngTM). During the stimulated hot flash, the investigators will
      simultaneously measure core body temperature, skin blood flow, skin temperature, sweat rate,
      and heart rate alongside the iButton® to correlate (confirm) the observed thermoregulatory
      changes and further assess validity. To date, existing studies using iButtons® to assess
      changes in skin temperature have been conducted.

      Each subject will undergo a two-phased screening to determine eligibility. Pre-enrollment
      measurements will include standard anthropometrics (weight, height), vital signs (blood
      pressure, heart rate), fasting blood draw, and questionnaires, as well as a 7-day hot flash
      journal that captures frequency and severity screening. Post-enrollment measurements will
      include simultaneous objective (via iButtons®) and subjective (via self-report journal) hot
      flash recordings (i.e., field testing), as well as a final laboratory visit will be conducted
      at Louisiana State University's School of Kinesiology and include body composition
      assessment, as well as the following assessments during a stimulated hot flash -- core
      temperature, skin blood flow, skin temperature, sweat rate, and heart rate.
