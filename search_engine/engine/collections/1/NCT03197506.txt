      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with standard
      therapy (surgery, external beam radiation therapy and temozolomide [TMZ] chemotherapy) in
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). (Neoadjuvant [Group 1]) II. To
      assess the 18 month overall survival rate of pembrolizumab in combination with standard
      therapy (surgery, external beam radiation therapy and TMZ chemotherapy) in patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). (Adjuvant [Group 2])

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess adverse events (AE) and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in combination with
      standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

      II. To assess time to progression in patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with
      standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. (Adjuvant only) III. To assess
      progression-free survival in patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with standard
      therapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. (Adjuvant only) IV. To assess time to treatment
      failure in patients treated with pembrolizumab in combination with standard therapy in
      patients with newly diagnosed GBM. (Adjuvant only)

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tumor PD-1/PD-L1 expression and inflammatory microenvironment profile by
      comparing PD-1/PD-L1 expression and T lymphocyte/monocytic infiltrates before and after
      administration of pembrolizumab treatment. (Neoadjuvant only) II. To assess the peripheral
      immunophenotype profile and GBM-associated antigen-specific T cell responses before and after
      receiving pembrolizumab treatment in combination with standard therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP 1:

      NEOADJUVANT (CYCLE 1): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      day 1.

      SURGERY (CYCLE 2): Patients undergo standard of care surgery within days 4-7.

      CONCURRENT (CYCLE 3): Starting 21-35 days after surgery, patients receive pembrolizumab IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 8-54.
      Patients also undergo external beam radiation therapy every 5 days per week on days 8-54.

      ADJUVANT (CYCLE 4-8): Within 3-5 weeks after completing radiation therapy, patients receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5
      every 28 days. Treatment repeats every 63 days for up to 5 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unexpected toxicity.

      GROUP 2:

      CONCURRENT (CYCLE 1): Starting 21-35 days after surgery, patients receive pembrolizumab IV
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 and temozolomide PO daily on days 8-54. Patients also
      undergo external beam radiation therapy every 5 days per week on days 8-54.

      ADJUVANT (CYCLES 2-6): Within 3-5 weeks after completing radiation therapy, patients receive
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 22, and 43 of cycles 2-5 and 1 and 22 of cycle 6
      (up to a total of 17 doses). Patients also receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5, 29-33,
      and 57-61 of cycles 2 and 6, days 22-26 and 50-54 of cycle 3, days 15-19 and 43-47 of cycle
      4, days 8-12 and 36-40 of cycle 5. Treatment repeats every 63 days for up to 5 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months
      until progressive disease, then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
