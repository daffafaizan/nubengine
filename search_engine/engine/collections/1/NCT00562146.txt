      small bowel feeding compared with gastric feeding may be associated with a reduction in
      pneumonia in critically ill patients. The Canadian Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended
      that small bowel feedings should be considered for patients at high risk for intolerance to
      enteral nutrition.

      There are several methods to place postpyloric tube, but there is a high success rate with
      endoscopic or radiological assistance. However, they are time consuming procedures, which is
      of limited availability at bedside and requires trained staff.

      Nasojejunal tube with spiral end (Flocare Bengmark NJ tube) has been used for bedside
      placement for 10 years. But only limited data are available for success rate, especially in
      brain injured patients. The aim of this study is to access the success rate and influencing
      factors of spiral end nasojejunal tube in such a population.
