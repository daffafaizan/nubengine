      resource-poor settings.

      One of the new methods that could be used to control PPH is Uterine packing with
      chitosan-covered gauze or Celox.

      Celox Haemostats are dressings with natural material called chitosan to control major
      haemorrhage including life-threatening bleeding . They are simple and effective, stopping
      major bleeding.It was first used by military forces to stop sever bleeding in the scene with
      no other options to stop bleeding. Celox™ granules are actually very high surface area
      flakes. When they come in contact with blood, Celox™ swells, gels, and sticks together to
      make a gel like clot, without generating any heat. Celox™ does not set off the normal
      clotting cascade, it only clots the blood it comes directly into contact with. Celox works on
      casualties using anticoagulants and anti-platelet therapy such as aspirin.

      We will be having two groups:

        1. Celox group:

           Celox placement is very simpe . During cesarean section celox is loaded in the lower
           uterine segment and part of it is passed through the cervix to the vagina. If PPH occurs
           after vaginal delivery the celox is inserted through the cervix to pack the lower
           uterine segment. Removal of Celox after 24 hours.

        2. Bakri balloon group:

      Before insertion the balloon, ensure that the bladder is empty by placing a Foley catheter.
      Grasp the cervix with ring forceps. Insert the balloon into the cavity of the uterus under
      ultrasound guidance; making sure that the entire portion of the balloon passes the cervical
      canal above the internal cervical os. Once the correct placement is confirmed, inflate the
      balloon with sterile saline using the enclosed syringe.
