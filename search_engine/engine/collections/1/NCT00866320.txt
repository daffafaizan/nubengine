      Primary

        -  To determine the tumor burden reduction rate in patients with sunitinib malate- or
           bevacizumab-refractory, metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with
           sorafenib tosylate.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety of sorafenib tosylate in these patients.

        -  To record the duration of tumor reduction, time to disease progression, and overall
           survival of patients treated with sorafenib tosylate.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
