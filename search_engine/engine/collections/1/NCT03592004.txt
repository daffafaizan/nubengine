      courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and prior to the surgery at least 8 weeks after the
      treatment procedure. Patients undergo biopsy test in one week after the baseline MRI scan to
      detect the biomarkers including ER, PR, Her-2 and Ki-67, which can be used to select the
      treatment plan referring to the NCCN clinical guidelines. After the surgery, responses to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy are determined according to the histopathologically examination of
      the surgically resected specimens.

      After completion of treatment procedure, patients are followed up for 5 years.
