    
      A retrospective survey will be conducted of all transfusion events reported in the University
      Hospitals Leuven between January 2011 and July 2012. Both severe accidents and near misses
      will be included.

      Data will be drawn from the incident report system. Data concerning the number of transfused
      blood products will be required from the Medical Administration Service.

      Events will be classified according to the severity and the cause of the event. The different
      settings where the events took place will be compared using a chi-square test (p<0,05).
