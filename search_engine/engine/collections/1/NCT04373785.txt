    
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal form of malignant brain cancer, with about
      12,000 new cases diagnosed each in the the United States. The current standard treatment
      consists of maximal, safe resection, followed by radiation therapy of 60 Gray (Gy) with
      concomitant oral temozolomide (TMZ) for 6 weeks, then continue with six cycles of high-dose
      temozolomide. The median survival rate for newly diagnosed GBM patients is 14.6 months with a
      2-year overall survival (OS) rate of 27.2%. This clinical trial evaluates the 2-year OS of
      oral NG101m as an adjuvant therapy to chemoradiotherapy in newly diagnosed GBM subjects.
