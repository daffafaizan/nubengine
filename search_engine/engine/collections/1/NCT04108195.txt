      increased susceptibility to infections, hypercalcemia, and renal failure. Overall rationale
      of study is that daratumumab in combination with talquetamab or teclistamab may lead to
      enhanced clinical responses in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma through
      multiple mechanisms of action. Daratumumab is human immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal
      antibody (IgG1k) that binds with high affinity to a unique epitope on cluster of
      differentiation 38 (CD38) in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple
      myeloma. Talquetamab and teclistamab are bispecific T cell redirection antibodies.
      Talquetamab binds to cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) receptor complex on T cells and to G
      protein-coupled receptor family C group 5-member D (GPRC5D), a 7-transmembrane receptor
      protein on plasma cells and teclistamab binds to human and cynomolgus-CD3 and B cell
      maturation antigen (BCMA). Purpose of study is to evaluate safety of daratumumab in
      combination with talquetamab and teclistamab, and to evaluate preliminary antitumor activity
      of each combination. Study consists of a screening period, treatment period (Part 1: dose
      escalation and Part 2: dose expansion) and a post treatment follow-up period (after end of
      treatment and up to 16 weeks after last dose. End of study is defined as last study
      assessment for last participant in study. Total duration of study is approximately 2.4 years.
      Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and biomarkers will be assessed at
      specified time points. Participants safety will be monitored throughout study by Study
      Evaluation Team (SET). SET consists of members of sponsor's study team and participating
      investigators.
