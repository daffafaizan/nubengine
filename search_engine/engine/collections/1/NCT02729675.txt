      innovative multi-level worksite interventions including educational/behavioral interventions
      and/or a fruit and vegetable (F&V) market at the worksite to improve F&V intake of employees.
      The hypothesis is that providing convenient, inexpensive access to F&V at the workplace
      through a F&V market will increase the availability of F&V at the workplace as well as at
      home and increase F&V intake of the employee. However, because it is unclear if improving F&V
      access and availability alone is adequate to increase F&V intake, the investigators will test
      the efficacy of the F&V delivery intervention alone and in combination with a
      promotional/educational intervention delivered at the worksite. The efficacy of these
      innovative interventions will be tested during a cluster randomized trial with 21 worksites
      to determine which interventions are most efficacious in increasing F&V consumption.

      The primary specific aims of this proposed research are to employ a cluster randomized trial
      to study the efficacy of delivering fresh F&V at reduced prices for purchase at worksites
      (access intervention); the F&V delivery intervention paired with educational interventions to
      change informational and social environments at the worksite (enhanced intervention); and a
      comparison intervention acting as an attention placebo. The study will compare the efficacy
      of the Access intervention and the enhanced intervention with the comparison Arm and will
      also compare the efficacy of the Access intervention to the Enhanced intervention.
