      health and energy level and it is possible that exercise can cause healthy changes in these
      communities. Through careful design, this study will use a controlled-feeding diet and 10
      weeks of exercise training to determine exercise effects on the number, distribution, and
      types of bacteria in the gut of breast cancer survivors. These changes will then be linked to
      fatigue and physiologic effects of exercise to determine how the information can be used to
      enhance exercise benefits and identify new treatment strategies leveraging changes in gut
      bacteria communities.
