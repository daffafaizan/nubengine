    
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center study with parallel groups. The study employs a single-dose,
      open-label design in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment along with
      matched healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. Subjects with normal hepatic
      function will be matched with subjects with hepatic impairment for gender, age (± 10 years),
      body weight (± 15%), and smoking status (smoker or non-smoker).

      Up to a total of 48 participants will be enrolled in this study (approximately 8 in each mild
      [Child-Pugh A], moderate [Child-Pugh B], severe hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh C] groups),
      and up to 24 healthy control subjects). Each participant will receive a single oral dose of
      300 mg of icenticaftor (QBW251) on Day 1 under fasting conditions.

      The study is comprised of an up to 28-day screening period (Days -28 to -1), a baseline
      evaluation (Day -1) prior to treatment on Day 1, and a follow-up period of 7 days for
      pharmacokinetics (PK) sample collection (pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48,
      72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours post-dose). A safety follow-up contact will be done 30 days
      after administration of the study drug.

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the
      systemic PK, safety, and tolerability of icenticaftor in participants with varying degrees of
      hepatic impairment.
