the effect of growth hormone in hypothalamo-pituitarydwarfism. i. the metabolic effects of human growth hormone.human growth hormone, isolated by raben'smethod, was given in 2 to 5 mg. dailydoses over periods from 1 to 12 days to 7 patientswith pituitary-hypothalamic dwarfism.the metabolic effects were as follows:nitrogen retention with a variablereduction in blood urea.  the plasma amino-acidconcentration did not alter afteri.m. injection of the hormone during fasting.an accompanying retention of intracellularcomponents, in such proportions requiredfor protoplasm formation.isotonic expansion of the extracellular compartment,without change in the plasmaelectrolyte concentrations.  retention of phosphorus,sometimes a rise in plasmaphosphate; increased intestinal calcium absorption,hypercalciuria, no alterationin plasma calcium; an increase in plasma citrateand citrate urinary excretion;the calcium and phosphate retention was reversedon stopping treatment.  mobilisationof fat stores with lipid catabolism: thiswas accompanied by a well markedincrease in nefa concentration for some hoursafter hormone injection in thefasting state, after a period of hypoglycaemiaand low nefa levels.  a complex,biphasic action on glucose metabolism.  fastingblood sugar levels are altered,as are the glycaemia in various tests such asfasting, insulin injections, tolbutamideadministration, intestinal hyperglycaemia.acceleration of intermediatemetabolism with increased blood citrateconcentrations and 24 hours urinaryexcretion of  -ketoglutaric acid.  in one testduring fasting the blood citrate increased4 hours after hormone injection.  afteran oral load of sugar the blood citrateand  -ketoglutaric acid concentrationsdid not alter.  a progressive gain inweight has been found during treatment, partlyreversible on stopping treatment,correlating with the intracellular nitrogen retentionand expansion of the extracellularspace, despite mobilisation of fat reserves.
