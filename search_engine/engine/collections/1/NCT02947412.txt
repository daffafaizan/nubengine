      is gaining popularity as a single procedure. Long term data is scarce.

      Re-Do and revisional surgery in form of re-sleeve, gastric bypass (mini -gastric bypass,
      roux-en y gastric bypass) and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) is described in the current
      literature due to weight regain and reflux. The investigators want to analyze the frequency
      of this re-do/revisional surgery and want to compare weight loss and improvement in
      comorbidities.
