      artery to artery embolism or intracranial arterial thrombosis. The traditional vascular risk
      factors, namely hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, family history and
      hyperlipidemia as well as atrial fibrillation are major determinants of stroke risk.
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been shown to be a risk factor for hypertension
      and,although the association is less strong, atherosclerotic heart disease.There is a high
      prevalence of OSA amongst stroke patients, on the order of 60 to 70%, which is tenfold higher
      than in the general healthy population. Recently, it has been shown that, in stroke patients
      undergoing inpatient rehabilitation,the presence of OSA predicts both a poor functional
      outcome and greater length of hospitalization in the rehabilitation unit, even after
      adjustment for stroke severity.

      We propose to examine the effect of CPAP therapy on the neuropsychological and functional
      outcomes of stroke patients with OSA admitted to the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute Stroke
      Rehabilitation Unit in a prospective, randomized study. We hypothesize that, in stroke
      patients with OSA, CPAP therapy will improve indices of vigilance, attention, and cognitive
      performances well as motor function(as it does in OSA patients without stroke)when compared
      to those not treated with CPAP. Furthermore,we hypothesize that the outcome of
      rehabilitation, as assessed by neuropsychological and motor indices, will be improved in
      these patients.
