      will receive) and randomized (study medication is assigned by chance) study. The study
      consists of 3 phases: a screening phase (within 21 days prior to administration of study
      medication), a treatment phase (from day -1 [1 days before the administration of study
      medication] to Day 10 including pharmacokinetics sample collection), and follow-up phase (up
      to 16 days after the last dose of study medication or after dropout [other than withdrawal of
      consent]). Approximately 32 healthy participants will be equally divided into 2 groups (Group
      1 and Group 2) to receive TMC435 for 7 days. Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination which will
      be monitored at various timepoints throughout the study. The total duration of study
      participation for each participant will be approximately 47 days.
