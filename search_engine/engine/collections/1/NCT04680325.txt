      women volunteered and participated in this study. The eligibility (no menstrual period for at
      least 12 months) of the participants was determined using a questionnaire. The participants
      were postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-75 years old who met the exclusion criteria
      including no recent antibiotics or immunosuppressive therapies, surgery of the stomach, small
      or large intestines, appendectomy, gastric bypass or gastric banding in the previous 6
      months, and diagnostic with any autoimmune diseases.

      This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover, pilot dietary intervention. Ocean
      Spray Cranberries, Inc provided the experimental and placebo beverages, which have been
      validated and used in previous studies [26-29]. Both beverages were similar in appearance,
      taste, and aroma and assigned to volunteers according to computer-generated random orders.
      Both investigators and participants were blind to the assignment and products are identified
      by a random 3-digit code pre-printed on the cap. The participants consumed either cranberry
      juice or placebo beverage daily (8 fl oz per day) for 15 days
