      ascending dose (MAD) in healthy volunteers and Part 3: proof of concept (POC) study in mild
      asthmatics. There will be 5 cohorts in SAD and 3 cohorts in MAD, the doses used in the MAD
      will be based on emerging safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) from Part 1 (SAD).
      POC is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double blind, two period cross-over, proof of
      concept study in male and female of non child bearing potential with history of mild asthma.
