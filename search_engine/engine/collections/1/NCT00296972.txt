      secondary to HCV infection has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV/HCV
      co-infection. The influence of HCV co-infection on the progression of HIV has been less clear
      and the results have been conflicting. Studies conducted in the pre-HAART era did not find
      that HIV/HCV co-infection influenced the progression of HIV-induced immunodeficiency or
      death. Of four large studies conducted after HAART was introduced, two suggested a faster
      progression of HIV disease in the presence of HCV co-infection and two found no influence of
      HCV co-infection on overall mortality or progression of HIV disease. HCV may also negatively
      influence HIV disease in indirect ways, such as making the discontinuation of antiretroviral
      treatment more frequent because of an increased risk of liver toxicity.The morbidity and
      mortality resulting from the rapid progression of HCV infection in HIV-co-infected patients,
      particularly given the advances in HIV treatment that have improved the life expectancy of
      HIV-infected patients, support treating HCV infection in these patients.
