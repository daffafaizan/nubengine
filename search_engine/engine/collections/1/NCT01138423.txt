      global health problem. According to guidelines, most classes of antihypertensives are equally
      effective for the treatment of hypertension. However, these guidelines are based on evidence
      from studies in patients with essential hypertension, but without a specific focus on ORH.
      There is an increasing body of evidence about the complex pathophysiological mechanisms of
      ORH. Adipose tissue dysfunction is commonly regarded as a common soil that eventually causes
      up regulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS).
      Moreover, development of hypertension is closely related to development of endothelial
      dysfunction, dyslipidemia and disorders of glucose metabolism. The investigators hypothesize
      that treatment with antihypertensives that are directed at down regulation of the SNS
      (moxonidine) and the RAS (aliskiren) will result in more beneficial effects than treatment
      with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), because the latter reduces blood pressure by
      inhibition of sodium resorption, without influencing the underlying disease mechanism. The
      main outcomes of interest are endothelial function and blood pressure, but many secondary
      outcomes are studied too.
