      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dasatinib in patients with varying degrees
      of hepatic impairment.

      II. To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of this drug in patients with varying
      degrees of hepatic impairment.

      III. To assess the safety profile and dose-limiting toxicities (if any) of dasatinib in
      patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe any antitumor efficacy associated with dasatinib administration in patients
      with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.

      II. To examine whether the pharmacokinetic clearance of dasatinib correlates with hepatic
      function as assessed by Child-Pugh Criteria, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Organ
      Dysfunction Working Group Criteria, or other assessments of liver function.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
