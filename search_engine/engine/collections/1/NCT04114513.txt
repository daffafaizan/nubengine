      of chronic diseases. Participants will be randomized into one of five arms daily consuming
      one of the following: placebo (maltodextrin, 8 g), inulin (8 g), pectin (8 g), beta-glucan (8
      g) or oligosaccharides (8 g).

      The study will include a 5-day screening period and a 5-weeks intervention period.

      During screening stage, a volunteer will complete a questionnaire, and the following
      measurements will be performed: blood levels of glycated hemoglobin, creatinine, lipids,
      C-reactive protein, anthropometric measurements, as well as cardiovascular risk will be
      assessed.

      Before and after the intervention blood and stool samples will be collected to conduct the
      following analyses: an extended lipid spectrum analysis, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
      16S rRNA gut microbiome sequencing, laboratory stool testing, stool fecal short-chain fatty
      acids analysis. Anthropometric measures, physical examination will be performed for each
      volunteer. The following questionnaires will be completed: dietary recall questionnaire,
      SF-36, the Rome Criteria for the Functional gastrointestinal disorders (functional
