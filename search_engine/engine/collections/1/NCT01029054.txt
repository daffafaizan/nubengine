      be increased until the best and safest amount (or dose) is identified in combination with
      standard doses of Revlimid® and dexamethasone. "Investigational" means that the drug
      combination is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more
      about it such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause and how effective the
      Revlimid® and carfilzomib and dexamethasone investigational combination is for treating newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma. In this clinical trial we are looking for the highest dose of the
      combination that can be given safely and see how well it works as a combination in newly
      diagnosed patients.

      The drug, carfilzomib, has not yet been approved by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration). Revlimid® and Dexamethasone have been approved by the FDA. The drugs have
      not been approved in this combination for use for your type of cancer or any other type of
      cancer. Carfilzomib is being researched to treat multiple myeloma. Dexamethasone is commonly
      used, either alone, or in combination with other drugs, to treat multiple myeloma. Revlimid®
      is currently approved by the US FDA in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of
      patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy.

      After the Phase I clinical trial defines the safest doses of Revlimid® and carfilzomib and
      dexamethasone that can be taken together, the research study will move on to its second
      portion, a Phase II clinical trial. The Phase II portion of the clinical trial will test the
      clinical effectiveness of the best dose combination of the three drugs.
