      comparison with physiologic hemostasis after endoscopic sinus surgery. The investigators aim
      to determine the relative efficacy of hemostatic agents to halt epistaxis and compare this
      with the degree of epistaxis observed without therapy and evaluate objective healing
      parameters.
