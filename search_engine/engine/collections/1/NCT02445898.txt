      postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting are well-documented.

      Hip-arthroplasty surgery and the inflammatory stress response in general affect the potential
      of recovery. Early postoperative orthostatic intolerance is common in patients undergoing THA
      with an incidence of 40%. The mechanism is thought related to an impaired autonomic
      regulation caused by surgery-induced inflammation. The effect of glucocorticoids on
      orthostatic intolerance, orthostatic hypotension and HRV after hip-arthroplasty surgery is
      unknown and calls for further investigation.

      The study is to be considered as exploratory. The primary analysis of the primary outcome
      measure is a comparison of the incidence of orthostatic intolerance from baseline to 6 hours
      postoperatively between the two groups.

      For calculation of sample size the difference in incidence between groups (40% versus 10%)
      from baseline (before surgery) to 6 hours after THA-surgery, a risk of type I errors 5% and a
      risk of type II errors 20% (80% power) were used.

      The primary analysis is carried out on all included patients (intention-to-treat) with
      baseline values as covariate. Secondary exploratory per-protocol analysis might be performed.
      Missing outcomes will be analysed using multiple imputation due to expected strong time
      trends.

      The secondary outcomes measures; Non-invasive blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance,
      cardiac output, HRV, plasma-hemoglobin, C-reactive protein.
