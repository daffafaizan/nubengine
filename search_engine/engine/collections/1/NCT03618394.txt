      extremely low birth weight This is probably related to inadequate calcium and phosphorus
      intake, which is considerably less than the accretion of these minerals during the last
      trimester of pregnancy In addition, severe morbidity during the neonatal period (e.g.
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]), chronic drug therapy (e.g. diuretics and systemic
      steroids), the need for total parenteral nutrition and prolonged immobility increase the risk
      of bone demineralization.

      Total parenteral nutrition is associated with osteopenia in preterm infants. Insufficient
      calcium and phosphate are likely causes; aluminum contamination is another possible
      contributing factor as this adversely affects bone formation and mineralization.

      The DHA+ARA-supplemented formulas supported normal growth and bone mineralization in
      premature infants who were born at <33 wk gestation. Smof lipid emulsion has a high density
      of this fatty acids, while Intra lipid does not contain any traces of DHA. Evidence has shown
      that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), especially the Ï‰-3 fatty acids such as
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are beneficial for bone health and
      turnover.
