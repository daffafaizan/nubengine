      intolerance and decreased quality of life. A weakness in both inspiratory and peripheral
      muscles is also reported. Aerobic training (AT) improves the functional status of HF patients
      (level of evidence IA). Additional benefits of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) and/or
      resistance training (RT) when combined with aerobic training (AT) in HF symptoms have also
      been found.

      Four exercise groups will be studied in order to identify the optimum exercise program I.
      Aerobic-Resistance-Inspiratory training (ARIS) group II. Aerobic Training-Resistance Training
      (AT/RT) group III. Aerobic training-Inspiratory Muscle Training (AT/IMT) group IV. Aerobic
      Training (AT) group
