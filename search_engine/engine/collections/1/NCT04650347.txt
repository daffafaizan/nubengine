      genitourinary tract infections, inflammatory skin conditions, traumatic urethral injury,
      pelvic radiation, and urinary tract instrumentation. It has an estimated prevalence rate of
      0.6%.1-3 USD is a common and challenging problem for urologists. Multiple treatment
      modalities are available for the management of urethral strictures depending on the site and
      length of stricture, this includes simple urethral dilatation, urethral stenting, endoscopic
      visual internal urethrotomy (VIU), or open reconstruction.

      Since 1974, Sachse's internal urethrotomy has been considered the treatment of choice for USD
      which is fast and simple to carry out and is associated with a short recovery time. The
      success rates are 33%-60%.

      Bulow et al in 1979 introduced the laser for internal urethrotomy. The obvious dominance of
      Ho: YAG are clear vision, less bleeding, precise incision and ablation of scar tissue, and
      short hospital admission, however, most literature assessing the adequacy of the laser in
      contrast to cold-knife urethrotomy show no difference in final results.

      The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy, safety, complications, and results of
      Holmium laser urethrotomy and cold knife internal urethrotomy for urethral stricture.
