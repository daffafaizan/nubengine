    
      This is a pilot study to prepare for larger clinical trials. Sixty-eight HIV-negative,
      non-pregnant, sexually active women aged 18-45 with bacterial vaginosis (BV, by modified
      Amsel criteria and/or Nugent score) and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV, on wet mount or by
      culture) will be treated using oral metronidazole for 7 days. After successful treatment, and
      when they are free of vaginal candidiasis, other curable sexually transmitted infections
      (STIs) and urinary tract infection (UTI)), they will be randomised to 4 different vaginal
      microbiome (VMB) maintenance interventions (17 per group) within 3 days of completing oral
      metronidazole treatment: 1) Behavioral 'vaginal practices cessation and safer sex'
      counselling only (control); 2) Behavioral counselling plus 500mg metronidazole pills twice
      per week for two months; 3) Behavioral counselling plus Ecologic Femi vaginal capsule, once
      per day for 5 days immediately after oral metronidazole treatment followed by thrice weekly,
      for two months; 4) Group 4: Behavioral counselling plus Gynophilus vaginal tablet, once every
      4 days for two months. Vaginal probiotic use may be ceased temporarily during menstruation.
      Participants will be asked to adhere to the interventions for 2 months, and VMB assessments
      will take place before (screening and enrolment visits), during (Day 7, Month 1 and Month 2
      visits), and after the interventions (Month 6 visit).
