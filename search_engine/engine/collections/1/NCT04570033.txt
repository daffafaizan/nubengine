      (US) and parathyroid scintigraphy (99mTc/99mTc-MIBI dual phase). Twenty-two patients had
      unsuccessful parathyroid surgery prior to the study. PET/CT scans were performed 65.0 ± 13.3
      min after injection of 218.5 ± 31.9 MBq of 18F-fluorocholine (FCH). Three experienced nuclear
      medicine physicians assessed the detection rate of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue.
      Response to parathyroidectomy and clinical follow-up served as a reference test. Per-patient
      sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for patients who underwent
      surgery.
