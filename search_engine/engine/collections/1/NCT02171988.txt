      investigation of an appropriate medical treatment of POTS has not been enough yet. Also, the
      prognosis of the disease after treatment is not well known. It is known that propranolol
      attenuate the tachycardia and improve symptom burden in patients with POTS. However, the
      effect of other Î²-Blocker, bisoprolol compared with propranolol is not known well. In
      addition, acetylcholinesterase inhibition with pyridostigmine was a effective method of
      acutely decreasing the tachycardia in patients with POTS. However, difference among three
      medical treatments effect is not known and long-term studies are not done yet. Therefore, in
      this study investigator investigate effect of medical treatment (propranolol only, bisoprolol
      only, propranolol+pyridostigmine, bisoprolol+pyridostigmine) and prognosis of Postural
      Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.

      Longer-term studies are needed to assess this promising therapy.
