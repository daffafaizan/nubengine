    
      Consecutive patients undergoing pre-test cancer genetic counseling and cancer genetic
      testing, during the study period, will be eligible to participate. During the pre-test
      genetic counseling, demographic data, family and personal medical history will be collected
      and pedigree will be drawn. Available participants will provide written informed consent.
      They will be then randomized in blocks of ten participants using an online system
      (http://wwwservizi.regione.emilia-romagna.it/generatore/).

      The study is open label; thus, patients and investigators will not be blinded to treatment
      allocation due to the study nature intervention.

      After randomization, participants will be scheduled for post-test genetic counseling session.
      Participants randomized to usual care will receive standard in-person result disclosure.
      Participants randomized to telephone counseling will be scheduled for telephone post-test
      counseling sessions. One-week after completing the post-test genetic counseling session, the
      survey package will be sent by email to participants to assess impact and satisfaction with
      post-test counseling.

      Genetic counselors delivering post-test genetic counseling will complete the questionnaire
      immediately after the post-test session.
