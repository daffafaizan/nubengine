    
      This trial has a two-step, sequential design, with continuation to the second part of the
      trial being dependent on the positive results in the first part. In Part One of the trial,
      the investigator will compare intrapatient variability in fDM performed at two timepoints
      prior to chemotherapy (chemotherapy will be chosen by the treating physician and will not be
      assigned as part of this study), with the change in fDM before and approximately one week
      after a dose of chemotherapy, to establish that treatment-related changes in fDM will occur
      in this clinical setting. If there are positive results in Part One, then the investigator
      will proceed to the second half of the trial. In Part Two, the investigator will examine
      changes in fDM that occur one week after each type of chemotherapy is administered, which
      will be compared to pathologic response, radiological response, and clinical response.
