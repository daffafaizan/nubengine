      parallel group, randomized trial to determine the efficacy and safety of testosterone
      replacement therapy (TRT) in improving the symptoms of androgen deficiency (sexual symptoms,
      low energy, and physical dysfunction) and overall health-related quality of life in men with
      prostate cancer who have undergone radical prostatectomy for organ-localized disease
      (pT2,N0,M0), Gleason score < 7 (3+4), who have undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/mL using a sensitive
      PSA assay) for > 2 years after radical prostatectomy, and who have androgen deficiency.
