      deficits and a decreased function after Achilles tendon rupture is found up to 10 years
      later. The majority of the patients are of working age and a deficit in physical performance
      will have impact on returning to work and sports.

      There has been promising results in treatments using early functional rehabilitation during
      the first eight weeks of treatment after both surgical and non-surgical treatment, but few
      studies has examined the effect of the exercises on its own. In general, descriptions of the
      exercise programs are lacking important information such as type, time of application,
      frequency, intensity and progression of the exercises.

      The primary aim is to test the feasibility of an early progressive exercise program for
      patients with Achilles tendon rupture treated non-surgically. Feasibility in this study will
      be defined as successful patient acceptability and compliance of the exercise intervention.
