      branch. It travels downward on the inside of the rib cage and then gives off six main
      branches; mediastinal, thymic, pericardiacophrenic, sternal, perforating and intercostal
      branches.

      In literature, there are so many articles that have been focused on thymus size in
      pregnancies complicated with diabetes mellitus, fetal growth restriction, preterm rupture of
      membranes and so on. To the best of our knowledge, there is no paper about fetal ITA whose
      branch are feeding vessel of thymus and ITA Doppler velocity. The arteries supplying the
      thymus are branches of the internal thoracic, and inferior thyroid arteries. As far as it has
      been known, growing of a tissue depends on increased blood flow. Before detecting possible
      blood-flow changes in fetuses complicated with great obstetrics patologies, the investigators
      should obtain normal values of ITA Doppler velocity.
