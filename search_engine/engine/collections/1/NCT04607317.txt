    
      This is a randomized, controlled pilot trial to assess the feasibility and fidelity of a 12
      week, individualized, telehealth exercise intervention in people with refractory epilepsy.
      This will be carried out using a 2 arm, parallel group design with a waitlist attention
      control.

      Participants will undergo formal exercise testing prior to enrollment to determine safety and
      establish a baseline fitness level. Participants will use a wrist-worn Garmin device to
      record activity and sleep. After a 4 week baseline period, participants will be randomized to
      intervention or wait-list attention control. The intervention group will undergo a 12-week
      telehealth exercise program designed by a trained health coach and tailored to the
      individual's personal fitness level and exercise preferences. The intervention is based in
      social cognitive theory to implement and enforce sustainable behavior change. The wait-list
      attention control will receive health education but will not be given an exercise program. At
      the end of the intervention period, the control group will be given the option to participate
      in the exercise program.

      The study will assess recruitment and retention as well as fidelity, acceptability and
      sustainability of a telehealth exercise intervention in this population.

      The study will investigate objective and subjective measures of the effect of the
      intervention on the known seizure triggers of sleep and stress as possible mediators of
      seizure frequency.

      The study will collect information regarding the effects of the intervention on depression,
      anxiety, quality of life, cognition, and seizure frequency.
