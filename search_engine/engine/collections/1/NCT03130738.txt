    
      Miconazole, an imidazole antifungal agent, is commonly used for different types of fungal
      skin infections, such as Candida, ringworm, jock itch, athlete's foot, nail fungus, vaginal
      yeast infections, and oropharyngeal candidiasis. The 2% formulation of miconazole is commonly
      used for dermatophytic infections. The mechanisms of action of miconazole against fungi in
      general appear to be applicable to fungi associated with otomycosis, in that miconazole has
      been demonstrated to have activity in vitro against some clinical isolates of fungi
      associated with human otomycosis in the US.

      Miconazole targets the cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme 14-α-sterol demethylase, an enzyme
      that is also involved in mammalian cholesterol synthesis, resulting in inhibition of
      ergosterol biosynthesis in the cell membrane of the fungal organism. Because ergosterol is an
      important component of the cell membrane, inhibition of its synthesis inhibits fungal cell
      growth.

      In addition to its activity toward the enzyme 14-α-sterol demethylase, miconazole also leads
      to increased reactive oxygen species in fungal organisms, which appears to result in
      fungicidal activity.
