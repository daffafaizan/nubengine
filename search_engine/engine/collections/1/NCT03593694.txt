      (AA) are disproportionately affected and have higher prevalence, poorer metabolic control and
      greater risk for complications and death compared to White Americans. Evidence from the
      literature show that effective interventions for AAs with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
      have multiple components including: education and skills training, nurse case management, and
      maintain high intensity. However, few large Randomized Clinical Trials (RCT) have tested
      multi-component interventions that include these key components in AAs with T2DM.

      Behavioral Activation is a psychotherapeutic process whereby patients are encouraged to
      identify and schedule structured and enjoyable activities for behavior change that are likely
      to improve outcomes such as mood, behaviors and quality of life. A brief manualized
      behavioral activation treatment for depression (BATD), has been modified for diabetes.

      This study tests a multi-component, high intensity intervention that incorporates several
      strategies that have been shown to be effective in improving diabetes outcomes in AAs. Nurse
      case managers will use videoconferencing technology to deliver education, skills training and
      problem solving for diabetes via smartphones, an approach that has not been used previously
      in vulnerable and underserved ethnic minority populations.
