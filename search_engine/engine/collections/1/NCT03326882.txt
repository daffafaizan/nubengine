      than 1 years who are undergoing surgical procedures requiring endotracheal intubation. Time
      to endotracheal intubation was compared between patients intubated using a GlideScopeÂ® video
      laryngoscope, and those intubated by standard direct laryngoscopy. The main objective of this
      study was to evaluate the intubation time of Glidescope compared with Macintoch laryngoscope
      in pediatric patients, ease of intubation, and cardiovascular changes during intubation.
