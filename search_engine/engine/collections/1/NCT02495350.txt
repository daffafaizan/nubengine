      Center (Beilinson Campus), Petach Tikva, Israel, a tertiary university hospital.

      All women undergoing vaginal delivery on the first day postpartum will be enrolled after
      filling out an informed consent.

      They will be given out a labor satisfaction questionnaire detailing initial desire for
      epidural analgesia, final desire for epidural analgesia, adequacy of pain relief during labor
      and satisfaction with labor. (see appendix 1).

      The investigators will evaluate breastfeeding success according to the latch scoring system
      in the first day postpartum which is routinely administered by nurses/ lactation consultants
      in the maternity ward.

      According to their initial desire verses final analgesic choice they will be divided into
      four groups:

        1. Women who initially didn't want and didn't receive one.

        2. Initially didn't want and did receive one.

        3. Initially wanted an epidural and didn't received one

        4. Initially wanted an epidural and did receive one.

      On the third day postoperatively the parturients will be called and assessed for mood and
      signs of postpartum depression using Edinborough Postnatal Depression scale validated into
      Hebrew (10) , and the investigators will assess whether or not they are breastfeeding.

      At 6 weeks the investigators will follow-up to assess breastfeeding duration ,and postpartum
      depression using the Edinborough Postnatal Depression scale.

      The investigators' comparison will include average pain scores, breast feeding success, and
      postpartum depression assessment.
