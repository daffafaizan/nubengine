    
      The primary aim is to evaluate abdominal pain in morbid obese patients before and after
      sleeve gastrectomy. The investigators will especially focus on chronic abdominal pain, and
      its relation to quality of life and weight loss. In a sub-analysis the investigators will
      compare the findings of the present cohort with patients operated with Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass.

      Primary endpoints/outcomes:

      - Define the prevalence of chronic abdominal pain 2 years after sleeve gastrectomy

      Secondary endpoints/outcomes:

      - Evaluate and characterise chronic abdominal pain in regard to:

        -  Weight development

        -  Obesity-related comorbidities

        -  Health-related quality of life

        -  Postoperative complications

        -  Metabolic effects after surgery

        -  Nutritional status

        -  Socioeconomic status
