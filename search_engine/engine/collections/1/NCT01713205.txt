      death. One of the most serious complications of major trauma is sepsis, which often induces
      sequential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). There were still no specific
      biomarkers to predict the susceptibility of complications and outcomes, which leading to the
      limited prevention methods and the high mortality rate of severe trauma patients. Previous
      studies from our and other group have found some sepsis and MODS predictors, including
      genetic polymorphisms, serum cytokines and cell-surface markers. The purposes of this
      multi-center observational study is to select biomarkers and evaluate a clinically and
      economically most effective diagnostic algorithm for prediction of complications in severe
      trauma patients.
