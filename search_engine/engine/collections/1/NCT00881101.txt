      tumors. Liposomal paclitaxel has different pharmacokinetic features comparing with
      conventional paclitaxel. However,the tolerance of this new dosage form of paclitaxel
      (liposomal paclitaxel) has never been studied in Chinese cancer patients. This study is
      designed to find the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of liposomal
      paclitaxel in Chinese cancer patients.
