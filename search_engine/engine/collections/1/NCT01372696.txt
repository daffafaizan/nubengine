      wall with minimal vertical growth. It has become evident over the last few years that rather
      than being a single entity requiring an accumulation of mutations, colon cancer is in fact a
      heterogenous disease forming via multiple distinct genetic pathways. Additionally, with
      improved endoscopic characterization, it has been noted from experience at Westmead hospital
      that two macroscopically distinct types of LSTs, "granular" and "non granular", have
      different natural histories and risks of invasive cancer. It is therefore hypothesised that
      different polyp types have different genetic abnormalities, and potentially form via distinct
      genetic pathways, although this theory has not been widely examined.

      This knowledge would be important in furthering our understanding of the development of
      cancer. There is accumulating evidence that genetic abnormalities may be a better predictor
      of cancer behaviour than histological grade. Additionally, guidelines for colonoscopy
      surveillance are currently a one size fits all approach that do not reflect the genetic
      heterogeneity of the disease and the knowledge that only 5% of polyps progress to cancer.
      Genetic studies may assess future cancer risk to a person in polyps once removed and plan
      surveillance colonoscopy frequency. This is an area with interest currently due to the
      national bowel cancer screening programme, with obvious cost implications for decision
      makers.
