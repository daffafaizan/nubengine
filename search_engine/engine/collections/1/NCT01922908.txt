    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study. . Approximately 48 subjects
      will be enrolled in the trial, undergo a real or SHAM MSC IV infusion and will be follow out
      to 1 year. There will potentially be 4 Cohorts with the dose escalation at a 3:1
      randomization schedule

      Objectives:

        -  The primary hypothesis' are that intravenous administration of allogeneic bone marrow
           derived mesenchymal stem cells is feasible and safe in patients with recent ischemic
           stroke and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IV MSCs when administered
           sub-acutely between 3-10 days following ischemic stroke.

        -  The secondary hypothesis is that allogeneic MSC transplantation will improve functional
           outcome after recent ischemic stroke.

      Safety and clinical efficacy points to be evaluated at Day 7 clinic visit, Day 30, Day 60,
      Day 90, and Day 180. Primary outcome or Primary endpoint of the study is to define the safety
      or harm of the MSCs
