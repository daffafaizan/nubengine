      inflammatory necrosis of the intestine mainly seen in premature infants, and continues to be
      an important cause of mortality and morbidity in neonatal intensive care units all over the
      world. Although it is more common in premature infants, it is also seen in term babies when
      the intestine is ischemic. Although the major problem in premature babies is the immaturity
      of the intestine, many factors contributing to immaturity play a role in the pathogenesis of
      NEC.

      With this study project, which is planned as a national multicenter prospective study, the
      incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborn infants born in neonatal intensive care
      units in our country and the risk factors associated with the NEC, especially the detailed
      feeding history of the patient (when the first feeding is nourished, antibiotics and other
      treatments that are being used). Most epidemiological data such as the most common stage of
      the disease, treatment, prognosis, comparison with the data of other countries will provide
      important information for the neonatal health of our country.

      The aim of this study was to determine the factors affecting the emergence of NEC in neonatal
      intensive care units and to determine the frequency of NEC.

      Study Hypothesis: Delayed enteral feeding, intensive use of antibiotics and nutrients other
      than breast milk increase the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis.
