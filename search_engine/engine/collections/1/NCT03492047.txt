      seems to have a major role in paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain, paclitaxel contributes to
      ROS formation (superoxide, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide) in neuronal
      mitochondria that are involved in nerve injury-induced.

      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a cysteine pro-drug and glutathione (GSH) precursor which is a
      protective agent and detoxifies and scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), which seems to
      help normalize the oxidative status.

      It has been reported that high dose of N-acetylcysteine shown to Prevent retrograde motor
      neuron death after neonatal peripheral nerve injury and significantly increases motor neuron
      survival, which may improve functional outcomes after obstetrical brachial plexus injury in
      rats.

      Also, it has been reported that NAC significantly inhibited CCI-induced microglia activation
      but elicited no notable effects on astrocytes. These results demonstrate an effective and
      safe approach that has been used clinically to alleviate neuropathic pain via the powerful
      inhibition of the activation of MMPs in rats.

      N-acetylcysteine has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against oxaliplatin-based
      adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer patients with Oral administration of
      N-acetylcysteine1,200 mg) was given one and a half hours before each oxaliplatin
      administration.
