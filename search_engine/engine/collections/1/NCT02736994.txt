      the current protocols. It was aimed to examine, in institutionalized older individuals with
      removable complete dentures, if the microbial composition and C. albicans colonization of the
      denture biofilm differs when overnight stored in a probiotic cleaning product compared to
      water or a cleanser. Additionally the influence of brushing on these protocols was
      investigated.
