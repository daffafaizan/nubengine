      be obtained from the blood that will be collected for the routine coagulation screening (in
      neonates and in children < 18 months) or at the time of surgery in children aged > 18 months.
      Healthy neonates will be recruited by the neonatologists. Children aged from 1 month to 15
      years will be included by anesthesiologists before minor elective surgery such as
      tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, phimosis or oral surgery. Additionally, blood from adults
      referred for thrombophilia testing will be studied. This study was approved by French
      authorities (ANSM and CPP). Inform consent will be obtained from all participants. Blood will
      be collected into plastic tubes containing sodium citrate (0.106 M, tubes from "Starstedt").
      Platelet poor plasma will be obtained by two centrifugations for 10 minutes at 2500 g at room
      temperature and stored at - 70Â°C until further examination.

      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed as 1) a descriptive analysis
      (frequency and percentage for qualitative data, mean, SD and centiles for quantitative data),
      and 2) a comparison analysis (student, Mann-Withney, Kruskall- Wallis).
