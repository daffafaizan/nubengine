      hair follicle and the inflammation present in the skin of patients with alopecia areata. In
      the study we will obtain additional scalp biopsies to examine how the drug affects the
      quality and state of activity of the immune cells in the biopsy specimens. This type of
      information will provide data about the behavior of these inflammatory cells in mediating the
      hair loss associated with alopecia areata and how this behavior may be effected by Aldara
      Cream 5% treatment. Such information may be valuable to the successful management of alopecia
      areata.
