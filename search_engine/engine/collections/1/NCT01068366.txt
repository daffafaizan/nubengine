    
      This is a single-center, single-operator, investigator-initiated, investigator-funded,
      open-label, non-randomized cohort study. Inclusion criteria include patients ≥18 years,
      secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) ≤1cm on transesophageal echocardiography or patent
      foramen ovale (PFO), without contraindications to antiplatelet and/or antithrombotic therapy,
      and suitable anatomy for device closure with one of the following: Amplatzer atrial septal
      occluder, Amplatzer Cribriform septal occluder, Amplatzer PFO occluder, or the Gore Helex
      septal occluder. After device implantation, routine clinical followup will be performed,
      including transthoracic echocardiography at 1 day, 1 month, and 6 months, and 48-Holter
      monitoring for arrhythmia at 1 month.

      Research related study procedures are blood draws to measure nickel levels and a patient
      questionnaire about symptoms. Blood draws will be done at baseline [from the femoral venous
      sheath immediately prior to device implantation] and at one (1) day, one (1) month, three (3)
      months and six (6) months. The Questionnaire will be completed at one (1) month, three (3)
      months and six (6) months but can be done over the telephone if patient is having blood drawn
      at a lab closer to their home. Patient participation is complete after collection of the 6
      month blood results and patient questionnaire.
