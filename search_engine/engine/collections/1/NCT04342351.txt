      for heart function and adverse cardiovascular events. The angiotensin receptor neprilysin
      inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan was shown to reduce the risk of both death (from
      cardiovascular and all-causes) and heart failure hospitalization. However, whether early
      treatment of ARNI following post-MI could alter myocardial remodeling or aerobic exercise
      capacity has yet to be assessed. The patients with MI within one month were enrolled in the
      treatment of ARNI group or ACEI group. The study proposes to perform serial Cardiopulmonary
      Exercise Tests (CPET) to prospectively measure changes in aerobic exercise capacity in
      patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), echocardiographic measures of LV
      end-diastolic/ systolic volumes, LV ejection fraction (LVEF), BNP and protein plasma levels,
      symptomatic heart failure, and life quality.
