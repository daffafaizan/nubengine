           completely introducing the study, the participants would be requested to sign informed
           consent.

        2. The participants would perform maximal oxygen consumption test prior to the
           supplementation. The participants would be supplemented with either Danggui Buxue Tang
           or placebo for a week before performing the 13-km run. A total of 4 times blood
           collection (before supplementation, immediate after running, 1 day and 3 days after
           running) would be performed for evaluating the effect of Danggui Buxue Tang on blood
           biochemical parameters.
