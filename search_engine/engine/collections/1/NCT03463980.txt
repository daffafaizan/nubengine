      low-income, suicidal African American women and men that compares the relative effectiveness
      of compassion meditation (CM) versus a support group (SG) for (1) reducing psychological
      distress (suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and shame); (2) bolstering interpersonal
      connectedness; and (3) enhancing self-compassion and mindfulness. It is hypothesized that at
      post-intervention and follow-up, compared to individuals in the SG, those in the CM
      intervention will endorse less psychological distress (suicidal ideation, depressive
      symptoms, and shame), more interpersonal connectedness, and greater levels of self-compassion
      and mindfulness.
