      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of microtubule-targeted agent BAL101553
      (BAL101553) in combination with standard radiation in patients with newly diagnosed MGMT
      promoter unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate safety and tolerability of the combination of BAL101553 in combination with
      standard radiation in patients with newly diagnosed MGMT promoter unmethylated GBM.

      II. To determine overall and progression-free survival. III. To assess the pharmacokinetics
      of BAL101553 and BAL27862. IV. To explore expression of biomarkers, including BubR1, stathmin
      and EB1 at baseline (exploratory biomarkers).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of the microtubule-targeted agent BAL101553.

      Patients receive microtubule-targeted agent BAL101553 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days
      1-42 and undergo concomitant standard radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 2
      months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.
