    
      Diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the
      western world, accounting for approximately 40% of new cases in the US, and up to 20 to 30%
      in Europe.

      Current treatments for diabetic nephropathy usually try to deal with the underlying diabetes
      or they aim to reduce cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycemia,
      smoking and dyslipidemia. A few recently approved drugs such as irbesartan and losartan (for
      type 2 diabetic nephropathy) have a renoprotective activity beyond their antihypertensive
      effect. However, morbidity and mortality rates remain high.

      Avosentan may have a positive effect on reducing the amount of protein lost in the urine and
      if this is the case it will help treat patients with diabetic nephropathy.
