      with low levels of testosterone appear to be at higher risk of metabolic syndrome.

      A substantial number of testicular cancer survivors might be in a state of "compensated
      hypogonadism" with testosterone levels low in the normal range due to an increased LH-drive
      from the pituitary gland.

      Whether this specific groups of testicular cancer survivors are at increased risk of
      cardio-vascular disease and might benefit from testosterone substitution is yet to be
      clarified.
