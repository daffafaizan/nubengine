      symptoms and in parallel, explore whether nitrous oxide improves cognitive and pain outcomes.
      Specifically, the investigators will first assess whether nitrous oxide treatment improves
      PTSD symptoms within 1 week. In parallel, the investigators will explore whether the
      treatment improves co-existing depression and pain. In addition, the investigators will
      explore nitrous oxide's effects on a PTSD-associated impairment that is often overlooked -
      disruption in cognitive control, a core neurobiological process critical for regulating
      thoughts and for successful daily functioning.
