    
      This study is a single blind, randomized, Simulated-ECT (S-ECT) controlled trial of
      electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). The purpose is to determine the efficacy and safety of ECT
      for severe agitation in moderate to severe stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD), while also
      examining the durability of the acute treatment effect in an exploratory maintenance
      naturalistic design. The investigators will study only inpatients with severe agitation and
      moderate to severe dementia, associated with high care costs and poor quality of life, who
      typically have already failed prior trials of psychotropic medications. The first aim is to
      compare the relative efficacy of up to 9 ECT treatments plus usual care (ECT+UC) versus
      Simulated ECT (S-ECT+UC) in reducing severe agitation in 200 participants with moderate to
      severe AD. The second aim is to compare the relative tolerability/safety outcomes of ECT+UC
      versus S-ECT+UC in the same group of participants. The exploratory aim is to understand the
      stability of agitation reduction (CMAI) and global functioning (Clinical Global
      Impression-Severity [CGI-S]) with assessments at 1,3, and 6 months following the randomized
      phase, and then for a fourth visit 12 months after the randomized phase. Establishing safety
      and efficacy of ECT for severe agitation in AD provides an opportunity to decrease long-term
      care placement, decrease the risk of mortality, decrease caregiver burden, and enhance
      quality of life for patients and their caregivers.
