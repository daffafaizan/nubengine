      International (SSI). The projected sample size is approximately 3,500, comprising mothers or
      female guardians of at least one child aged 11-14 who live in the United States. The survey
      will take no more than 20 minutes to complete. Mothers who indicate that they do not plan to
      vaccinate their children in the next year will be randomized to view brief videos tailored to
      their questions or concerns about HPV vaccination. The outcome of interest is intention to
      vaccinate. Mothers who have vaccinated their child or intend to vaccinate their child will be
      asked a separate set of questions relevant to this information.

      Mothers who indicate that they do not intend to vaccinate their child against HPV will be
      asked about their questions or concerns regarding HPV vaccination (from a pre-populated list
      of common concerns). Mothers will be randomized to one of three arms: 1. A general
      information video; 2. The general video plus a video addressing their top concern; or 3. The
      general video plus one or more videos addressing all of their concerns. Each video is less
      than 50 seconds in length.
