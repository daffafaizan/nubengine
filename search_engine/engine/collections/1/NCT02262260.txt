    
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common endocrine disease in developed countries, with
      prevalence estimates ranging between 2 to 5% of the world's population. Diabetic retinopathy
      (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are common microvascular complications in patients with
      diabetes and may have a sudden and debilitating impact on visual acuity (VA), eventually
      leading to blindness. DME is a frequent manifestation of DR and is the major cause of visual
      loss in patients with DR. If left untreated, >50% of patients lose >2 lines of visual acuity
      (VA) within 2 years. DME mostly affects the working-age population, imposing a significant
      burden both on society and on individual patients - a burden that is expected to increase
      with the rising prevalence of diabetes.
