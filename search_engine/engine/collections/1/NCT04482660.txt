    
      CROSS-SECTIONAL OBJECTIVES

        -  To measure 18F-RO6958948 retention in selected participants of ALFA-related studies as a
           function of amyloid levels.

        -  To study the relation between 18F-RO6958948 retention and amyloid levels.

        -  To characterize imaging correlates as a function of tau and amyloid levels.

        -  To study the role of tau retention on cognitive performance.

        -  To define predictors of tau retention.

      LONGITUDINAL OBJECTIVES

        -  To measure tau accumulation and spreading in participants of the ALFA-related studies of
           BBRC as a function of baseline amyloid levels.

        -  To study the dynamic relation between tau spreading and amyloid levels longitudinally.

        -  To define predictors of tau spreading.
