      inhalers (DPIs) containing budesonide-formoterol. Pharmacists are instructed to switch
      patients to the inhaler with the lowest price. The pharmacist will train the patient on how
      to use the new inhaler. All patients whose eligible inhaler switch occurred between 1st July
      2018 and 1st March 2019 will be eligible for the study.
