    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ATR kinase inhibitor BAY1895344 (BAY1895344)
      with concurrent head and neck stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) reirradiation and
      pembrolizumab.

      II. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BAY 1895344 in combination with
      concurrent head and neck SBRT and pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity (overall response rate, progression-free
      survival, and overall survival) of BAY 1895344, SBRT, and pembrolizumab for recurrent head
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify predictive biomarkers of response to BAY 1895344, SBRT, and pembrolizumab,
      including, but not limited to the following: genetic alterations of ATM and other
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response genes, tumor mutational load, circulating tumor
      DNA, baseline tumor ATM expression, tumor PD-L1 expression, and change in circulating Ki67+
      CD8+ T-cells relative to baseline.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BAY1895344 and stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) given with fixed-dose pembrolizumab.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Starting on day
      7, patients also receive BAY1895344 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 7-9 and 14-16
      during cycle 1, and before and after each SBRT treatment during cycle 2 for a total of 9
      doses. Beginning cycle 2, patients undergo SBRT starting between days 2 and 8 for 3 fractions
      with 2-3 days between fractions. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up quarterly for 2 years or until
      death, whichever occurs first.
