      Observation Schedule (ADOS). ASD-related symptomatology and levels of impairments will be
      further characterized using the Social Responsibilities Scale 2 (SRS 2), Caregiver Strain
      Questionnaire (CSQ), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Communication Questionnaire
      (SCQ), and Repetitive Behaviour Scale Revised (RBS-R).

      Subsequently all participants will be administered the following eye-tracking paradigms: (1)
      dynamic social and non-social visual preference paradigm during which dynamic geometric
      images (DGI) and dynamic social images (DSI) will be presented, (2) non-biological versus
      biological motion paradigm, (3) social attention and sharing of enjoyment paradigm, (4)
      preference for real versus schematic emotional face stimuli paradigm during which photographs
      of human faces and emoticons will be presented, (5) shared social attention and gaze
      direction paradigm.
