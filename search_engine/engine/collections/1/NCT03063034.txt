      the order in which they will smoke two study menthol cigarette products (including one
      comparator product and one test product). Subjects will smoke each study product exclusively
      for approximately one week prior to a test visit, with a different product smoked each week
      over a two-week period. Cigarette butts will be collected the day prior to each test visit
      for determination of MLE "tar" and nicotine levels. Blood samples will be collected at each
      test visit for determination of plasma cotinine levels. Subjects will provide responses to
      questions during each test visit to assess their cigarette smoking and cigarette butt
      collection behavior during the preceding day.
