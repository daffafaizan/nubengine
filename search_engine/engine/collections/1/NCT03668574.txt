    
      A total of 30 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (with a duration of at least
      12 weeks) who are seeking for treatment will be recruited. These patients will be randomly
      allocated into two groups.

      Patients allocated to the placebo group will be treated twice a week for a total of 12 weeks
      with detuned ultrasound and shortwave therapy

      Patients allocated to the exercise group will be trained with aerobic exercises on a
      treadmill twice a week for a total of 12 weeks.

      Primary outcomes will be pain and disability. Feasibility outcomes will be adherence,
      satisfaction and recruitment. Kinesiophobia, perceived global effect and physical capacity
      will also be analyzed as secondary outcomes. The outcome assessor of this trial will be
      blinded to the group allocation.
