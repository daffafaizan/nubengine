        1. Evaluate the effects of the Mindful Kala program on outcomes of health-related measures
           such as mindfulness, stress, connectedness, and wellbeing amongst students. The
           investigators hypothesize that participants will experience fewer symptoms of stress,
           increased mindfulness, increased well-being, and increased connectedness.

        2. Evaluate the effects of the Mindful Kala program on changes in measures of cultural
           competence. The investigators hypothesize that the level of cultural competence will
           increase among the students.

        3. Develop and examine the feasibility and acceptability of a 4-week Mindful Kala program
           for college students.
