      and in some cases, mortality. Currently the most common method of surgical treatment includes
      the use of a sliding hip screw over a Gamma intramedullary nail, but there is conflicting
      evidence regarding which device has a lower revision surgery rate and complication rate.
      Recent improvements in implant design of the Gamma3 nail, demonstrating decreased rates of
      femoral shaft fractures and improved function, provide compelling rationale for the conduct
      of a large, definitive trial.

      This trial is a definitive, multi-center, concealed randomized controlled trial. Surgeons
      will use one of the two surgical strategies in patients who have sustained a trochanteric
      fracture; the Gamma3 intramedullary nail or the sliding hip screw. Clinical assessments will
      occur at the time of hospital admission, post-surgery, 13 weeks, 26 weeks, 52 weeks, and 104
      weeks.
