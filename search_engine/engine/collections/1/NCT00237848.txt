      and thereby increasing the capacity of the brain to both form new connections and strengthen
      existing connections, schizophrenic patients may derive both greater and sustained benefit
      from cognitive retraining.

      Patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are currently receiving
      antipsychotic medication will be randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive either
      D-serine (30 mg/kg) or placebo in addition to cognitive rehabilitation or a non-interactive
      placebo for 12 weeks.
