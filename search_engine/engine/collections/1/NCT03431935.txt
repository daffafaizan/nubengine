      at St. Jude or Methodist Adult Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center. The questions ask about
      sickle cell disease knowledge and self-management skills, access to care, general adjustment,
      quality of life, and stress. These questions will take about 60 minutes to complete.

      Participants will answer questionnaires on a password protected laptop or tablet using a
      computer program called Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviews (ACASI). The laptop or tablet
      will be kept by the study team. A study team member will be available during this time to
      address any technical issues or answer any questions. Participants will answer one of the
      questionnaires verbally, and the study team member will record responses from the
      questionnaire with paper and pen. Questionnaires given verbally will be audio-recorded and
      reviewed by the lead researcher or other study team member. The recordings will be destroyed
      immediately after review. No transcript or written record of the recordings will be made.
      Study members will meet five times with each participant during regularly-scheduled clinical
      visits over a two year period.

      Two institutions will collaborate in the proposed project. St. Jude Children's Research
      Hospital (St. Jude) and the Methodist Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center will be the primary
      source of participants. Faculty from the University of Memphis, Department of Psychology,
      will be involved in methodological considerations and analyzing the data.
