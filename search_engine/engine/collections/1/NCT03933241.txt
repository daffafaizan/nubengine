      resection after informed consent were selected as the study subjects,Randomly divided into
      experimental group and control group. The experimental group apply the routine postoperative
      nursing process of transsphenoidal pituitary tumor plus nasal irrigation nursing process, the
      control group apply the routine postoperative nursing process of transsphenoidal pituitary
      tumor .After the removal of nasal gauze,we use visual analogue scale (VAS) to score and
      observe the clinical symptoms of nasal cavity in both groups. The patients were asked to mark
      out the score that could represent the severity of their symptoms for evaluation. The nurses
      filled in the form, and the nasal comfort was re-evaluated through face-to-face talks and
      telephone follow-up at two days ,1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the removal of the
      gauze.we will apply nasosinusitis scale (SNOT -20) to measure the quality of life of the
      patients in the two groups at the first day, 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after the removal
      of nasal strips .After 12 weeks of discharge, two groups of patients were hospitalized for
      reexamination with pituitary MRI or CT,to determine the incidence of postoperative sphenoid
      sinusitis.Patients were followed up and interviewed by telephone one week, four weeks and 12
      weeks after discharge, were evaluate the incidence of complications such as nasal bleeding,
