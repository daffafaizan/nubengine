    
      During 2010, we've conducted two cross-sectional, telephonic national surveys that assessed
      the prevalence (Portuguese Asthma Prevalence Survey - PAPS) and the control (Portuguese
      Asthma Control Survey - PACS) of asthma and rhinitis. Before these surveys there was no
      country-wide data on prevalence or about the control of asthma in Portugal.We propose an
      additional study that will apply a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests and clinical
      assessment to a sub-sample of participants in the PACS study. The effect of asthma, rhinitis
      and their control on personal and social burden will be studied comparing patients with
      current asthma and/or rhinitis and individuals with no respiratory symptoms.Sample size
      calculations were based on the comparison of quality of life measured by WHOQOL-BREF in
      patients with different diagnosis. Data collection includes anthropometric measurements, lung
      function & inflammation tests, allergy tests, a structured clinical interview and
      standardized questionnaires. Research assistants performing the evaluations will be blinded
      to the subject classification in PAPS and PACS and to the results of the questionnaires
      administered, namely the GA2LEN survey instrument and CARAT. The data collection will be
      organized with the local Public Health delegate and will take place as close as possible to
      the participants' communities at a local health unit or in the surrounding area, in order to
      minimize dropouts.
