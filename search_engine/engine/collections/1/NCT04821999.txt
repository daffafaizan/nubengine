      (8,9). These could be prolonged symptoms of SARS-CoV2 or a posteSARS-CoV2 syndrome for which
      dysfunction of smell and taste sensation has been proposed.

      The proposal presents the diode laser 940 as possible treatment for the loss of taste
      sensation in patients with long SARS-CoV2. The effect of low levels of laser energy was first
      discovered by Dr Endre Mester in 1967.5 Since then it has been used for various applications
      in the field of medicine and dentistry and is broadly termed 'low level laser therapy'(LLLT)
      or 'biostimulation' or 'phototherapy'. It is defined as a 'non-thermal' laser light
      application using photons (light energy) from the visible and infrared spectrum for tissue
      healing and pain reduction (North American Association of Laser Therapy-NAALT). Several in
      vitro studies have demonstrated that the effects of laser light on wound healing are much
      greater than obtained with light from other sources, such as light-emitting diodes
      (LEDs).(10-13)
