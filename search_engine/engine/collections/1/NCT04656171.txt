      very penalizing for children especially regarding graphic tasks, handwriting, whether or not
      they have skeletal malformations of the upper limbs. Consequences are fatigue because of
      energy expended trying to execute fine motor movements correctly.

      Main objective:

      To identify gesture dyspraxia in order to propose a targeted rehabilitation leading to
      national recommendations.

      Main Evaluation Criteria :

        1. measurement of fine motor praxia

        2. quantification of dyspraxia

      Secondary Objectives :

      To identify the musculoskeletal or tendinous anomalies in the upper limbs of AF children and
      to assess their functional consequences.

      To determine if these upper limbs abnormalities could influence the somatosensory map of this
      part of the body in the cerebral cortex.

      Secondary Evaluation Criteria :

        1. MRI of the hand and forearm, orthopedic examination and functional assessment

        2. Previously obtained brain MRI data
