      more aggressive radiation therapy treatments of head and neck cancer include the additive and
      synergistic increase in mucositis from the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The
      severe toxicity associated with more aggressive radiation therapy treatments for locoregional
      head and neck cancer limits the extent to which these treatments can be offered since many
      patients present with nutritional deficiencies and consequent general debility. Intensity
      Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) is a technology has the potential for exquisite dose painting
      and structuring in such a manner that it can permit exclusion of normal tissues and sensitive
      structures from the high dose radiation volume without compromising primary tumor or nodal
      target coverage. In this phase I/II feasibility trial, radical radiotherapy will be delivered
      using Helical Tomotherapy Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (HT-IMRT) to a dose of 66-70 Gy to
      involved areas and to at least 50 Gy to un-involved sites, treated prophylactically. It is
      hypothesized that the pattern of failure and toxicity profiles of patients treated with
      helical tomotherapy will demonstrate the greater efficacy of helical tomotherapy, as compared
      with conventional radiotherapy, in the treatment of cancers of the head and neck.
