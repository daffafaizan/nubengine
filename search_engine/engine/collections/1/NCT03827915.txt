    
      Patients presenting to the CCU with persistent AF for direct current (DC) cardioversion, who
      meet the inclusion criteria and fail to revert to normal sinus rhythm after two DC
      cardioversion attempts will be invited for enrollment in the study. No sampling will be
      carried out for the sake of this study.

      Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will receive double sequential external
      defibrillation (DSED) or a third DC cardioversion (standard of care).

      DSED is the process of using two defibrillators near simultaneously at their highest allowed
      energy setting and aims to treat refractory atrial fibrillation. The first set of pads is
      placed in the traditional anterolateral position and the second set can be either placed
      adjacent to the first set (antero-lateral) or in the antero-posterior position. Shocks are
      then delivered simultaneously or near simultaneously.
