    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an experienced anesthesia provider can
      adequately and/or easily mask ventilate an anesthetized patient with a commercial
      non-invasive ventilator device. The ventilator subject of this study is commonly used in the
      ICU and investigators aim to evaluate its usefulness in the OR. Investigators believe that
      the ventilator will ventilate with consistent breath rates, adequate tidal volumes and
      minimal airway pressures. The providers subjective scoring of ease or difficulty of
      ventilation with each device will also be recorded.
