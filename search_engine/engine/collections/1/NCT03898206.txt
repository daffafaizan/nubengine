      waist circumference will be measured. They will be familiarised with a motorised treadmill
      that will be used during the experimental visit below and will take part in an exercise test
      to determine a light-intensity walking speed for the experimental visit.

      Participants will then attend two experimental visits in a random order:

        1. Prolonged sitting: Participants will remain seated for 5 hours and instructed to reduce
           excessive movement.

        2. Breaking up sitting with walking breaks: Participants will rise from the seated position
           every 30 minutes throughout the experimental period to walk on a motorised treadmill at
           a light intensity for 3 minutes. After performing walking activity, they will return to
           the seated position. In addition, blood sample will be taken at the resting position
           just before each physical activity bout. The activity breaks will be undertaken on 9
           occasions, providing a total of 27 min of light intensity activity.

      During each visit, blood pressure will be taken 11 times and blood samples will be taken 10
      times. Participants will be given a breakfast and lunch meal to consume.
