      etiology. This condition is a clinical challenge due to the different treatment protocols
      available. Therefore, the aim of this study is through a double blind randomized clinical
      trial, evaluate the effectiveness of different clinical protocols in the reduction of dentin
      hypersensitivity. Thirty-two patients with dentin hypersensitivity in at least three teeth
      will be selected.The teeth will be randomly divided into two different groups according to
      the desensitization approach (single agent with neural action; single agent with obliterating
      action; associated technique (neural and obliterator agents). The dentin hypersensitivity
      level will be evaluated immediately after desensitization and after 1, 2, 4,12 and 24 weeks.
      Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis.
