    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the 12-month progression-free survival of patients with peripheral T-cell or
           natural killer cell neoplasms treated with bevacizumab and combination chemotherapy
           comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (A-CHOP).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (complete remission [CR, unconfirmed CR, or
           functional CR] and partial remission) in these patients after courses 3, 6, and 8 of
           this treatment regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive 6-8 cycles of A-CHOP followed by 8 cycles of maintenance bevacizumab (MA),
      as outlined below. Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg is administered on day 1 over 90 min (first cycle),
      60 min (second cycle) and 30 min for the subsequent cycles. CHOP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2
      ; doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2 ; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 [max. 2 mg]; prednisone 100 mg daily on days
      1-5) is administered on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Radiographic response is assessed after
      cycles 3, 6 and 8 of ACHOP and after cycle 8 of MA. Patients receive six cycles of ACHOP if
      they achieve a complete response (CR) after three cycles, eight cycles if they achieve a
      partial response (PR) after three cycles. Non-responders are removed from the study. ACHOP
      responders receive maintenance bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 21 days for eight cycles.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study within 22 months.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: 46
