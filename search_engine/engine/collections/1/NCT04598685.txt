      and 19 years. Examinations are conducted at schools and companies throughout Tyrol, Austria
      and include laboratory measurements; standardized medical interviews; anthropometry; liver
      elastography; ultrasonography of the carotid artery and the aorta, and blood pressure,
      bioelectrical impedance; visceral abdominal fat-tissue-thickness measurement, pulse-wave
      velocity measurements.

      The study hypothesis is that the cardiovascular risk factors measured already influence the
      formation of atherosclerosis (measured as carotid and aortic Intima-Media Thickness and
      Pulse-Wave-Velocity) in adolescents.

      A long-term follow-up by means of record linkage is furthermore planned to evaluate the
      effect of early atherosclerosis and the cardiovascular risk profile on future morbidity with
      a special focus cardio- and cerebrovascular events.
