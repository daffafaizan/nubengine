      because of "decompensation" that increases anxiety and fear. That is why therapeutic
      treatments are delivered quickly to treat these symptoms and to allow a better relationship
      with patients. This relationship patients-nursing staff called "therapeutic alliance" is
      needed in psychiatry. Moreover, other treatments added to the therapeutic ones are used, like
      mediation, to increase the patients' state of health.

      These last years, numerous studies were based on hortitherapy or care-gardens. It consists in
      the use of plants with a medical staff (for example nurses). A lot demonstrated the efficacy
      of the care-gardens, but most of them showed methodological weaknesses : no control group, no
      randomization, few patients. Furthermore, these studies were not performed with feared
      patients hospitalized in psychiatry.

      That is why the investigators would like to perform a randomized study, controlled, and they
      aim to demonstrate the efficacy of hortitherapy on anxiety in patients allowed in adult
      psychiatry for at least 4 weeks. This study will be performed on 190 patients who will be
      included in one of these groups:

        -  Control group : only usual care

        -  Hortitherapy group : 2 hortitherapy sessions/week during 4 weeks, added at the usual
           care.

      Anxiety will be evaluated with HAD-A scale that is a brief questionnaire (2 at 6 minutes).
      HAD-A is very sensitive at the modifications and allows to follow the evolution of the
      anxiety. This scale is easy to use by the nursing staff and shows an excellent reliability,
      by the way really adapted to this study. On another hand researchers will also focus on the
      effects on the therapeutic alliance and the persistence of the effects at week 8.
