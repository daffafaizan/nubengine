      (cervical dilatation > 4cm and preterm birth is considered inevitable or delivery is
      indicated for maternal or fetal indications) to either milking of the umbilical cord of their
      infants (intervention group) or to clamp the cord as per standard practice (currently it is
      the immediate cord clamping) after birth (control group). Randomization will be done in
      variable block sizes and will be concealed by using opaque envelopes prepared ahead of time
      from a randomization table. Envelopes will be opened before the time of delivery.
