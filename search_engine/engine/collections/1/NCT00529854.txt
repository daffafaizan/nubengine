           time period.

             1. Data collected will be the outcome measures listed above (Number of ICD-9 codes at
                discharge, number of CPT codes at discharge, ext)

             2. In addition the total number of STICU patient-days, ventilator-days, central
                line-days, confirmed infectious complications, injury severity scores for trauma
                patients, and antibiotic-days will be collected over the three month period. This
                will serve as a way to ensure the observational and prospective populations are not
                different, and only the documentation and billing methods changed.

                line-days, confirmed infectious complications, injury severity scores for trauma
                patients, and antibiotic-days will be collected over the three month period. This
                will serve as a way to ensure the observational and prospective populations are not
                different, and only the documentation and billing methods changed.

        4. After the 3 month prospective evaluation, the attending physicians will be given a
           survey to document their acceptance or rejection of the billing module.
