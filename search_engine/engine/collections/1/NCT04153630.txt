    
      The Main Objective is to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of haploidentical MSCs
      derived from bone marrow administered by intravenous injection for the treatment of patients
      with RDBS. The assessment of the symptomatic improvement of the treated patients will be made
      regarding the baseline situation and the response to treatment at the biochemical,
      histological and molecular level.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Describe the clinical and molecular phenotype of the mucocutaneous involvement of patients,
      including the characterization of the mutations responsible for the disease.

      Study drug: Allogenic mesenchymal cells (haploidentical) derived from bone marrow and
      expanded.

      Method of administration: Systemic / Intravenous Administration dose: 2-3x10e6 BM-MSC / Kg.
      Weekly dose for three consecutive weeks

      Follow-up period: 12 months after the infusion. However, patients will be monitored outside
      the clinical trial over a 5-year period
