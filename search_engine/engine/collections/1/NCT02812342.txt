      2 patches of alopecia involving the scalp), AT or AU with tofacitinib ointment for a maximum
      of 6 months. During treatment, patients will be evaluated every 4 weeks and effectiveness of
      the medication will be measured by changes in hair growth. Laboratory evaluation will be
      performed before and during treatment in order to monitor for adverse effects of the
      medication.
