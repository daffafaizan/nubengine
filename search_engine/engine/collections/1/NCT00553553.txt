      upon on the pre-operative hepatic pathophysiology or the extent of parenchymal resection,
      both of which will affect peri-operative hepatic function, capacity for drug handling and
      risk of coagulopathy. Use of IV morphine during hepatic resection can result in high plasma
      levels post-operatively due to a reduced rate of morphine metabolism, risking a higher rate
      of morbidity. However, this remains a mainstay of peri-operative analgesia in combination
      with controversial non-opioid supplementation (paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs).

      This study compares the efficacy of IV morphine only versus a combination of pre-incisional
      intrathecal morphine and intra-operative IV remifentanil. Intrathecal morphine provides the
      mainstay of post-operative analgesia for 12-24 hours and remifentanil provides profound,
      titratable intra-operative analgesia until the delayed onset of the intrathecal morphine. We
      hypothesise that this combination might provide desirable intra-operative haemodynamic
      conditions and eliminate the post-operative additive effects of long-acting, intra-operative
      IV opioid and intrathecal morphine. Further, if the dose of intrathecal morphine is adequate,
      this would result in a low rate of post-operative analgesic supplementation and fewer side
      effects. The titratable dose range of remifentanil is limited to the lower range found to
      risk post-operative hyperalgesia.
