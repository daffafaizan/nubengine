      reassuring elements on the risk of maternal-fetal transmission, it nevertheless counted an
      increase in severe maternal forms in the third trimester associated with more premature
      deliveries and cesarean sections. In addition, due to the very recent nature of this new
      infection, we have little data on the effect of SARS-COV 2 contracted during pregnancy on the
      fetus and on maternal-fetal exchanges.

      Publications report an increase in growth retardation, maternal coagulopathies, preeclampsia
      and placental thrombosis. The vascular placental abnormalities observed in the first series
      must be confirmed and refined. Finally, pregnancy is marked by immunomodulation which can
      interfere with immune reactions. A better understanding of the immunological mechanisms in
      the mother and of the immunity transmitted to the fetus is necessary to better understand the
      maternal-fetal issues of COVID 19.

      This prospective study concerns patients presenting for their delivery at Foch Hospital.

      4 groups of patients will be identified in the delivery room after childbirth based on their
      COVID 19 PCR taken within 72 hours, their COVID 19 serology, or a history of positive COVID
      19 PCR during pregnancy : 1 control group of 50 patients, 1 group of 50 asymptomatic
      patients, 1 group of 50 patients with symptoms, and 1 group of 50 cured patients who
      contracted the disease during pregnancy. The patients will have various samples: blood,
      umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, placenta
