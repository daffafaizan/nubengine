      combining an Electronic Monitoring system (EM, named MEMS®; Aardex Ltd) and motivational
      semi-structured interviews. This programm is held by the Unisanté's community pharmacists*,
      in coordination with medical and nurse staff , to support medication adherence and to promote
      the continuity of care. For patients not speaking french, english, or italian, the interviews
      will be done with a interpreter.

      The medication adherence data will be analysed in both groups along with clinical data
      obtained through draw samples regularly prescribed by the physician.
