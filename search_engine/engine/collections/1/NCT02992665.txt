      place during normal fertilization (1). The interaction between the sperm and oocytes surface
      protein receptors may be the triggering event for oocyte activation during the process of
      fertilization (2). It is suggested that the process of intracellular Calcium elevation is
      triggered by binding of the sperm to the oocyte oolemma and hence the fertilization starts
      (3). Severe male factor couples might have compromised fertilization and pregnancy outcomes
      (4).

      A prospective multicenter non-randomized study indicated that calcium ionophore could improve
      the fertilization as well as the clinical pregnancy rates in these patients (5). On the other
      hand, a randomized controlled trial did not find any significance for the use of calcium
      ionophore in the couples with poor ovarian reserve with regards the fertilization and
      clinical pregnancy rates (6). The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the use
      of calcium ionophore on the ICSI outcomes in couples with severe male factor infertility.
      Investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial on the sibling oocyte to justify the use
      of calcium ionophore in these cases.
