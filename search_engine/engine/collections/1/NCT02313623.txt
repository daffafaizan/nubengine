      which is a useful, though not specific, biomarker for detecting prostate cancer. The
      suspected patients will be further sent for digital rectal examination(DRE), in which a
      doctor inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the patient's rectum to feel for lumps,
      enlargements, or areas of hardness that might indicate prostate cancer. However, the only
      test that can fully confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a biopsy - the removal of
      small pieces of the prostate for microscopic examination. If cancer is suspected using PSA
      test and DRE, more than 90% suspected patients choose undergo prostate biopsy. Prostate
      needle biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization.
      Markedly, the fine needle biopsy is minimally invasive and has currently been suggested for
      longitudinal monitoring of highly suspected patients or follow-up therapeutic responses. The
      large availability of biopsy samples for prostate cancer provides a cornerstone for the
      proposed patient specimen-based research. The investigators anticipate that comprehensive
      analysis rather than simple pathological examination of these samples will generate new
      insights to prostate tumor progression in human.
