      renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Patients with LF are usually associated with impaired
      coagulation, impaired metabolic ability of anticoagulants, and increased bleeding risk. KDIGO
      guideline recommended no-anticoagulation for CRRT in patients with liver failure and
      increased bleeding risk. However, the averaged CRRT circuit lifespan under no-coagulation was
      reported to be 7-8 hours in patients with liver failure. Commonly, a CRRT regimen needs more
      than 24 hours treatment, which means 3-4 filters replacement for one regimen in liver failure
      patients underwent no-anticoagulation CRRT. Several observational studies suggested that
      regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) during CRRT was effective and safe in patients with
      liver failure. Therefore, the current opinions on the anticoagulation strategy for CRRT in
      patients with liver failure and high bleeding risk are controversial. Therefore, the purpose
      of this single center, randomized, control, open-labeled study is to evaluate the effect and
      safety of RCA versus no anticoagulation for CRRT in patients with liver failure and high risk
      bleeding.
