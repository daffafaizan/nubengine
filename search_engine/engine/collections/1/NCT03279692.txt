    
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying pembrolizumab in participants with
      meningioma. Research studies have shown that meningioma tumor cells express a gene called
      PD-L1. The investigators will be looking to determine whether the study drug may may stop
      meningioma tumors from growing.
