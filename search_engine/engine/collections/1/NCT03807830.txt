      recipients have some low frequency residual hearing in the ear which is to be implanted. To
      help preserve hearing, the electrode array must be inserted extremely carefully. It is
      desirable to have real-time feedback relating to progress of the electrode insertion.

      One possible tool that might provide this is an electrocochleography (ECochG). A brief
      low-frequency acoustic tone at a fixed level is delivered to the external ear canal. This
      results in normal movements of the outer and the inner hair cells inside the inner ear. These
      movements are known to produce small electrical potentials that have been previously been
      sensed by a recording electrode placed on the promontory, or surface of the bone in which the
      cochlea is located. Averaging of these recordings in synchrony with the acoustic stimulus
      allows the small ECochG signal to be reinforced while any physiological or electrical noise
      is averaged out. With ECochG measurements different aspects of the auditory system can be
      tested. For the investigators work only the cochlear microphonic, generated by the outer hair
      cells will be recorded and analysed.

      The Advanced Bionics (AB) implant system is uniquely suited to do such measurements. The aim
      of the study is to monitor electrode array insertion during surgery and any residual hearing
      function over time in using this tool as a comparison to conventional methods. Subjects will
      undergo the study procedure of ECochG measurements, alongside additional standard of care
      appointments for the research, pure tone audiometry and impedence measurement. Only a 10
      minute ECochG measurement will be the additional research component to the patients clinical
      routine as mentioned above.
