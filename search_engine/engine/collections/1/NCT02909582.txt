      associated with increased maternal morbidity during and after cesarean section. The optimal
      surgical approach has not been well elucidated for obese individuals.

      Materials and Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial comparing a Pfannenstiel
      incision placed below the pannus (should a pannus exist) with a Cohen incision placed above
      the pannus (should a pannus exist); allocation is 1:1 with stratification for pre-gestational
      diabetes and presence of pannus. The study will be assessed by intention-to-treat analysis
      looking composite maternal morbidity (wound complications within 6 weeks, endometritis,
      postpartum hemorrhage) as the primary outcome with secondary outcomes including wound
      complications, operative time, estimated blood loss, pain management, and patient and surgeon
      satisfaction. Significant confounders will be assessed and adjusted in the multiple
      regression analysis accordingly.

      Results: The investigators propose the Cohen cesarean incision will result in statistically
      less maternal morbidity from cesarean section than the Pfannenstiel incision.

      Comment: The benefits of a Cohen incision have been encouraged in non-obese pregnant women;
      the investigators propose that they be considered in obese women as well.
