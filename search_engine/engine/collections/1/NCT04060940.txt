      symptoms of anxiety and/or depression in young adults aged 18 to 29 years old. Additionally,
      we are interested in assessing neural, cardiac, and immunological changes associated with
      psychological symptom reduction in these individuals. Lastly, we are interested in examining
      whether an abbreviated 8-session version of ERT produces similar results to a longer
      (16-session) version of ERT.
