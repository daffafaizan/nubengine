      important in modifying t2DM risk but there are critical gaps in our knowledge about the
      clinical magnitude of the association with t2DM and potential mechanisms in humans. We are
      conducting a randomized trial to quantify the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation
      on beta-cell function, insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance and systemic inflammation and
      other cardiometabolic outcomes in ambulatory adults at high risk for t2DM. We anticipate that
      the research proposed in this application is significant because it will provide the basis
      for defining feasible nutritional interventions that promotes prevention of t2DM. Based on
      the results of the proposed studies and future work in this area, vitamin D and calcium
      supplementation can assume an important role in the treatment of t2DM and in the prevention
      of the disease in the 41 million Americans who are at risk of developing t2DM.
