      participants, including height, weight, computerized cognitive functioning, and an EEG
      recording. Participants will also be taught how to keep a detailed food and symptom diary
      over the following week. One week later, the participant will return to the lab and turn in
      the food/symptom diary. All ADHD participants and a subgroup of controls (called extended
      controls or EC) will be trained on how to follow the dietary intervention. Detailed
      information on the diet will be given, including food additives to avoid, healthy foods which
      should be eaten, and shopping tips. For the next two weeks, the participant will follow the
      dietary intervention at home with access to Dr. Holton to answer any questions. The
      participant will return to the lab after following the diet for two weeks and assessments
      (cognitive testing, and EEG) will be completed again along information on dietary compliance
      will be collected. The third meeting will also mark the beginning of the first challenge
      period. For the challenges, the participant will consume chocolate cookies every Monday,
      Tuesday, and Wednesday for two weeks. The cookies may or may not contain artificial food
      coloring depending on the week. Every Wednesday repeat testing will be completed after the
      cookies are consumed. The participant will be asked not to take ADHD medication on testing
      days. After two weeks of challenges the study will be completed. The participant will receive
      information on their performance and on the study results overall.
