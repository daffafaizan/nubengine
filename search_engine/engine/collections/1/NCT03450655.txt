      Participants will be recruited from the Healthy Ageing Initiative (HAI), an ongoing
      population-based study that invites all 70-year-olds in Umeå, Sweden, to a health
      examination. The exercise program will focus is on station-based aerobic exercises and
      resistance exercises, predominantly with participants' own body weight as resistance. The
      program is progressive, starting at a moderate pace so that participants learn to perform the
      exercises properly. The intensity will be aimed at 60-80% of maximal exhaustion, and each
      exercise bout will last 60 seconds with 20 seconds of rest between bouts. The program was
      developed by seniors in the bachelor's program in exercise physiology at Umeå University,
      Sweden.
