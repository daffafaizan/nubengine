      into the group who will receive real neurofeedback and the group who will receive sham
      neurofeedback. Participants will receive the real-time neurofeedback for 12 times, 3 to 4
      times a week, each time the real-time neurofeedback consists of 12 sessions of liftstone as
      the index reflecting the brain activity. Sham group will receive the identical neurofeedback.

      All of the subjects will undergo magnetic resonance imaging scan, during which T1, diffusion
      tensor imaging, resting-state, and task fMRI data will be collected. For task Fmri scan, the
      participants will be asked to finish four cognitive task, including 2-Back working memory,
      Go/No-Go task, Willingness to Pay for Food, and Delay Discounting tasks. Clinical
      measurements including BMI, eating behavior, psychiatric status will be assessed. Those
      aforementioned examinations will be performed at before the neurofeedback, 6th times and the
      end of the treatment.
