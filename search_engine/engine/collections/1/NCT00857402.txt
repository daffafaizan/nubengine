      emerging multi drug resistance and the long treatment duration there is a need to optimize
      the current chemotherapy. Host immunity is important in determining the susceptibility and
      outcome of disease as could be exemplified by co infection with HIV which dramatically
      increases the risk to develop TB.

      Previous results from our group and others show that nitric oxide produced by activated
      macrophages from arginine might be important to control the disease. However, the relative
      importance of nitric oxide in human TB has been debated. In a previous study in Gondar,
      Ethiopia, we observed an effect of adjuvant treatment with arginine capsules on sputum smear
      conversion and reduction of cough. In this study we wanted to test the hypothesis based on
      previous observations that an arginine rich food supplementation might enhance clinical
      improvement in patients with smear positive tuberculosis and if this effect could be due to
      increased nitric oxide production.
