      This is a quasi-experimental study in which the investigators aim to test the feasibility of
      a non-pharmacological strategy to prevent cognitive decline in patients with a diagnosis of
      mild cognitive impairment. This strategy is based on five different interventions:

      a) Cognitive training

      This comprises training using using the cogweb software, both in person and remotely:

      i) in person training: 30-minute sessions, supervised by a trained nurse, twice weekly .

      ii) remote training: unsupervised 30-minute sessions, to be performed at home at the
      participants will.

      b) Physical activity This is based on 60-minute sessions including aerobic, resistance,
      agility/balance and flexibility exercises, directed by a physical education teacher and
      supervised by a nurse, twice weekly.

      c) Nutrition education

      This is based on monthly 180-minute sessions, directed by a nutritionist, comprising:

      i) Presentation and discussion of healthy and easy to cook recipes by the nutritionist; ii)
      Preparation of healthy meals by the participants, followed by a period of social interaction
      between the participants while consuming the meals prepared.

      d) Adaptation to memory loss This is based on monthly 30-minute sessions, directed by a
      psychologist or a nurse, who will provide strategies that participants may use in their daily
      life to cope with memory loss.

      e) Diagnosis of hearing impairment Before implementing the sessions of cognitive training,
      physical activity, nutrition education and adaption to memory loss, an audiologist will
      perform an audiogram to all participants. Those with auditive performance inferior to the
      reference values will be referred for a medical appointment with an otolaryngologist.

      Strategies (a),(b), (c) and (d) will be implemented over a period of 10 months, in groups of
      10 participants.
