      do not require surgery[1] In addition, Hall and others recently reported that low doses of
      ionizing radiation to the brain in infancy may influence cognitive abilities in adulthood.
      [2] Accordingly, increased serum concentrations of, for example S100B ( a calcium-binding
      protein present in high concentrations in glial cells) and neurone-specific enolase ( NSE: a
      cytoplasmatic enzyme occuring predominantly in neurones ) have been demonstrated to reflect
      the presence and severity of brain tissue damage in acute head injuries. [3] In both
      pediatric age and adults.
