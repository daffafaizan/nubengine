      determine if it is appropriate for them to participate in this study. This testing includes
      the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III (UPDRS III). Research assistants will
      explain the study and obtain informed consent. There will be three consecutive days of
      testing, as well as 2 follow up visits at 1 and 4 weeks. Visits include the following:
      Patients will have sensors put on their hands, feet, and chest. These sensors measure their
      movement while they perform kinematic tasks such as forward walking, wrist movements, and the
      UPDRS III. Patients will also be given vibrotactile stimulation for a total of 4 hours
      throughout the day. During this time, patients will be provided with books/movies as
      entertainment, and they may move around freely. Patients will also be asked to complete
      several questionnaires throughout the visits about their Parkinson's symptoms.
