      on work performed at Washington University by Dr. Gordon Shulman and published in The Journal
      of Neuroscience.(Shulman, Astafiev, Franke, Pope, Snyder, McAvoy, and Corbetta 2009)
      Individuals will be shown a target, which is randomly selected from 12 objects designated as
      targets, before each scan. The target for a scan will never appear as a non-target object in
      another scan. Per established protocol, individuals will fixate on a central cross prior to
      imaging. Individuals will press a MR-compatible button when they detect the target. Target
      objects only appear in the cued stream. Cues, a filled red square, are programmed to occur,
      on average, every 2.06, 4.12, or 6.18 seconds within a temporal window of Â± 400 milliseconds
      centered on those values.
