      past few decades, optimal pharmacological therapies with statins targeting LDL-cholesterol
      substantially reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease. However, the residual
      cardiovascular risk is still high, requiring need for additional preventive therapies to
      achieve even greater risk reduction.

      Recent meta-analysis demonstrated fibrates can reduce the risk of coronary events and might
      have a role in patients with high cardiovascular risks or combined dyslipidemia. Likewise,
      fenofibrate had a possible benefit for patients with high triglyceride level and low
      HDL-cholesterol level in the post-hoc analysis of ACCORD or FIELD trials.

      Thus, investigators tried to determine effects of combination therapy with rosuvastatin and
      fenofibrate on atheromatous plaques and its tissue characteristics of de novo coronary
      lesions with intermediate stenosis in patient with coronary artery disease, compared with
      rosuvastatin alone therapy.
