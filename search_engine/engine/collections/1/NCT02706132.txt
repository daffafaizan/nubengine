      transplantation.The A、B antibodies to grafts bind to the graft endothelium and activate
      complement, which attracts and activates neutrophils and platelets and increases the
      permeability of the endothelium. The neutrophils exude, the platelets aggregate, and the
      small vessels of the graft get thrombosed, resulting in ischemic damage,leading nonfunction
      grafts.In addition, if the A、 B antibodies remain high level, it can lead to acute humoral
      immune rejection. A lot of research confirmed that the ABO incompatible is a risk factor of
      postoperative short- and long-term survival. And mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are
      characterized by the properties of immunosuppressive and regenerative properties, which make
      MSCs great attractive in treating immunological diseases (including transplant rejection) and
      organ/tissue ischemic injury. So we conduct this clinical study,to confirm the effect of MSCs
      in ABO incompatible liver transplantation by comparing the incidence of primary nonfunction,
      acute rejection, biliary complications and survival rates.
