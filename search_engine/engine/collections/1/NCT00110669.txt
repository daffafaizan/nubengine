    
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common lethal inherited disorder worldwide.
      Despite the exponential increase in our understanding of the disorder since the discovery and
      characterization of the causative gene and its product dystrophin in 1987, current
      therapeutic management remains largely supportive. Awaiting a final genetic cure to be
      available in the future, further investments in developing better drug therapies for DMD
      remain important. The effect of a high dose prednisone regimen will be evaluated in
      comparison to a daily dose regimen in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled 4-arm study. Ambulant children aged 4-10 years with an established DMD
      diagnosis will be studied. Patients will undergo 2 screening evaluations within 1 week.
      Patients will be randomized into treatment groups on the second screening visit, followed by
      a 12-month treatment period. During the treatment period, patients will be evaluated at
      monthly intervals. The primary endpoints are percentage change in average muscle strength
      score and QMT performance for specific muscle groups. Secondary endpoints include timed
      function tests, functional grades for arms and legs, and pulmonary function tests.
