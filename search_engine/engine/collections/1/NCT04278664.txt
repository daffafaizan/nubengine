      during pregnancy. These studies are additionally limited due to number of patients as well as
      number of secondary outcomes reported. Therefore, this study will enroll 100 participants to
      reach a power of 81.8% with HbA1c as a primary outcome and secondary outcomes related to
      diabetic management such as frequency of hypoglycemia, antenatal hospital stay (percentage
      requiring admission, length of stay), miscarriage, cesarean section rates, induction of
      labor, fetal birth weight, gestational age at birth or preterm birth (<34 weeks, <37 weeks),
      frequency of neonatal hypoglycemia, shoulder dystocia, neonatal death, major and minor
      anomalies, and neonatal intensive care admission.
