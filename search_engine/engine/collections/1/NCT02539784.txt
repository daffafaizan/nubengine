      (PD). Investigator will assess the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation
      (SCS) with frequencies of 50, 100 and 130 Hz in a shuffle randomized for each patient.
      Briefly, each frequency will be evaluated immediately after and 4 weeks following SCS
      initiation with UPDRS-III, pain scales, and Hauser's diary. The best frequency for each
      patient will be then selected and maintained activated for 12 additional weeks. At the end of
      these 12 weeks, new assessment including UPDRS, visual pain scale, "SAINT-ANTOINE" Pain
      Questionary, PDQ-39 (quality of life), daily L-dopa equivalent dose, MDRS (cognitive status),
      LARS (apathy status) and MADRS (depression status) will be compared to the inclusion data of
      each patient. Primary endpoints include the safety of thoracic SCS by collected the number of
      adverse event and the efficacy by measuring the UPDRS-III OFF med/ON stim at 30 weeks.
