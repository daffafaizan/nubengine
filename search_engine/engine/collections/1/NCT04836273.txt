      Before inclusion in the study, the participants will complete a screening visit and a blinded
      14-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) run-in period to ascertain a regular occurrence of
      postprandial hypoglycaemia (IG <3.9 mmol/l, ≥3 times/week). After enrolment in the study, the
      participants will wear a CGM for the entirety of the study period (apart from the four weeks
      before the follow-up visit). Prior to the first mixed meal test (MMT) during the in-patient
      part, the subjects will be randomised into one of four double-blinded treatment sequences
      consisting of an in-patient part (two MMTs) follow by a nine weeks out-patient part (two
      times four weeks per out-patient part with an interposed washout period of one week) and
      ended with a follow-up visit four weeks after out-patient part completion.

      During the in-patient part, the participants will undergo two separate MMTs, with a minimum
      of 7 days in-between, accompanied by one of the following double-blind, randomised,
      placebo-controlled crossover interventions:

        1. Subcutaneous placebo self-administration

        2. Subcutaneous 120 µg dasiglucagon self-administration

      The out-patient part is divided into two double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled
      crossover out-patient parts with of the following interventions:

        1. Subcutaneous placebo self-administration

        2. Subcutaneous 120 µg dasiglucagon self-administration
