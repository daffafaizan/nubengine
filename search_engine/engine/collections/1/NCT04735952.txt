      patients for detecting established P. aeruginosa lung infections. For each expectorating
      subject (n ≥ 288; 5 centers), the diagnostic accuracy of the volatile biomarker panel will be
      tested, with sputum culture as the standard.

      AIM 2: Quantify intra-subject breath variability of the target pediatric population. We will
      collect longitudinal breath samples for two years from P. aeruginosa-negative subjects (n ≥
      58; ~60% non-expectorating) at 4 pediatric CF clinical centers. We will measure intra-subject
      variance in the breath signatures of expectorating and non-expectorating subjects, with the
      latter being the target population for the clinical trial. Two to 8 breath samples will be
      collected per patient.
