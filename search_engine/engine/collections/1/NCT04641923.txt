      Mesothelial injury, inflammation and unbalanced fibrinolysis have been described as the
      primary factors leading to adhesion formation.2 Within hepatic surgery, the degree to which
      adhesions pose a significant challenge at the time of repeat resection often depends upon the
      extent of hepatectomy, hilar dissection, number of preceding liver resections, and the
      location of the proposed repeat partial hepatectomy. More specifically, peri-hepatic
      adhesions can lead to increased operative time, an increased risk of bleeding, injury to
      adjacent intra-abdominal organs and even higher perioperative morbidity.3 Similar to other
      diseases, repeat hepatectomy is often required in instances of both primary and metastatic
      liver cancers. This need will likely only increase in the future with continuously improving
      systemic chemotherapy and novel multimodality treatments. Not surprisingly, the necessary
      lysis of peri-hepatic adhesions has also been shown to increase operative times, by consuming
      as much as 50% of the operative procedure, during a repeat hepatectomy as well.4

      Numerous anti-adhesion materials and barriers have been studied in colorectal,5,6,7
      gynecological,8,9 neurosurgery,10 cardiac surgery,11 and otolaryngology.12 There is some data
      that these barriers can also be helpful in reducing operative times for repeat hepatectomy as
      well.13 More specifically, in a rat model, an Alg bilayer sponge application was effective in
      preventing peri-hepatic adhesions following a crush hepatectomy model.14 Unfortunately, there
      has been limited data regarding the effectiveness of any antiadhesion barriers in reducing
      peri-hepatic adhesions to date. SEPRA-C2T15 concluded that barrier film is helpful in
      reducing abdominal and perihepatic adhesions. This was done in patients with unresectable
      colorectal liver metastasis who underwent two stage hepatectomy and the median time to second
      hepatectomy was only 2 months.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a topical anti-adhesion barrier
      film in reducing the severity of subsequent peri-hepatic adhesions at the time of repeat
      hepatic surgery.
