      the airways of asthmatics: Specifically, that obesity induces systemic oxidative stress in
      part through increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adipose tissue and, in
      parallel (or as a consequence), increased systemic levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±)and
      8-isoprostanes. Furthermore, it creates an imbalance in the regulation of protective
      anti-oxidant thiol/disulfide pairs such as glutathione/glutathione disulfide. We hypothesize
      that in asthmatics, the lung is a target-organ of this obesity-related systemic oxidative
      stress. This is manifested as increased oxidation of airway NO into nitrate and reactive
      nitrogen species (RNS) including peroxynitrate and nitrotyrosine, thereby reducing NO
      bioavailability and exhaled NO levels. NO has many key physiological properties including
      bronchodilation, anti-tumoral/bactericidal activity, and anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative
      activity. Thus, reduced NO bioavailability in obese asthmatics could favor increased
      bronchoconstriction and impair the lung's ability to respond to further oxidative or
      inflammatory challenges. Therefore, we hypothesize that: 1) obesity causes redox stress in
      the airway, which in turn decreases the bioavailability of NO by shunting it into RNS, 2)
      that weight loss will decrease systemic oxidative stress and thereby increase NO
      bioavailability due to decreased oxidation into RNS, and 3) that by decreasing systemic
      oxidative stress, weight loss will reduce bronchial hyper-reactivity.
