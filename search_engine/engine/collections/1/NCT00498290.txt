      include the need for parenteral analgesia(persistent pain), intravenous fluids (persistent
      gut dysfunction), and bed rest (persistent lack of mobility). These factors often overlap and
      interact to delay return of function. Obviously, postoperative complications will also
      prolong the time until recovery and ultimately length of stay. A clinical pathway, called
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery(ERAS), to accelerate recovery after colonic resection based
      on a multimodal programme with optimal pain relief, stress reduction with regional
      anaesthesia, early enteral nutrition and early mobilisation has demonstrated improvements in
      physical performance, pulmonary function, body composition and a marked reduction of length
      of stay.

      Comparison(s): A total of 500 cases colorectal surgery were randomized to receive ERAS
      protocol or the traditional protocol, such as mechanical bowl preparation, intravenous fluids
      until bowl movement recovery and bed rest.
