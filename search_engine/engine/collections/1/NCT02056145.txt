      ultrasound-guided single femoral block and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks with 20 en
      10 cc bupivacaine 0.25% respectively vs. the only ultrasound-guided single femoral block with
      20 cc bupivacaine 0.25%, given just prior to elective hip surgery procedure, is effective in
      reducing acute postoperative pain (VAS scores) and postoperative opiate consumption.
