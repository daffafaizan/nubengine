      into a complete study in which the investigators will use B-mode ultrasonography to evaluate
      daily changes in diaphragm thickness in all critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation
      (MV) until successful weaned from MV. The impact of patient age, co-morbidities, and the use
      of various modes of ventilation on diaphragm thickness will be assessed. Diaphragmatic
      thickness and its change from baseline will be evaluated as predictors of the need for a
      prolonged wean (>7days).

      The investigators hypothesize that in patients on mandatory mode ventilation, diaphragmatic
      thickness will progressively decrease. Switching from mandatory to assisted breathing modes
      will correlate with increases in diaphragmatic thickness.
