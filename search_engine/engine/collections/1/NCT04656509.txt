      (PC) on maximal anaerobic power, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), and total blood volume in
      11 young healthy individuals (age: 21.3Â±0.5 y) (6 men, 5 women). Methods: Participants
      trained three times a week for eight weeks performing a PC program consisting of 30 bouts of
      4-s at an all-out intensity (i.e., 2 minutes of exercise per session). The cardiovascular
      stress progressively increased over the weeks by decreasing the recovery time between sprints
      (30 to 24 to 15-s) and thus session time decreased from 17 to < 10 min.
