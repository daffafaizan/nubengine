hyperaldosteronism, hyperplasia of thejuxtaglomerular complex, normalblood pressure, and dwarfism:report of a casea patient with the syndrome of hyperal-dosteronism, hyperplasia of the juxtaglo-merular complex, dwarfism, and normalblood pressure is reported in detail.  in thispatient, the aldosterone secretion rate in-creased significantly and the serum potas-sium rose slightly with sodium depriva-tion.  with a low-sodium diet urinary sodi-um fell to zero.  spironolactone with a low-sodium diet raised serum potassium to nor-mal.  infusion of albumin, however, resul-ted in a rapid increase in serum potassiumand a fall in aldosterone secretion rate.  theunique features in this patient are the re-sponse to albumin and the lowering of uri-nary sodium to zero in response to a low-sodium intake.  in all other essentials, thecase resembles the two previously reportedcases.  treatment by subtotal adrenalecto-my was not curative.
