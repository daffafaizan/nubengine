      given to alleviate distress during minimally invasive surgical procedures. Unabated distress
      may interfere with the ongoing procedure and may negatively impact future interventions.

      Studies have shown that nonpharmacologic analgesia in the form of self-hypnotic relaxation
      during invasive medical procedures significantly reduces patients' pain, anxiety, drug use,
      and number of complications. The long-term goal of this study is to determine whether
      self-hypnotic relaxation therapy can be a safe and practical method for reducing cognitive
      and physiologic distress associated with invasive procedures.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a standard care
      group, an empathic control group, and a self-hypnotic relaxation group. The emphatic control
      group will meet with a clinician who will offer encouragement and support. The group assigned
      to self-hypnotic relaxation will read a standardized script prior to procedure. Self-report
      questionnaires will be used to assess pain and anxiety.
