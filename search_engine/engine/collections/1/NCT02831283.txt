      impairment, and amyloid burden in elderly subjects with different clinical and biomarker
      profiles of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants will undergo amyloid PET imaging with
      18F-Florbetaben with target number of completers being 15 amyloid-positive elders with
      impairment, 15 amyloid-positive elders with normal cognition, 15 amyloid-negative elders with
      impairment, and 15 amyloid-negative elders with normal cognition. Subjects will undergo
      screen that includes neuropsychological testing, brain MRI, and PET imaging with
      18F-florbetaben to define the above 4 groups. Subjects will have 11C-PBR28 PET imaging to
      measure the 18 kDa translocator protein (a marker of inflammation). Subjects will have the
      option to have lumbar puncture performed to measure CSF concentrations of amyloid,tau,
      phospho-tau, and inflammatory markers.
