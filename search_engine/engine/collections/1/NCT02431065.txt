      ultrasonography-guided and direct-surgical rectus sheath block after single-port access
      laparoscopy in benign ovary cyst patients.

      Patients will be randomly divided into 3 groups based on the procedure: control group,
      ultrasonography group and direct injection group. Each group consists of 30 patients.

        -  Control group Normal saline 10mL will be injected under ultrasonography guidance into
           the right, left rectus sheath at the end of the operation before emergence from general
           anesthesia.

             -  Ultrasonography group Local anesthetic (Ropivacaine 0.75% 10 mL) will be injected
                under ultrasonography guidance into the right left rectus sheath at the end of the
                operation before emergence from general anesthesia.

                  -  Direct injection group Local anesthetic (Ropivacaine 0.75% 10 mL) will be
                     injected under direct visualization into the right, left rectus sheath at the
                     end of the operation before emergence from general anesthesia.

      Analgesic efficiency will be assessed using the VAS (visual analogue scale) pain scale and
      the total amount of self-administered fentanyl via PCA (patient controlled analgesia) devices
      at multiple time scales (1, 6, 10, 24 and 48 hours after surgery). We will also compare the
      incidence of fentanyl complications, such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and dizziness
