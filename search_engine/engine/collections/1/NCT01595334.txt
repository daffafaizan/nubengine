      antagonist would contribute to obtaining mature M2 oocytes so that maximum number of good
      quality embryo's with potential to implant is obtained.

      The mature oocytes would be subjected to either standard in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) depending on the status of the male factor.

      The objective would be to obtain good quality embryo's with implantation potential for fresh
      embryo transfer and/or subsequent frozen thaw embryo transfer.

      In both these events, the secondary outcome measures would be establishment of clinical
      pregnancy by transvaginal ultrasound performed 6 weeks after embryo transfer.
