      responses constitute a major component of OLP pathogenesis where targeted therapies play an
      important role in managing this condition. Apremilast is a new well-tolerated and relatively
      safe anti-inflammatory therapy that has been approved for managing psoriasis and psoriatic
      arthritis. Given its safer profile, Apremilast may ameliorate inflammatory responses in
      clinically active OLP without the experience of serious adverse events associated with other
      systemic immunosuppressive therapies used to treat OLP. The plan is to conduct a
      single-center, explanatory, randomized, 16 weeks, parallel group, superiority, blinded,
      placebo-controlled, clinical trial.

      The main objective is treatment success assessment. Other objectives include exploring the
      efficacy of Apremilast in clinically active OLP adult patients considered for systemic
      treatment and failed topical corticosteroid therapy. It is hypothesized that Apremilast will
      induce more treatment success as compared to placebo in patients who failed the standard
      treatment of topical corticosteroids.
