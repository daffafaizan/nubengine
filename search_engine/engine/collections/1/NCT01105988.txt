      within 7 days before starting treatment with radiation and temozolomide.

      Two intravenous catheters (IVs) will be placed for each scan. One IV will be used to inject
      the FLT for the PET scan and the contrast agent for the MRI scan. The second IV will be used
      to draw blood for research tests. The PET scan will take about 2 hours. The MRI scan will
      take about 60-75 minutes. They will be done simultaneously.

      About 4 weeks after you finish radiation therapy you will have a second FLT-PET scan and MRI
      scan.
