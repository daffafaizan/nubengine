      muscle (underneath the chin) during swallowing and breathing exercises. A neurologist trained
      in EMG will perform all procedures to ensure best placement and minimize discomfort of the
      participant. While the needle is in place, the participant will complete a series of
      swallowing tasks and breathing exercises using a small, handheld training device. All
      swallowing and breathing tasks will be viewed under x-ray in order to see the movement and
      timing of the tongue and swallowing muscles during each task. Participation in the study will
      take one, one-hour visit to the Shands Dental Tower lab spaces where all procedures will be
      completed.
