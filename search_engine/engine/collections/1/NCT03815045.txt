      puncture or an ultrasound-guided lumbar puncture for obtaining CSF. This study will be
      conducted in the Neurology clinic. For subjects in the traditional group, the site of needle
      entry will be determined through palpation of the spine. For subjects in the ultrasound
      group, site entry will be done using ultrasound guidance. Success and failure of these
      techniques will be compared along with secondary outcome measures aimed at assessing the
      safety and efficacy of each of these techniques.
