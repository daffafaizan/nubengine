      is still discussed considering the low clinical aggressiveness and the availability of
      ablative 131Iodine therapy. However, there is a subgroup of tumors which lose the ability to
      capture Iodine over time. This study wants to describe the role of a post-operative external
      beam radiotherapy in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
