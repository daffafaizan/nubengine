      vilanterol+fluticasone with fluticasone monotherapy and a placebo (vilanterol is not
      available as a monotherapy). The order in which the treatments are given will be randomized
      and each treatment will be separated by a minimum one-week washout. Fifteen asthmatic
      participants will be recruited from the local community. Methacholine challenge testing (MCT)
      with the two-minute tidal breathing protocol will be used to quantify the bronchoprotective
      effects (if any) of each treatment against methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction.

      Each participant will undergo a total of nine methacholine challenges. After a baseline
      methacholine challenge, the randomized treatment (identity unknown to investigator or
      participant) will be administered through an ElliptaÂ® (multi-dose dry powder inhaler). Thirty
      minutes following treatment administration, a second methacholine challenge will be
      performed. At 24 hours post-treatment, each participant must re-visit the lab for one
      methacholine challenge. The same process will be followed for each treatment.
