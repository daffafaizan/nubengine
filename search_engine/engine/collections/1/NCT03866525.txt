    
      This is a phase I/II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of OH2 injection in patients
      with malignant solid tumors.

      In the phase I dose escalation part, three doses (1x10e6, 1x10e7, 1x10e8 CCID50/mL) of OH2
      will be delivered intratumorally as single agent and in combination with HX008 to observe the
      DLTs and to identify the MTD. After the completion of phase I, the recommended dose for
      single agent and combination therapy will be determined for dose expansion in phase II.

      The phase II part comprises of 4 cohorts. In cohort 1, patients will be treated at the
      recommended dose as defined in phase 1. In cohort 2, OH2 will be delivered in combination
      with irinotecan for the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal cancers. In cohort 3, OH2 will
      be injected in combination with HX008, and the first doses of the two anti-tumor agents will
      be administered on the same day. The treatments in cohort 4 will be identical as in cohort 3,
      except that the first dose of HX008 will be administered at the time of the third dose of
      OH2.

      The biodistribution of OH2 is evaluated in the phase 1 part of the trial by detection of
      viral loads in the blood, urine, and saliva at different timepoints. In addition, the
      injection sites are swabbed for virus shedding on the next day of each dose from cycle 1-3.

      Adverse events (AEs) and DLTs are graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0). Radiographic imaging studies
      are performed using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Measurement of
      cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions are conducted with calipers. Evaluation of response are
      performed by the investigators using both the RECIST version 1.1 and the iRECIST criteria.
