      perineal post on the lower extremity during hip arthroscopic procedures by peri-operative
      monitoring of various prognostic markers for venous, nerve and tissue injury. The data from
      this exploratory study can be used to help develop estimates of the proportions of patients
      who experience significant venous/nerve/tissue compromise in the lower extremity as a result
      of the application of traction forces necessary to achieve hip joint distraction, and may
      serve as a basis for sample size planning in future studies comparing the effects of various
      methods of hip distraction techniques during hip arthroscopy.
