      diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on three different phenotypes previously identified and
      different patterns of progression [Lobo, 2004] in order to correlate this data with genetic
      information (based on a list of candidate genes previously identified as being involved in
      DR).

      The results of this study will be used exclusively for scientific purposes.
