      therapy currently involves utilizing physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      medications, opioids, and bone re-building medications known as bisphosphonates. A usual
      treatment plan may include some, if not all the above. There is growing evidence that the
      posterior spinal elements contribute to pain that patients with VCFs experience. RFA-MBN,
      which targets these posterior spinal elements, may provide more sustained pain relief and
      improved physical function compared to usual care for these fractures. The procedure
      essentially "ablates with heat" the medial branch nerves which send pain signals from the
      posterior elements to the brain.

      Patients will be randomly selected into one of two groups. The treatment group will receive
      the RFA-MBN procedure along with usual care therapy. The control group will undergo usual
      care. The control group will have the option to cross over to receive RFA-MBN at a defined
      interval during the study. There will be follow up visits at various intervals to compare
      pain relief and function based on various surveys of the treatment, control, and cross-over
      groups.
