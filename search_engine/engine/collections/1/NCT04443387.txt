      globe which has been associated with many immune-mediated diseases, including asthma. Severe
      asthma has been linked with a decreased glucocorticoid receptors (GR) ratio (GR-α/ GR-β
      ratio), indicating steroid hyporesponsiveness. Using combined in silico and in vivo
      approaches, the investigators aimed to explore the immunomodulatory effect of VitD on
      asthmatic patients diagnosed with hypovitaminosis D. Methods: In silico tools were used to
      identify the regulatory effect of VitD supplementation on GR genes. The investigators
      measured the expression levels of GR-α and the inactive isoform, GR-β, in the blood of adult
      asthmatics diagnosed with hypovitaminosis D before and after VitD supplementation. Moreover,
      the blood levels of inflammatory cytokines associated with asthma severity were determined.
