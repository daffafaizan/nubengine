      sleep in the acute aftermath of an experimentally-induced trauma in the interest of
      developing a secondary prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder. The effects of a
      GABAergic compound will be compared with that of a noradrenergic compound. Memory, sleep and
      stress-related immune response factors will be quantified and compared across drug
      conditions.
