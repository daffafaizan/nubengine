      Primary

        -  Determine the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate in women with ductal carcinoma in
           situ undergoing lumpectomy followed by brachytherapy using the MammoSite^® Radiation
           Therapy System.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the early and late complication rates and cosmetic outcome in these patients
           after treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo lumpectomy. Patients with negative tumor margins* (no ink on tumor)
      undergo placement of the MammoSite^® Radiation Therapy System at the time of lumpectomy or
      within 4 weeks after surgery.

      NOTE: *If positive margins are present, the surgeon may elect to resect the positive margins
      and then insert a new MammoSite® device if all other eligibility criteria are met.

      Beginning 2-5 days after placement of the MammoSite^®, patients undergo brachytherapy through
      the MammoSite^® twice daily for 5 days (a total of 10 fractions).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for ≥ 5 years.
