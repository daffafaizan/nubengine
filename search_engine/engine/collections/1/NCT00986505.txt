      Rheumatology criteria: pain in the four quadrants of the body for at least 3 months and a

      All patients received amitriptyline at a dose of 12.5 mg in the first week and 25 mg over the
      subsequent 4 weeks. Patients of group 1 (n = 15) received 125 mL 0.9% saline and patients of
      group 2 (n = 15) received 240 mg lidocaine diluted in 125 mL 0.9% saline. The solutions were
