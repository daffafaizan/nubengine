      women. Women with sexual pain exhibit higher vaginal pain sensitivity and lower levels of
      sexual desire and arousal compared to pain-free women. As a result of pain, sexual
      intercourse is avoided. Previous work in this area has examined a wide variety of
      interventions for sexual pain but has not examined how vaginal pain sensitivity and resulting
      sexual dysfunction may be mediated by pain-related fear. The study team proposes that a
      standardized exposure intervention that directly targets pain-related fear will in turn
      reduce vaginal pain sensitivity and translate to clinically meaningful changes in sexual
      function. The study team will assign women with sexual pain to receive a home-based,
      patient-controlled exposure intervention or standardized home-based home program. The
      specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To evaluate the extent to which pain-related fear
      mediates vaginal pain sensitivity in women with sexual pain; 2) To evaluate the extent to
      which graded exposure translates to changes in sexual function and partner dynamics. The
      completion of this work will provide us with a better understanding of the mechanisms
      underpinning sexual pain and specifically, how pain-related fear influences vaginal pain
      sensitivity and sexual function.
