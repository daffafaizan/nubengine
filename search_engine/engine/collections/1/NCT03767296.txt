    
      During the preoperative visit, baseline MAP (mean arterial blood pressure) will be defined.

      All patients receive standard anesthesia care during the surgical procedure. Before induction
      of anesthesia, 6 additional sensors (stickers) are applied to the back of the patient (at
      three levels: 2 at the upper thoracic level, 2 at the lower thoracic level and 2 at the
      lumbar region). 2 sensors are routinely applied to the forehead to measure the cerebral
      oxygenation and a BIS sensor is applied to measure the depth of anesthesia. Through an
      intravenous line anesthetics will be administered. Vasopressor agents will be administered
      through a second intravenous line. After induction of anesthesia, an endotracheal tube is
      placed. According to the estimated duration of surgery a bladder catheter is placed.

      If - after induction of anesthesia- MAP has decreased more than 20%, a vasopressor agent will
      be administered in order to increase the blood pressure to normal (preoperative) values.
      According to the MAP, several bolus administrations and incremental bolus dosages might be
      needed to reach the target blood pressure range (MAP decrease less than 20%). According to
      the group to which the patient has been randomized, a bolus of ephedrine and/or phenylephrine
      will be administered.

      The study will be completed when MAP decreases more than 20% from baseline for the 4th time.

      A total amount of Ephedrine and Phenylephrine resp. of 140 mg and 1500 Î¼g will not be
      exceeded.

      If the administration of the vasopressor study medication does not achieve the desired
      result, the patient will receive an appropriate treatment.

      The endovascular surgical procedure can start without delay and the duration of surgery will
      not be prolonged because of the measurements and blood pressure management.
