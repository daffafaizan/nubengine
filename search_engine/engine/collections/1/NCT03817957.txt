    
      In this study, patients with confirmed and documented preoperative non-anaemic iron
      deficiency (diagnosis up to 28 days before surgery in routine pre-surgery monitoring) who
      develop anaemia within 12 to 72 hours after start of surgery (with additional confirmation at
      Baseline) and for whom fast replenishment of iron stores is necessary, will be included and
      substituted within 24h after Screening Visit/V1. Peri- or postoperative anaemia will be
      assessed as soon as possible but earliest 12 h after surgery. For short term safety analysis
      iron in urine will be measured in the first urine after the end of i.v. administration in the
      first 35 patients who are eligible for analysis in each i.v. treatment group. Only those
      patients are eligible for whom haematuria and/or proteinuria are excluded using dip stick
      test. The Ferric Carboxymaltose treatment arm will be closed if a sufficient number of
      patients is included for safety analysis.The study will then be continued for assessment of
      co-primary efficacy endpoint: The effectiveness of postoperative i.v. iron substitution with
      Polyglucoferron compared to conventional oral iron substitution with Ferrous sulfate
      (treatment 28 - 35 days) to normalize Hb-values or to increase Hb-values by at least 1.5 g/dl
      until visit 4 will be evaluated as well as patient related outcomes, such as the decreased
      need for allogenic blood transfusions. In addition, the well-being of the patient will be
      assumed to improve after treatment using the SF36 questionnaire.
