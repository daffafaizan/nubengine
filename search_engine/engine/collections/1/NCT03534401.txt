      Kenya clinics in Nairobi, Kenya. A matched-pair cluster control design including 600 female
      FP clients ages 15-49 years (inclusive of 360 clients age 15-24 years) will be utilized to
      evaluate this intervention. Baseline data will be collected prior to routine FP service
      delivery, with a short exit survey conducted immediately following the clients' FP
      appointment (ARCHES or standard FP counseling will be provided during this visit). Follow-up
      data will be collected at 3 and 6-months post-intervention. Qualitative data will be
      collected from intervention providers (n=12) regarding implementation via weekly technical
      assistance sessions during the first three months, and then monthly, regarding acceptability
      and feasibility of integrating ARCHES into routine FP counseling, including barriers and
      facilitators to implementation, and any issues with maintaining fidelity to the ARCHES model.
      Structured interviews with select providers (n=12) will also be conducted at 3-months
      post-training to delve further into these issues. Structured interviews with intervention
      participants reporting experience of RC in the past 3 months on the baseline survey (20
      participants ages 15-24, 15 ages 25-49; total n=35) will be conducted at 3-months follow-up
      to assess their experience of the intervention; perceived utility of the messages, care and
      materials; barriers to utilizing messaging and materials; and suggestions for improvement.
      Analyses specific to participants ages 15-24 will provide findings to guide consideration of
      ARCHES as an effective strategy to improve reproductive health and reduce GBV among
      adolescents in the region. The project consortium will engage Government of Kenya officials,
      IPPF executive directors and IPPF member associations across the federation to pave the way
      for the future roll out of this approach in other low and middle-income country (LMIC)
      contexts.
