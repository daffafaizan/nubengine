      reducing early readmissions for heat failure in patients hospitalized for cardiac
      decompensation.

      This work will create an interventional assistance program to structure the exit consultation
      in order to optimize treatment, educate patients, ensure the continuity of hospital-city care
      and improve compliance (reminders) to reduce re-hospitalizations. This program will be
      carried out by using a computer platform allowing the systematization of output documents and
      the sending of messages (e-mail / SMS) for making appointments (medical consultations,
      biologicals sampling) and perfect therapeutic education.
