      range (70-180 mg/dL) of the second generation of a Glucose Predictive and Therapy Advisory
      system in diabetic patients treated by basal-bolus insulin regimens using pumps or multiple
      daily injections. We want to compare the time spent in safe range while using the predictor
      and advisor outputs and when the patient is not using them. This is a randomized controlled
      crossover trial. Patient will come for two admissions of 3 days, one with the DIAdvisor
      system fully activated, and one with the prediction and advice features disabled.
