      with renal insufficiency. A study has shown an incidence of fifteen percent of gout in the
      first five years spent in dialysis and it was associated with an increased mortality.
      Allopurinol is a medication intended to lower uric acid and therefore prevents gout attacks.
      Its metabolism is mainly renal, and some studies from the early 1960s demonstrated that it is
      also dialyzable. At the moment, we do not have strong evidence of the optimal dosage of
      allopurinol with modern techniques of dialysis. The hypothesis is that allopurinol would be
      more efficacious to lower uric acid if it was given after dialysis only. The investigators
      will then switch administration of allopurinol to bedtime for dialysis patients currently
      taking that medication. Dosage of uric acid will be performed to assess the efficacy of the
      intervention.
