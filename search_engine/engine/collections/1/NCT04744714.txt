      pregnancy outcomes. However, the current guidelines for GWG are based on American population
      and may not apply to pregnant women in China, especially for those with gestational diabetes
      mellitus (GDM) who have high risk factors. The big gaps in academic-related fields need to be
      filled.

      Our research group has previously found the heterogeneous relationships between GWG and
      adverse outcomes in GDM women with different abnormal glucose metabolism. Therefore, based on
      the principles of precision medicine, this project intends to establish for the first time
      the GWG standard for Chinese pregnant women to optimize the GWG management through a
      multicenter prospective cohort study. At the same time, specific GWG guidelines applicable to
      GDM women with different glucose metabolism abnormalities were innovatively constructed. Our
      study will provide strong evidence for stratified management and precise intervention of GDM
      pregnant women, which is of great significance to ensure health of both mothers and their
      offspring.
