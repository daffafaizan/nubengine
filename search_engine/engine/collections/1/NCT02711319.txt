      to modulate cortical excitability of motor areas and induce changes over the descending
      corticospinal output. This modulation may be useful to promote active recovery of motor
      function and to obtain functional benefit from gait rehabilitation. Through the use of
      repetitive high-frequency rTMS, improvement has been reported in motor and sensory functions
      measured by American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS), and time
      to complete a peg-board task in four chronic incomplete cervical SCI patients.

      Physical therapy aims to improve function of both undamaged and also, as far as possible,
      damaged neuronal structures. However, 'reorganization' of neuronal circuits is the target of
      specific training approaches. Therefore, the challenge is to guide CNS plasticity in order to
      optimize the functional outcome for a given individual. Hypothesized was that high-frequency
      rTMS coupled with gait training can improve motor recovery in the lower extremities and
      locomotion in incomplete SCI patients to a greater degree than sham stimulation.
