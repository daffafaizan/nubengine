      being used in the Department of Anesthesia (The Child Induction Behavioral Assessment tool)
      to grade the difficulty of patient behaviors exhibited during anesthesia inductions. The
      Child Induction Behavioral Assessment (CIBA) tool is more succinct than previously validated
      tools for assessing behavioral responses to inhalation inductions, making it practical for
      use in a busy clinical practice setting. Having clinicians document a patient's behavioral
      response to induction using the CIBA tool is useful because this information can help to
      optimize subsequent induction plans if the patient returns. Additionally, population data may
      be collected using electronic data reports for QI purposes. Prior to using data from the CIBA
      tool in QI initiatives, it is important to assess whether this tool is reliable and valid.
