      healthy volunteers during PECs can inhibit the activity of a central insulin stimulus (i.e,
      INI) to reduce endogenous glucose production. Secondarily, in an exploratory arm, this study
      seeks to examine whether a single dose of OLA can inhibit improvements associated with INI
      administration on specific cognitive domains (visuospatial, and verbal memory). Further, the
      study will also explore the effects of insulin and OLA on neurochemical and neurohemodynamic
      measures obtained through MRI imaging techniques.

      To accomplish these objectives, this study will have two separate and parallel arms - a
      metabolic PEC arm to study the primary hypothesis, and an MRI imaging and cognitive testing
      arm to study the two secondary hypotheses.
