      characteristics from the first trimester of pregnancy. For example, Kurjak et al.,in one of
      the first studies using transvaginal pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound in early pregnancies,
      identified the uterine arteries in 100% of the patients. The flow blood of the corpus luteum
      was identified in 75% patients. The measures obtained by Doppler ultrasonography that may
      have prognostic value to the evolution of pregnancy include uteroplacental blood flow, also
      known as trophoblastic flow. Jaffe et al. reported that abnormal Doppler findings were
      associated with a significantly higher prevalence of complicated pregnancies, among women
      with abnormal Doppler findings, 43% ended in miscarriage, whereas among women with normal
      findings only 1.4% of women miscarried.Progesterone plays a crucial role in the maintenance
      of pregnancy. In the presence of sufficient progesterone levels during pregnancy, lymphocytes
      synthesize a mediator called progesterone induced blocking factor (PIBF), which is
      anti-abortive in mice . Besides inducing secretary changes in the endometrium and supporting
      early pregnancy, it modulates the maternal immune response to prevent fetal rejection and
      relaxes the uterine smooth muscles .CA-125, well-known as a tumor marker for epithelial
      ovarian cancer , is a high molecular weight glycoprotein that is produced not only by ovarian
      cancer, but also by nonovarian tumors, normal epithelia of the peritoneum, the endometrium,
      the fallopian tube, and the ovary. Because CA-125 is also produced by the endometrium, some
      authors suggest that CA-125 can be used as a marker for endometrial receptivity in patients
      undergoing IVF . Its role as a predictor for pregnancy outcome is controversial .
