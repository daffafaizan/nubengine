    
      Primary

      - to determine the safety, toxicity, and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of autologous dendritic
      cell-adenovirus chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21) vaccine administered as an
      intratumoral injection in treating patients with stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent non-small cell
      lung cancer

      Secondary

        -  to determine the biologic and clinical responses to therapy

        -  to determine treatment-related toxicity using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria

        -  to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)

        -  to monitor patients for evidence of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21
           vaccine-induced cytokines and antigen-specific immune responses

        -  to detect immune responses to tumor-associated antigens and vector

        -  to assess patients for objective signs of tumor regression (RECIST criteria)
