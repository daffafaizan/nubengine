      guided procedures in the MRI suite. The real-time MRI Imaging software will be used during an
      MRI procedure to take continuous pictures.

      The Philips Interventional iSuite software package has not received FDA 510(k) clearance. The
      Investigator will be evaluating and publishing on the use of this software as a clinical aid
      in performing interventional procedures within the MR suite. The primary evaluation will be
      weighted toward enhanced facilitation of ablation procedures. However, the software will not
      replace standard MR imaging for final confirmation of needle tip position and ablation
      margins.
