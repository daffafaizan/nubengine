      will be collected for analysis. Collection of media will include laser assisted collapse of
      the blastocyst on day 5, 6, or 7 in order to release blastocoel fluid into the culture media.
      Embryos diagnosed as aneuploid or monogenic disorder affected (abnormal embryos) will be
      donated for additional analysis with patient consent.

      Results obtained from culture media will not be provided to the patients. The information
      obtained from cf-PGT will be compared to results obtained from embryo biopsies obtained as
      part of routine PGT and evaluated for concordance and reliability. Abnormal embryos will be
      rebiopsied (~3 to 4 times) to evaluate concordance with cf-PGT and the original clinical
      trophectoderm biopsy PGT results.

      All cases will be labelled using a 5-digit barcode and embryo number or saliva source code.
      Because PGT will be conducted under clinical regulatory approval (CAP and CLIA), patient
      information will be protected under HIPAA guidelines, including sending reports in encrypted
      secure email per standard operating procedures. All publications and presentations will
      maintain de-identification of any patient data used.

      Patients may withdraw from the study at any time by contacting the principal investigator of
      their respective recruiting site. They will continue to receive standard of care through
      their treating IVF center. A recruitment target of 200 patients is intended for this study.
