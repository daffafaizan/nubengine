      Raynaud phenomenon, digital ulcers and cutaneous calcinosis may result in pain, disability
      and claw deformity. Strategies to improve hand function are recommended since its diagnosis
      and throughout the treatment. Unfortunately hand care assistance is not often available. The
      objective of this study was to developed a brief guide about hand care and home-based
      exercises to be applied in our outpatient clinic.

      Methods: A brief program , with instructions about the disease and home-based exercises will
      be applied in a group patients with Systemic Sclerosis (SS) during the period of 12 weeks.
      Hand function (Cochin Hand and Functional Scale), disability (HAQ-Scleroderma), quality of
      life (SF-36 hand pain (visual analogue scale), grip and pinch strength, hand mobility (delta
      finger) will be assessed in the first appointment and after twelve weeks.
