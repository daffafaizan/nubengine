      The presence of anisocytosis or RDW variations has been classicaly used as a test for iron
      deficiency anemia. Increasing evidence points to its potential as a predictor for various
      conditions such as heart failure , malignancy, ischemic heart disease and sepsis.

      Study investigators will examine the relationship between RDW levels and incidence of atrial
      fibrillation in critically ill sepsis patients as well as 28-day mortality.
