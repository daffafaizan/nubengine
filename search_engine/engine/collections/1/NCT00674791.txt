      peptides to patients with high risk (TxN2-3M0) or metastatic breast cancer with no evidence
      of disease following their completion of systemic therapy, with the secondary objectives of
      evaluating immune response disease relapse survival. Two cohorts of 9 patients each will be
      treated with different doses of the vaccine. They will receive the peptide vaccine
      subcutaneously on weeks 0,1,2,4,5, and 6 and then receive the immunizations every 1 month for
      6 months or disease recurrence. Toxicity will be assessed at each dose level using CTCv3
      toxicity criteria.
