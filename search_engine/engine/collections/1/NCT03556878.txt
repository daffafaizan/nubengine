      commonly experienced by individuals with a severe mental illness reduces capacity to function
      and contributes to key symptoms. This study seeks to collect pilot data on an adapted version
      of the Transdiagnostic Sleep and Circadian intervention (TranS-C). The adapted version will
      be referred to as 'Fitted TranS-C' as it is designed to improve the fit to delivery within
      community mental health centers. 'Fitted' treatments are needed because the context for
      implementation (community setting) typically differs from the original testing context
      (university setting) causing a lack of 'fit' between the setting and evidence based
      treatments.
