      the influenza vaccination programme be extended to include children aged 2 to 16. In the
      three flu seasons in which the child flu immunisation programme has been running (2013-14,
      2014-15, 2015-16), uptake rates have been low (approximately 40%). Multiple factors are
      likely to underlie the poor uptake, including thinking the vaccine was unsafe and ineffective
      and having experienced side-effects related to the vaccine previously.

      Although symptoms are commonly reported following vaccinations, their causes are not always
      straightforward. Although a minority may be directly attributable to the vaccine itself,
      others may reflect pre-existing or coincidental symptoms that are misattributed to the
      vaccine. Following vaccination, an expectation that the vaccine causes side-effects may also
      contribute to parents detecting symptoms in their child that might otherwise have gone
      unnoticed. Perception of side-effects may also influence the parent's decision to vaccinate
      their child again in following years.

      Other possible factors influencing parents' perception of side-effects and their willingness
      to vaccinate their child again are their personal health beliefs and their interpretations of
      the information they are given about vaccination and side-effects. These cognitive processes
      can be measured objectively using experimental tasks, and can reveal characteristic patterns,
      or 'cognitive biases' which govern behaviour.
