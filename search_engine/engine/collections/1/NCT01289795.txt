      development of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. However, endothelial dysfunction (ED) is
      not established as a risk factor for ischemic stroke.

      As a novelty the proposed trial investigates the following variety of indirect markers of
      endothelial function in acute ischemic stroke:

      circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), endothelial microparticles (EMP), ENDOPAT
      (RH- PAT ratio) in two regards:

        1. time after ischemic events (< 48h, Days 4-5, day 7 or at discharge)

        2. etiological stroke subtypes

      It is not known whether these parameters are changed after acute cerebral ischemia and could
      possibly serve as specific target for treatment.
