      and failure of historic hip resurfacing prosthesis. Metal-on-metal devices reduce the wear
      substantially and may solve this problem. The purpose of this study is the investigation of
      the functional and radiological result and subjective patient outcome after implantation of a
      hip resurfacing endoprosthesis (Birmingham Hip Resurfacing) during the first two years after
      surgery.
