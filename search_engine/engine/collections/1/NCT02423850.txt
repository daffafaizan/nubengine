      Newly admitted patients with a diabetic foot ulcer are included at the first visit in the
      multidisciplinary clinic. The data mentioned below are collected at the first visit and the
      following examinations are performed including 3D photos. The wound size (2D area, 3D area,
      perimeter and volume) are estimated from the photos using the 3D-WAM camera. The wound
      examination is repeated after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks or until healing of the wound.
      The wound healing is estimated using changes in wound size per time unit. Patients are
      treated by standard ulcer treatment methods and are unaffected by the project per se. During
      the trial the different methods of treatment are noted including changes from initial
      treatment. The variables will be quantified after one year depending on time to heal,
      establishment of a chronic ulcer (non-healing after one year) or an amputation has been
      performed.

      At baseline the following patient data will be collected:

        -  Demographic data: gender, age

        -  Smoking habits

        -  Time period between onset of wound to first visit in the multidisciplinary clinic

        -  Body Mass Index

        -  Comorbidity using Charlson Comorbidity Index score

        -  Type of diabetes, duration of diabetes

        -  Diabetic complications including retinopathy, albuminuria, coronary heart diseases and
           neuropathy

      The following examinations will be performed at baseline:

        -  Blood pressure measurement

        -  Peripheral blood pressure

        -  Examination for neuropathy using monofilament

        -  Blood samples from patients with a diabetic foot ulcer

      The clinical examination of the ulcer are performed at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36
      and 52 weeks or until wound healing:

        -  Size of wound (2D area, 3D area, perimeter, volume) measured using the 3D-WAM camera

        -  Size of wound in 2D area using the digital imaging method with the software ImageJ

        -  Location of the ulcer

        -  Classification of ulcer: granulation, necrosis, epithelialisation

        -  Secretory potential

        -  Foot deformity

        -  Bone affection - if osteitis is suspected an x-ray is taken

        -  Signs of infection

      The different types of ulcer treatment is registered for every ulcer:

        -  Type of bandage

        -  Antibiotics (local, systemic)

        -  Revision (method, frequency),

        -  Surgery

      Effect variables

        -  Wound 2D area, 3D area, perimeter and volume

        -  Variation in 2D and 3D area measurements during the study period

        -  Percentage change in wound size after 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks

      Endpoints

        -  Wound healing

        -  Amputations

        -  Chronic wound (non-healing after 1 year)

        -  Death

      Significance

      This project seeks to clarify whether 3D photos of wounds will provide accurate structural
      measures to illuminate the background for delayed ulcer healing, and thereby to create
      platform for a more evidence based treatment algorithm.
