    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy vs standard management, in terms
           of reduction of lymphedema, in patients with chronic arm lymphedema after radiotherapy
           for cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the mechanisms of tissue reperfusion and healing in patients treated with HBO
           therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy over 90 minutes 5 days a week for 6
           weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard management. Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and
           15 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients (42 for arm I and 21 for arm II) will be accrued
      for this study.
