           to monitor the injection of the BoNT-bolus. Immediate after MRI-scan, physiotherapy will
           be performed. Patients, who were randomised to the non-treatment group at baseline, will
           receive physiotherapy immediately after MRI at week 16.

        -  At week 3 and week 19, three weeks after BoNT injection, respectively, MRI will be
           repeated. T2-and DTI- weighted and FLAIR- sequences will be performed.
