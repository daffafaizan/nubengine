      improve the early diagnosis of ARDS, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers of ARDS.
      The goal of this project is to find a series novel biomarkers by differential proteomic
      techniques that can improve the early diagnosis and develop a more efficient therapy to
      enhance ARDS patient survival rate. Clinical data and blood sample were recorded before
      treatment and after treatment. Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE
      III) scores were calculated at enrolment. Studying blood specimens from different period ARDS
      patients by proteomic analysis. It can provide information on a complex composition of
      proteins that are differentially expressed, which could be used for discovering high
      sensitivity and specificity ARDS biomarker.
