      In a hypothesis testing research proposal, briefly mention the hypothesis to be tested and
      provide the scientific basis of the hypothesis, critically examining the observations leading
      to the formulation of the hypothesis.

      Does this research proposal involve testing of hypothesis: 0 No 1 Yes (describe below)

      The investigators hypothesise that supplementation of vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol), in
      addition to standard antibiotic and other supportive therapy in the management of under-five
      children with severe pneumonia will significantly shorten the duration of severity of
      pneumonia and thereby reduce hospital stay and also reduce the risk of new episode of
      pneumonia.

      Specific Objectives:

      Objective: To assess the clinical benefit of oral vitamin D3 supplementation, in addition to
      standard antibiotic and other supportive therapy, in the management of hospitalised,
      under-five children with severe pneumonia.

      Primary objective: To compare the duration of severe pneumonia of children in the two study
      groups receiving the standard therapy (appropriate antibiotic and other supportive therapy)
      with those receiving vitamin D supplementation in addition to the standard therapy.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the duration of hospitalization, fever, tachypnoea, chest in drawing,
           hypoxia, lethargy and inability to feed during hospital stay, in under-five children in
           the two study groups, as mentioned under the primary aim.

        -  To compare the recurrence of new episode of pneumonia over the next 6 months after
           discharge from hospital in the two study groups.

        -  To identify the optimum safety dose of vitamin D3 for different groups of under-five
           children.

        -  In severe pneumonia patient who also have acute watery diarrhoea we will assess the
           indirect absorption of vitamin D by measuring serum vitamin D level and will also assess
           the clinical outcome in the subgroup.
