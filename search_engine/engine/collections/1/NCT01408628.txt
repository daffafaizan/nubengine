      of Kansas an innovative model of synchronous ("live") Internet initiation and intensification
      of once daily basal insulin glargine or detemir in type 2 diabetic patients that can be
      deployed statewide in a subsequent larger study (R18). The study's specific aims are to 1)
      develop a synchronous ("live") interactive Internet-administered course designed to teach
      groups of type 2 diabetic patients to safely administer basal insulin without significant
      support from their usual source of diabetic management and to self-adjust the dose to achieve
      a HbA1c < 7.0% using a treat-to-target algorithm; and 2) to assess for the Internet patients
      selected clinical and psychometric outcomes. These will include HbA1c, frequency and severity
      of hypoglycemia, psychological resistance to insulin treatment, diabetes quality of life, and
      treatment satisfaction. The study builds upon the findings of the Treat-to-Target and
      INITIATE trials, as well as on successful Internet interventions for weight management, and
      both lays the conceptual foundation and gathers the expertise to successfully apply for the
      R18, which will have as primary aims addressing of delays to insulin therapy documented in
      the DAWN study and cost effectiveness analysis of the Internet intervention. The study hopes
      to show that Internet teaching of basal insulin therapy is comparable to traditional insulin
      management with respect to safety and effectiveness as measured against expected (published)
      results for frequency of hypoglycemia and percent of patients reaching target. Psychometric
      outcomes are exploratory - and hypothesis generating with respect to the subsequent R18
      application.
