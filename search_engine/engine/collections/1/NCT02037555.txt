    
      The primary objective of this clinical study was to compare the percentage of subjects with
      any component of a 7 item major morbidity composite (postoperative mortality, stroke, acute
      kidney injury ([AKI]), surgical re-exploration, arterial or venous thromboembolic event,
      prolonged mechanical ventilation, or infection) between 2 groups of subjects randomly
      allocated to receive preoperative supplementation of AT-III (Human) (Antithrombin-III ([Human
      ]) or Placebo.

      The secondary objectives of this clinical study were the following:

        -  To compare postoperative antithrombin III (AT) levels at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
           admission between the AT-III (Human) treatment group and Placebo control group

        -  To compare the following perioperative outcomes between the AT-III (Human) treatment
           group and Placebo control group:

             -  Postoperative chest-drain blood loss in the first 12 and 24 hours after surgery

             -  Transfusion requirements

             -  Need for surgical re-exploration

             -  Low cardiac output syndrome

             -  Myocardial Infarction (MI)

             -  Stroke

             -  AKI

             -  Arterial or venous thromboembolic events

             -  Infections

             -  Prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hours)

             -  All-cause postoperative mortality

             -  ICU stay duration

             -  Prolonged ICU stay (>6 days)

             -  Length of hospital stay

      Additionally, safety objectives included the evaluation of AT III (Human) for clinical safety
      including adverse events (AEs), risks for bleeding, clinical laboratory testing, physical
      exam, and vital signs.
