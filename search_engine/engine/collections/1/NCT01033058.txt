      ACS undergoing early PCI, loading dose of atorvastatin before early PCI led to a reduction of
      prei-PCI MI, recurrent CV events and mortality. While, theses studies included patients with
      non-ST-segment elevation ACS, requiring PCI; these results cannot be extrapolated directly to
      patients with ST-segment elevation MI, and these trials included patients sent to an early
      and selective PCI, but not those undergoing emergency revascularization;

      This study is designed to find out whether STEMI patients undergoing emergency PCI can
      benefit from intensive atorvastatin treatment compared with routine treatment.
