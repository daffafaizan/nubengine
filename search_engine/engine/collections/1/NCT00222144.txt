      patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Also to determine the expression of
      PDGF-R, phosphorylated PDGF-r and C-kit in the original tissue and correlate with response.
      If the patient has a tumor in an accessible location, we will ask for consent from the
      patient to obtain biopsy before and after the therapy to assess the same molecular markers.
