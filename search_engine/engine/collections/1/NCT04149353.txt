      post-treatment time points will accurately predict the patient's response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, providing useful prognostic and surgical-planning information. The study will
      enroll patients with operable breast cancer being treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      followed by potentially curative surgical resection. The standard of care for these patients
      would not normally include PET imaging but may include MR imaging. Patients in the study will
      receive combined PET/MR imaging prior to treatment and following treatment. Then, patients
      will receive curative intent surgery and be followed in the usual fashion and assessed for
      local and/or distant recurrent disease. The pathology report will be reviewed for therapy
      treatment effect as assessed by Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) score. Quantitative measures
      from PET and MRI will be computed: the change in PET tumor-mean standardized uptake value
      (SUV) and tumor size as assessed by MRI, from pre- to post-treatment. The image-based
      quantitative measures will be correlated with the pathology outcomes to evaluate
      predictability of the image measures for RCB score. Patients will be followed with the intent
      of further correlating image measures with clinical outcomes.
