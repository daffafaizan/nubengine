      production yield. China is the largest potato producer with a quarter of world production,
      followed by India, Russia, and USA. The potato production as well as consumption has enhanced
      in developing countries while continuously declined in developed countries during the last
      decade. The investigators therefore explored the prospective associations of consumption of
      total potatoes, sweet potatoes, stir-fried potatoes, and non stir-fried potatoes with the
      risk of hypertension in general people of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) cohort
      study from 1989 to 2011. A total of 11,763 participants (â‰¥20 years old) who were free of
      hypertension at baseline were enrolled from CHNS Cohort study. Cox proportional hazards
      regression models were used to estimate the associations after adjusting for potential
      confounders. This study provides new evidence on the association of various potato
      consumption with the incidence of hypertension in China. As urbanization accelerates across
      the whole domain of China, the tendency of transition to Western-style diets and lifestyles
      appears continuously and steeply growing. More and more potatoes will be consumed as
      processed potato products including potatoes chips and French fries, which may be a potential
      risk factor of hypertension occurrence.
