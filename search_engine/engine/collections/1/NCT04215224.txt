      development of artificial intelligence, much more potential lies in the histopathology images
      of HE slices in primary gliomas could be excavated to aid prediction of patients' prognosis
      in the frame of molecular pathology of gliomas. The creation of a registry for primary glioma
      with detailed survival data, molecular pathology, histopathology image data and with
      sufficient sample size for deep learning (>1000) provides opportunities for personalized
      prediction of survival of glioma patients with non-invasiveness and precision.
