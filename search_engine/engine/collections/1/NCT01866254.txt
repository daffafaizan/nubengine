      Since some patients cannot tolerate morphine, hydromorphone may be an acceptable alternative.
      Intrathecal Intrathecal hydromorphone has been shown to be effective at treating post
      cesarean section pain and possibly with less side effects than morphine.

      One side effect of morphine is respiratory depression occurring hours after the start of
      morphine use. Respiratory depression occurs when air being taken into the lungs is less than
      normal, leading to a lower amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide being exchanged in the blood
      stream. Because hydromorphone dosages are lower and it has a quicker onset of action than
      morphine, it is believed that the use of hydromorphone should decrease the possibility of
      delayed respiratory depression.
