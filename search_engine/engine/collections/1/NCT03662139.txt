      non-progressive injury of the fetal or immature brain. It causes movement deterioration and
      activity limitation. In CP patients increase in slow walking speed, shorter step length, and
      longer duration in the double support phase are common. Such gait changes are thought to
      reflect the unbalanced walking pattern seen in these children. Although children with CP are
      well known to have poor balance and high fall incidence, little effort has been made to
      quantify the dynamic walking stability of these children.

      The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) is a performance-based tool developed by Shumway-Cook and
      Woollacott to quantitatively measure dynamic balance capabilities. It also evaluates the
      individual's ability to modify gait in response to changing gait task requirements. Despite
      it's widespread use in the elderly population, DGI has not yet been investigated in children
      with neurological conditions. Considering that it takes a little time to apply the test, it
      may be advantageous for children in terms of simplicity and ease of administration.

      In this study the investigators aim to validate and assess interrater and test - retest
      reliabilities of Turkish version of Dynamic Gait Index in children with unilateral, spastic
      cerebral palsy.
