      active-controlled, 4 period crossover study was to evaluate the effect of therapeutic and
      supra-therapeutic doses of eslicarbazepine acetate on the placebo corrected time-matched
      change from baseline using individually corrected QT (QTcI) interval durations in adult
      healthy volunteers.
