      the introduction of Fiasp® insulin. Subjects enrolled in the study will have a 2 week period
      of optimization with weekly assessments of their Carelink download before entering the
      blinded phase of the study. They will use their usual home insulin during the optimization
      phase. They will then be started on their first blinded insulin (aspart or Fiasp®) which they
      will use for 2 weeks, before they cross-over to the other insulin.
