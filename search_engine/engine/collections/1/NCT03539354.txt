      grafting plus b-blocker treatment (according to guidelines; group I) and coronary artery
      bypass grafting plus b-blocker treatment (according to guidelines) plus temporary spinal cord
      stimulation (group 2). Temporary spinal cord stimulation is performed for 3 days before
      surgery and 7 days after coronary artery bypass grafting. Continuous ECG during intensive
      care unit stay, daily ECG and 24-h Holter monitor recordings at 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after
      coronary artery bypass grafting, external loop recorder after discharge from intensive care
      unit until 30 days after coronary artery bypass grafting. Rhythm status and clinical outcome
      assessment at 12 month follow up
