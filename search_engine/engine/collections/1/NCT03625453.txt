    
      ABX-1431 is a potent and selective, orally available, irreversible inhibitor of
      monoacylglycerol lipase, a metabolic enzyme that regulates the activity of the endogenous
      cannabinoid (endocannabinoid) system. It is being developed as a potential first-in-class
      compound for the treatment of Tourette Syndrome.

      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and effect on tics ABX-1431 in adults with
      Tourette Syndrome or chronic motor tic disorder in an 8-week study. It is a two-part study.
      Part 1 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of ABX-1431 at two target dose
      levels. Part 2 is an optional, open-label, non-randomized study of ABX-1431.

      Patients will participate in the main study (Part 1) for approximately 10 to 14 weeks (up to
      30-day screening period; 56-day treatment period; 14-day follow-up period). For patients who
      choose to participate in Part 2, there is a period of up to 4 weeks between the last study
      visit in Part 1 and first study visit in Part 2. Patients who choose to enter Part 2 will be
      treated with open-label ABX-1431 for an additional 6 weeks (28-day treatment period; 14-day
      follow-up period).
