      treatment in patients with MS of Hispanic descent relative to their ancestral background.
      Therapeutic success will be determined by annualized relapse rate (ARR; defined as the number
      of relapses divided by the person years followed) after initiation of treatment with Gilenya®
      (fingolimod)in comparison to the relapse rate in the previous 12 months. This will be
      determined based on medical chart extraction, in-person assessment and regular clinical
      follow-up.

      A secondary objective of this study is to investigate whether the efficacy of Gilenya®
      (fingolimod) is superior or equal in HW which have higher loads of Amerindian versus
      Caucasian background with opticospinal MS (OSMS-NMO neg) versus classical MS (CMS) in the
      first 12 months using radiological and clinical parameters. The following measures will be
      obtained:

        1. Number of relapse-free patients over the investigational period

        2. Site of relapse defined as brain or spinal cord.

        3. Sustained Disability progression will be defined as a one point (1) increase from
           baseline in patients with baseline EDSS score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point (0.5)
           increase in patients with baseline EDSS score of 5-5.5 or above after 3 months.

        4. MRI changes as described as number of new T2 lesions and number of Gd-enhancing lesions
           after 12 months from baseline.
