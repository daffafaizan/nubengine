      requirements when administered by the parenteral route in critically ill septic children. The
      study size will include 45 critically ill septic, pediatric patients (15 infants at 1 month-3
      years of age, 15 children at 4-12 years of age and 15 adolescent at 13-19 years of age, male
      and females admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Children's Medical
      Center, Dallas. The minimal subject's weight will be 4 kg. The number of subjects includes an
      expected drop out rate of about 20%, in order to obtain 12 patients with complete data in
      each group. Patients will receive nutritional support as per standard care. This study will
      yield important knowledge and may lead in the future to changes in the current practice on
      the management of critically ill pediatric patients in the PICU.

      Study Aim#1: Determine the parenteral requirements of methionine, in the presence of
      cysteine, in critically ill septic patients' required extended use of TPN, by using the
      indicator amino acid oxidation and balance technique.

      Study Aim#2: Determine methionine metabolism through the rates of transmethylation,
      transsulfuration and remethylation at the current standard intakes of methionine of 120
      mg.kg.d. with negligible amounts of cysteine.
