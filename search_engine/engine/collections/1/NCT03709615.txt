      anxiety disorder (SAD). However, little is known about the processes and mechanisms of change
      in this treatment. Compared to face to face (FTF) treatments, online interventions may
      operate through partially different mechanisms of change due to the text-based nature of the
      interaction and the reduced level of therapist involvement. The present randomized controlled
      trial will examine therapeutic processes during iCBT for SAD including the presence of sudden
      gains and their relationship to outcome, the relationship between anxiety and depressive
      symptoms along the course of treatment, changes in the therapeutic alliance and attrition
      from therapy. Moreover, we will compare iCBT for SAD with a wait-list control group and
      utilize weekly measurements of anxiety, depression, and SAD-related cognitions in both
      groups. This will facilitate comparison between temporal processes in both conditions and
      also shed light on processes occurring in wait-list conditions.
