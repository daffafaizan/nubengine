    
      This study's aims are: AIM 1: To examine the relative efficacy of Familias Unidas, extended
      to target obesity, in increasing physical activity and improving the quality of dietary
      intake among overweight Hispanic youth and AIM 2: To examine whether and to what extent
      family functioning partially mediates the effects of Familias Unidas on physical activity and
      quality of dietary intake.

      H1: Familias Unidas will be efficacious, compared to Community Practice, in increasing
      Hispanic youth's past moderate to vigorous physical activity over time.

      H2: Familias Unidas will be efficacious, compared to Community Practice, in improving
      Hispanic youth's past quality dietary intake (defined as decreases in dietary intakes of
      sugar-sweetened beverages, fast foods, and increases in dietary intakes of fresh fruits and
      vegetables) over time.

      H3: Familias Unidas' effects on youth's past day moderate to vigorous physical activity and
      youth's past quality dietary intake will be partially mediated by changes in family
      functioning over time.
