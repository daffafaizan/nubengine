    
      Excessive supraventricular ectopic activities (ESVEA) are a common finding on long-term ECG
      recordings and have a connection to atrial cardiomyopathy, incident AF, stroke and mortality.

      Holter recording from 2018 preformed at Danderyd hospital will be screened in order to
      identify 125 recordings with ESVEA, defined as at least 30 atrial ectopic beats/hour or a
      supraventricular run of at least 20 consecutive beats. Participants fulfilling eligibility
      criteria will be offered prolonged AF screening with continuous event recording (ELR). A
      matched control group (125 participants) without ESVEA will also be screened using same
      method.

      Cardiovascular data from medical records will also be collected in order to attain
      information regarding co-morbidities and being able to assess CHA2DS2-VASC score.

      Samples of blood will be collected at index time, after 21± 3 months for further analysis
      with the aim of identifying biomarkers for atrial fibrillation. During this two time periods
      transthoracic echocardiography will also be preformed.

      The study population will after 21± 3 months be subjected to renewed screening with ELR in
      order to examine the persistence of excessive supraventricular activity they will also
      preform a 24 hours ambulatory ECG (Holter).

      Four years after the completion of screening visits, data from patient records and
      information thorough telephone interview and/or data from Swedish Patient Register, Swedish
      Dispensed Drug Register will be collected
