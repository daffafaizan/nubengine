      amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) in reducing neurovascular bundle inflammation in prostate
      cancer patients undergoing bilateral full nerve sparing robotic assisted laparoscopic radical
      prostatectomy (RALP). Specifically, this study compares potency outcomes in patients who had
      full nerve sparing RALP procedures with dHACM application to the neurovascular bundles to
      that of full nerve sparing RALP without dHACM application to neurovascular bundles.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two possible treatment groups:

        -  Group 1 - Treatment Group ( Full Nerve Sparing RALP + AmnioFixÂ®)

        -  Group 2 - Control Group ( Full Nerve Sparing RALP alone)
