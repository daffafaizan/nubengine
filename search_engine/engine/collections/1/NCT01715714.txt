      are still at significant risk for postoperative major adverse cardiocerebral events (≈15%
      MACCE rate), with ≈3% of patients dying within 30 days of surgery. Recent clinical evidence
      shows that cardioprotection in patients receiving chronic statin treatment can be further
      improved by a high-dose statin 'recapture' therapy given shortly before an
      ischemia-reperfusion sequence, resulting in a 61% risk reduction for MACE at 30 days in
      patients undergoing PCI. Evaluation of this novel approach in the setting of CABG seems
      particularly promising, as myocardial injury, surgery-related inflammation and pre-existing
      patients' comorbidities play a pivotal role for poor clinical outcomes after CABG that may be
      improved by an acute statin recapture therapy. The StaRT-CABG trial is the first large-scale
      (n=2,630 CABG patients), multicentre (8 cardiac surgery centres), randomised, double-blind
      and placebo-controlled trial that aims to test whether an acute high-dose statin recapture
      therapy given shortly before CABG reduces the incidence of MACCE at 30 days after surgery
      (composite primary outcome: all-cause mortality; non-fatal myocardial infarction and
      cerebrovascular events). The StaRT-CABG trial is expected to provide highly relevant clinical
      data on the efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach in order to optimize the care for all
      CAD patients undergoing CABG with broad clinical implications on current clinical practice
      and existing guidelines.
