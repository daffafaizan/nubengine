    
      after randomization of patients in both groups (Plavix or Pidogrel), the measure of platelet
      activity by the VerifyNow assay, 4 to 12 hours after the loading dose of 600mg or after the
      last dose of clopidogrel for patients on maintenance dose. The VerifyNow assay will
      determine: - The PRU:-P2Y12 Reaction Units-

      -% Of platelet inhibition It will be considered low responder or clopidogrel resistant
      patient with PRU> 235 or %inhibition <15%.

      Monitoring of patients included in the study will take place over a period of 12 months, MACE
      will be notified and dated. MACE criteria are: angina, myocardial infarction, coronary
      angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft, and stroke.

      Each hemorrhagic event will be notified and classified according to the GUSTO scale.
