      I. To assess the 1-year overall survival rate in patients with stage IV melanoma treated with
      dinaciclib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the 6-month progression-free survival rate in these patients. II. To evaluate
      the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial responses) in the subset of
      patients with measurable disease.

      III. To assess the safety and tolerability of dinaciclib given to patients with stage IV
      melanoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive dinaciclib IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 3
      years.
