    
      Follow-up: In our neurosurgical center, follow-up was conducted for all patients at the first
      3-6 months and annually after discharge by clinical visit and telephone interview.

      Study overview: The population in the OHAVM study will be divided into two parts. Clinical
      and imaging data of high-level AVM patients from 2012/04 to 2019/09 were retrospectively
      collected. And the high-level AVM patients from 2019/09 to 2019/12 were prospectively
      collected. The intervention strategies in our institution for high-level AVMs are of four
      categories: microsurgical resection, embolization, embolization+radiosurgery, and
      single-stage hybrid surgery (embolization-resection). Each participants will be followed at
      least for 5 year since enrollment. Finally, we will clarify the clinical outcomes and
      prognostic predictors for patients with SM grade IV and V AVMs after different management
      strategies.

      Sample size: About 1000 patients will be enrolled in this study, and half of them were
      unruptured. The population distribution of different management strategies is expected as
      follows: conservative:100 cases, microsurgical resection: 300 cases, embolization:250 cases,
      embolization+radiosurgery: 250 cases, single-stage hybrid surgery: 100 cases.

      Study endpoints: The neurological function prognosis, occlusion rate and complications were
      evaluated at 2 weeks, 1 year, 3 years, 5 years after the treatment and the last follow-up,
      respectively.
