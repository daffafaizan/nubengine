      or radioembolization to treat or manage the disease during an image guided intervention.
      Subjects will undergo a CT perfusion study of the liver prior to the radioembolizaiton
      mapping procedure or prior to the chemoembolization treatment. During the radioembolization
      mapping or chemoembolization procedure, 2 DynaCT acquisitions on the interventional C-arm
      will be acquired (the second during an injection of an iodinated contrast material) and will
      be processed using Siemens' PBV software to generate blood volume maps. The diagnostic
      accuracy of the two approaches to assess the vascularity of the tumors will be assessed.
