      Both reported short sleep and reported long sleep are major predictors of excess mortality
      risk, but the importance of reported sleep duration as a risk factor is not yet known.
      Sleep-related risks are of special interest to The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), because
      insomnia increases among women at menopause, and because WHI's hormone replacement therapy
      (HRT) and dietary modification (DM) may influence sleep. The WHI is an exciting opportunity
      to examine whether risks associated with reported sleep durations can be explained by a
      selection of intercurrent conditions, but the broad WHI design does not control for important
      potential confounders. Explicitly, the broad WHI design by itself cannot determine if
      behaviorally-modifiable objective sleep durations are the primary risk factor.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This ancillary project supplemented the WHI Observational Study (OS) by performing additional
      examinations on 600 San Diego OS women. These volunteers underwent home sleep recordings,
      hormone measurement, and detailed psychiatric interviews. To facilitate distinction of
      affective and sleep factors in WHI outcomes, the types and severity of depression in the OS
      subsample and the validity and reliability of sleep items in questionnaires given to WHI
      women were examined.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
