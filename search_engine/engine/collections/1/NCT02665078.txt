      scheduled for a lobectomy or an anatomical segmental resection for malignant lung tumors will
      be enrolled in the study. After lung resection, the lung will be placed on a surgical table
      in a similar position to the in-vivo situation in the Image Guided Therapeutic operating room
      (GTx-OR) within Toronto General Hospital. The lung will be evaluated by XLTF-UC180 for
      localization of the tumor. The ultrasound probe will be put on the lung surface in several
      different directions to obtain the cross section with maximum diameter. The ultrasound image
      with size measurement of the tumor will be recorded using an ultrasound scanner (EU-Y0008,
      OLYMPUS MEDICALSYSTEMS CORP., Tokyo, Japan). Next, the bronchial stump of the specimen will
      be opened and a small sized endotracheal tube will be inserted to inflate and deflate the
      lung. After inflation of the lung, the tumor will be evaluated by XLTF-UC180 to see the
      difference in ultrasound images between deflated and inflated lung. After ultrasound
      evaluation, the specimen will be delivered directory to the pathology laboratory and the
      actual tumor size and histological diagnosis will be determined. In addition, we will
      evaluate the differences between US image and pathological morphology using Hemotoxylin and
      Eosin (HE) slides of lung tumor. We will work together with the surgical team to confirm sign
      off of specimens.
