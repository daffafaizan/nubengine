      incontinence as defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) Standardization of
      Terminology Committees Joint Report as the observation of involuntary leakage from the
      urethra synchronous with the sensation of a sudden, compelling desire to void that is
      difficult to defer. The system provides treatment by delivering small controlled electrical
      pulses to the sacral nerves, as these nerves have been shown to regulate the micturition
      cycle.

      In this study, subjects will be randomized into one of two groups with a 1:1 ratio after
      enrollment. Subjects will either be randomized to an immediate or a delayed activation group.
      An intraoperative test will be performed, and all subjects will receive a permanent implant
      if they have an appropriate motor nerve root response without significant discomfort at 5 mA
      amplitude or less.
