      this burden of suffering, innovative interventions are needed to improve self-care behaviors
      including: dietary intake, physical activity (PA), self-monitoring, and medication adherence.
      The goal of this study (A New DAWN) was to develop and test a culturally appropriate,
      church-based intervention to improve diabetes self-management and glycemic control.

      Twenty-four African American churches in central NC were recruited and randomized to receive
      the special intervention (SI-13 churches, 117 participants) or the delayed intervention
      (DI-11 churches, 84 participants). The SI included an 8-month intensive phase consisting of:
      1 individual dietary assessment and counseling visit; 12 group sessions; monthly phone
      contact with a peer counselor (church diabetes advisor (CDA)); and 3 printed encouragement
      messages from the primary care clinician. This was followed by a 4-month reinforcement phase
      including monthly phone contacts from the CDA. At 8- and 12-month follow-up, HbA1c was
      assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography.

      At baseline, 64% of participants were female and means were: age 59, years with diabetes 9,
      HbA1c 7.8%, Systolic Blood Pressure 139, Diastolic Blood Pressure 76, and BMI 35.0. A total
      of 174 (87%) participants returned for 8-month measures. Adjusting for baseline values and
      randomization by church, the mean HbA1c level was 7.4% for the SI and 7.8% for the DI
      (difference 0.4%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.1-0.6, p = 0.009). There were no
      statistically significant differences between groups for BP or BMI. Of 82 (70%) SI
      participants completing an 8-month follow-up questionnaire, 65 (79%) were very satisfied with
      the nutritional component, 63 (77%) were very satisfied with the PA component, and 72 (88%)
      considered the program to be very helpful overall.

      In A New DAWN, the SI was acceptable and produced a modest, but clinically significant,
      reduction in HbA1c. These findings support the acceptability and effectiveness of
      self-management interventions given in a church setting for African Americans with type 2
      diabetes.
