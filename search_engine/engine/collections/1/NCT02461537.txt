      to induction chemotherapy have a dismal prognosis. For these patients, allogeneic
      transplantation is the recommended treatment. While allogeneic transplantation may be
      considered as the ultimate treatment concept, the treatment path to transplantation is not
      well defined.

      The traditional approach to pursue a complete remission by means of aggressive reinduction
      chemotherapy prior to allogeneic transplantation. This approach is associated with
      potentially life-threatening toxicities and has limited efficacy. As a result, only some
      patients will reach allogeneic transplantation in complete remission.

      To reduce the number of patients who die or who are ineligible for transplantation due to the
      toxicity of aggressive induction chemotherapy, other bridging options have been explored. One
      promising alternative is to abstain from remission induction. Instead, disease control by
      means of less aggressive chemotherapy or simply monitoring leukemic proliferation can be
      considered.

      This randomized trial will identify if there is non-inferiority of the less toxic approach,
      compared to the standard approach of remission induction by aggressive chemotherapy prior to
      allogeneic transplantation.
