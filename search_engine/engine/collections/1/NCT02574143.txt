    
      -  To study the epidemiology of non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB) and to provide an estimate of
           the distribution (prevalence) of NCFB etiologies across all different levels of health
           care as well as real-life data regarding the current management of NCFB in Germany

        -  To establish feasible investigational strategies in order to establish the etiology of
           NCFB

        -  To perform observational research into bronchiectasis, particularly in areas where
           single center datasets are underpowered, such as in rare etiologies or determining
           markers of prognosis

        -  To promote collaborative clinical, basic and translational research in NCFB between
           German (and European) centers

        -  To provide a registry of well phenotyped patients with NCFB in clinical centers
           potentially eligible for enrolment into clinical trials

        -  To track access to healthcare and cost of caring for patients with NCFB over time
