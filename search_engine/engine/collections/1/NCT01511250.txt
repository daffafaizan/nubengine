      assess safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults and children living in dengue endemic
      countries.

      The study enrolled 360 healthy participants. The study was conducted in 2 parts, Part 1 - age
      descending and and Part 2 - expansion - ages 1.5-11 years. Participants were allocated to one
      of the four age cohorts in Part 1 (21 to 45 years, 12 to 20 years, 6 to 11 years, and 1.5 to
      5 years) and expansion age cohort 1.5-11 years in Part 2. Participants were randomized in 2:1
      ratio and in 3: 1 ratio in Part 1 and 2 respectively to receive:

        -  TDV 0.5 mL SC injection

        -  Placebo (inactive solution) - this is a solution that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      This multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 37 months (including screening period). Participants made multiple visits to
      the clinic including a final visit at Day 1080.
