    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 3 way crossover
      study.

      All patients complete diary cards for the first month of the study in order to determine
      compliance in providing a daily record of symptoms and medication taken. All compliant
      patients receive subcutaneously injected heparin twice daily, inhaled heparin daily, or
      matched saline placebo in a random order. Each of the three drug administration periods lasts
      2 months, for a total of 6 months of treatment. Patients who have a flare in disease activity
      that requires hospitalization are terminated from that drug administration period of the
      study.

      Patients are followed biweekly during the first month and again at the end of the second
      month for each of the three 2 month drug administration periods.
