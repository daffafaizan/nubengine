    
      This is a prospective, 3:1 randomization, multi-center trial to assess the TAXUS® Element™
      Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System for the treatment of de novo atherosclerotic lesions
      of up to 28 mm in length in native coronary arteries ≥ 2.75 mm and ≤ 4.0 mm in diameter,
      compared to a control group of TAXUS Express2 Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System .

      One thousand two hundred sixty-four (1264) subjects will be treated with either the TAXUS®
      Element™ stent or the TAXUS® Express2 ™stent at a maximum of 100 clinical sites.
      Randomization to treatment group will be unbalanced 3:1 towards the test group to gain
      maximum clinical experience with the new TAXUS® Element™ platform. Follow-up at 30 days, 9
      months and 12 months will be completed in all subjects enrolled in the study. Angiographic
      follow-up at 9 months will be completed in a subset of three hundred thirty (330) subjects
      enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomly allocated to the angiographic subset at
      participating sites through the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).

      Eligible subjects will have annual follow-up until 5 years post-index procedure.
