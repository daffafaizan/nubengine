      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase II
      dose of XK469R in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies.

      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the presence of genetic variations potentially affecting XK469R disposition in
      patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive XK469R IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of XK469R until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
