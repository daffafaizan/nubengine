      individuals, nearly 30 million people in the US alone. About 5-10% of asthmatics have severe
      disease that is difficult to control with standard therapies. Severe asthmatics are
      considered to be relatively resistant to corticosteroids, a mainstay of therapy in asthma.
      Furthermore, chronic corticosteroid therapy often results in side effects that adversely
      affect outcomes. Thus, more effective treatment options, which are safe, cost-effective and
      easy to administer, are needed for severe asthmatics.

      As our understanding of asthma evolves, it is becoming clearer that there are distinct
      phenotypes that differ regarding demographic factors such as age, sex and race, but also,
      perhaps more importantly, with regards to clinical, physiologic and biologic characteristics.
      This heterogeneity may reflect distinct pathogenic mechanisms that result in airflow
      obstruction and the clinical presentation of asthma. In turn, a better understanding of the
      different factors that contribute to disease severity and pathogenesis will be necessary to
      identify new, personalized treatment and management approaches for severe asthmatics. Our
      goal is to gain a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms that differentiate severe
      asthma from mild to moderate asthma, including the role of the above-mentioned factors on
      disease control. In so doing, we hope to discover novel pathways that can be manipulated to
      achieve our primary aim of developing new therapies for severe asthmatics.
