      I. To evaluate improvement in progression-free survival for patients treated with
      anti-programmed cell death 1 (anti-PD1) pembrolizumab in combination with intravenous (IV)
      bevacizumab and oral metronomic cyclophosphamide as compared to patients treated with other
      second line chemotherapeutic agents.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain pilot data on clinical response rates using both Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria and immune related response criteria (irRECIST).

      II. To obtain data on changes in tumor microenvironment prior to and subsequent to therapy
      and, to screen for potential biomarkers to predict clinical benefit.

      III. To determine the safety and tolerability of the treatment combination in the study
      population.

      IV. To evaluate overall survival in patients treated with anti-PD1 pembrolizumab in
      combination with IV bevacizumab and oral metronomic cyclophosphamide.

      V. To assess the impact of the combination of anti-PD1 pembrolizumab, IV bevacizumab and oral
      metronomic cyclophosphamide on anti-tumor immune responses in ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on
      day 1 and cyclophosphamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every
      3 weeks for up to 12 months (or 17 courses) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients without evidence of disease progression may continue
      treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months
      for 1 year, and every 12 weeks and 6 months thereafter.
