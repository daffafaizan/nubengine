      compression fractures. However, no prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical trials
      are available to document for the efficacy of wearing of the rigid or soft brace for the
      management of osteoporotic compression fracture. Therefore, the current trial was therefore
      designed to compare the outcome for improvement of disability and pain in patients with
      osteoporotic compression fracture using rigid, soft, or no brace.
