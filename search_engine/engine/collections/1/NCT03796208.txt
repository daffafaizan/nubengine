      determine if the B-EPIC tobacco intervention is superior to tobacco 'treatment as usual
      (TAU)' for opioid dependent pregnant women maintained on buprenorphine; the outcomes for the
      first aim will be quitting smoking and/or reducing cigarette consumption during pregnancy.
      The project design also will determine the economic impact the B-EPIC intervention
      (10-months) has on healthcare expenditures.

      After informed consent, eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to the B-EPIC group
      (tobacco intervention) or TAU tobacco treatment (control group). All will continue to receive
      opioid dependence treatment with buprenorphine, regardless of treatment assignment.

      Women enrolled in the control group are informed of the risks of tobacco use and benefits of
      quitting using the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 5'A's approach
      by their healthcare provider. This standard tobacco cessation counseling takes approximately
      5-15 minutes, and is offered at each prenatal and postpartum appointment.

      Women enrolled in the intervention group will receive TAU plus B-EPIC, which includes four
      core components: 1) Individualized tobacco treatment plus supplemental counseling, 2)
      Biomarker validation and feedback, 3) Change in maternal thought process and adoption of
      healthy behavior (e.g. exercise, based on PI framework), and 4) Pharmacotherapy as needed.
      The initial assessment for this intervention takes 60 minutes, with follow-up sessions
      typically lasting 15-20 minutes. The intervention will be led by a certified tobacco
      treatment specialist (CTTS).
