      behaviors, as well as negative symptoms such as disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors.
      Antipsychotics are the primary method of treatment in pediatric populations, but can produce
      unpleasant or dangerous side effects. Medication response is highly variable. Recent evidence
      demonstrates transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) relieving auditory hallucinations
      (AH) associated with schizophrenia in adults, and to a lesser degree negative and cognitive
      symptomology. Such studies provide important scientific and technical knowledge that may be
      applied to pediatric populations.

      Hypothesis: 1. Primary: Youths with EOS will demonstrate amelioration of AH after
      administration of tDCS. 2. TDCS will be well-tolerated in pediatric populations with minimal
      adverse side effects.
