    
      Changes on the interproximal periimplant marginal bone level measured as the distance between
      the bone crest to the first implant to bone contact, using periapical radiographs, will be
      evaluated.

      Each patient will receive to implants that will be rehabilitated with an implant supported
      prosthesis, being the test group a prosthesis connected directly to the implants, while the
      control group will be a prosthesis connected to the implants through intermediate abutments.
