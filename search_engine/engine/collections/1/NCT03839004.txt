    
      The first international scientific research project focusing on a holistic approach to
      pregnancy is starting now at the Clinica Mangiagalli in Milan.

      This innovative model aims to the gold standard of a "positive pregnancy", which supports
      both the somatic and psychological component of the mother-newborn unit, and thus organically
      and proactively prevents the main issues arising during pregnancy and delivery due to
      unhealthy lifestyles.

      A team of experts will take comprehensive care of the mother, first by means of an accurate
      evaluation of her nutritional profile, and then of her biomechanic (osteo-skeletal) state.

      Then, the experts will lead an "academic" path, which will initiate a development of her
      biochemistry (through nutrition), respiration (through yoga), physical wellbeing (through
      osteopathy and yoga); and strengthen her sense of self, removing her self-doubt (through
      mindfulness and yoga).

      The women will be supported up until childbirth, so as to attempt to prevent the main
      complications of pregnancy and of delivery.

      This model does not aim to substitute the allopathic one which is currently in place
      (ultrasounds, ob-gyn appointments, tests, etc.), but to enhance its nature in a more
      effectively THERAPEUTIC manner, increasing the mother-newborn unit's potential of health.

      In summary:

        -  Weekly mindfulness meet-ups

        -  Weekly yoga meet-ups

        -  Nutritional screening and further check-ups, if needed

        -  Osteopathic screening

        -  Five motivational meetings with a coach

        -  Four obstetrical appointments

        -  Obstetrical screening and check-ups up until childbirth

      The team in charge of the project is made up of gynaecologists, midwives, psychologists,
      osteopaths, nutritionists and yoga teachers, who all collaborate on a regular basis with the
      Clinica Mangiagalli.

      The project is offered to women free of charge.
