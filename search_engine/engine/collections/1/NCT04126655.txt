    
      Arfolitixorin ([6R] 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate) is a folate based biomodulator designed
      to replace leucovorin. Arfolitixorin is the key active metabolite of leucovorin (LV) and does
      in contrast to LV not require enzymatic metabolic activation. In clinical practice, LV is
      administered in the form of Calciumfolinate. A hypothesis is therefore that patients which
      are not capable of metabolizing LV could have a better antitumoral effect with Arfolitixorin
      administration. The antitumoural effect could be measured as inhibition of the enzyme
      thymidylate synthase, an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis.

      Primary objective The primary objective is to compare the properties of Arfolitixorin and
      Calciumfolinate together with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on thymidylate synthase (TS) (i.e.
      measured as thymidylate synthase inhibition) in tumour and adjacent liver tissue in patients
      with liver metastases from colorectal cancer receiving a peroperative intravenous
      administration of Arfolitixorin or Calciumfolinate.

      Secondary objectives To study safety in terms of adverse events and laboratory measurements;
      haematology and clinical chemistry.

      To explore differences in pharmacokinetics of folates and folate metabolites in plasma.

      To study gene expression in tumour and adjacent hepatic tissue and its correlation to tissue
      concentration.

      To investigate the relation between the levels of deoxyuridine (dU) in plasma with the amount
      of TS inhibition in tumour tissue, in order to evaluate dU as a surrogate marker for
      TS-inhibition.

      Study population:

      Thirty adult patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastases, indicated for surgical
      removal will be randomised.
