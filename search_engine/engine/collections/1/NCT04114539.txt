    
      This is an international, multicenter, open-label, long term extension study evaluating the
      safety of ecopipam tablets for the treatment of pediatric subjects (aged ≥6 to ≤18 years at
      Baseline) with Tourette Syndrome. Subjects who completed the Phase 2b, randomized,
      double-blind, efficacy and safety study (EBS-101-CL-001) without major reportable protocol
      deviations, and who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study will be eligible
      to participate in this study. All subjects who provide informed consent and participate in
      this study will be titrated to a target dose of 2 mg/kg/day. All participants rolling over
      from the Phase 2b double-blind efficacy and safety study will be tapered off of study
      medication to maintain the blind from that study. Subjects will complete study visits every
      month for 1 year. Follow Up visits will be conducted 7 and 14 days after the last dose of
      study medication and a Follow Up phone call will be conducted 30 days after the last dose of
      study medication.
