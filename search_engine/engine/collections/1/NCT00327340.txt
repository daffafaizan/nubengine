    
      This study was initiated as a multicenter, open-label, randomized study, with a planned
      enrollment of 40 subjects. Although two treatment arms were included in this study, no
      comparison between the arms was intended.

      Subjects with metastatic HRPC who failed first-line docetaxel therapy and required
      second-line therapy were randomly assigned to treatment with OGX-011 in combination with
      docetaxel/prednisone (OGX-011/docetaxel/prednisone) or OGX-011 in combination with
      mitoxantrone/prednisone (OGX-011/mitoxantrone/ prednisone). The study was randomized to
      assure that subjects were enrolled in each of the two treatment arms in an unbiased manner.

      Based on preliminary safety data from the first 44 subjects who were randomized to receive
      either docetaxel or mitoxantrone, the protocol was amended to enroll approximately 20
      additional subjects who would be assigned to the docetaxel/prednisone treatment arm to
      further investigate safety of the combination.
