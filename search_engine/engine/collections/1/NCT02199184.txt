    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination of dose adjusted (DA)-EPOCH +
      ofatumumab in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory Burkitt leukemia or
      relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) defined by complete response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety of this combination, the overall survival and event-free survival
      rates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive DA-EPOCH regimen comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV),
      vincristine sulfate IV, and etoposide IV continuously over 96 hours on days 1-4;
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on day 5; and prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on
      days 1-5. Patients also receive ofatumumab IV over 2 hours on days 1, 2, and 11 of cycle 1;
      on days 1 and 8 of cycles 2 and 4; and on days 1 and 11 of cycle 3 for a total of 9
      injections. Patients may receive rituximab instead of ofatumumab if their insurance provider
      does not cover the cost of ofatumumab. Patients receive rituximab IV over 2 hours on days 1
      and 11 of cycles 1 and 3 and on days 2 and 8 of cycles 2 and 4. Treatment repeats every 21-28
      days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-4 months for 1 year and
      then every 4-8 months for 2 years.
