      disease (CAD) with parameters from standard methods. Subjects will be patients admitted to
      coronary angiography due to suspected CAD. Pulse wave signals will be analyzed according to
      novelly established algorithm regarding the presence of CAD and/or myocardial ischemia. These
      results be compared to the diagnoses made by coronary angiography (primary endpoint):
      presence of minimum one coronary artery stenose >=50%. For secondary analyses, results will
      be compared to parameters form echocardiography and cardiogoniometry.
