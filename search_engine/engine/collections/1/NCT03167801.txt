      It has a key role in the synchronisation of circadian rhythms including the sleep wake cycle,
      with a peak secretion around 03:00.

      The neural pathway controlling melatonin secretion is long and transits via the thoracic
      spine. The exact level is not known, but interruption of the connection in patients with
      lesions of the spinal cord is known to occur.

      Tetraplegic patients often complain of insomnia, daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality
      but the contribution of melatonin levels to sleep quality has not been explored in large
      studies, although case reports have shown reduced or abolished melatonin secretion and
      altered melatonin secretion profiles with delayed peak secretion. Paraplegic patients report
      fewer sleep difficulties and little is known about melatonin secretion in this group. The
      investigators hypothesize that sleep abnormalities are related to abnormalities in melatonin
      secretion and that this is in turn related to the level of the spinal cord injury

      The study aims to explore the profiles of melatonin secretion in patients with spinal cord
      injuries and comparing melatonin profiles with a database of healthy volunteers. The
      investigators will further analyse the results looking at the severity of spinal cord injury
      using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and the level of the injury. Outcome measures are
      melatonin secretion profile, sleep complaints measured using the Pittsburgh scale and daytime
      sleepiness measured using the Epworth sleep scale.
