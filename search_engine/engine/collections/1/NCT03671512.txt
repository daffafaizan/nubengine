    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open, active comparator-controlled study with
      a parallel group, subject-paired design (i.e. the effect of both treatments can be observed
      in the same subject).

      Subjects must have two quadrants of their mouth that each have at least two teeth with one or
      more pockets per tooth that are 5-8 mm in depth. Subjects having more than 2 quadrants will
      have the first 2 quadrants randomized to receive two different treatments (one quadrant root
      planing and one quadrant PSR procedure) from the group of available quadrants.

      Investigators will assess the efficacy of the Periodontal Structure Repair device (PSR) as
      measured by a reduction in pocket depth.
