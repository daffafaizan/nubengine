    
      In a first phase of data collection (pre-implementation) all alarms of an intensive care unit
      population are recorded.

      In an interim period an Alarm Advisor software will be introduced to the unit.

      In a second phase (post-implementation) the same set of alarm data will be recorded.

      The "Alarm Advisor" Software can identify alarms based on criteria set by the medical staff
      and provide hints to reduce alarms and alarm nuisance (e.g. by proposing adjustments of alarm
      limits).

      The effect of reduction of recurring nuisance alarms through the implementation of the Alarm
      Advisor shall be evaluated.
