      The objectives of this clinical trial are the following:

        -  Main objective of the study: Overall response rate obtained after R-CHOP regime followed
           by Alemtuzumab consolidation as second line therapy

        -  Secondary objectives

             -  Determine the molecular complete response rate after R-CHOP regimen

             -  Determine the efficacy of Alemtuzumab in response improvement after R-CHOP regimen:
                conversion of PR to CR and of MRD+ to MRD-.

             -  Applicability (toxicity profile) of Alemtuzumab consolidation therapy.

             -  As additional objectives will be considered:

                  1. Prognostic value of several biological variables (ZAP-70 and cytogenetics)
                     having influence on the response

                  2. Response duration

                  3. Progression free survival

                  4. Overall survival
