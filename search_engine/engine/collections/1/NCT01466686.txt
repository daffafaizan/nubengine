      (LDFRT) may be used to potentiate full dose chemotherapy, decreasing the development of
      resistance found with standard doses of radiation and chemotherapy. This is a nonrandomized,
      open label, single institution phase II trial with a safety run-in to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of LDFRT plus temozolomide in patients with High Grade Glioma (to only include
      Anaplastic Astrocytoma or Glioblastoma Multiforme) previously treated with surgical resection
      followed by adjuvant radiation therapy plus temozolomide. The primary objective of the phase
      II study is to estimate response rate in patients treated with twice daily fractions of low
      dose radiation plus temozolomide chemotherapy.
