      is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open label, observational investigator initiated
      study to assess the effect on cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal heart failure (HF)
      events of a telemedicine-based comprehensive management program for patients with chronic HF
      by means of remote daily telemonitoring of signs and symptoms of HF and remote structured
      follow-up using videoconference. The organizational characteristics of the programme and the
      impact in health outcomes resulting from its implementation have been previously published.

      In this study we aim to compare the strategy of providing nurse-based structured follow-up to
      high-risk chronic HF patients through planned contacts between health care providers and
      patients and/or caregivers in the basis of face-to-face on-site encounters (usual care) or
      provide the planned care using telemedicine with the combination of remote daily monitoring
      of signs and symptoms of HF (telemonitoring) and delivery of structured nurse-based follow-up
      health care using videoconference (tele-intervention).

      The main hypothesis of the study is that daily telemonitoring of clinical variables and
      symptoms in high-risk patients with HF allows early detection of decompensations by
      decreasing the number of fatal cardiovascular events or non-fatal HF events. As a secondary
      hypothesis we assume that tele-intervention using telemedicine may help to optimise
      neurohormonal treatment and deliver appropriate education to high-risk patients with HF; and
      delivery of care in high risk patients with HF through the combination of remote monitoring
      and tele-intervention may translate into a reduction of fatal and non fatal HF-related
      events.
