      meditation technique developed and offered by the David Lynch Foundation. The technique
      involves the use of a sound (mantra) to effortlessly allow the mind to settle down to a state
      of inner calm. Meditation enables those who have learned it and regularly practice it to be
      more self-aware and respond in a calmer and more considered manner to whatever happens in
      their present experience.
