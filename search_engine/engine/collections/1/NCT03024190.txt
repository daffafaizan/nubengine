    
      In this study, 40 subacute stroke patients (duration is 3~6 months after stroke) with
      hemiplegia would be enrolled. Each stroke patient is diagnosed by a neurologist according to
      the history, physical examination, and brain imaging evaluation. These 40 patients would be
      randomly divided into a experimental or a control group. All patients in the control and
      experimental groups will both receive regular rehabilitation therapy including occupational
      therapy (OT) 3 times per week and one hour for one session OT intervention. Additionally, 15-
      min stretching exercise for upper extremity twice daily will be performed for 3 weeks in this
      study. KT intervention in the experimental group: The technique of KT for spastic wrist and
      fingers in stroke patient will be performed from the proximal interphalangeal joints of all
      fingers acted on the extensor carpal and digital muscle groups, with an anchor at the
      proximal one-third forearm. The KT will be applied for 5 days one week for 3 weeks.

      In this study, all patients in the control and experimental groups will receive the following
      evaluations before intervention, immediately post intervention, and 2-week after
      intervention: Physical examinations (modified shworth scale and Tardieu scale), Hand function
      evaluation (Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity, box and block test, and Minnesota
      Manual Dexterity Test), and Musculoskeletal sonography (sonoelastography and shear wave
      velocity). SPSS software will be used to record and analysis the collecting data.
      Investigators will analyze and compare the findings of physical examinations, upper extremity
      function assessments, and musculoskeletal sonography within and between the experimental and
      control groups before and after interventions.
