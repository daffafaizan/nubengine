      HME. This will occur as the patient presents to a regular clinic visit. Dr. Alvarez will be
      introduced to interested patients and their parent(s) and a brief discussion about the
      project will occur. If the patient and their direct family are interested they will be
      entered into the study. This will involve interviewing the patients and their direct family.
      This interview will take about 1 hour. We are interested in identifying all affected family
      members as far up the family tree as possible. We ask that the idea of the study be
      introduced to extended family members by the participating family members and then have them
      call Dr. Alvarez to set up an appointment. Each available member will be interviewed and a
      physical exam done to determine the location of osteochondromas. In addition, Xrays will be
      done to determine the location of all osteochondromas. All Xrays will be reviewed. No new
      ones will be taken unless it is part of the patient's routine care.

      To complete the genetic work up DNA analysis will be done on all available family members.
      This will entail obtaining a blood sample from each family member willing to partake in the
      study. These blood samples will be used only for the purpose of identifying abnormalities in
      the genes related to osteochondromas. The blood samples will be taken at British Columbia's
      Children's Hospital and processed there. DNA samples will be kept confidential.
