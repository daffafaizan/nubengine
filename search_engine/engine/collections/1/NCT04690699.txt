    
      For each solid tumor cancer, a Phase 1 evaluation of the safety and tolerability of PVSRIPO
      monotherapy intratumoral injections will be completed prior to initiation of enrollment in
      the Phase 2 portion of the study where the anti-tumor efficacy of PVSRIPO in combination with
      anti PD 1/L1 therapy will be assessed. The goal of Phase 1 is to verify the technical
      feasibility of injecting the relevant site(s) of disease for each solid tumor cancer of
      interest without the confounding effect of concomitant anti-PD-1/L1 therapy on interpretation
      of the data. This portion of the study will also provide a preliminary evaluation of the
      antitumor efficacy of PVSRIPO monotherapy in each solid tumor cancer of interest and inform
      future studies.

      Once a dosing regimen for PVSRIPO injections has been established in Phase 1, the Phase 2
      portion of the study will open for enrollment. In this portion of the study, patients will be
      treated with a combination of PVSRIPO and a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
      anti-PD-1/L1 therapy, the choice of which will be determined based on the solid tumor cancer
      of interest and specified in the associated tumor specific appendix. A sufficient number of
      patients will be enrolled per solid tumor cancer of interest in the Phase 2 portion of the
      study to provide evidence that the combination arm shows a clinically meaningful benefit in
      overall response rate (ORR) over anti PD 1/L1 monotherapy based on comparison to historical
      controls in a similar patient population.

      The goal of Phase 2 is to evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of PVSRIPO in combination with
      anti PD 1/L1 therapy for each solid tumor cancer of interest, and to estimate the probability
      that the observed ORR is substantially different than that predicted for anti-PD-1/L1
      monotherapy.
