      to those created by HDR brachytherapy treatment, without the use of invasive catheters. The
      radiosurgery volumes will closely be made to resemble HDR brachytherapy therapeutic volumes
      with similar dose limitation objectives to adjacent normal tissues.

      The CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System is a unique radiosurgical system capable of
      treating tumors anywhere in the body noninvasively and with sub-millimeter accuracy. The
      CyberKnife System delivers radiation using a precise targeting methodology allowing a focal
      treatment margin around the target, thus limiting the volume of adjacent tissue receiving
      high doses radiation. This in turn allows the delivery of high doses of radiation to the
      prostate over a short series of treatments.
