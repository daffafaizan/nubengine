      leukocytes as well as the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators from cells from
      normal individuals and subjects with COPD. The hypothesis is that in COPD the life-span of
      leukocytes, such as the neutrophil, is enhanced and this may contribute to inflammation, a
      prominent characteristic of this disease, by secreting and releasing inflammatory mediators.
      We also suggest that differences may exist in the sensitivity of the various leukocytes to
      different therapies.

      Leukocytes will be purified from the peripheral venous blood of patients with COPD as well as
      healthy individuals. We will then investigate the effects of novel and existing therapeutic
      agents on leukocyte survival and inflammatory mediator synthesis and release. We will also
      examine the regulation and release of enzymes known to damage lung tissue. Further studies
      will be carried out to elucidate the signal transduction pathways that lead to the
      activation, altered longevity and function of leukocytes. In other experiments ribonucleic
      acids or RNA may be extracted form leukocytes to investigate which genes are involved. The
      primary objective is to identify the mechanisms that enhance leukocyte longevity and
      inflammatory mediator and/or enzyme synthesis and release with a view to identifying novel
      targets for drug therapy.
