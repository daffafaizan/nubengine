    
      The PREMIUM Registry is a multinational, prospective, observational convenience study of the
      ED hemodynamic profiles of patients presenting with acute CHF, stroke and systemic infections
      and their potential relationship with patient outcomes. Continuous hemodynamics will be
      measured by noninvasive means using the Nexfin device and outcomes (in hospital length of
      stay, the interval development of organ dysfunction and mortality or the need for unscheduled
      medical care within the ensuing 30 days) will be captured within the registry.

      The treating ED physicians will be blinded to the hemodynamic monitoring and there will be no
      modification of the standard care that each patient receives. Hospital charts will be
      reviewed and patients/family members will be additionally called at 30 days after the
      hospital visit in order to collect any additional outcome data.
