    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and postoperative pain reducing
      efficacy of a single preoperative intrathecal administration of brivoligide injection in
      patients with a Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) score â‰¥16 undergoing unilateral total knee
      arthroplasty.

      Potential subjects will be prescreened for PCS scores of 16 or greater in advance;
      pre-qualified patients will be invited to the investigative site for informed consent and
      full screening within 30 days of randomization. Patients providing informed consent and
      meeting all study eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study on the day of surgery
      (Day 1). Safety assessments will be performed through Day 28; efficacy assessments will be
      conducted at the follow-up visits and daily via electronic diary by subjects through Day 42.
      Follow up visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42.
