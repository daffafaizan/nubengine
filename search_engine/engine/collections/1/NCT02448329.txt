    
      AZD1775 is an inhibitor of Wee1, a protein tyrosine kinase. Wee1 phosphorylates and inhibits
      cyclin-dependent kinases 1 (CDK1) and 2 (CDK2), and is involved in regulation of the intra-S
      and G2 cell cycle checkpoints.

      In in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, AZD1775 selectively enhanced chemotherapy induced
      death of cells deficient in p53 signaling. Tumor context-specific sensitization to the DNA
      damaging agents gemcitabine and platinums was observed in TOV21G (ovarian carcinoma) cell
      lines matched for wild type and knock down of p53.
