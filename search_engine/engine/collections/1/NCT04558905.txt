    
      This a non-inferiority and cross-over study, with a planned follow-up of 16 months, with 2
      intervention arms:

      Intervention 1: Patients assigned to 6 months of usual medical care model, followed by 4
      months control period, and finally 6 months of hybrid medical care model.

      Intervention 2: Patients assigned to 6 months of hybrid medical care model, followed by 4
      months control period and finally 6 months of usual medical care model.

      Specific objectives are as follows:

      Primary objectives

        1. To compare the mean disease activity of RA patients (as measured per RAPID-3), after 6
           months since study entry, between patients assigned to intervention 1 and patients
           assigned to intervention 2.

        2. To compare the RA patient´s quality of life (as measured per WHOQOL-BREF) and RA
           patient's disability (as measured per HAQ-DI) after 6 months since study entry, between
           patients assigned to intervention 1 and patients assigned to intervention 2.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. At the end of the complete follow-up period, for each patient, to compare the cumulative
           RA disease activity during the 6 months period where patients received usual medical
           care model, with the cumulative disease activity during the 6 months period where
           patients received hybrid medical care model.

        2. At the end of the complete follow-up period, for each patient, to compare patient´s
           satisfaction with usual medical care model and patient´s satisfaction to hybrid medical
           care model.

        3. At the end of the complete follow-up period, for each patient, to compare patient´s
           adherence to the usual medical care model with patient´s adherence to hybrid medical
           care model.
