      intervention for reducing stress and enhancing psychological wellbeing among Hong Kong
      adults. Prior to all study procedures, an online informed consent (with phone support) will
      be obtained from potential participants. Around 30 eligible participants will be randomly
      assigned to either the Zentangle group or the waitlist control group in a ratio of 1:1.
