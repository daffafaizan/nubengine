      obtained using Zuf Globus Ltd technology, produced in Israel and listed by the Ministry of
      Health in Italy as a food supplement. This study aims to highlight a possible role of Lifemel
      in preventing neutropenic events, as well as reducing anaemia and thrombocytopenia following
      the administration of chemotherapy in patients with a histological or clinical diagnosis of
      solid neoplasia undergoing first-line chemotherapy.
