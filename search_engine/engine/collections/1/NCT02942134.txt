      failure due to COPD and emphysema. Augmented dyspnea after use of NIV is commonly found and
      leads not only to high patient discomfort, but can also be associated with acute respiratory
      failure. This monocentric obervation trial includes patients with COPD III°-IV° (GOLD) and
      emphysema and an established long term NIV therapy. During their routine inpatient follow-up,
      we will extend the routine examinations, focussing on the vulnerable first hour after the
      nocturnal use of NIV. This includes monitoring of breath rate, heart rate, pulsoxymetry,
      trancutaneous CO2, blood pressure and capillary blood gas analysis. Sonographic measurement
      of diaphragm movement and thickness will be complemented. Subjective dyspnea will be
      documented by use of the BORG scale.

      By collecting this data, we hope to understand the pathomechanisms causing augmented dyspnea
      after NIV and thus provide information for therapeutical concepts to prevent it.
