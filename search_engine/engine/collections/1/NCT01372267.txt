      important problem that is rarely managed appropriately. The estimated rates of chronic pain
      in Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment are as high as 60%. Chronic pain is seldom
      successfully addressed in SUD treatment settings because of a limited understanding of the
      problem and a lack of effective intervention strategies. A clear and urgent need exists for
      the study of effective alternatives to the use of opiate pain medications in those treated
      for SUDs who also have pain because of: (1) the potential for abuse and diversion of opiate
      medications by patients in SUD treatment; and (2) recent evidence that untreated pain may
      undermine the effectiveness of standard treatments for SUDs.

      An important potential strategy to address this problem is the use of Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT) to manage pain and decrease substance misuse. Psychosocial interventions such
      as CBT have demonstrated efficacy for reducing pain and improving functioning for a broad
      spectrum of pain-related conditions. However, this form of treatment has not been explicitly
      tested in patients with co-occurring substance use disorders. Additionally, although pain is
      common in both men and women, most studies have lacked sufficient power to test the effect of
      interventions separately in men and women. The present intervention is designed to integrate
      CBT for pain and CBT for SUDs with the primary goal of improving pain- and substance-related
      outcomes. The investigators will test the efficacy of this modified protocol on both men and
      women in this understudied patient population.
