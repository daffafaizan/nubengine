    
      A prospective randomized trial that will be performed over the period of 1 year or until 20
      patients in each arm meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited. One arm will be treated
      with a NIR laser (ARC Lasers Gmbh, Germany) alone and another arm will have an ICG+ NIR laser
      treatment.

      FDA approved NIR lasers in the range of 810- 980nm. FDA approved ICG (Akorn, Buffalo Grove,
      IL) applied locally total application will not exceed 2.5 mg Randomization method: first five
      volunteers will start the ICG+ laser followed by five from only laser treatment group. This
      will be followed by allocating one volunteer to each study arm alternatively.

      Data to be collected: demographical data including age and gender, approximate duration of
      symptoms, culture results, SNOT 20 (QOL questionnaire) score.

      Urine test will be done to rule out pregnancy prior to study enrollment. Treatment: ICG arm-
      will be defined as local application on a pledget soaked with ICG with a concentration of
      200µg, upon removal of the pledget a NIR diode laser set at 6W with light emittance
      introduced intranasally with a 30mm diffuser fiber capable of radiating light
      circumferentially allowing the light energy to reach all treatable areas. Laser will be
      activated for 180 seconds. Assuming an approximate radius of the nasal cavity is 3mm, energy
      density will be around 200J/cm². Treatment will be repeated twice, 5-7 day apart. Cultures
      will be collected at the end of all treatments.

      Non-ICG arm: same as above but without ICG appliance. Follow up will consist of an office
      visit upon end of treatment with an additional visit scheduled two weeks later Protective
      equipment: specifically designed eye goggles, draping preventing clothes stains from the dye
