      associated with long-lasting psychosocial distress, problems in a multiplicity of everyday
      activities and overall reduced quality of life. There is increasing evidence to suggest that
      a novel behavioral intervention is a treatment of choice for executive dysfunction. However
      few studies have addressed ecological relevance: failing to take into account the significant
      impact of the complex settings of real life on executive function. More data are desperately
      needed in this area given the devastating consequences of ABI. We propose to investigate the
      benefits of two community- based interventions.
