      failure patients and the presence of sleep-disordered breathing has been associated with
      increased mortality. This study is designed to investigate prevalence and dynamics of
      sleep-disordered breathing in end-stage heart failure patients pre and post heart
      transplantation, as this topic is hardly studied yet and previous reports suggest changes in
      the entity of sleep-disordered breathing through heart transplantation. The circumstances and
      the impact of sleep-disordered breathing or residuals in heart transplant patients is not
      well understood yet and will be subject of this study.
