      donors. This process requires from four to six days of G-CSF injection and is associated with
      significant morbidity, most notably bone pain. POL6326 is associated with few side effects
      and collection of cells occurs on the same day as POL6326 administration.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of this novel agent for hematopoietic
      progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic transplantation based on the following
      hypotheses:

        1. Donors mobilized with intravenous POL6326 will require fewer collections than have
           previously been seen for donors mobilized with subcutaneous plerixafor.

        2. Healthy HLA-matched donors receiving one or two infusions of POL6326 will mobilize
           sufficient CD34+ cells (at least 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg recipient weights) following
           leukapheresis to support a hematopoietic cell transplant.

        3. IV POL6326 will result in more rapid kinetics and a higher maximum (peak) of human CD34+
           stem cells mobilized from human normal allogeneic donors compared to previous donors who
           were mobilized with plerixafor.

        4. The hematopoietic cells mobilized by IV POL6326 will be functional and will result in
           prompt and durable hematopoietic engraftment following transplantation into
           HLA-identical siblings with advanced hematological malignancies using various
           non-myeloablative and myeloablative conditioning regimens and regimens for routine GVHD
           prophylaxis.
