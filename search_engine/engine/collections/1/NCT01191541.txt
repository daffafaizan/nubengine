      of anthracycline, or intermediate/ high-dose Ara-C or As2O3 as an early consolidation, so as
      to decrease the risk of relapse.However, a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline may lead
      to cardiac toxicity, especially for children. In addition, containing Ara-C will led to more
      therapy-related toxicity. The benefit to add Ara-C to the schedules is questionable and
      remains a matter of investigation in children.
