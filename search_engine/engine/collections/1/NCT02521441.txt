      women with breast cancer who will receive chemotherapy that includes up to 4 cycles of
      epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, 100 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2, respectively. Subjects would be
      randomized to one of three arms, which were 10 mg/dose of F-627, 20 mg/dose of F-627 or
      Filgrastim, in an equal ratio on Day 1 of the study. Patients will remain on their randomized
      study drug dose and regimen for each of the following 3 chemotherapy cycles. The chemotherapy
      to be administered for chemotherapy cycles 2-4 should be the same therapy administered to the
      subject on Day1.

      Chemotherapy will be administrated through intravenous IV) injection on Day 1 of each 21-day
      cycle and be repeated every 3 weeks for up to four cycles unless a dose delay is necessary.
      Approximately 48 hours after chemotherapy completion in cycle (day 3 of the cycle), patients
      will either receive a subcutaneous (SC) injection of F-627 (either 10 mg/dose or 20 mg/dose)
      or 5 μg/kg/dose filgrastim used up to two weeks or stopped while ANC more than 5 × 109/L.

      To track ANC concentration post chemotherapy, subjects returned to their study site for blood
      draws either daily (Cycle 1) or 3 times per week (every other day; Cycles 2-4) until ANC
      levels reached ≥2.0 × 109/L, post-nadir, and then every 3 days until the next chemotherapy
      cycle.

      All subjects returned for an End of Study visit approximately 3 weeks after their final study
      drug administration (Study Day 84) and had a follow-up phone call 30 days after the last
      study drug.
