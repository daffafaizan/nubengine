      rotator cuff tendinopathy (impingement syndrome) and subsequently evaluate novel treatment
      strategies that address these mechanisms. The objectives of this application are to study the
      muscle patterns in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy as well as the effects of both
      pain and exercise on these patterns. Our first hypothesis is that pain relief from a shoulder
      injection will result in increased rotator cuff activity. Our second hypothesis is that
      patients with tendinopathy will demonstrate improved rotator cuff muscle activity following a
      six-week exercise program and that this improvement will be higher in patients that respond
      favorably to treatment. Our final hypothesis is that patients with cuff tendinopathy will
      show decreased rotator cuff activity compared to healthy subjects. The investigators plan on
      addressing these hypotheses using several novel techniques for muscle activity assessment.
