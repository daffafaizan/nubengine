      valve operations remains controversial. The current practice is both center- and
      surgeon-specific with guidelines based on non-randomized data. A prospective randomized trial
      was performed to evaluate the worth of less-than-severe FTR repair during mitral valve
      procedures.

      A single center randomized study was designed to allocate patients with less-than-severe FTR
      undergoing mitral valve surgery to be prophylactically treated + tricuspid valve annuloplasty
      (TVP- or TVP+). These patients were analysed using longitudinal cardiopulmonary exercise
      capacity, echocardiographic follow-up, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The primary
      outcome was more than mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR) recurrence with vena contracta >3mm.
      Secondary outcomes were maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and right ventricular (RV) dimension
      and function.
