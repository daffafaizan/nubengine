childhood echolalia in delayed, psychotic and neuropathologicspeech patterns.some linguistic analytical procedures andpreliminary findings from controlled tape-recordedsamples of a group of echolalicchildren are reported together with theclinical and experimental rationale for theinvestigation.  the subjects are echolalic3-yr. olds and a group of young clinical referralsrepresenting a variety of pathologicalconditions.  variables selected forstudy include the proportion of echo tonon-echo and silence, the quality and appropriatenessof the non-echoed speech, theamount of the stimulus echoed, the natureof the triggering stimulus, the deviation ofecho pattern from stimulus pattern, pitch-loudness-timevariations, and the child'schronological and mental ages.  early quantitativeresults yielded very similar echo:non-echo:silence percentages with echolaliarepresenting a mean of about 40% of theconversation of each experimental group.
