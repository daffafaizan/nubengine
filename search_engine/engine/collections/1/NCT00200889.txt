      and incomplete. The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how a form of
      neuromodulation, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation, which is non-invasive and
      non-painful, affects human brain and autonomic activity. We will accomplish this by
      integrating whole brain functional MRI (fMRI) methodologies with gastric MRI and
      physiological monitoring.

      This study will comprise 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain-gut scans and 2
      behavioral visits consisting of a nutrient drink test, all while receiving the
      neuromodulation with varying parameters. Participants will also have their heart rate,
      breathing, and gastric activity monitored during all visits.
