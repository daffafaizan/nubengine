      in different body sites (vagina, oral etc.) and that the main source of these microorganisms
      is the mother for vaginally born infants, while C-section born infants acquire most of the
      anaerobic microbial communities from other sources rather than mother's vaginal and gut
      microbiota, such as the environment.

      Specific Research Objectives will be:

        1. To investigate diversity of archaea in the vagina of healthy women in the context with
           community state types (CSTs), and compare vaginal microbiome in pregnant with
           non-pregnant healthy women.

        2. To identify the presence of archaea in different body sites (oral, gut) or body fluids
           (amniotic fluid, urine, human milk) within the perinatal microbial communities.

        3. To investigate the presence of archaea in the infant's first-days-of-life intestinal
           community, and to identify the sources of these microorganisms by using source tracking
           approach.

        4. To investigate Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) in maternal (serum, saliva, urine,
           breast milk) or intrauterine sources (amniotic fluid) as potential modifiers of the
           microbial communities in these sites.

        5. To analyze associations of maternal/ intrauterine HMOs with infant HMOs and microbiota
           (meconium and infant stool) in order to investigate vertical transmission of microbiota
           to the infant.
