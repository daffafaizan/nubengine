    
      This is a single-center, open label, two-arm phase II study of clinical activity of
      tosedostat in adult patients with MDS who have failed prior hypomethylating agent-based
      therapy. Arm A is defined as Revised International Prognostic Scoring Systems (IPSS-R) very
      low, low, and intermediate disease. Arm B is defined as IPSS-R high or very high risk
      disease. The two arms are separate and will enroll simultaneously. The dose of tosedostat
      will be 120 mg once a day continuously for each 28 day treatment cycle. Patients will be
      assessed for disease response, on average, every two cycles as defined in the protocol. If
      patient has no response as defined by the protocol after two cycles, azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SC
      or IV for 5 days may be combined with tosedostat, at the investigator's discretion.The
      primary endpoint the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tosedostat in two groups
      of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome who have relapsed after or are refractory or
      intolerant to azacitidine or decitabine. The primary endpoint for patients with IPSS-R very
      low, low and intermediate disease is transfusion independence and the primary endpoint for
      patients with high or very high risk disease is overall survival.
