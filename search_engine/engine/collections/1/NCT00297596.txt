      is still responding to the oxaliplatin at 6 cycles, the oxaliplatin may be continued with the
      trastuzumab up to 10 cycles at the investigator's discretion. After discontinuing the
      oxaliplatin/trastuzumab combination, patients should continue with single agent trastuzumab
      until disease progression.

      Trastuzumab will be administered as an 8 mg/kg loading dose by intravenous (IV) infusion over
      90 minutes on day 1 of cycle 1. Subsequent doses will be administered as a 6 mg/kg IV dose
      over 30 minutes. Oxaliplatin will be administered at a dose of 130 mg/ m2 over 120 minutes on
      day 1 of each cycle, following standard antiemetic premedications. 21 day cycles.

      For the first cycle, trastuzumab will be administered before oxaliplatin; however for
      subsequent cycles, oxaliplatin will be infused prior to trastuzumab
