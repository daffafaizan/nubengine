    
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of remifentanil conscious sedation in
      patients undergoing Electrophysiological (EP) studies for the ablation of idiopathic
      ventricular tachycardia and/or persistent frequent PVCs of non-ischemic origin.

      Remifentanil is an analgesic- synthetic opiate with an very short half life. It is rapidly
      broken down by enzymes in the blood and is ideally suited for continuous sedation. The effect
      is practically eliminated within 5 minutes after the intravenous sedation is stopped.

      You are being asked to participate in this study because you are already scheduled to undergo
      EP studies under the care of your cardiologist for the ablation of idiopathic ventricular
      tachycardia and/or persistent frequent PVCs of non-ischemic origin.
