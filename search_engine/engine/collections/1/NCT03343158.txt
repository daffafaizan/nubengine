      questions with acceptable sensitivity and false positive rate, based on the draft 11-question
      pilot tool. Using the identified questions, investigators will develop a composite screening
      tool and determine criteria that should be used for identifying children for testing with
      minimally acceptable sensitivity and false positive rates. In the second phase of the study,
      investigators will select optimal questions to create a composite screening tool and validate
      it in a similar study population. Investigators anticipate the accuracy of the tool will be
      much improved compared to the individual questions. Investigators will also assess the
      usability of the HIV Risk Screening Tool as measured by the time taken to administer the
      tool, and perceptions of its ease and simplicity.
