      technique under local anesthesia. The extent of surgery was determined based on our usual
      amounts. Before re-attaching the recessed muscle to the sclera, 5 units of botulinum toxin in
      0.1 ml of hyaline solution were, or 0.1 ml of hyaline solution alone were was injected into
      the posterior muscle belly by the surgeon who was unaware of the contents of each syringe.
