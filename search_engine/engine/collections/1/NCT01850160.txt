      arterial hypertension, the percentages of arterial hypertension control with monotherapy
      remain quite low reason why the fixed-dose combinations of drugs have been one of the most
      interesting research topics in order to achieve an appropriate control of arterial
      hypertension.

      The possibility of achieving better coverage and Blood Pressure control through a drug
      combination has leaded, on a scientific base of the efficacy of an Angiotensin Receptor
      Blockers II plus diuretic combination, to the development of a great number of combinations
      with different Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers plus hydrochlorothiazide. Yet it is
      noteworthy that despite the increasing evidence showing additional benefits in Blood pressure
      control and reduction of cardiovascular outcomes with chlorthalidone over
      hydrochlorothiazide, there is neither a great number of combinations nor studies with
      Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers plus chlorthalidone whereby the conduction of a trial
      assessing the efficacy and safety of Valsartan plus chlorthalidone in hypertensive patients
      is proposed plus the benefits of combination therapy that include, among others, the greater
      efficacy with lower doses of each individual component as well as reduction in occurrence of
      adverse events directly related with lower drug doses.With this treatment schedule it is
      expected to obtain higher control of blood pressure values and greater percentage of
      patients.
