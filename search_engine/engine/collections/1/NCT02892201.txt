      residual disease following radiation with or without systemic therapy for squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Hypothesis: The use of pembrolizumab in patients with residual disease following radiation
      with or without systemic therapy will lead to an enhanced overall response rate due to
      treatment-related priming of the immune response.

      When initially registered, the study used a follow up assessment of 12 weeks. However, the
      actual study aims for the primary and secondary outcomes were updated to 168 weeks. The
      primary completion date was also updated to reflect the primary outcome timeline.
