      advised not to engage in any cognitive or physical exertion while symptomatic. More recently,
      however, concussion has been described as a physiological injury affecting both the heart and
      autonomic nervous system, and patients suffering from prolonged concussion-related symptoms
      and deficits have been encouraged to begin aerobic exercise as part of their concussion care.
      While intensive exercise too soon after concussion has been associated with delayed recovery
      and used to justify prolonged periods of rest, recent studies have shown that controlled,
      sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise may aid recovery by improving autonomic balance and
      cerebral blood flow auto-regulation after concussion. This study will randomly assign
      pediatric patients with concussion to a treatment group in which they will complete
      sub-symptom threshold aerobic exercise or to a placebo group in which they will complete a
      standardized stretching protocol. All participants will have routine visits that consist of a
      physical examination and exercise test until the intervention ends at recovery or 1-month
      post-randomization.
