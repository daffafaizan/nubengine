      that utilizes an adaptive directional microphone system with an automatic gain control noise
      reduction program. This hearing aid feature is intended for adult hearing aid users and its
      potential benefits of speech, vocabulary and listening development in pediatric users has not
      been investigated. Here the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of OSN programming in
      pediatric hearing aid users (6-12 years of age) diagnosed with a symmetrical sensorineural
      hearing loss in the mild to moderately-severe range. The investigators used a within-subjects
      study design with pre- and post-comparisons. All participants were fit with bilateral Oticon
      OPN™ behind-the-ear hearing aids with the OSN feature enabled. Participants will undergo
      standard audiometric diagnostic testing and will be fit with the hearing aids by a licensed
      clinical audiologist. Participants are required to wear the hearing aids full time (at least
      6 hours per day average) during the duration of the study. The evaluation measures will
      include speech recognition testing in controlled background noise and the Speech, Spatial and
      Qualities of Hearing Scale questionnaire (completed by parents/legal guardian). Testing will
      be performed within a week of the hearing aid fitting (pre-intervention) and two months post
      fitting (post-intervention).
