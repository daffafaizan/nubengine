      mechanical infertility is hysterosalpingography (HSG). Several reports have shown that this
      common procedure is associated with moderate pain, i.e. around 5 on a visual analog scale
      (VAS)of 1-10. It is therefore important to find modes for pain reduction for HSG. According
      to a report on sonohydrosonograpy, a similar technique using sonography, insertion of media
      warmed to body temperature into the uterus significantly reduced the pain during the
      procedure compared with media at room-temprature. The use of room-temperature media is the
      routine in our institution, as well as in many others. A comparison between the media at
      different temperatures has not been reported so far.

      We plan to perform a prospective trial in which patients referred for HSG will be randomized
      to the procedure using either warmed or room-temperature media. we will asses pain levels
      using VAS during the procedure.
