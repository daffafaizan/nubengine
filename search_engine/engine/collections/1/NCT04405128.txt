      injury on brain tissue motion has yet to be explored. Preliminary brain tissue motion
      measurements from a small number of patients suggest that brain biomechanics may be disturbed
      in the presence of injury. This study combines Transcranial Tissue Doppler ultrasound with
      brain MRI to establish whether analysis of brain tissue motion provides clinically useful
      information for emergency diagnosis and monitoring of acute brain injury.
