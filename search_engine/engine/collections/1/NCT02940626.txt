    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, single-dose, placebo-controlled study of ASN100 for the
      prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in mechanically ventilated subjects who are heavily
      colonized with S. aureus. This will be a global study conducted at approximately 65 sites to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ASN100.

      Eligible subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will be screened by semi-quantitative culture of an endotracheal aspirate (ETA) to identify
      those who are heavily colonized with S. aureus (3+ to 4+). Upon determination of eligibility,
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups, ASN100 or placebo.
