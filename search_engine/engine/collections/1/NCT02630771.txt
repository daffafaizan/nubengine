      dentoalveolar pain disorder (PDAP) or widespread in the head/face/jaw such as with
      temporomandibular disorders (TMD). PDAP pain manifests in a tooth that usually underwent root
      canal treatment or in the site formally occupied by such tooth, while TMD pain is usually
      reported over the preauricular area, jaws and temples. These commonly comorbid disorders have
      a significant impact on the individual and society. Their mechanisms are poorly understood
      with evidence suggesting deficient pain modulation and abnormal brain features. PDAP and TMD
      patients, when compared to controls, have abnormal sensory/pain processing as well as brain
      structural and functional differences.

      This proposal will investigate pain modulatory mechanisms and brain functional and structural
      characteristics using multiple MRI modalities in PDAP patients with and without TMD. All
      measures from patients will be compared to painfree controls. This knowledge will support
      better understanding of mechanisms involved in PDAP and will support development of
      mechanistic-based clinical treatments for the patients the investigators serve. Findings from
      these investigations will likely contribute to our understanding of other chronic pain
      conditions.
