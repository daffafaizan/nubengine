      contains both hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate. This trial utilises iAluRil® for the
      same clinical indication as it is listed for on the ATGR, i.e. to re-establish the
      glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layers of the urothelial vesical tissue in cases in which their loss
      can cause problems, such as recurrent urinary tract infection in neurologically intact
      populations, but in a specific and vulnerable patient population (acute SCI). The trial will
      demonstrate the safety and feasibility of providing a series of iAluRil® treatments in early
      acute SCI, and provide an indication of effectiveness to prevent early urinary tract
      infections (compared to current standard infection control), informing researchers about the
      suitability of conducting a large randomised controlled clinical trial with this
      intervention.

      An 'Intervention post-UTI' arm for eligible inpatients and outpatients with SCI who have
      significant recurrent UTIs, will allow equivalent data collection and observations, informing
      researchers about a trial to reduce UTI recurrence during sub-acute/chronic SCI.
      Additionally, these patients will self-administer iAluRil® treatments providing data on the
      feasibility of SCI patients self-administering iAluRil® treatments.
