      hypogonadism in HIV-infected MSM population. Age-matched non-HIV infected MSM group will be
      used as comparison group. We will also determine the risk factors associated with male
      hypogonadism (age, duration of HIV infection, comorbidities, BMI, ART use). Correlation will
      be made between serum testosterone levels and sexual function, vitality, exercise capacity,
      mood, and bone mineral density.
