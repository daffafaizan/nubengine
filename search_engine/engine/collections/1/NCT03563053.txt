    
      This is an international (North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia), multi-center,
      prospective, open-label treatment study, designed to continue to provide the study medication
      to all patients who completed 12 months of treatment (including those treated with placebo)
      in the IEDAT-02-2015 trial, completed the study assessments, do not present safety
      contraindication to continuation of treatment, and provided informed consent. The study aims
      to collect information on the long-term safety and efficacy of the trial treatment. Patients
      meeting all selection criteria will receive monthly infusions of EDS-EP (dose range of ~14-22
      mg DSP/infusion). If this dose of EDS-EP is not tolerated, the patient should be discontinued
      from the study. During the study, long-term efficacy assessments will be performed every 6
      months, while safety parameters will be assessed at each monthly visit.

      The ICARS, EQ-5D-5L and the CGI-C/S will be administered by a site rater. All patients
      enrolled in this study will have participated in Study IEDAT-02-2015, and there will be no de
      novo enrollment of new patients.

      The Principal Investigator will ask all patients who meet the above requirements, and
      determine their interest in continuing to receive treatment with the study medication in a
      new protocol. The Principal Investigator will then determine the eligibility of the patients
      on the basis of his/her clinical judgement of patients' status and their safety.
