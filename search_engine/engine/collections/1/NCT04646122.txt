      history, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure
      (IOP) measurement, gonioscopy, dilated fundoscopic examination, stereoscopic optic disc
      photography, and automated perimetry using Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA
      Standard 24-2). Only subjects with open angles on gonioscopy were included.

      One eye of each subject will be scanned by a high-speed 1050-nm-wavelength swept-source OCT
      instrument.

      OCT is providing measurements of the RNFL thickness, ONH, as well as the inner macula for the
      assessment of glaucoma progression.

      The split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm will be used to
      compute 3-dimensional optic disc angiography. A disc flow index was computed from 4
      registered scans.

      Evaluation of progressive changes of the optic disc and RNFL will be based on event-analysis
      and/or trend-analysis. In event analysis, progression is defined when the difference between
      the baseline and follow-up measurements of the parameter of interest is greater than its
      test-retest variability (or the reproducibility coefficient). In trend analysis, regression
      analysis is performed between the parameter of interest and time.
