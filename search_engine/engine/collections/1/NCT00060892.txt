    
      The primary goal of this study was to assess the safety of AMG0001, detect potential
      angiogenesis response to AMG0001 treatment and to correlate these changes to clinical
      endpoints dependent upon improvement in tissue perfusion for relief of CLI complications. The
      objectives of this study were to:

        -  Assess the overall safety of different exposure regimens of AMG0001 in the CLI subject
           population.

        -  Evaluate the potential effect of angiogenesis associated with different doses and dose
           regimens of AMG0001 as measured by improvement in tissue perfusion.

        -  Evaluate the activity of different exposure regimens of AMG0001 to benefit clinical
           outcomes of reduction of amputation and mortality, wound healing, rest-pain reduction
           and improvement in subject's ability to function without adverse consequences on quality
           of life.
