      at Wills Eye Hospital. Informed consent will be obtained prior to the office visit. Patients
      will complete a satisfaction survey with a few additional questions about themselves and
      their vision. Electronic health records (EHR) will be used to collect race, gender, age,
      glaucoma diagnosis, current and prior treatments, timing of appointment and care, visual
      acuity and field data, and distance to patient's home. Additional information captured will
      include weather, time of day, day of week.

      In addition to completing the questionnaire subjects will be asked to provide their name and
      date of birth. Trained research staff members will use this information to find patients on
      the EHR system. A research assistant will later abstract information from the patient's EHR.
      This information will be tagged to the survey by a unique identifier, but all patient
      identity related information will be removed, including name and date of birth. Patients will
      be made aware that research staff will be retrieving their protected health information (PHI)
      for the purpose of this study through the consent form.
