      for patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). It is recognized that
      diagnostic algorithms for pulmonary embolism (PE) may not be as effective and safe in
      patients with malignancy, due to the low specificity of D-dimer test in that setting. A
      diagnostic algorithm that could safely rule out PE in patients with malignancy without
      performing computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) could nonetheless improve patient
      care.
