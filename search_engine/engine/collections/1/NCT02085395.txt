    
      An open phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of topical SR-T100 gel in the
      treatment of human cutaneous cell carcinoma in situ (Actinic Keratosis and Bowen's Disease).
      The primary efficacy endpoint defines as the proportion of patients whose lesion size reduced
      at least 75%. The secondary efficacy endpoints include complete clearance rate as the
      proportion of patients with no clinical visible AK/BD lesions in the treatment area, partial
      clearance rate as the proportion of patients at least a 75% reduction of AK/BD lesion size in
      teh treatment area, and histological response rate as the proportion of patients with biopsy
      proven clearance of AK and BD in situ. Safety was evaluated by clinically significant changes
      occurring from baseline to the end of the study by observing physical examination, vital
      signs, laboratory assessments and AEs.
