      vivo will be achieved in patients with rapidly progressing or advanced HIV disease (RAD)
      using antiretroviral combinations inhibiting viral replication at distinct sites of action.
      Antiretroviral combinations are chosen with the hypothesis that simultaneous change to as
      many new agents as possible is necessary to maximally reduce plasma viral load.

      In this open-label, multicenter study patients are randomized into 1 of 4 groups based on
      prior antiretroviral experience. Each regimen consists of 4 drugs that include a combination
      of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (stavudine, lamivudine, zidovudine,
      didanosine, zalcitabine) plus nevirapine (NVP), nelfinavir (NFV), or ritonavir (RTV).
      Patients must be naive to at least 2 of the 4 drugs in the regimen and at least 1 of the
      novel drugs must be NVP, NFV, or RTV.

      Prior to randomization to a NFV- or RTV-containing regimen, patients are stratified by HIV
      RNA (greater than or equal to 50,000 or less than 50,000) and must able to receive 2 or more
      novel drugs.
