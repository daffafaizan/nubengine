      who met the early escape criteria in Study GED-0301-CD-002, or subjects who completed Study
      GED-0301-002 or GED-0301-003, may be eligible for this study. Primary objective is to assess
      long-term safety of GED 0301. Additional efficacy and patient reported outcomes will be
      explored.

      There are 5 possible treatment groups for GED-0301-CD-002 Subjects (Groups 1-5). There are 3
      possible treatment groups for GED-0301-CD-003 subjects (Groups 1-3). Treatment is assigned
      based on clinical improvement achieved or not achieved from the core GED-0301 study.

        1. continuous GED-0301 160 mg once daily for 12 weeks, followed by alternating placebo once
           daily for 4 weeks with GED-0301 160 mg once daily for 4 weeks, through Week 208;

        2. alternating GED-0301 160 mg once daily for 4 weeks with placebo once daily for 4 weeks,
           through Week 208;

        3. alternating placebo once daily for 4 weeks with GED-0301 160 mg once daily for 4 weeks,
           through Week 208;

        4. continuous GED-0301 40 mg once daily through Week 208;

        5. alternating placebo once daily for 4 weeks, followed by GED-0301 40 mg once daily for 4
           weeks, through Week 208.

      The GED-0301-CD-003 trial was not initiated; the GED-0301 program was terminated; no safety
      findings were noted.
