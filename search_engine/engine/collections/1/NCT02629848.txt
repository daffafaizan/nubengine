      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin to treat people who have Stage IV or recurrent
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study will look at progression free
      survival, overall survival, overall response and safety.

      The study enrolled 401 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient
      and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Motesanib 125 mg + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient + Paclitaxel + Carboplatin

      All participants were asked to take 5 X 25 mg motesanib tablets or placebo at the same time
      each day throughout the study. All participants received treatment with paclitaxel 200 mg/m^2
      intravenous (IV) and carboplatin IV on Day 1 of each 3 week Cycle for up to 6 Cycles. After 6
      Cycles participants could continue to receive motesanib or placebo alone for up to 36 months.

      This multi-centre trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to 36 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, plus a final
      visit 30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
