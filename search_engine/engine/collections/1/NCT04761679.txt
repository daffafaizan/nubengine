      patients with COVID-19. The N95 mask covers their nose and mouth with a tight seal. Nurses
      wear the mask for more than 8 hours per day, as a result they are at increased risk for skin
      injury on the nasal bridge. Mepliex is foam dressing which has been used to prevent pressure
      injuries to the skin. This study will evaluate if using Mepilex or band-aid on the nasal
      bridge of the nurses who wear the N95 for more than 8 hours decreases the potential for skin
      injury. In addition, the investigators will test if the Mepilex or band-aid also maintains
      the seal of the mask. Maintaining the seal is important to ensure that the nurse is not
      exposed to the virus. The investigators will be working with nurses who do not directly take
      care of COVID-19 patients to ensure the safety of all participants.
