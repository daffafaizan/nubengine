      screened with failed sit-to-stand ability after discharged from the National Taiwan
      University Hospital medication ICU 48hours will be enrolled in the study. In the assignment
      procedure, the participants will be stratified by a stabilized sitting posture and unable
      stabilized sitting posture, and then the participants are randomized to the experiment group
      and control group. The experiment group will accept regular care and an extra STS bedside
      care protocol once a day for two weeks or discharged within two weeks. In contrast, the
      control group will accept regular care.

      All participants will be followed for one year after ICU discharge at 5 time points:48 hours,
      14day,1, 3, 12 months. A comprehensive functional evaluation (success rate of sit to stand,
      scores of FSS-ICU, scores of MRC muscle scale, muscle strength at knee extensors, scores of
      the barthel index for activities of daily living (ADL), scores of instrumental activities of
      daily living scale (IADL), the walking distance by the 6-minute walk test, numbers of
      sit-to-stand repetitions in 30 seconds, rate of bed-bound status, rate of mortality) will be
      performed. Estimated 206 participants will be enrolled and followed one year after ICU
      discharge.
