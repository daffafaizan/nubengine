      China, about 40,000 patients suffered from end stage renal disease treated with PD, and
      almost of them followed continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of the
      expensive price of import automated PD (APD) machines although the higher clearance of
      solute, lower rate of PD related peritonitis and higher quality of life (QOL) in patients
      treated with APD compared those with CAPD. Now, cheaper domestic APD machines ( PDGO, Fuzhou,
      China) are accessed to the ESRD patients in china, but the efficacy and safety of which are
      not fully clear. This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study.
      Patients in treatment group will receive APD while those in control group will receive CAPD
      for 8 weeks. After followed-up for 8 weeks, the adequacy of PD, residual kidney function ,
      peritoneum function and QOL of patients will be evaluated.
