      Participants will be screened for early signs of heart failure using cardiac ultrasound
      (cardiac transthoracic echocardiography or cardiac TTE). Those participants who have early
      changes in the structure and function of the heart and may be at future risk for heart
      failure will be enrolled into the study. Additional imaging of the heart will occur using
      cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI). Following baseline studies, participants
      will either receive a medication called sacubitril/valsartan or placebo for 6 months.
      Sacubitril/valsartan in an FDA approved medication currently being used for heart failure
      with reduced ejection fraction in the general population, and we are evaluating whether this
      medication could be useful to reduce HIV-related heart failure with preserved ejection
      fraction. Sacubitril/valsartan is an oral medication taken twice daily that may block
      aldosterone hormone and increase natriuretic peptide hormone. Overall, this study aims to
      investigate the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on measures of heart disease related to
      inflammation, structure and function of the heart muscle in HIV using cardiac TTE and cardiac
      MRI imaging as well as blood markers of heart failure and inflammation.
