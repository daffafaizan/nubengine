      showed some efficacy to eliminate head louse infestation but that the treatment regimen was
      inadequate to kill all lice or louse eggs. This study has been designed to compare two
      different application regimens that have been shown effective in vitro.

      A planned total of 120 patients who, following examination, are found to suffer from active
      head lice infestation will be recruited to the trial. The patient will be treated with 10%
      cocamide DEA lotion using the appropriate treatment regimen according to the randomization
      code from a pre-prepared listing in balanced blocks of 12.

      Group 1: 10% cocamide DEA is applied directly to dry hair, the excess water evaporated off
      using a hair dryer and is then left for 8 hour/overnight before washing off with clean water.

      Group 2: 10% cocamide DEA is applied directly to dry hair, the excess water evaporated off
      using a hair dryer and is then left for 2 hours before washing off with clean water. A follow
      up treatment is given after 7 days.

      Treatments will be applied by experienced investigators throughout the study. Assessments
      will be made by other investigators unaware of the treatment regimen used.

      After treatment (day 0), follow up assessments will be performed on days 4, 8,11 then again
      at day 14 after which they will leave the study. Any adverse events or side effects from the
      treatments will be monitored during the study.
