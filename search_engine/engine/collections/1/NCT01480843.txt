      these problems patients, even those managing their diabetes for many years, find it difficult
      to continue with complicated insulin schedules. This may lead to errors in treatment and poor
      glucose control. Simplification of treatment has been found to the decrease risk of low blood
      glucose, a very dangerous condition at this age. In a previous study, the investigators found
      that simplifying treatment did not cause the blood sugars to rise out of control. In this
      study, the investigators plan to simplify insulin treatment and monitor for low glucose
      episodes with help of a continuous glucose monitor and A1C (measure of average glucose
      control over 3 months). The investigators will simplify the treatment by adding glucose
      lowering medications that you can take by mouth, in addition to the injection of long acting
      insulin called glargine.
