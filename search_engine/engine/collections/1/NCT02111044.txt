      previous treatment with somatostatin analogues. For patients who had previously received
      medical therapy for acromegaly a washout periods before study entry of 3 months for
      long-acting formulation of somatostatin analogs, 2 weeks for octreotide sc, 2 months for
      pegvisomant and/or cabergoline must be foreseen.

      Each patient will be randomized and wll remain in the study for about 6 months, and they will
      attend a visit every two weeks.

      The patients will be treated for 4 months in a total, in particular every month of treatment
      will be followed by a washout period of 2 weeks.

      At each month of treatment the patients will receive one of the four treatment as reported
      below:

      Octreotide 100 mcg sc three times daily (t.i.d) for 4 weeks, ITF2984 500 mcg sc twice a day
      (b.i.d) for 4 weeks, ITF2984 1000 mcg sc b.i.d for 4 weeks, ITF2984 2000 mcg sc b.i.d for 4
      weeks. Patients will be randomized using a 4 way crossover design to receive ITF2984 or
      octreotide at each treatment month. Each patient will receive all of the four treatments
      overseen in this study.
