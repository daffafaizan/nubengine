    
      Methods: randomised phase I/II international trial with a parallel group design, open to
      participants and investigators but blind to laboratory personnel, in healthy volunteers.

      Vaccines strategies: 70 volunteers will receive 3 DNA-C vaccinations and 1 NYVAC-C
      vaccination; 70 volunteers will receive 2 DNA-C vaccinations and 2 NYVAC-C vaccination.

      DNA-C: 2x2ml intra muscular in right and left vastus lateralis; NYVAC-C: 1 ml intramuscular
      in non-dominant deltoid.

      Main outcome:

        1. the presence of CD8/CD4+ T cell responses defined according to internationally agreed
           criteria for evaluation of IFNgamma ELISPOT assays:

             -  in response to env plus at least one of the gag, pol, nef peptide pools,

             -  at weeks 26 or 28;

        2. the safety parameters.

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  cellular responses,

        -  antibody responses,

        -  all grade 1 and 2 adverse events,

        -  all events including those considered unrelated.

      Sample size: 140 volunteers

      Enrollment period: 9 months

      Patient's participation duration: 78 weeks

      Study duration: 27 months
