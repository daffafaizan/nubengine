    
      This is a 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine the effects of dietary
      fiber in treating functional childhood constipation. The addition of fiber is anticipated to
      allow children to have more normal stool consistency and frequency.

      All participants will be asked to take a snack bar twice daily and will be randomized in a
      1:1:1 ratio to fiber 1, fiber 2 or placebo snack bar groups. All participants will be asked
      to take low-dose Miralax to avoid worsening of constipation in all groups.
