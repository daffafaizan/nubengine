      While dietary modification and increased levels of physical activity remain steadfast
      recommendations, alternative strategies related to supplementation remain an interest for the
      general populace and medical communities. A potential objection to the use of dietary
      supplements is that they often contain stimulants designed to increase metabolism. However,
      consumers and health practitioners alike are wary of such formulae; hence, the continued
      investigation of non-stimulant supplements is warranted. Therefore the aim of this study is
      to examine a novel weight loss formula with and without common stimulants on anthropometry
      and indices of cardiovascular disease risk.
