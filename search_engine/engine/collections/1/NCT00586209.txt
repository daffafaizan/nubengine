      parallel-group,study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral L-glutamine therapy for
      patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle β°-thalassemia who are at least 18 years old with
      focus on the aspect of exercise endurance. In this study, the patients will orally take
      L-glutamine or placebo twice daily, and clinical and hematological parameters will be
      monitored. The adverse events,especially those attributable to L-glutamine therapy, will also
      be monitored.

      The data obtained will be essential in understanding the role of L-glutamine in therapy for
      sickle cell anemia and sickle β°-thalassemia.
