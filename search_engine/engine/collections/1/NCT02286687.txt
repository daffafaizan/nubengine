      I. To determine whether the PARP inhibitor talazoparib achieves clinical benefit (complete
      response [CR], partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD] > 24 weeks) in metastatic or
      inoperable locally advanced or locally recurrent cancer patients who have somatic mutations
      or deletions of BRCA1 or BRCA2, mutations or homozygous deletions in other BRCA pathway
      genes, and germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA 2 with cancers other than breast or ovarian
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of talazoparib in this patient population.
      (Across-indication) II. To determine baseline molecular markers (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA],
      ribonucleic acid [RNA] and protein) or scores (e.g., microsatellite instability positives,
      and somatic mutation burden) that may predict clinical benefit. (Within-indication) III. To
      determine pharmacodynamic (PD) markers in tumor, blood and plasma that may predict outcome.
      (Within-indication) IV. To determine concordance of BRCA1/2 alterations in archival tissue
      and pre-treatment biopsies. (Within-indication) V. To determine concordance of genomic
      alterations in tumor and circulating free DNA. (Within-indication) VI. To evaluate the
      progression free survival (PFS) in patients. (Within-indication) VII. To evaluate the
      duration of response (DOR) in patients. (Within-indication) VIII. To evaluate the overall
      survival (OR) in patients. (Within-indication)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks for 1 year.
