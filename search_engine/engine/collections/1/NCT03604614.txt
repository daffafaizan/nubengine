      gastric cancer with severe local progression or distant metastasis is more common.Gastric
      cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis has an extremely poor prognosis,with a median survival
      of less than 6 months.Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) is currently a
      treatment for malignant tumors in the abdominal cavity and prevents tumor recurrence and
      metastasis.Studies have shown that hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy
      (HIPEC) has good clinical efficacy in the prevention and treatment of peritoneal metastasis
      of gastric cancer and its associated malignant ascites.Therefore,we conduct a single-centre
      randomized controlled trial to explore the safety and feasibility of HIPEC in the treatment
      of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis. The metahnism of HIPEC is taking
      advantage of the difference in temperature sensitivity between cancer cells and normal cells.
      Perfusion of the abdominal cavity with a chemical fluid of the appropriate temperature can be
      performed. Suitable high temperatures can directly kill tumor cells.It is generally believed
      that the optimal temperature for the treatment of tumors is 42.5°C to 44°C.In this study,we
      set the temperature 43°C. Paclitaxel is a novel broad-spectrum antitumor drug,which has a
      unique anti-cancer mechanism.We use Paclitaxel as peritoneal hyperthermic perfusion
      chemotherapy drugs.The chemotherapy is SOX(Teggio and Oxaliplatin),.The primary endpoint is
      PFS. Secondary endpoints are one-year OS、canversion rate and ascites assessment. A phase III
      study PHOENIX-GC trial had finished enrollment,and the conclusion was the median OS 17.7 and
      15.2 months respectively for IP and SP.The primary analysis did not show the statistical
      superiority of the IP regimen.The sensitivity analysis IP considering the imbalance of
      ascites, suggested clinical efficacy of IP PTX in gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.
      For this reason,we conduct a trial to explore the safety and feasibility of HIPEC in the
      treatment of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.
