      followed in the university pediatric rehabilitation clinic. Cerebral palsy risk factors and
      demographic information will be obtained from the database.

      Cerebral palsy subtypes classified according to The Surveillance for Cerebral Palsy in Europe
      (SCPE) classification into four groups: spastic (unilateral and bilateral), dyskinetic
      (dystonic and choreoathetoic), ataxic/hypotonic, non-classifiable. Cerebral palsy risk
      factors will be primarily divided into 4 as preconceptional, antenatal, intrapartum and
      neonatal risk factors. Then, risk factors in the data will be distributed to the appropriate
      risk factor group.

      The data will be classified according to date of birth, divided into 3 groups: those born
      before 2000, those born between 2000-2010, and those born after 2010. Changes in cerebral
      palsy risk factors will be investigated at 10-year intervals.
