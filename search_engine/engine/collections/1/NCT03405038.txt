      risk. Patients receiving prone position Under acute respiratory distress syndrome appear to
      be particularly vulnerable. This retrospective study is designed to compare the risk of
      catheter colonization that could be induced or worsened by prone position. Knowing that,
      prone position is increased into the care acute respiratory distress syndrome since few
      years. Unfortunately, no study has examined the prone position impact on catheter-association
      infection in these population.
