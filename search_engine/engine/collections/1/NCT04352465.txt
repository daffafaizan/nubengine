      reaction that can be harmful and worsen the severity of the clinical condition. Thus, the use
      of MTX-loaded nanoparticules in patients with acute lung injury secondary to COVID-19 aims to
      decrease the exacerbated inflammatory reaction leading to a decrease in cell damage caused by
      this inflammatory process in patients.

      The study will be divided in 3 phases:

      Phase A (n=4): IV administration of 20 mg of MTX-loaded nanoparticles. Four doses of
      Investigational Product (IP) will be administered, once per week. If patients show clinical
      improvement after 2nd or 3rd administration, the next phase will start.

      Phase B (n=12): IV administration of 30 mg of MTX-loaded nanoparticles. Four doses of
      Investigational Product (IP) will be administered, once per week. If patients show clinical
      improvement after 2nd or 3rd administration, the next phase will start.

      Fase C (n=26): IV administration of 40 mg of MTX-loaded nanoparticules. Four doses of
      Investigational Product (IP) will be administered, once per week.
