      response in patients with relapsed or refractory WM. This will study the effect of single
      agent LBH589 on response in these patients. Efficacy measures will include both objective
      clinical measurements and investigator-reported outcomes. Response and time to event analyses
      will follow the criteria set forth in the International Waldenstrom consortium
      recommendations. Prior to the start of the study, investigators will assess disease and
      perform a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.

      Response will be assessed after 2 cycles. If patients have stable disease or response, then
      they will continue on therapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity, being assessed
      every cycle until the sixth cycle and then every 3 months. Patients who show progression
      after 2 cycles will come off therapy and undergo event monitoring every 3 months. All
      responses will be assessed by M-protein quantification and immunofixation from serum and IgM
      monoclonal protein level. In addition, BM biopsies will be done at baseline, at the end of
      cycle 6 and at the end of all therapy. The protocol was amended because of concerns of
      toxicity to allow a starting dose of 25 mg; 12/36 (33%) patients were enrolled on the 25 mg
      dose.
