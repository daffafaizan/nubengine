      changes of gonadotropins towards reduced levels, and in some women a re-acquisition of normal
      menstrual cycle. Furthermore, an abrogation of menopause-related depression, amelioration of
      hot-flashes and improvement of quality and duration of sleep has been reported.

      Myo-inositol is involved in several aspects of human reproduction. Elevated concentrations of
      myo-inositol in human follicular fluids appear to play a positive function in follicular
      maturity and provide a marker of good quality oocytes. Nevertheless its positive role in PCOS
      women is a consequence of a defect in the insulin signalling pathway (inositol-containing
      phosphoglycan mediators) that seems to be primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin
      resistance
