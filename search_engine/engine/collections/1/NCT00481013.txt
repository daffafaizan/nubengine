      Each visit entails a stay of two days and one night at the General Clinical Research Center
      (GCRC).

      Subjects who live within driving distance will be allowed to participate in the study without
      an overnight stay through two consecutive outpatient visits. All subjects will be evaluated
      at two screening visits 2-4 weeks apart to determine eligibility for participation. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized to receive VPA or placebo for the first six months. At the
      six-month visit, patients will be evaluated and crossed over to the other regimen.
