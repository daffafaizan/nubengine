      nitrate supplementation improves strength , endurance, and power measurements in male
      CrossFit athletes. Specifically, the strength measurements will be taken using isometric and
      isokinetic tests on the Biodex dynamometer. Endurance will be measured using time trials for
      a 2000 meter rowing test and the "Fran" CrossFit workout. Finally, power will be analyzed
      using the Wingate cycle test.

      The treatment group will receive 1 serving of f potassium nitrate KNO3- (N) (8 mmols NO3-).
      The placebo group will receive 1 serving of the nitrate-free placebo (PL) potassium chloride
      (8 mmol KCl).

      The participants will complete two three-day baseline testing, with a six-day supplementation
      period following each round of baseline testing. Following the first six-day supplementation
      period, there will be a 10 day washout period before the second baseline testing begins.
