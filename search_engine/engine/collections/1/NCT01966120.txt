      parallel-group, phase III trial with BF-200 ALA and placebo in seven centres in Germany. A
      total of 94 patients were screened in this study; 87 were randomized (55 patients received
      BF-200 ALA, 32 received placebo). Patients received one PDT. If residual lesions remained at
      3 months after treatment, PDT was repeated. Illumination was performed with the PDT lamp
      BF-RhodoLED.
