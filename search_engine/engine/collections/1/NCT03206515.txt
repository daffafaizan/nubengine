      management of >20mm kidney stones. Microchannel percutaneous nephrolithotomy (Mini PCNL)
      which takes nephrolithotomy channel size less than or equal to 18, was first used in the
      treatment of children with kidney stones in 1997, then gradually applied to adult, aims to
      achieve the similar stone clearance rate as the standard channels, at the same time, reduce
      the complications. At present, the use of percutaneous renal surgery in our country is more
      than 18F plastic peel-away sheath, with the access sheath with a suction-evacuation function
      was first used by Guohua Zeng and so on. But there is still a lack of high quality evidence
      of Evidence-based medical evidence to compare the two kinds of sheath for the safety and
      effectiveness. Therefore, this study provides a reliable theoretical basis for the choice of
      the sheath for the treatment of 2-5cm size Kidney, and ultimately benefit patients with 20mm.
