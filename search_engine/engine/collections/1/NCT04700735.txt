    
      The geko™ device has a wide range of clinical applications including the post-operative
      management of edema.

      Although many short-term acute studies have been completed using the device, little clinical
      data has been collected on the effect of geko™ use in current standard care pathways for
      edema management on patient outcomes during follow-up of up to twelve months.

      As the manufacturer of the device, Firstkind Limited has an obligation to collect safety and
      performance data to comply with current regulations (MDR EU 2017/745 Annex XIV, Part B).
      Consequently, there is a need for an observational study to provide data to demonstrate
      patient benefit and regulatory compliance.

      The geko™ Cross Therapy Registry - Edema (gekoTM CTR - Edema) study will prospectively and
      systematically collect clinical data on all device variants used in standard care pathways
      for edema management allowing for the monitoring of patient outcomes during a follow-up
      period of up to twelve months. This study forms part of the overall Post-Market Clinical
      Follow-up strategy for the device and Post Market Surveillance (PMS) to support device and
      performance.
