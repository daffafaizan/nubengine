      intervention and may increases the risk of wound complications and infection postoperatively.
      Effective treatment of edema, therefore, is of great importance. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the efficacy of the multi-layer compression therapy and of the A-V Impulse
      compression (AVI) in reducing ankle- and hindfoot edema as compared to the standard treatment
      with ice.
