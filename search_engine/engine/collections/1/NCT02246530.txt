      progress to surgical correction despite conservative measures. These include physical
      therapy, medication management and minimally invasive procedures such as subacromial bursa
      injections and intra-articular injections with steroids. Recently a popular treatment of
      common musculoskeletal injuries (including tendinopathies) has emerged throughout the US and
      has been utilized worldwide for many years with good empiric evidence known as Platelet-Rich
      Plasma (PRP) injections. In partnership with UAB Orthopedics and Radiology, the UAB
      Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation aims to compare PRP to corticosteroid
      injections for patients with partial rotator cuff tears or tendinopathy. Outcome measures are
      ultrasound imaging, pain and disability over the course of 6 months.
