      and genioplasties. Those plates allowed for the slot principle to be performed during
      orthognathic surgery. Mandibular slotplates for bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO)
      were recently designed. The aim of the study is to evaluate their clinical usefulness and the
      applicability of the slot principle with these plates in BSSO.
