      I. To assess safety of the combination of pioglitazone (PIO) and TKI in CML subjects who
      experience a loss of major molecular response (MMR) following a first TKI discontinuation.

      II. To assess survival without loss of MMR following a second TKI discontinuation in subjects
      who achieve or maintain < molecular response (MR)^4.5 with the combination PIO and TKI
      administered for at least 6 months.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pioglitazone orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients also start
      or continue the same TKI therapy at the pre-discontinuation doses. Courses repeat every 28
      days for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 3 months, every
      3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.
