      irreversible process. DR is not only the overall progress and the level of blood sugar, and
      blood glucose fluctuations more closely, is the key to a smooth hypoglycemic delay DR
      progression.Diabetes control and complication trail(DCCT) study shows that even though
      glycemic control was no significant difference in blood glucose fluctuations ,DR also have a
      significant difference. In this study, three different glucose-lowering program for: (A) a
      single oral anti-diabetic drugs, (B) basal insulin and oral anti-diabetic drugs, (C) premixed
      insulin and oral anti-diabetic drugs for comparison. Focus on the stability and the impact of
      these three programs hypoglycemic long-term prognosis of the DR, and thus affect the
      molecular mechanisms of DR-based exploration of glucose fluctuations, to optimize blood
      glucose solutions, lower blood sugar steady, slow progression of DR ultimate clinical
      purposes.

      The multi-center study is to cooperate, enrolled 600 cases of type 2 diabetes, observe the
      effects of different solutions on blood sugar glucose fluctuations and retinopathy, a total
      of 5 years of follow-up. This will be the first at home and abroad to compare the incidence
      of hypoglycemic effect programs on DR large multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical
      studies, clinical practice will optimize the treatment of type 2 diabetes theoretical and
      evidence-based medicine.
