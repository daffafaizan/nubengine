    
      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to determine the safety of treatment with
      doxazosin in cocaine-dependent volunteers by examining hemodynamic and subjective effects of
      administration of ascending doses of cocaine (0, 20mg, and 40mg) and a placebo dose during
      treatment with doxazosin.

      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the effect of doxazosin on the pharmacokinetics of
      intravenously administered cocaine; To determine effects of treatment with doxazosin, as
      compared to placebo, on subjective effects produced by administration of cocaine or placebo.
