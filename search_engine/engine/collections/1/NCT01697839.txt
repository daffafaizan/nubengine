      studies reveal as many as 1/3 may have abnormal electrophysiological examinations. Baseline
      neuropathic abnormal findings are exacerbated by many myeloma treatments, especially
      bortezomib, thalidomide, and to a lesser extent lenalidomide. Several studies suggest that
      vitamin D supplementation may help reduce the symptoms of neuropathy.In this prospective
      study, we will investigate the relationship between vitamin D and PN among MM patients
      treated with either bortezomib or thalidomide. The study consists of a screening period of up
      to 14 days, followed by a single assessment visit to evaluate vitamin D levels, incidence and
      severity of PN, neuropathic pain, and markers of depression. Patient charts will also be
      utilized to assess the frequency of skeletal-related events.
