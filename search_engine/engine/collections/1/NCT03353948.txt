      particular when PCOS is linked to obesity. Obese PCOS has poor IVF outcomes associated with
      impaired oocyte and embryo parameters and morphology. The purpose of this pilot prospective
      study was to investigate the effect of the novel medical therapy (combination of metformin
      and liraglutide (COMBI)) in the specific infertile obese PCOS population. GLP-1 has been
      investigated in regulation of reproductive system in animal models. Current observations
      suggest that it directly regulates kisspeptin and GnRH expression and that ovaries express
      GLP-1 mRNA. In obese PCOS, GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide provided positive effects on
      weight reduction and glucose homeostasis
