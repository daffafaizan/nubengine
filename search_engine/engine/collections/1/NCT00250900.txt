      diagnosed with AOM during a one year period in an urban pediatric emergency department,
      utilizing diagnostic recommendations from contemporary evidence-based guidelines. The
      objectives of the study were to determine whether treatment of AOM using a "Wait and See
      Prescription" (WASP) significantly reduces use of antimicrobials compared with a "Standard
      Prescription" (SP) and to evaluate the effects of this intervention on clinical symptoms and
      adverse outcomes related to antibiotic use.
