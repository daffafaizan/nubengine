    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety of infusing cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65-specific cytotoxic
           T-lymphocytes (CTL) generated using pp65 peptides in patients who have undergone
           allogeneic stem cell transplantation and have persistent CMV infections.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize CMV pp65-specific immune responses in terms of cytotoxicity and cytokine
           production pre-infusion and then periodically thereafter.

        -  Characterize the levels of CMV DNA in recipients of CMV pp65 CTL and observe whether the
           CTL infusion has any impact on the level of virus.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 cytotoxic T-cell infusion on day 1. Patients may
      receive up to 2 more doses at least 2 weeks after previous dose.

      Blood samples are collected and analyzed by quantitative CMV PCR, chromium release assays for
      CMV pp65-specific cytotoxicity, and immunophenotype for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD19, and CD45
      RA/RD. Intracellular cytofluorometry is used to assess IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-Î³
      production by CD4 and CD8 CMV-specific effector cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.
