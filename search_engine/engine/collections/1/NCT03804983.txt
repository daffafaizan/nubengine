    
      This trial aims to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using MyTDI to determine insulin
      parameters on the Closed Loop Control (CLC) Artificial Pancreas (AP) system t:slim X2 with
      Control-IQ technology for use both at ski camp and at home in adolescent patients with type 1
      diabetes.

      Once deemed eligible, participants and their parent(s) will be trained on the use of the
      Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump with Control-IQ technology and the study Dexcom G6 system.
      Participants will then use the this study equipment with their home insulin parameters at
      home for at home for 5 days. Participants will then come to the ski resort to participate in
      a 72-hour ski admission. Upon arrival, each participant will be randomized to either the
      using the Control-IQ system with their usual insulin parameters during the ski study and the
      at-home 5 days at home study or using the MyTDI insulin parameters during the ski study and
      the at-home 5 days at home study. Study duration for each participant will require 5 study
      visits over about 2 weeks.
