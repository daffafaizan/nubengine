      in speech, limb control, balance, and gait. Individuals with degenerative cerebellar ataxias
      are at a high-risk of falling and have progressive impairments in motor coordination
      resulting in unsteadiness in gait and posture. No definitive treatment options are available
      for ataxia. There is therefore a critical need to identify strategies to improve motor
      function and reduce falls in patients with ataxia. Physical therapy has been demonstrated to
      improve motor function in subjects with cerebellar ataxia, but the gains in performance
      following balance training are modest. Sensory augmentation is a technique of augmenting or
      replacing compromised sensory information. In the context of sensory-based balance
      impairments, a sensory augmentation device provides cues of body motion that supplement an
      individual's remaining intact sensory systems. The investigators hypothesize that sensory
      augmentation may improve the effectiveness of balance training in individuals with ataxia,
      and aid in greater improvement in motor function than traditional physical therapy alone.
      Sensory augmentation has been shown to decrease body sway during real-time operation in a
      laboratory setting in individuals with vestibular deficits and peripheral neuropathy, and
      general age-related declines in balance performance. Preliminary results suggest that
      persistent improvements in balance performance exist over time periods of hours to days
      following a small number of training sessions. This study aims to characterize the effects of
      sensory augmentation in individuals with ataxia during static and dynamic balance exercises
      over a period of twelve weeks of in home balance training with and without vibrotactile
      sensory augmentation.
