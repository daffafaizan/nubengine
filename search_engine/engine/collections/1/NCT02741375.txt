      physiopathologically the cessation of intracranial circulation. BD is a clinical diagnosis
      that can be made with various clinical tests. However, in order for BD to be definitely
      established, clinical tests performed initially need to be repeated after 24 h or to be
      confirmed by corroboratory tests. In addition, the obligation to confirm BD using
      corroboratory tests varies in current guidelines from country to country but has been
      eliminated except for certain specific circumstances. However, considering the adverse
      effects on patients awaiting donor and organ donations of the time lapse between initial and
      repeat tests in order to confirm BD, more rapid confirmation of definite BD is commonly made
      using corroboratory tests.

      This study was planned with the hypothesis that this non-invasive technique using NIRS
      technology can be an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of BD.

      This study was performed with patients with suspected BD in emergency departments and
      intensive care units and was intended to evaluate the effectiveness of cerebral oximetry as
      an auxiliary diagnostic tool in patients with suspected BD.
