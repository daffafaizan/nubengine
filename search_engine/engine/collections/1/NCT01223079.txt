      LH in this process is more controversial. FSH is associated with stimulating growth and
      recruitment of follicles while LH is associated with the selection of dominant follicles
      destined for ovulation. We will use an open, prospective, cross-over study to compare the
      safety and efficacy of two different treatment protocols for controlled ovarian stimulation
      in egg donors.

      20 participants will undergo two cycles of stimulation. The first one will be with r-hFSH
      though the cycle and the second with r-hFSH then r-hLH. The participants will have 1 month
      rest cycle between the treatment cycles. r-hFSH doses will be adjusted according to patient
      response. r-hLH dosing will begin when there are 2 follicles greater than or equal to 14mm in
      diameter. The does will be 300IU/day and continue until the day of r-hCG administration.
