      After consent, infants with estimated gestational age between 26-36.6 weeks or with expected
      birth weight 1000-2500 grams will be randomized to resuscitation per standard protocol or to
      resuscitation per standard protocol and plastic bag. The intervention group will be placed
      into a plastic bag covering the body and back and top of head (excluding face) prior to
      drying the body's surface. Resuscitation efforts continue per standard of care. The infant
      will remain in the bag through the admission process until his/her axillary temp is in the
      range of 36.5- 37.5 degrees Celsius. At this time, the bag will be discontinued and
      discarded. Standard temperature control will be continued per nursery standard. Skin-to-skin
      contact between mother and baby is not excluded; however, the infant will remain in the
      plastic bag. Infant's axillary temperature will be measured per nursery standard after
      discontinuation of plastic bag. The control group will receive standard of care
      thermoregulation. Secondary measures (i.e. blood pressures, glucose levels, weight gain,
      observation for respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pneumothorax,
      sepsis, seizures, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, pulmonary
      hemorrhage, and death) will be recorded in both groups.
