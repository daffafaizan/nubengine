      Early myocardial reperfusion with either of thrombolytic therapy or primary percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PPCI) is the most effective strategy for reducing the size of a
      myocardial infarct and improving the clinical outcome. Although this process can restore
      blood flow to the ischemic myocardium, it can induce injury. This phenomenon termed
      myocardial reperfusion injury can paradoxically reduce the beneficial effects of myocardial
      reperfusion. The pre-clinical study in animal models of acute myocardial infarction suggests
      that lethal reperfusion injury accounts for up to 50% of the final size of a myocardial
      infarct.

      Remote ischemic conditioning uses brief ischemia and reperfusion of a distant organ to
      protect the myocardium. In animal study, remote ischemic postconditioning seems to be more
      effective than local postconditioning in experimental myocardial infarction.BÃ¸tker et al. has
      reported remote ischemic preconditioning before hospital admission increase myocardial
      salvage in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether remote ischemic per-conditioning (RIPC)
      can reduce late infarct size in patients with STEMI treated with PPCI within 12 hours of
      symptoms onset. To test this hypothesis, we will randomize patients into PPCI + RIPC or PPCI
      alone. We will evaluate marker of reperfusion injury using contrast cardiac magnetic
      resonance image.
