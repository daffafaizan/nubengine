      prostate cancer that when dutasteride is given during the regrowth phase (off-phase) of
      intermittent therapy, that tumor growth is inhibited and that survival is improved. We have
      also shown that testosterone is a more potent inducer of certain tumor suppressor androgen
      response genes than dihydrotestosterone. In this murine model, we showed that use of a
      5-alpha reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) resulted in significant hyperinduction of the U19
      tumor suppressor androgen response gene during the regrowth phase of treatment. In the
      current clinical trial, we will determine if use of dutasteride in men with advanced prostate
      cancer during the off-phase of intermittent androgen ablation therapy will also result in
      hyperinduction of these tumor suppressor androgen response genes. Gene expression will be
      measured in tumor tissue obtained by prostate biopsies during the off-phase when the
      testosterone level has normalized. PSA levels will also be measured to determine the PSA
      doubling time during the off-phase to determine the effect of dutasteride on PSA kinetics.
