    
      This is an observational, prospective, monocentric study aiming at verifying the feasibility
      and safety of post-SCS HOPE in the setting of our liver transplant program.

      20 consecutive patients with written informed consent will be enrolled. They will be
      transplanted with grafts from extended criteria BDD or from DCD donors preserved by post-SCS
      HOPE.

      The HOPE procedure will be performed in our operating room after regular procurement,
      transport and back-table preparation. University of Wisconsin Machine Perfusion Solution
      (UW-MPS) will be used. Two pumps will provide dual pressure-controlled perfusion through the
      portal vein and the hepatic artery. Portal flow will be continuous and will be adjusted to
      keep portal pressure below 5 mmHg. Instead, arterial flow will be pulsatile and will be
      regulated to maintain arterial pressure between 25 mmHg and 30 mmHg. The perfusate will be
      oxygenated with the goal of a partial Pressure of Oxygen (PO2) of 50-70 kilopascal. The
      perfusate temperature will be kept between 4°C and 12°C by a heat exchanger. pH, PO2 and
      partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PCO2) of the perfusate pumped to the graft and drained
      from the vena cava will be monitored. HOPE will be maintained for 3 to 4 hours.

      Patients will be followed-up for at least 1 year according to a scheduled timetable.

      Data about HOPE and transplant procedure, about donors and recipients' characteristics and
      about patients' follow-up will be collected in a dedicated electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)
      according to Good Clinical Practice.
