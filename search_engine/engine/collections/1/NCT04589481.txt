      intended to relieve or eliminate bad breath. The main aim of the study is to determine the
      effectiveness of the candies on the subjective perception of bad breath. The secondary
      outcome of the study is to investigate whether there is actually a decrease in volatile
      sulphur compounds (VSC) in the exhaled air and also a decrease in bad breath during
      organoleptic measurement.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the different candies can relieve or
      eliminate bad breath, both subjectively and objectively.
