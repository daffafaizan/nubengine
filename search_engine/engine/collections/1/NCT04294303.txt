      will be randomized to receive usual care (i.e. they will get the current standard care for
      patients with heart failure) or usual care and participation in the iGetBetter program.
      Participant will complete a questionnaire in the hospital about their quality of life.
      iGetBetter group will be given a Bluetooth-equipped scale, blood pressure cuff, and a tablet
      with a data plan. Participant will check their weight and blood pressure at home daily, using
      the equipment provided. This information will be sent via the internet to iGetBetter's web
      server, where the data will be temporarily stored. The data will be monitored by the
      physician researcher. If their blood pressure is high (e.g. greater than or equal to 140/90
      for two days in a row) or they gain a significant amount of weight (e.g. 2 pounds in two
      days), the study team will be automatically notified. A member of the study team will alert
      participant cardiologist and the cardiologist will have the option to make any
      recommendations, such as contacting the subject to schedule an office visit.

      Total participation in this study will last 45 days after patient is discharged from the
      hospital.

      Regardless of the assigned group, participant will be asked to complete two questionnaires
      after 45 days. A member of the research team will contact participant by phone to complete
      these questionnaires. One of these questionnaires will investigate their quality of life; the
      other will assess how participant feel the care they have received has affected their health.
      Patients assigned to the iGetBetter group will also complete a third survey about their
      satisfaction with the program.
