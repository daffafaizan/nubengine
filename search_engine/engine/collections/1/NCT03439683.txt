      including snapshots of mechanical ventilator waveforms to assess the knowledge, attitudes and
      practice of physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists working in the ICU and caring for
      patients under mechanical ventilator about patient-ventilator asynchrony. The survey is
      web-based and will be sent for health professionals working in the ICU of the participating
      centers. All data will be treated anonymously with the intent of identifying knowledge gaps
      and inadequate practice that could be remediated by continuous medical education initiatives
