stable strontium in human bone: geographical and agedifferences in the united kingdom and theircorrelation with levels of strontium-90a re-assessment has been made of published data of other workers on sr and90sr in human bone.  in different parts of great britain the mean ratio ofstable sr to ca in adult human bones rangedfrom 240 to 475ug/g.  extreme valueswere found even as close as 40 miles apart (carlisle v. westmorland).perinatal levels of stable sr were correlated with adult levels.  an estimateof placental discrimination may be derived from the ratio, perinatal level:adult level of about 0.7.the concentration of stable sr in bones of children from 2 to 5 years old ormore was not demonstrably different from that of adults except in one area,carlisle.  with the striking exception of london and south-east england thechange from perinatal to adult levels occurred in the 2nd year of life: therewas no particular change during the first 9 months or so.  in london andsouth-east england the pattern of change with age was quite different: therewas a progressive rise in sr level from shortly after birth to the end of the1st year by which time adult levels were reached.  it is concluded thatgeographical differences need to be taken into account when makingphysiological deductions about turnover of bone salt from changes with age inthe level of stable sr.when children in the south-east of england and the rest of the united kingdomwere compared, there seemed to be a broad inverse correlation between levels ofstable sr and of 90sr.detailed analysis of perinatal results from one area suggested that the levelof stable sr in bone was somewhat higher in summer than in winter and somewhathigher in anatomically normal babies than in babies dying with gross congenitaldefects.  90sr showed the seasonal change only.
