      generation platelet concentrate and is defined as an autologous leucocyte-and platelet-rich
      fibrin biomaterial.Platelet-rich fibrin membrane consists of a fibrin 3-D polymerized matrix
      in a specific structure ,with the incorporation of almost all the platelets and more than
      half of leucocytes along with growth factors.It enhance the stabilization and
      revascularization of the flaps and grafts.

      Bioactive silica graft (Novabone dental putty )is being used for regenerative procedures is a
      premixed composite of bioactive calcium -phospho-silicate particulate which is composed
      solely of elements that exist naturally in normal bone (ca,p,na,si,o) and an absorbable
      binder which is a combination of polyethylene glycol and glycerine.Treatment of intrabony
      defects with bioactive silica graft has led to clinically and statistically significant
      probing depth reduction ,relative attachment level gain and radiographic osseous defect fill.
