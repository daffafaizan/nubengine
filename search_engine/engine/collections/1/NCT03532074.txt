    
      Patients with symptomatic rectosigmoid endometriosis requiring laparoscopic surgery are
      included in the study.

      Before surgery, bowel symptoms are assessed using validated questionnaires
      (Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom Questionnaire and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index).

      Indocyanine green is administered through peripheral line. A near-infrared (NIR) camera-head
      enables real-time direct visualization of bowel perfusion before and after the removal of the
      rectosigmoid nodule. Rectosigmoid tract perfusion is assessed before and after the removal of
      the nodule. To estimate the vascularization, a scale with a score between 0 and 4 is used.

      After complete removal of rectosigmoid nodule, the post-operative follow-up will be the same
      as usual after intestinal endometriosis surgery. Postoperative bowel symptoms are evaluated
      using the same questionnaires.
