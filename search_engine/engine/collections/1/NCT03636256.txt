    
      In this clinical trial, subjects with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) or
      muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), will receive NanoDoce. Subjects will be stratified
      into two treatment groups, Group 1 (NMIBC) and Group 2 (MIBC). All subjects will receive
      NanoDoce injected into the index tumor resection site on the bladder wall, immediately
      following transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), followed by an initial
      NanoDoce intravesical instillation.

      Once the TURBT resection site is healed (approximately 1 month), Group 1 (NMIBC) subjects
      will proceed to a 3-month Induction period (6 weekly NanoDoce intravesical instillations,
      followed by 6 weeks of rest). After the Induction period, following confirmation of
      non-recurrence, Group 1 subjects will proceed to a 3-month Maintenance period (3 weekly
      NanoDoce intravesical instillations, followed by 9 weeks of rest).

      After NanoDoce direct injection and the initial intravesical instillation, Group 2 subjects
      will proceed to institutional standard of care and will not receive Induction of Maintenance
      intravesical instillations.
