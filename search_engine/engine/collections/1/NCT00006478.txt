        -  Determine the humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with follicular
           non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with autologous lymphoma-derived idiotype vaccine with
           keyhole limpet hemocyanin plus sargramostim (GM-CSF).

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients in the
           post-transplant setting.

        -  Determine the changes in quantitative bcl-2 in the blood and bone marrow of these
           patients before and at various times after the series of idiotype vaccines.

      OUTLINE: Vaccinations begin at day 100 or up to 6 months after hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation. Patients receive autologous lymphoma-derived idiotype vaccine plus keyhole
      limpet hemocyanin subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC is administered on
      days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 doses, followed 12 weeks later by the fifth
      and final dose.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
