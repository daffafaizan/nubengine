      underrepresented in previous studies. The pattern of use and efficacy of tolvaptan in
      real-life clinical practice are currently unknown.The objective of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of tolvaptan in cirrhotic patients with hyponatremia. The secondary objective is
      to evaluate the short- to intermediate-term safety of tolvaptan in cirrhotic patients.This
      will be a phase IV, open-label, prospective cohort study for 7 days. Although not mandatory,
      study subjects are encouraged to undergo follow-up assessments at 1 month.Subjects will be
      evaluated at designated time points after initiation of therapy. The primary efficacy
      endpoint is the proportion of subjects with normal serum sodium level (135-145 mmol/l) on day
      7. The secondary efficacy endpoints are serum sodium level, change in sodium level from
      baseline, quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), change in body weight, edema, renal function, mortality
      and liver-related complications on day 7 and day 30.
