      administered low-dose IL-2 therapy to monitor the improvement of clinical and laboratory
      parameters to explore its efficacy and to observe changes in immune cell subsets and
      cytokines. One million units of rhIL-2 was administered subcutaneously five days every week
      for 4 weeks and then twice a week for 8 weeks. All patients were followed up for 3 months
      after treatment.
