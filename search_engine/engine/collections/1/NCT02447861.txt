      3, and people with 3q29 duplication syndrome have an extra part of their chromosome 3.
      Sometimes babies are born with a deletion or duplication of part of human chromosome 3, even
      though their parents have an intact chromosome 3. This is called de novo (or new)
      abnormalities.
