      ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide followed by peripheral blood stem cell support in
      patients with small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the rate and duration of response in
      these patients after this treatment. III. Determine the progression free and overall survival
      of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive 4 courses of intensive
      chemotherapy consisting of ifosfamide IV over 24 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day
      1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered
      subcutaneously beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood cell counts recover. Courses
      repeat every 14 days. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected after course 1. PBSC
      are reinfused on day 3 of courses 2 and 3. Patients who experience a complete response
      receive prophylactic cerebral irradiation on day 71. Patients are followed every 2 months for
      5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
