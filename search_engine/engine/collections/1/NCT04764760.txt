      herein tested Cooper's paradigm, which holds that abdominal pressure exceeding abdominal wall
      resistance causes hernia, by incorporating the Tensiflex mesh prosthesis which is a modified
      version of mesh prosthesis of Stoppa technique in the surgical treatment of patients with
      hernia. The study was 2-phased: the first phase involved the pre-peritoneal implantation of a
      bi-layered mesh for anatomical replacement of the damaged fascia. The second phase involved
      the implantation of the bi-layered Tensiflex mesh prosthesis for definitive and seamless
      augmentation of tensile strength in the myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud.

      Eighty-three percent of our patients consumed analgesics for 3 days (3% reported no pain on
      day 3); however, by day 5, 86% reported pain intensity scores lower than 5. The median number
      of lost workdays was 7. Most importantly, the primary endpoint of 100% recurrence-free
      outcomes was met, as were the secondary endpoints (minimal pain, morbidity, and loss of
      workdays).
