      IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain human cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
      modified to prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement fixation.
      Abatacept is a selective co-simulation modulator that inhibits the co-stimulation of T-cells.
      Abatacept is currently approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is useful in symptom
      reduction and delaying the progression of structural damage.

      RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease. With the introduction of biological
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (biologics), the options for the treatment of
      RA have dramatically changed. Abatacept is currently the only biologic to be available in
      both, a subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) formulation. The efficacy and safety profile
      of IV-Abatacept has been well established in the last years and clinical trials comparing
      SC-Abatacept with IV-Abatacept have clearly demonstrated an equal efficacy and safety
      profile. Importantly, switching from IV- to SC-Abatacept appears to be associated with a
      persisting good efficacy of Abatacept and no increase of adverse events (AE). On the other
      hand, however, switching from SC- to IV-Abatacept has not been the subject of clinical
      trials.

      This Phase IV study is aimed at reviewing both the transition from weekly SC- to a single
      IV-Abatacept but also the return to weekly SC treatments after a 4 week break. Holiday
      seasons can present a major problem to RA patients treated with weekly subcutaneous
      biologics, including SC-Abatacept. Therefore an evaluation into the use of IV-Abatacept
      treatment to cover a 4 week break may present an acceptable treatment alternative for this
      patient population.
