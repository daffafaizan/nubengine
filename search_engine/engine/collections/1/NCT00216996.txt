      synthesis in burn patients, resulting in a glutamine-depleted status, which compromises liver
      function, including glutathione status, proline and arginine homeostasis and whole body
      protein balance (1). The purpose of this study is to directly quantify glutamine / glutamate
      kinetics in relation to glutamine / glutamate disposal and whole body amino acid balance, by
      using stable isotope tracers [1-13C, 15N]leucine and [15N2]urea.

      We hypothesize that the enrichment of amino acid mixtures with glutamine will attenuate
      overall body nitrogen catabolism and better maintain proline and arginine homeostasis.

      The purpose of this study it to 1) investigate the effect of glutamine supplemented total
      parenteral nutrition (TPN) on whole body metabolic and disposal rate of glutamine, and its
      rate of de novo synthesis in severely burned patients and 2)explore the impact of glutamine
      supplementation on whole body protein turnover, studied with L-[1-13C, 15N}-leucine, and on
      the metabolic homeostasis of urea cycle.
