      collateral pathways, surgical revascularisation is the most successful therapy to improve
      cerebral haemodynamics, and to reduce the risk of subsequent stroke. Surgical procedures for
      moyamoya disease can be classified into three categories: direct bypass, indirect bypass, and
      combined bypass. Although surgeons have their own experience choosing the recipient
      vessels,no standard has been established based on a worldwide consensus.

      Intraoperative ICG angiography using Flow800 software and multimodal neuronavigation
      (structure combined with perfusion MRI sequence) can be used to assess the real-time cerebral
      blood flow velocity and perfusion of local brain tissue, which is contribute to choose a
      recipient vessels with relative low cerebral blood flow velocity and perfusion.

      Therefore,the PBM study in our institution is designed to compare the direct bypass surgery
      with multimodal neuronavigation with traditional direct bypass procedure alone in preventing
      any ischemic event afterwards after cerebral revascularization surgery in adult ischemic MMD
      patients.
