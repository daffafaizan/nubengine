    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with 5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin,
      oxaliplatin, and Avastin will cause colorectal tumor cells to shrink or disappear. The study
      will also determine the safety of these drugs when given together and the quality of life of
      the patients who are enrolled in the study.

      It is thought that these drugs will be better tolerated if they are chronomodulated, i.e., if
      they are given at certain times of day rather than as a continuous infusion.
