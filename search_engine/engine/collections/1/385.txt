4159. detection of heart shunts by means of i 125external scintillation detection of a pure dilutioncurve originating in the right ven-tricle has been pursued by investigators for manyyr.  the use of the soft photonsof 125 i offers an improved method of determinationby allowing excellent collimationthrough 2 mechanisms  (1) a small half value layerof 2 cm in tissue, and (2) uni-directionality, in part due to all-or-none photoelectricabsorption of these photonsas compared with the pluridirectionality due to comptonscatter in the case of 131 i.in 30 normal individuals, externally detected dilutioncurves from the right heartventricle and arterial dilution curves obtained by arterialpuncture are compared.five hundred microcuries of 125 i are injected into anantecubital vein.  the amountof radiation absorbed from a 500 uc dose in an adult of70 kilos is 1000 to 2000mrads when injected in the form of 125 i iodide.  the useof 125 i orthoiodohippu-rate is advised due to its short biological half-period andthe integrated whole-bodyradiation exposure is decreased 100-fold in comparisonwith the 125 i iodide.  theshape of the right heart curve is very similar to the arterialdilution curve with a13   5% excess of counts originating outside the right ventriclearea.  the descendingsegment of the right ventricle curve has a minimum count rateof only 12   2% of thepeak of the curve as compared with the arterial curve of 102.5%.  a mean t 1/2of the descending down slope of the right ventricle is 1.520.45 sec. for the rightheart curve and 2.4   0.65 sec. for the arterial curve.the clinical usefulness of thisprocedure in 20 patients with atrial septal defects and 9patients with ventricular sep-tal defects is analyzed.  it seems possible to perform selectiveright-heart radiocardio-graphy by means of external precordial detection of 125 i.  themethod is simple andreproducible.
