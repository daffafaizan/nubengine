      the stimuli: their orientation and/or color, the existence of binocular suppression, etc.

      In different blocks, stimuli will be manipulated in different ways to characterize basic
      aspects of visual processing. For example, the contrast, color, and/or spatial layout of
      stimuli will be varied.
