      I. To test the hypothesis that there is high level of concordance between the electrophoretic
      mobility profile of microsatellite biomarkers in circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid
      (ccfDNA) versus in primary tumor tissues in patients with colorectal carcinomas displaying
      microsatellite instability.

      II. To test the hypothesis that changes in the electrophoretic mobility profile of
      microsatellite biomarkers in liquid biopsies from patients with colorectal carcinoma
      correlate with therapeutic responsiveness measured based on Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      III. To determine whether microsatellite alleles generated as a result of microsatellite
      instability detectable in liquid biopsy specimens from patients with colorectal carcinoma
      represent the entire cancer cell population or only a subset of cancer cells differentially
      affected by genomic instability.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo collection of blood samples to evaluate microsatellite instability via
      serial liquid biopsies at baseline, then every 6 weeks and at progression or 9 months.
