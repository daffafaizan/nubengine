      pressure, increased abdominal obesity (gain in fat around the region of the stomach), and
      insulin resistance. Insulin is the hormone that your body produces to decrease the levels of
      sugar in your blood. A person that is insulin resistant needs more insulin to decrease blood
      sugar levels than a normal person does. Insulin resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes, which
      is one of the most common illnesses in the United States.

      There is evidence pointing to a relationship between insulin and testosterone in men
      (testosterone is the male sex hormone that is produced in the testes). As men get older their
      testosterone levels decrease while their weight and insulin resistance tends to increase. The
      purpose of this research study is to learn more about the details of the relationship between
      insulin and testosterone. A clearer understanding of this relationship can have an important
      impact on public health due to the high rate of health problems associated with diabetes,
      obesity, and heart disease.

      We are looking for men between the ages of 50-75 with the metabolic syndrome to participate
      in this research study. Participation in this study involves taking medication and/or placebo
      (a placebo looks exactly like the study medication but contains no active drug), blood tests,
      muscle biopsies, and imaging scans. This study involves outpatient visits. Subjects are paid
      up to $500 for completing the study.
