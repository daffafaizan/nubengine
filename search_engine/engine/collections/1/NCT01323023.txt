      over a two-year period. We will: 1) aggregate de-identified data and 2) analyze the
      aggregated data. We will not identify or recruit study subjects, administer surveys to
      patients, or conduct any interventions with patients or practices. The individual research
      networks will submit only de-identified data to a central data repository for subsequent
      analysis by us. Individual research networks will submit their own protocols for review by
      their IRBs in order to collect patient-specific data, conduct interventions, and submit
      de-identified data to our central repository.

      By combining data from funded projects we will be able to answer questions that individual
      projects would not be able to answer. The analysis will use the combined set of data to gain
      statistical power sufficient to test hypotheses of interest, determine the distribution of
      responses to the selected measures in patients in primary care practices, assess the impact
      of types of interventions, compare the impact of different types of interventions, determine
      if these measures can be used routinely, and conclude how useful, if at all, the selected
      measures were in Prescription for Health projects. Statistical analysis will include basic
      descriptive statistics and distributions of scores at baseline and follow-up and more complex
      hierarchical linear modeling, which seeks to understand effects in multi-site studies (across
      sites or groups of sites). We will not directly evaluate specific research network
      interventions, but will assess them as part of larger groups. This study will report only
      aggregated results and will not name individual primary care practices or research networks.
