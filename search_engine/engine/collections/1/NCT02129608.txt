    
      This study is being done to find out how effective Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT - Erchonia®
      Zerona™ 2.0 Laser) is compared to Lorcaserin (Belviq®) in helping overweight people reduce
      their weight gain - especially in the central body region. Subjects will undergo 2 screening
      visits in which the investigators will take their medical and weight concern histories; and
      if found eligible, they will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) 12 weeks of LLLT, 2) 12
      weeks of Lorcaserin, and 3) 12 weeks of a combination of both Lorcaserin and LLLT. Full study
      participation will last approximately 6 months and consists of 10 visits- 9 clinical and 1
      phone call. During this study subjects will be provided with weight prevention counseling and
      be asked to complete 3 additional fasting blood draws. There will be one urine pregnancy test
      (for females only) at the beginning of the study.
