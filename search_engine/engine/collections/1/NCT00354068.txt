        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity, if attainable, of
           imatinib mesylate in combination with temozolomide in patients with malignant glioma.

        -  Characterize the safety and tolerability of imatinib mesylate, including acute and
           chronic toxicities, in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of temozolomide on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of imatinib mesylate
           at each dose level.

        -  Evaluate the impact of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug (EIAED) coadministration on
           the PK of imatinib mesylate using a population-based PK approach.

        -  Evaluate the antitumor activity of imatinib mesylate plus temozolomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate. Patients are stratified
      according to concurrent enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital,
      carbamazepine, fosphenytoin, primidone, oxcarbazepine) (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-8 and oral temozolomide
      once daily on days 4-8. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined.

      On days 1 and 8 of course 1, blood is drawn for pharmacokinetic studies.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
