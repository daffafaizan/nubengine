      the study were selected from 59 stroke patients and randomized into two groups; BTX-A
      injections and exercise in BTX-A Group (n=15), and BTX-A injection and exercise, additionally
      with dry needling in BTX-A+Dry needling Group (n=15). All patients underwent 200 U BTX-A
      injections in biceps brachii muscle under sonographic guidance. Patients who were included in
      BTX-A+Dry needling Group underwent dry needling for 4 times in total following BTX-A
      injection, as the first one being administered immediately after the BTX-A injection, and the
      remaining three with a three-day interval (3rd, 6th and 9th days after BTX-A injection).
      Stretching exercises for the upper extremity spastic muscles and strengthening exercises for
      the antagonist muscles on the hemiplegic side were applied in both groups. Patients were
      followed for 3 months after injection. As a result, the data obtained in this study was
      compatible with the results that ultrasonography (US)-guided BTX-A injection to the upper
      extremity together with the rehabilitation program decreased the post-stroke spasticity,
      improved the upper extremity motor functions, and this improvement continued until 3 months
      after injection. In addition, dry needling combined with BTX-A injection and performed in a
      total of 4 sessions with three days intervals, contributes to the antispastic effect to start
      earlier, to be more effective and to maintain a longer-lasting effect.
