      or pregnant women, and subjects who have undergone bariatric procedure. IDA can have a
      substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects and the treatment of
      these subjects includes controlling the bleeding and replenishing lost iron. Oral iron
      administration is often used in the clinical practice at many clinics; however, oral iron may
      not be tolerated by all subjects. Hence, there is a need for an alternative iron treatment in
      subjects, who do not tolerate oral iron.

      This study is planned to compare the efficacy and safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 with
      another parenteral iron preparation (iron sucrose) in subjects with IDA and who are
      intolerant or unresponsive to oral iron therapy or who need iron rapidly.
