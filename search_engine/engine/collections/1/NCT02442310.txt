      pharmacokinetics of a new formulation of deferiprone, delayed release tablets in twenty
      healthy volunteers. In each study period, blood samples for pharmacokinetics assessment will
      be collected pre-dose and over 24 hours post-dose. Safety will be assessed throughout the
      study.
