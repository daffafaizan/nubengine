      chemotherapy (PHRAC) to patients with Stage II or Stage III colorectal cancer without
      apparent liver metastasis based on a thorough preoperative evaluation. The study endpoints
      were disease-free survival, overall survival, and liver metastasis-free survival as evaluated
      by intent-to-treat analysis.
