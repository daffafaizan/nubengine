      electrode placement for a variety of disorders including, but not limited to Parkinson's
      disease, essential tremor, dystonia, depression, epilepsy, neuropathic pain and Alzheimer's
      disease. This eligible patient population is broad but unified by the fact that they will all
      undergo DBS to treat specific circuit dysfunctions. Patients with externalized leads or
      internalized IPG may be included. Besides the structural 1.5T or 3T scans, subjects may
      undergo a resting state fMRI exam.
