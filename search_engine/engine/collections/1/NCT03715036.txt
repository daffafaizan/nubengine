      evaluation which involves the use of advanced equipment and providers, including trained
      sonographers and physicians to perform and review the ultrasound, as well as a full
      examination with multiple fetal measurements and images. A number of recent analyses show
      that measurement of the abdominal circumference (AC) in the fetus is the single most useful
      indicator of fetal growth abnormalities. Measurement of AC as well as DVP do not require
      extensive training, long time to acquire, or expensive ultrasound machines. They can be
      easily performed in the office by providers who are specifically trained in obtaining these 2
      measurements. Therefore, we intended to evaluate if introduction of bedside ultrasound during
      routine antenatal visits (point of care ultrasound or POC-US) to evaluate fetal AC and
      amniotic fluid DVP would decrease the false positive rates of fundal height measurement in
      diagnosing intrauterine growth abnormalities, and would improve the diagnosis of amniotic
      fluid volume and fetal growth deviations.
