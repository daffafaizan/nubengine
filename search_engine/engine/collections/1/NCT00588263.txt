      hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families. The increased risk to develop both breast and
      ovarian cancer associated with inheriting a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has been well
      established. It has also been suggested that is an overrepresentation of other cancers such
      as colon, prostate and pancreatic cancer present in BRCA1 or BRCA2 families. Population
      specific mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been identified. In the Ashkenazi Jewish
      population, 3 specific mutations have been seen in 2% of the population. This study will
      anonymously screen archived tissue samples of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals diagnosed with
      cancer between 1993 and 1996 at MSKCC for the three founder mutations seen in the Ashkenazi
      Jewish population. Results will be stratified by tumor type and compared with the population
      frequency to determine whether individuals inheriting mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 may have an
      increased risk to develop other cancers, in addition to breast and ovarian cancer. This
      information will be useful in helping to identify individuals who may benefit from genetic
      counseling and possibly genetic testing who to date are not typically referred. It will also
      be useful in developing high-risk cancer screening strategies and determining appropriate
      options for prophylactic surgery.
