    
      Part A is a dose escalation study to determine a safe and tolerable dose of ASN007 for
      patients with advanced solid tumors. Part A will also describe how the body works on
      ASN007(pharmacokinetics) and the effects of ASN007 on the body (pharmacodynamics) of ASN007,
      through blood sampling and optional biopsies..

      Part B of the study will enroll patients with particular tumor types and genetic mutations
      for treatment at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose. Part B will enroll patients in five groups of
      fifteen patients each:

      Group 1: Patients with metastatic BRAF mutated melanoma Group 2: Patients with metastatic
      NRAS and HRAS mutated solid tumors Group 3: Patients with metastatic KRAS mutated colorectal
      cancer (CRC) Group 4: Patients with metastatic KRAS mutated non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) Group 5: Patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) Patients
      with melanoma will be required to have pre-dose and post-dose biopsies.

      Group 6: Patients with metastatic MEK1, BRAF V600E, non-BRAF V600E solid tumors or BRAF
      fusions without prior treatment with BRAF, MEK, ERK inhibitors
