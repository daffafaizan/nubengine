      months after kidney transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen of 'reduced-dose'
      tacrolimus + sirolimus + corticosteroids or a regimen of 'standard-dose' tacrolimus +
      sirolimus + corticosteroids. The two treatment groups were also compared with respect to the
      incidence of acute graft rejection at 6 months and patient and graft survival at 6 months
      after transplantation.
