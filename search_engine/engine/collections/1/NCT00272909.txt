      N4057 (piclozotan) in subjects with clinical findings of an acute ischemic stroke and a
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating a measurable penumbra (perfusion-weighted
      imaging [PWI] minus diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] volume). Efficacy will be determined by
      comparing the proportion of subjects with no growth in stroke lesion volume as assessed by
      DWI at Screening to stroke lesion volume assessed by FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion
      recovery) on Day 28 in the piclozotan group versus the placebo group.
