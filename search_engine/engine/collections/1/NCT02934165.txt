    
      This project produced a comprehensive, interactive multimedia (IMM) program called Family
      Safety 123 to teach childhood injury prevention skills to parents of children 2 to 5 years of
      age. The program contained 40 high-quality video clips, each 2 to 5 minutes in length,
      depicting injury prevention strategies in 13 content areas: supervision, preventing airway
      obstructions, poison awareness, preventing burns, preventing falls, firearm safety, motor
      vehicle safety, pedestrian awareness, sports, playgrounds, water safety, bike safety, and
      other safety concerns. Each content area contained 1 to 6 videos comprised of short video
      presentations, modeling vignettes demonstrating desired behaviors, supportive testimonials,
      and suggestions for modifications to home and recreational environments. Family Safety 123
      video content is derived from The Injury Prevention Program (TIPP) sheets developed by the
      American Academy of Pediatrics, which recognizes injury prevention as a primary topic for
      parents.
