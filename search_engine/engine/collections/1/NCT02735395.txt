      of metronidazole (MTZ) and amoxicillin (AMX) significantly improves the benefits of the SRP
      in the treatment of subjects with periodontitis. However, the optimal dosage and interval of
      administration of these antibiotics are still unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was
      to compare the clinical and microbiological outcomes of different dosages and duration of the
      systemic administration of the combination of MTZ and AMX as adjunct to scaling and root
      planing (SRP) in the treatment of generalized chronic periodontitis (GChP). One hundred ten
      subjects will be randomly assigned to receive SRP plus placebo, or SRP combined with 250 mg
      or 400 mg of MTZ, plus AMX (500 mg) TID, for either 7 or 14 days. Subjects will be clinically
      and microbiologically monitored up to 1 year post-therapy.
