      that can lead to impaired chewing, swallowing, altered sense of taste and speech. This
      eventually affects their nutritional status and quality of life. The reported prevalence of
      xerostomia in NPC survivors ranged from 80% -100% [6-9]. This high prevalence has stemmed a
      lot of interest in prevention and treatment of this important sequelae. Saliva substitute in
      the forms of gels, toothpaste, sprays or mouthwash has been used for treatment of xerostomia
      [10]. Oral7® mouthwash (Oral7 International, United Kingdom) is a mucin-based saliva
      substitute formulated with natural enzymes such as lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, glucose oxidase
      and lactoferrin, similar to naturally occuring saliva. The biophysical properties of the
      mouthwash can potentially provide relief to xerostomia symptoms in patients post radiotherapy
      translating to a better quality of life. Hence, the purpose of the present study is to
      evaluate the effects of saliva substitute in treating xerostomia among NPC patients post
      radiotherapy. The primary end-point of the study was to compare the subjective xerostomia
      symptoms, measured using a validated inventory taken 4 weeks following intervention and at
      baseline between patients who did not receive and patients who received Oral7® mouthwash. The
      secondary end-point was to demonstrate similar changes in objective measurements using
      sialometry techniques.
