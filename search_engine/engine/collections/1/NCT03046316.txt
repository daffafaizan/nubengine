      factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1) be
      established prior to enrollment. Standard front line systemic should be given according to
      clinical practice. Molecular targeting drugs for patients with driving mutations should be
      acquired legally. Patients without driving mutations should undergo standard first line
      chemotherapy and or immunological checkpoint inhibitors. One cycle is three weeks and
      response evaluation is done every two cycles. CR, PR and SD should be confirmed after four
      cycles of therapy.

      Patients, who achieve non-PD after four cycles of treatment, with distant metastasis
      involving no more than five total metastatic lesions, will be screened and enrolled.
