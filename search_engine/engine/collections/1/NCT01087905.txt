      versus six weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), the effect of NRT monotherapy
      (nicotine patch alone) versus NRT combination therapy (nicotine patch + oral NRT), and the
      effect of cognitive medication adherence counseling (CMAC) versus no CMAC. A total of 987
      smokers seeking cessation assistance from the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) were
      randomly assigned to the eight (2x2x2) different conditions generated by the three
      experimental factors. This design provides us with sufficient power to analyze each of our
      three main effects listed above. We will also test for two- and three-way interactions, but
      do not have sufficient data to make a priori assumptions about interaction effects. Finally,
      we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for each of the three interventions to allow
      readers of this research to evaluate whether the additional costs of the interventions yield
      sufficient gains to warrant implementing them broadly.
