      in Wuhan, China. This virus, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2), spread worldwide and has been designated a pandemic by the World Health
      Organization.

      By the beginning of March 2020, several Ear, Nose, Throat societies raised awareness of a
      frequent association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and smell disorders.

      In the present study, the investigators wish to begin to understand the pathogenesis of
