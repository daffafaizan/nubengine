      devastating and disabling disease.

      Shire Human Genetic Therapies (Shire HGT) is developing an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
      recombinant human heparan-N-sulfatase (rhHNS) for patients with MPS IIIA. rhHNS is being
      administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via an surgically implanted intrathecal drug
      delivery device (IDDD), because when administered intravenously (IV) it does not cross the
      blood brain barrier (BBB).

      This study will evaluate the effect of 48 weeks of rhHNS treatment on the clinical course of
      MPS IIIA, using cognitive function as the primary outcome measure. The trial will evaluate 2
      dosing regimens of rhHNS administered via an IDDD in comparison with a no treatment control
      group. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to either of the treatment groups or the no
      treatment group. Treatment will be administered in an open-label manner. The safety and
      tolerability profile of rhHNS will continue to be evaluated in this study.
