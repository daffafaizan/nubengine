    
      The study is designed as a prospective, open, randomized controlled trial involving patients
      aged 18-28 years of both genders with uni- or bilateral keratoconus planned for routine
      corneal crosslinking at the Department of Ophthalmology, Umeå University Hospital, Umeå,
      Sweden. The study involves 30+30 eyes with keratoconus, which are randomized to receive
      either conventional corneal crosslinking (n=30) using the Dresden protocol or a modified
      treatment - corneal reshaping and crosslinking (n=30), where a rigid contact lens is sutured
      to the cornea during the treatment to flatten the corneal curvature and potentially improve
      the optical outcome after the treatment. Patients are randomized utilizing a list of unique
      random numbers between 1 and 60. All patients are informed about the procedures before
      consenting to participate in the study. The study also involves 60 eyes of healthy age- and
      sex-matched control subjects.

      At baseline, before treatment, each eye is evaluated with autorefractometer measurement, best
      spectacle-corrected LogMAR visual acuity, Pentacam Scheimpflug photography, Goldmann
      applanation tonometry and biomicroscopy. The corneal biomechanical characteristics are
      assessed with applanation resonance tonometry and the ocular response analyzer. The
      investigations are repeated at 1 month, 6 months, 2 years and 5 years after the treatment.
