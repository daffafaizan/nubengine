      bleeding could contribute to DCI occurrence. More precisely, we suspect that DCI areas are
      somehow overlaps of regions in which microperfusion is precociously altered, shortening
      circulatory reserves, and territories of secondarily spasmed arteries further lowering blood
      flow, resulting in ischemia. We aim to explore the potential microvasculature alteration
      through cerebral glucose perfusion and metabolism assessment using early dynamic
      18F-fluorodesoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computer Tomography (dynamic 18F-FDG
      PET/CT). If our hypothesis turned out to be valid, we would at the same time be able to
      determine risk factors for this unpredictable complication and gain remarkable insight into
      DCI pathophysiology. Thus, the purpose of this trial is to demonstrate, in patients affected
      by SAH, the correlation between early cerebral glucose uptake defects in 18F-FDG PET/CT and
      delayed cerebral infarction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
