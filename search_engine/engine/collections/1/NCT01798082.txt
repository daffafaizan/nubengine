      Hospital will be contacted via telephone prior to the initial consultation visit to ascertain
      interest for this study. If they are interested, they will be randomized to one of two
      groups: those that receive a DA and those that do not.

      This study requires you to answer some questions about the information packet you received in
      the mail. We routinely send a packet to all of our new patients. Half of the participants
      received a decision aid to supplement their information packet and the other half received
      our routine informational packet. You will be asked to complete a set of 2 questionnaires. It
      will take less than 10 minutes to complete these questions.

      All data will be extracted and used by only the investigators on this study. The data will be
      stored on a restricted-access network drive and results will be reported in aggregate and no
      personal health history will be disclosed. Our primary outcome for this analysis is
      decisional conflict differences in those who receive a DA and those who do not.
