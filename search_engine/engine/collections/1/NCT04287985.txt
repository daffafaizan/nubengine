    
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 18
      years and above with biopsy confirmed diagnosis of IgAN. The study is designed to test the
      safety and effectiveness of multiple doses of VIS649. The main objectives are to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of VIS649 and to evaluate the dose response of different doses of
      VIS649 by measuring proteinuria.

      The study is comprised of three main periods, Screening, Treatment (12 months) and Follow-Up
      (4 months). Approximately 144 patients will be enrolled. The findings from this study will
      form the basis for subsequent clinical development of VIS649.

      VIS649 is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG2) monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks
      the biological actions of the cytokine A PRoliferation Inducing Ligand (APRIL), a key factor
      in the production of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 (a-g- IgA1), which is critical to the
      pathogenesis of IgAN.
