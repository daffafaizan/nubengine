    
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms in a 1:1 fashion. ARM I = CPX-351; ARM II =
      CLAG-M.

      ARM I (INDUCTION): Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3,
      and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a
      response other than an MRDneg CR receive a second course of CPX-351 intravenously IV over 90
      minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM I (POST-REMISSION): Patients who achieve a CR or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery
      (CRi) receive a reduced dose of CPX-351 IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5 for up to 4
      additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (INDUCTION): Patients receive cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV
      over 2 hours on days 1-5, G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, and mitoxantrone IV over 60
      minutes on days 1-3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      who achieve a response other than an MRDneg CR receive a second course of cladribine IV over
      2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, G-CSF SC on days 0-5, and
      mitoxantrone IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (POST-REMISSION): Patients who achieve a CR/CRi receive an intermediate dose of
      cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-6 for up to 4 additional courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
