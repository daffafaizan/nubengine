    
      Orthodontic buttons are bonded on the vestibular surfaces of the upper right premolars (1.4
      and 1.5) and the upper right first molar (1.6). A composite resin is polymerized on the top
      of the buttons. Then, participants are divided into two groups.

        -  Trial Group: participants from this group will receive a manual toothbrush and Biorepair
           Total Protection toothpaste for home oral hygiene after lunches.

        -  Control Groups: participants from this group will receive a manual toothbrush and
           Sensodyne Repair & Protect for home oral hygiene after lunches.

      After 7 days from the procedure of bonding, the buttons on upper right first premolars (1.4)
      are debonded. After 15 days from the procedure of bonding, the buttons on upper right second
      premolars (1.5) are debonded. In the end, After 30 days from the procedure of bonding, the
      buttons on upper right first molars (1.6) are debonded.

      Debonded buttons are then stored in sterile environment at 2-3Â°C temperature; successively,
      they are sent to laboratory for SEM evaluation.
