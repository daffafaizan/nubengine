    
      The present study is designed as a 24-month, single centre, double-blind, randomized,
      controlled, two-arm clinical trial (acupuncture and control). The research will be conducted
      following the CONSORT recommendations and the STRICTA extension. The study care protocol will
      consist in acupuncture or control intervention at the selected acupoints (R6, E6,E2, Ig4,
      VC24, TA23, B2) for 8 weeks, 20 minutes sessions with 12 weeks of follow up. Complementary
      clinical approaches (sialometry, sialochemistry, Schirmer test, staining with topical
      lissamine green), and the questionnaires (OHIP-14, Eular Sj√∂gren's Syndrome Patient Reported
      Index (ESSPRI), Xerostomia Inventory, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) will be performed
      in weeks 1, 8 and 12. The control group will consist of superficial acupuncture, or placebo,
      or sham. After all interventions and evaluation methods completed, data will be analyzed for
      their distribution and homogeneity in order to choose the most appropriate statistical test.
