      of an attenuated strain of Salmonella typhimurium expressing human interleukin-2 (IL-2) in
      patients with unresectable hepatic metastases from a solid tumor cancer. Standard Phase I
      dose escalation scheme will be used to determine the MTD of Salmonella Typhimurium. Six dose
      levels of Salmonella will be studied with a minimum of 3 patients enrolled in a dose level.
