    
      Ten patients who are having a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter inserted at the Ottawa
      Hospital, and who provide informed consent, will undergo intra-abdominal pressure (IAP)
      measurements with the Stryker intracompartmental (STIC) pressure monitor. Values will be
      compared to the insufflator at inflation pressures 5,10, and 15 mmHg (millimeters of
      mercury).

      To determine if the Stryker pressure monitor is appropriate for measuring IAP in PD patients,
      the observed pressures will be analyzed with Bland Altman plots. If the mean difference
      between readings is 5 mmHg and 95% of the points fall within 2 standard deviations of the
      mean difference, the Stryker pressure monitor will be considered an acceptable method of
      measuring IAP.

      This tool will then be used as part of a future larger trial which will 1) measure IAP with
      resistance training in patients treated with PD; with and without dialysate, 2) assess PD
      patient interest in participating in resistance training trials and 3) determine the
      appropriateness of the proposed resistance training program for this patient population.

      The ultimate goal is to use this study to help inform and develop a clinical trial to 1)
      assess the impact of resistance training on quality of life and functional status, 2) assess
      the risk of developing leaks/hernias, and 3) determine if there is an association between IAP
      during resistance training and subsequent hernia development
