      Lenalidomide is a capsule that is to be taken orally (by mouth). If the patient's disease
      progresses after 2 cycles of therapy, a low dose of dexamethasone will be added. If the
      patient's disease is stable after 2 cycles of therapy, the use of an alternate corticosteroid
      (prednisone) will be added to the lenalidomide therapy they are receiving. Dexamethasone and
      prednisone are in tablet form and will be taken orally (by mouth). However, if the patient
      has a minimal response after an additional 2 cycles of lenalidomide therapy, the therapy will
      be continued until their disease progresses. See the intervention descriptions for further
      details.
