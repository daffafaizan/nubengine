      assistance with weekly online ordering of $30/week worth of potassium rich foods delivered by
      a local grocer to a community location for reducing urinary albumin excretion among African
      Americans with hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Participants will be recruited from
      primary care clinics in Baltimore, MD.

      150 African American adults diagnosed with hypertension and with mild/moderate chronic kidney
      disease based on the presence of albuminuria will be randomly assigned to one of two arms for
      12 months. There are 2 phases of the study. In Phase 1 (months 1-4), one study arm will
      consist of minimal guidance from the study team and a weekly allowance of $30 dollars to
      purchase food and drinks of their choosing from a local grocer. During Phase 1, the second
      arm of the study will receive dietary guidance from the study coach and assistance with
      ordering and purchasing $30/week worth of high potassium foods from the same local grocer. In
      Phase 2 (months 5-12) neither study arm will receive a food allowance, however the second arm
      will receive telephonic visits and dietary advice from the study coach.
