      regimen using a purpose-built pump that aims to enhance the efficacy, safety and
      personalization of remifentanil therapy for labouring women. The system studies the
      parturient's pattern of analgesic use in 15 minute epochs and titrates the demand doses and
      basal infusion rate to maintain a plasma level of remifentanil that is appropriate for the
      degree of pain felt.

      The system incorporates vital signs (pulse oximetry and heart rate values) into the algorithm
      which would temporarily stop the pump and step down doses accordingly when predefined
      critical values are reached.
