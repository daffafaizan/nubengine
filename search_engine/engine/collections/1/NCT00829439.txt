      carbidopa, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, to increase the bioavailability of levodopa.
      Animal studies have suggested that levodopa can reverse the excess phosphorylation of some
      enzymes involved in synaptic and neuronal function, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent
      kinase type 2 (CaMKII).

      Recently, it was shown that excess phosphorylation of CaMKII may be responsible for some of
      the neurological deficits seen in Angelman syndrome. Therefore, it is hypothesized that
      levodopa may lead to an improvement in the neurodevelopment and abnormal movements (e.g.
      tremors) in children with Angelman syndrome.

      Although many children have used levodopa for a variety of medical conditions over the last
      30 years, it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in
      children, and it has not been formally studied in children with Angelman syndrome, so we do
      not know what dose of levodopa is most appropriate for children with Angelman syndrome.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of levodopa that
      children with Angelman syndrome can tolerate without any serious side effects.

      Once we know the dose of levodopa that can be tolerated by children with Angelman syndrome,
      we will conduct a larger follow-up study to find out whether levodopa will lead to an
      improvement in their development and tremor.
