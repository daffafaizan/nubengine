      cell transplant. To date, there are no specific dermal biomarkers that predict or define the
      onset of acute skin graft versus host disease. The primary objective of this study is to
      observe the changes in the inflammatory environment of the skin during the process of acute
      and chronic skin graft versus host disease. This will be accomplished by using a non-invasive
      transdermal patch called D-Squame to analyze inflammatory cytokines and key epidermal
      proteins. Patients will be enrolled prior to receiving a stem cell transplant and followed
      weekly after stem cell infusion until day 99. If acute skin graft versus host disease
      develops, they will be followed weekly until resolution of acute graft versus host disease or
      development of chronic graft versus host disease, whichever occurs first. Patients with a
      diagnosis of chronic skin graft versus host disease will be enrolled and followed weekly
      until 4 weeks, irrespective of clinical course. In addition, healthy controls will be
      enrolled and used as comparators. The relevance of this study is to provide a better
      understanding of the local inflammatory environment induced by acute or chronic skin graft
      versus host disease. This is likely to enable the investigators to define a biomarker panel
      that predicts the onset of acute graft versus host disease rapidly and non-invasively.
