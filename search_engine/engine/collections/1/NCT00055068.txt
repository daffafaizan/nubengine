      To date, no OCD psychotherapy trials have specifically focused on early childhood.
      Development of interventions for childhood onset OCD that address both developmental
      considerations and familial relationships is necessary.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of either Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT) or Relaxation Training (RT) over the course of 14 weeks. The CBT treatment is
      designed to lessen anxiety by addressing specific OCD symptoms. The relaxation intervention
      addresses generalized feelings of anxiety with the expectation that OCD symptoms may benefit
      indirectly. The clarity, completeness, acceptability, and feasibility of both interventions
      is assessed. A 3-month post-treatment follow-up is also conducted.
