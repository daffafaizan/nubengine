      the EV71 vaccine, and explore the protective levels of various enterovirus neutralizing
      antibodies. This study includes the following three sections: (1) efficacy study of EV71
      vaccine based on enhanced cases monitoring, using prospective cohort study design (2) study
      on correlation between EV71 vaccine protection and EV71 antibody levels, using case-control
      study design (3) pathogenic spectrum and sero-epidemiological investigation of hand, foot and
      mouth disease (HFMD) in children. 15500 volunteers aged 6-71 months are expected to
      participate in this study, among which 5000 volunteers aged 6-35 months will receive two
      doses EV71 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd, and constitute the experimental
      cohort. 10000 unvaccinated volunteers aged 6-35 months will constitute the the control
      cohort. The efficacy evaluation will be conducted based on the abovementioned two cohort.
      Enhanced HFMD surveillance system will be established to report the HFMD cases in the
      abovementioned 2 cohorts, as well as another cohort consisting of 500 volunteers aged 36-71
      months. The case surveillance period of this study is one year. Laboratory tests will be
      conducted for case confirmation.
