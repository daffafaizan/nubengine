      (cataract group)includes patients who are planned for cataract extraction without any other
      preexisting retinal or optic nerve pathology that may affect the RNFL thickness, while group
      2 (combined cataract and glaucoma group) includes patients who are diagnosed with POAG
      controlled on medical treatment with cataract and planned for cataract extraction only.

      The OCT scans with complete ophthalmological examination are done before surgery and 6 weeks
      after uneventful cataract extraction (phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation)
