    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Examine the effect of bevacizumab and irinotecan on vascular permeability and blood flow
           in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the reproducibility of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) in malignant
           gliomas.

        -  Determine the predictive value of DCE-MRI in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas
           treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan.

        -  Describe the activity of the combination of bevacizumab with irinotecan as measured by
           response rate and progression-free survival.

        -  Describe the toxicity associated with the administration of bevacizumab with irinotecan.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on days 1, 15, and 29 and irinotecan IV on days 2,
      15, and 29 during the first 6-week cycle. After the first cycle, the irinotecan and
      bevacizumab will be given on days 1, 15 and 29. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients also undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI 4 times.
