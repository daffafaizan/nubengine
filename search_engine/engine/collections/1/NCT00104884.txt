      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV
           malignant melanoma treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) intravenously (IV) over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and
      15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
