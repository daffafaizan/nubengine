      variability can be improve with use of an implanted pump which delivers insulin by the
      intra-peritoneal route. Some patients however still have difficulties to achieve their
      glycemic goal despite this therapy. Continuous Glucose Measurements (CGM) has proven to be
      able to improve glucose control (HbA1c, time spent in hypoglycaemia) of patients treated with
      an external insulin pump. No trial has been performed yet to assess the utility of CGM on
      patients using an intra-peritoneal insulin delivery.

      During this study, we propose to assess the influence of CGM use on type 1 diabetic subject
      treated with implanted insulin pump. It is a prospective, randomized cross-over study. After
      a 2 weeks run-in period with CGM followed by a 4 weeks break, subjects will participate at
      two experimental periods of 3 months separated with a 3 month washout. During the
      intervention phase, patient will use a CGM system (Abbott Freestyle Navigator II) to adapt
      their insulinotherapy. During the control period, patients will based their insulinotherapy
      upon their usual care and capillary glucose measurements. The order of the periods will be
      randomized.

      The main endpoint will be the time spent in glucose interval 70-180mg/dL during the last 20
      days of each period. The control arm will wear a blinded sensor during this phase to allow
      comparison.
