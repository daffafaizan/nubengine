      frequency and urgency, with or without urge urinary incontinence. The burden of OAB on the
      American public is immense in both human and financial terms. Despite this burden, there is a
      lack of effective diagnostic and treatment modalities for OAB. Other than two-dimensional
      video urodynamics, which has remained relatively unchanged for decades, there is a lack of
      diagnostic modalities that will allow investigators to characterize subtypes of OAB and
      measure the effects of treatment on bladder physiology. Newer imaging techniques are
      desperately needed to help guide treatment and predict and improve outcomes of different
      treatment modalities. Intravesical botulinum toxin is a minimally invasive treatment for OAB
      refractory to medical therapy. Despite the widespread use of intravesical botulinum toxin
      injection for OAB refractory to medical therapy, to date the optimal placement of the drug
      has not been determined. Typically ten injections are given, either dispersed evenly across
      the bladder or in two rows of five injections. However, it remains unknown which injection
      method will optimize outcomes and reduce the risk of urinary retention after Botox®. This
      lack of knowledge is a direct result of the fact that there has been no mechanism to study
      the effect of Botox® on bladder filling and emptying in a three-dimensional fashion.
      CineMRI-UDS will provide this mechanism, and has the potential to significantly improve care
      and urologic education by enhancing the understanding of bladder physiology.
