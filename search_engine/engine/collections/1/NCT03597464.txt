      tolerability of voclosporin, added to the standard of care treatment in LN, for an additional
      24 months, following a treatment period of 52 weeks in the AURORA 1 study (AUR-VCS-2016-01).
      All subjects will continue to receive background therapy of MMF and/or oral corticosteroids
      starting at the same dose as at the end of the AURORA 1 study. Subjects with LN, who have
      completed 52 weeks of treatment with study drug in the AURORA 1 study, will be eligible to
      enter the study. The long-term safety and tolerability of the drug combination will be
      assessed from its safety profile while demonstrating the continued ability to achieve and
      maintain long-term renal response.
