    
      Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) represents the cutting edge within high conformal and
      modulated radiotherapy techniques; it can provide high local control (LC) for curative-intent
      of low burden metastatic, persistent and metastatic lesions in face of minimal acute and late
      toxicities. SBRT is amenable even in patients who had already been managed by radiotherapy.
      In addition, SBRT has been shown to be active in chemoresistant disease, and potentially able
      to mount immune response through the release of tumor neoantigens after cell killing, thus
      allowing to synergize with immunotherapeutic approaches. SBRT has been widely adopted in the
      clinical setting of oligometastatic/persistent/recurrent (MPR) disease (up to <5 lesions) in
      several malignancies including also ovarian cancer (OC); the recently published
      retrospective, multicenter Italian study (MITO-RT1) has confirmed the activity and safety of
      SBRT in MPR OC, thus providing a model able to predict the higher chance of complete response
      of tumor lesions to SBRT, and local control rate.

      The MITO-RT3/RAD trial is a prospective, Italian multicenter Phase II study aimed at
      evaluating the activity and safety of SBRT in MPR-OC patients. Clinical and imaging data, as
      well as SBRT technical parameters, would be analyzed with the aim to identify potential
      predictors of response to treatment and clinical outcome: in this context, additional
      insights into the tissue features of tumor lesions would be of clinical interest in the
      context of the personalized treatment, as testified by studies demonstrating that image-based
      quantitative features from pre-treatment imaging could predict clinical outcomes in several
      malignancies.

      Furthermore, given the crucial role played by the mutational status of BRCA 1/2 genes in this
      disease, the assessment of BRCA gene status was considered mandatory, thus representing
      inclusion criteria.

      The study will include patients with oligo-metastatic/persistent/recurrent lesions (MPR) from
      OC patients for which salvage surgery or other local therapies resulted not feasible, as per
      relative contraindication to further systemic therapy because of serious comorbidities, as
      per previous severe toxicity, unavailability of potentially active chemotherapy, or patient
      refusal of systemic therapy
