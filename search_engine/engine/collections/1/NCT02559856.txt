      established therapy with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
      for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), due to ease of administration and more
      predictable pharmacokinetic properties. Many clinical questions about the new OAC remain
      unanswered because there have not been direct head-to-head comparison trials. For example,
      although studies have shown that rivaroxaban and apixaban are at least as effective and safe
      as LMWH and VKA, meta-analyses suggest that apixaban may be associated with lower bleeding
      risk. Concerns about the potential impact of medication non-adherence have been raised.
      Compliance with twice daily medications (e.g. apixaban) is often worse than once daily
      medications (e.g. rivaroxaban). Both of these medications are approved by Health Canada for
      treatment of VTE yet there is genuine uncertainty about which of the two direct OAC confer
      the best risk-to-benefit ratio.This is a multi-centre, prospective randomized open blinded
      end-point (PROBE) trial assessing clinical feasibility for a larger multi-centered trial
      comparing bleeding outcomes using apixaban vs. rivaroxaban for treatment of acute VTE. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine if it is feasible to conduct a large
      randomized multicenter trial comparing apixaban vs. rivaroxaban for the treatment of acute
      VTE. The secondary objectives are to assess safety and superiority of apixaban vs
      rivaroxaban.
