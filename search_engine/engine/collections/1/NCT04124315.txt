      within Fairview. Participants will have a diagnosis of PAD and be â‰¥40 years of age
      (participants are diagnosed before they are referred to the SET program). Rate limiting
      comorbidities not associated with vascular disease (e.g., severe chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease) will be exclusionary (for example). Age, sex, race, ethnicity, educational
      status, and smoking status at baseline will be recorded from cardiac rehabilitation intake
      forms. Eligible participants will be identified by study staff reviewing electronic medical
      records of patients who are enrolling into the SET program. University of Minnesota staff
      will travel to the urban and rural clinical rehabilitation sites to obtain informed consent
      at the participants first SET visit. They will then provide participants instructions and
      training for how to use the smartphone and app.
