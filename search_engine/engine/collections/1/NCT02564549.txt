    
      This is an unblinded, randomized trial of TRUS biopsy-based active surveillance versus
      mpMRI-based active surveillance. Patients on the TRUS biopsy-based arm will undergo annual
      systematic biopsies without any MRI staging or guidance. Patients on the mpMRI- based arm
      will undergo annual mpMRI surveillance imaging, with image-guided targeted biopsies only as
      indicated by radiographic findings.
