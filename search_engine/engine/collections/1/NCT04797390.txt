      To compare the short-term and long-term effectiveness of self-administered APCD therapy
      versus Usual Care in HNC survivors with treatment naive LEF on anatomical measures of
      internal and external LEF. Baseline measures will be obtained at the start of therapy.
      Short-term effectiveness will be evaluated at 2 months and long-term effectiveness will be
      evaluated at 4 and 6 months. Hypothesis: the APCD therapy will be associated with greater
      short-term and long-term reduction in anatomical measures of LEF.

      Aim 2:

      To compare the short-term and long-term effectiveness of self-administered APCD therapy
      versus Usual Care in HNC survivors with treatment naive LEF on patient reported
      biopsychosocial outcome measures impacted by LEF. Outcome measures will include: 1) symptom
      burden, 2) symptom burden and functional impairment, 3) quality of life (QOL), 4) work and
      activity, 5) perceived self-management capacity, 6) body image, and 7) diet modifications.
      Baseline measures will be obtained at the start of therapy. Short-term effectiveness will be
      evaluated at 2 months and long-term effectiveness will be evaluated at 4 and 6 months.
      Hypothesis: the APCD therapy will be associated with greater short-term and long-term
      improvement in patient reported biopsychosocial outcomes.
