    
      Background:

      We have previously shown (IIR 95-045) that teledermatology, using store and forward
      technology, can result in reliable and accurate diagnostic outcomes when compared to
      clinic-based dermatology consultations. This investigation builds on that fundamental
      diagnostic information by assessing the health services implications of a teledermatology
      consult system.

      Objectives:

      To investigate health services outcomes related to teledermatology implementation. Outcomes
      of interest were time to diagnosis and treatment initiation, the proportion of patients that
      avoided the need for a clinic-based encounter, and an economic analysis.

      Methods:

      Patients referred from the primary care clinics to the dermatology consult service were
      randomized to either usual care or a teledermatology consultation. A usual care consultation
      consisted a conventional text-based electronic consult request. A teledermatology
      consultation included digital images and a standardized history, in addition to the
      electronic text-based consult. Consultant dermatologists, reviewing the consult requests for
      both modalities, decided when, and if, a referral required a clinic-based evaluation.

      Status:

      Final report has been prepared and is in the review process at this time.
