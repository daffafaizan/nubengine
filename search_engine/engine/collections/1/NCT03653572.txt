    
      Adult patients (aged >18 years) will be enrolled as they present for emergency or immediate
      medical care, in facilities such as the intensive care unit (ICU), cardiac care unit (CCU),
      and/or other departments. Subjects may or may not have a clinical indication for ultrasound
      scanning as part of their regular medical care and will be required to meet the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will undergo an ultrasound
      exam using the investigational ultrasound device. The exam type will be based on the
      subject's clinical condition. Users performing the scans will periodically be asked to
      provide feedback on User Survey forms prepared by the Sponsor. Image data sets from
      investigational exam will be stored electronically and de-identified data will be disclosed
      to the Sponsor.Results are for use in development and optimization of a next generation
      ultrasound system being developed by study Sponsor, GE Healthcare (GEHC) prior to future
      commercial release.
