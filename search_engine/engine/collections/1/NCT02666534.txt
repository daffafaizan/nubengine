      Hence, surgical excision is the standard treatment for cutaneous SCC. However, some patients
      are ineligible for surgery because of their poor general health, concomitant anticoagulant or
      immunosuppressive therapies, or allergy to local anesthetics.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methylaminolevulinate (MAL) is an innovative treatment
      modality that has been approved in Europe for the treatment of actinic keratosis, basal cell
      carcinoma, and Bowen's disease. However, currently, there is insufficient evidence to support
      the routine use of topical PDT for SCC.

      Ablative fractional laser (AFL) ablates the epidermis and dermis without significant thermal
      injury, creating microscopic ablation zones in the portion of the skin that the laser is
      applied to. Our previous studies showed that AFL-primed MAL-PDT (AFL-PDT) offered a higher
      efficacy than conventional MAL-PDT in the treatment of many other diseases, such as actinic
      keratosis, actinic cheilitis, and Bowen's disease.

      Investigators recruited Korean patients with microinvasive SCC and compared the efficacy,
      recurrence rate, and cosmetic outcomes of AFL-PDT with those of standard MAL-PDT.
