        2. Key date elements and definition of each variable were in line with the American Heart
           Association(AHA)/European Society of Cardiology(ECS） recommendation on AF and CHD. To
           reflect the contemporary antithrombotic management of AF and CHD in the past five years,
           the following data were collected: basic socio-demographic information, symptoms and
           signs relating to AF, medical history, results of physical examination and laboratory
           test.

        3. Follow-up time is at least 12 months. The patients will be asked about their medications
           and clinical outcomes by telephone interview or outpatient clinic. Then we will analyze
           the relative safety and efficacy of the various antithrombotic regimens.

        4. Based on the largest prospective study by Denmark about this issue, we anticipate an 30%
           incidence of composite outcome in the triple therapy arm. To achieve a precision of 10%
           with an α=0.05 and the rate of defaulters is 10%. The final estimated sample size was
           986.
