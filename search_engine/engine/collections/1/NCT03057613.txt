    
      Primary Objective:

      To assess safety and estimate 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) of postoperative
      radiation therapy (RT) + concurrent and adjuvant Pembrolizumab in high risk resected
      cutaneous squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (cSCC-HN).

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To evaluate the relationship of baseline programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by
           tumor and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to preliminary efficacy .

        2. To phenotype tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), and
           investigate tumor suppressor populations including Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor
           cells (MDSCs) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) suppressor cells and assess ex vivo
           for effector function by cytokine production and cytotoxicity assays as well as
           suppressor function in assays with autologous PBLs.

        3. To evaluate the tumor microenvironment (TME), and immune markers at the invasive margin
           of the tumor, including CD8, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, galectin-9 or HMGB-1, BTLA and HVEM, as
           well as Lag-3, CTLA-4 and others.

        4. To evaluate the genomic and/or transcriptomic profile of these tumors using RNA-seq
           /Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing

      Trial Design:

      This is a phase II trial evaluating the addition of concurrent and adjuvant fixed-dose
      pembrolizumab in combination with standard intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), in
      order to establish safety and estimate efficacy of this regimen to be tested in a subsequent
      randomized registration trial.

      Thirty seven patients will be enrolled.
