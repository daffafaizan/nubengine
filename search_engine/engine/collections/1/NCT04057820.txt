      for infants with NOWS to the ESC care approach at a randomly allocated transition period
      (from usual care to the ESC care approach).

      During the initial birth hospitalization, the clinical site research team will collect data
      under waiver of consent for infants who meet eligibility criteria.

      The site research team will obtain informed consent from the legal guardian(s) to obtain
      long-term outcomes for eligible infants and caregivers. Clinical site research team members
      may obtain this consent at any point during the hospital stay for infants who meet the
      trial's inclusion criteria. This data will allow the protocol study team to short- and
      long-term outcomes for infants managed with the ESC care approach compared to usual
      institutional care.
