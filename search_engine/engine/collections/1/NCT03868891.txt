      for the treatment of chronic Eustachian tube (ET) dysfunction (ETD) in older children still
      experiencing middle-ear disease. Children with or without cleft palate (CP) with ventilation
      tubes (VTs) will be evaluated for the function of the soft palate and the ET. Subjects with
      active muscular ETD and inadequate soft palate closure will be prescribed soft palate
      strengthening exercises for at least 2 months. The objective of the study is to demonstrate
      the effect of exercises on soft palate closure and ETF. This pilot study will enroll 30
      children between ages 6-17 years with VTs or post-VT extrusion tympanic membrane (TM)
      perforations. All 30 children will have ETD, with active muscular dysfunction. 15 subjects
      will have a history of cleft palate (CP) and 15 no history of CP. Subjects will undergo
      history, physical examination including an ENT exam, video-otoscopy and ET function testing
      which may include Forced Response Test (FRT), Inflation-Deflation Test (IDT) and
      Tubomanometry. They will also undergo evaluations for swallow, speech and soft palate
      function. Enrolled children will then receive instruction on the use their EMST150 exercise
      device. This device will be used daily for at least 2 months. Subjects will undergo full
      evaluations for ET function and velopharyngeal incompetence after the 2-month treatment and
      will then discontinue the use of devices for at least 2 months. After this time, the same
      testing will be done. Weekly phone calls/emails/texts from study staff will encourage use of
      the devices as prescribed.
