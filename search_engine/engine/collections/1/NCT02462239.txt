      symptoms (e.g., painless hematuria). The urologist will perform cystoscopy and if urothelial
      cancer of the bladder is suspected, the patient is taken to the operating room for an
      examination under anesthesia (EUA) and a TURBT. If this shows muscle invasion then
      conventional staging with CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis is performed. The patient who has TNM
      Stage T2a-T4a N0-3 M0 is eligible to be enrolled in the trial. Eligible consenting patients
      will be randomized 2:1 to PET-CT or none (Control). The actual treatment received by the
      patient will be documented. The primary outcome measure is treatment received.
