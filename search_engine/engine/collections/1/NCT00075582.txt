    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the failure-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed low-risk
      rhabdomyosarcoma treated with vincristine (V), dactinomycin (A), cyclophosphamide (C), and
      radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine local control rates in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the
      rate of second-look surgery in patients with bulk residual tumor at diagnosis (clinical group
      III) and the proportion of second-look surgeries that render patients treated with this
      regimen tumor-free or with microscopic tumor only and evaluate the pathologic significance of
      that residual tumor.

      III. Determine the local control rates in patients with clinical group III disease treated
      with response-adjusted radiotherapy doses after second-look surgical resection.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment regimens according to disease stage and clinical group.

      REGIMEN I (subset 1 patients) [closed to accrual as of 08/13/2010: Patients receive VAC
      chemotherapy comprising vincristine IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 1-9 and dactinomycin
      IV over 1 minute and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10; VA
      chemotherapy comprising vincristine IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 13-21 and
      dactinomycin* IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 13, 16, 19, and 22; and radiotherapy**, 5
      days a week, beginning on week 13 and continuing for 4-7 weeks, depending on prescribed dose.

      REGIMEN II (subset 2 patients)[closed to accrual as of 9/23/2011]: Patients receive VAC
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy** as in regimen I and VA chemotherapy comprising vincristine IV
      over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 13-21, 25-33, and 37-45 and dactinomycin* IV over 1 minute on
      day 1 of weeks 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, and 46. Patients with clinical
      group III disease may undergo second-look surgery at week 13 followed by response-adjusted
      radiotherapy, and continued VA* chemotherapy. In both regimens, treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *For both regimens, dactinomycin is omitted during radiotherapy.

      NOTE: **Clinical Group I tumors and those with Clinical Group III uterine/cervix primary
      disease with negative nodes who have undergone a complete resection (i.e. hysterectomy) at
      Week 13 do not receive radiotherapy at Week 13

      Patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
