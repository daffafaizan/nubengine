      investigators want to perform a prospective cohort study in children under 3 years. Three
      groups should be compared: i) control without anesthesia / surgery, ii) children with only
      anesthesia, and iii) children with both surgery and anesthesia. All children will be
      investigate before and after intervention. Different behavioral scales will be used for
      detailed cognitive abilities and self-regulatory skills.
