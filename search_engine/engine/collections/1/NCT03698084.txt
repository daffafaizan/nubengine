      Passive (around 1800 participants) - Demographic data will be collected at inclusion and a
      parental questionnaire at one year of age. Infants admitted to a hospital with an acute
      respiratory tract illness will be followed up to the age of 3 years.

      Active (around 200 participants) - Demographic data, parental questionnaire and the following
      samples will be collected at inclusion; blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, urine and stool. During
      the infants first RSV season (Oct - May) weekly phone contact will monitor respiratory

      testing) will have further samples of blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, urine and stool collected
      at the time of infection and 7 weeks later. Infants in the active cohort will be followed up
