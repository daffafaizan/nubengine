    
      The aim of this study is to describe treatment outcomes in patients infected with pandemic
      influenza (the most likely case being a version of the influenza A H5N1 virus) including
      overall survival, the incidence and duration of hospitalization, the resolution of protocol
      specified symptoms, the incidence and the severity of treatment limiting side effects in
      treated patients. This study will also describe the sequelae of influenza in infected
      patients including transmission to other persons, associations between baseline data and
      treatment outcomes and drug resistance. A repository of biological samples will also be
      created to examine virological and immunological concepts relating to pandemic influenza.

      It is an open label prospective cohort study. Patients presenting at study sites with the
      recognised clinical case definition for pandemic influenza (to be distributed by State and
      Commonwealth Departments of Health when first clinical case occurs) will be eligible to be
      enrolled on the study. Informed consent to participate in the study will be sought including
      parental/guardian consent for minors and presumed consent for adults who are incapacitated
      (consistent with NHMRC requirements).
