      primary aim of the study is to determine if lipoic acid and omega-3 fatty acids can improve
      cognitive function over 12-weeks in people with multiple sclerosis that have a baseline score
      of at least two standard deviations below normative values on any one of four cognitive tests
      that include, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), Stroop Color-Word Test, California
      Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II), and Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT).

      The secondary aim is to determine treatment effects on markers of endothelial inflammation,
      insulin dysregulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction that may be related to cognitive
      dysfunction by measuring soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) levels,
      homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and MRI phosphorus imaging in a subset of
      study participants. The study will also measure safety by adverse event reports and
      laboratory measures; plasma fatty acid levels; serum lipoic acid levels.
