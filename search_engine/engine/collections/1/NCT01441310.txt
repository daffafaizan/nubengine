    
      Prospective phase II clinical trials for sentinel node navigation surgery(SNNS) in early
      gastric cancer.

      Laparoscopic SNNS:

        1. ICG and 99mTc-antimony sulfur colloid (ASC) submucosal injection under intraoperative
           endoscopy

        2. Sentinel node basin identification and dissection

        3. Sentinel nodes picking in back table

        4. Frozen biopsy of sentinel nodes(hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry
           for cytokeratin)

        5. If the sentinel node biopsy by frozen section is negative, limited gastrectomy will be
           performed or if positive, radical D2 gastrectomy will be performed.

      Sample size: 100 cases

      Study duration: 5 years( 2year enrollment, 3 year follow-up)
