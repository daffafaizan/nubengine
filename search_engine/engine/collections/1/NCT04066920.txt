      alkylator-based treatment in patients with relapse or refractory PCNSL, the development of
      novel salvage chemotherapy regimen remains an area of clinical unmet need.

      Ibrutinib, an oral inhibitor of bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), is known to induce death of
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells with dysregulated B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling
      and has shown promising activity in patients with a variety of B-cell malignancies. Recently,
      several studies reported that ibrutinib may have an excellent single-agent clinical activity
      against relapsed or refractory PCNSL. Furthermore, proven pharmacokinetic data suggested that
      ibrutinib successfully penetrated the BBB and reached the achievable concentration in
      cerebrospinal fluid. When ibrutinib is administered in combination with BBB-destructing
      chemotherapeutic agents (such as, temozolomide or etoposide) for salvage treatment of PCNSL,
      therefore, anti-lymphoma activity of ibrutinib could be maximized.

      In this context, this phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IBER
      salvage chemotherapy followed by ibrutinib maintenance for transplant ineligible patients
      with relapsed or refractory PCNSL.
