      tension-type headache (TTH) treated for 4 weeks with different manual therapy-based
      techniques.

      Methods: The study design involved a factorial, randomized, double-blind, controlled study of
      76 subjects. They were divided into 4 groups: suboccipital inhibitory pressure was applied to
      the first group; suboccipital spinal manipulation was applied to the second group; a
      combination of the two treatments was applied to the third group; and the fourth group was a
      control group. Quality of life was assessed using the SF-12 questionnaire (both overall and
      in its different dimensions) at the beginning and at the end of treatment, and after one
      month as a follow-up.
