      immune function, the immune systems' ability to control HIV-1 replication is not improved.
      AGS-004 is an immunotherapeutic agent made from autologous DCs co electroporated with
      amplified in vitro transcribed (IVT) ribonucleic acid (RNA) encoding CD40L and with IVT RNA
      encoding three or four autologous HIV-1 antigens. The HIV-1 RNA is derived from the plasma
      sample taken immediately prior to the initiation of ART.
