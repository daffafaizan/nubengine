    
      The RADBRI trial is designed as an explanatory, multicenter, open-label, 2-arm parallel group
      superiority randomized trial with stratification by center and blood group, random permuted
      blocks (lengths of 4 or 6) and balanced allocation (1:1) conducted in 8 centers across the
      world. Including a population of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) included
      in the waiting list for a liver transplant (LT) that are not eligible for transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) or ablation as a bridge to transplant but are eligible to
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Participants will be randomly assigned to either no
      intervention or SBRT with a 1:1 allocation as per an online, central randomization service
      (Sealed Envelopeâ„¢) and stratified by site and by blood type (ABO type) using random permuted
      blocks (lengths 4 or 6). Aiming for a total sample of 332 (166 per group). Patients will be
      followed for 18 months until drop-out from waiting list or LT. A computed tomography (CT) or
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level will be performed every 3
      months while waiting. In those that get transplanted, follow-up will be carried out for
      additional 36 months (every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter).
