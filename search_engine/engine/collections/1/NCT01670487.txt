      procedures such as immunizations, needle aspirations, injections, venipuncture and
      intravenous cannulation. In general, vapocoolant sprays , have been found to be effective in
      decreasing the pain of various medical procedures. Moreover, the use of vapocoolant sprays
      ,unlike other local anesthetics , such as infiltrative lidocaine , is not associated with a
      painful injection and does affect the success rate of the procedure including intravenous
      cannulation and may even increase the success rate of the intravenous cannulation.
