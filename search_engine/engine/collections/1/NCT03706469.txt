      participants to evaluate the relative BA and effect of food on the PK of TAK-831 tablet
      formulation.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to TAK-831 in 1 of the 4 treatment sequences as following:

        -  T2 50 mg Fasted + T3 50 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fasted + T2 600 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fed

        -  T3 50 mg Fasted + T2 600 mg Fasted + T2 50 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fed

        -  T2 600 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fasted + T3 50 mg Fasted + T2 50 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fed

        -  T3 600 mg Fasted + T2 50 mg Fasted + T2 600 mg Fasted + T3 50 mg Fasted + T3 600 mg Fed

      All participants will be asked to take tablet of assigned TAK-831 on Day 1 of each treatment
      period.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 70 days. Participants will make multiple visits to
      the clinic and will be contacted by clinic approximately 14 days after the last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.
