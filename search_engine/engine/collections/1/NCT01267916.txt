      that expiratory flow limitation and as a consequence, intrinsic positive end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEPi) is present in grossly obese subjects especially in the supine position. It
      is known that there is a significant negative correlation between PEEPi present and PaO2.
      Therefore, the investigators postulated that if the reduce the PEEPi by reducing the
      respiratory rate in obese subjects, the impaired gas exchange might improve.

      The investigators tried to research the effect of low respiratory rate and high tidal volume
      on the intrinsic PEEP and gas exchange for obese subjects undergoing general anesthesia.
