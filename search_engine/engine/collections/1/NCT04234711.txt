      between conventional repair and sutureless technique for total anomalous pulmonary venous
      connection. Subjects will be enrolled at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital (GPPH) and
      three to five participating hospitals. All clinical interventions will follow the
      participating hospital's standard of care. Informed consent will be obtained from all study
      participants before study enrollment. After undergoing their surgical repairs, study
      participants will be followed up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after initial surgery and annually
      thereafter. All preoperative and postoperative medical records data will be submitted to a
      centralized database at GPPH through a secure online research platform.

      Baseline and post-operative (6 months) assessments will include a history and physical
      examination, a quality of life survey, physical examinations, liver and kidney function
      assessments, serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), echocardiography and electrocardiography.
      Besides, a small amount of common pulmonary vein tissue may be required for hematein and
      eosin staining.
