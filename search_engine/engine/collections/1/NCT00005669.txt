      doubled during the past 20 years. Obesity is closely linked with development of insulin
      resistance and other mediators of unfavorable cardiovascular risk, such as hypertension and
      dyslipidemia. These obesity-related risk factors often first appear during childhood. Since
      obese children tend to become obese adults, such children are at increased risk for
      persistence of these abnormalities into adulthood and for the early occurrence of
      obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Obesity-related insulin resistance is also largely
      responsible for the recently documented rise in the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in youth. To
      date, there is no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for children with obesity and insulin
      resistance. Metformin is a medication approved for use in adults with Type 2 diabetes that is
      unique in that it promotes weight loss and improves features of the insulin resistance
      syndrome. Preliminary studies suggest that metformin may promote weight loss in obese
      non-diabetic children. However, the mechanism of metformin-induced weight loss has not been
      elucidated. We propose to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and mechanism of
      metformin-induced weight loss in obese, hyperinsulinemic children aged 6-12.99 years. We will
      conduct a six-month randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial of metformin. All study
      participants will receive nutritional consultation and advice on appropriate diet. We will
      study the effects of metformin on weight, food intake, energy expenditure, insulin
      sensitivity, and lipids. At the end of the six-month placebo-controlled trial, all subjects
      will be offered metformin in an open label phase for an additional six months.
