      with an Stage IVa oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The study population will consist of
      patients who have not been treated previously. Patients satisfying the inclusion-exclusion
      criteria will be included in the study after obtaining a valid, written and informed consent.
      After reviewing the histopathological report, the patients will be treated as per the study
      protocol. The patients will be under regular follow-up with 3 monthly intervals for a period
      of one year and 6 monthly period in the following years. At each follow-up, patients will be
      evaluated clinically for evidence of locoregional tumor recurrence. The locoregional
      recurrence-free survival will be calculated based on the difference between the date of
      inclusion and the date of biopsy-proven recurrence. We will also record the overall survival,
      parameters like trismus, osteonecrosis and xerostomia. Quality of life will be assessed at a
      regular interval of 1 year using the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire
      (UW-QOL v.4)

      Study protocol:

        1. Preoperative radiotherapy over 5 weeks- Dose 180-200cgys per day/ total 4500 cgys

        2. Three weekly concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 100 mg /m2

        3. Initial surgery in leg for Prefabrication of fibula - 2 weeks after starting of
           radiotherapy treatment. Delay is required for planning of implant position in the
           fibula.

        4. Definitive surgical procedure with reconstruction by prefabricated flap, 6 weeks post
           radiotherapy.
