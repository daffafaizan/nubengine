    
      Primary objectives:

        -  Describe the epidemiology, clinical presentation, bleeding score, bleeding episodes,
           quality of life, laboratory parameters, genetics and treatment of homozygous and known
           heterozygous individuals (of all ages) with rare bleeding disorders (disorders of
           fibrinogen, FII, FV, FV & VIII, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII, alpha-2-antiplasmin and PAI-1
           deficiency) in the Netherlands;

        -  Examine the relationship between the clinical and laboratory presentation (clinical and
           laboratory phenotype), and between phenotypes and genetics (genotype);

        -  Examine the relationship between quality of life, phenotype and genotype;

        -  Validate the established factor activity levels for patients to remain without symptoms.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Compare the clinical presentation, bleeding score, quality of life and laboratory
           parameters of individuals with a rare bleeding disorder (disorders of fibrinogen, FII,
           FV, FV & VIII, FVII, FX, FXI, FXIII, alpha-2-antiplasmin and PAI-1 deficiency) to those
           of individuals with haemophilia A or B in cooperation with the HIN-6 investigators

        -  Establish a firm base for a future Dutch registry for homozygous and known heterozygous
           individuals with rare bleeding disorders

        -  To develop a standard set of patient-reported, clinical and administrative data to be
           collected on a regular basis

        -  Liaise with the pro-RBDD study, a similar study in Italy, to work towards a pan-European
           study linking phenotype to genotype in individuals with rare bleeding disorders

        -  To assess if the NHA can distinguish mild clinical phenotypes in patients with similar
           factor activity levels

        -  To evaluate the usefulness of saliva coagulation biomarker tests in the management of
           patients with a rare bleeding disorder

        -  To examine whether age-dependent laboratory changes in factor concentrations and
           fibrinolysis occur in individuals with rare bleeding disorders and if so, whether they
           influence clinical phenotype

        -  To evaluate if patients with rare bleeding disorders are protected from arterial
           thrombosis
