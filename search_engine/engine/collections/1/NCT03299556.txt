    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded trial with historic and concurrent
      controls to assess the effect of the addition of WHT on patient and health system outcomes.
      WHT used in this study are the Apple Watch and iPhone, a pain application (Pain App) designed
      specifically for this study to be used with the watch and phone, and physician and patient
      dashboards also designed for this study to provide subjects and health care providers data
      displays of information captured by the WHT.

      The WHT will consist of:

        -  AppleWatch and iPhone

        -  Patient and provider tracking of patient-reported pain, pain management, medication
           usage, functionality, depression, activity and sleep (measured by 3 axis actigraph)

        -  Prompts to subjects to engage in self-care, including non-pharmaceutical pain management
           therapies consistent with MPP training

      Subjects will use the WHT 20 hours per day, every day for a period of 12 months.

      Subjects will attend study visits at baseline and months 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.

      Outcome data for control groups will be collected retrospectively from the electronic health
      record (EHR). Assessments will have occurred as part of their standard of care.
