    
      Autologous T cells transduced with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that recognize the CD19
      antigen (CD19-CAR T cells) have been used in multiple clinical trials at several institutions
      worldwide. We established an in-house manufacturing process for CD19-CAR T cells with a CD28
      (cluster of differentiation 28) costimulatory domain.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To study the safety of administration of CAR T cell at the Sheba Medical Center

        2. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of administering anti-CD19-CAR T cells in
           children and young adults with B cell malignancies.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To study in vivo and in vitro behavior of CAR T cell in patients, including persistence,
           expansion, cytotoxic potential and exhaustion.

        2. To study the cytokine milieu in CAR treated patients.

      Eligibility Patients 1-50 years of age, with a CD19-expressing B-cell malignancy that has
      recurred after, or not responded to, one or more standard chemotherapy-containing regimens.

      Design Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)will be obtained by leukapheresis. Anti-CD19
      CAR T cells will be manufactured from fresh autologous PBMCs. PBMC will be cultured in the
      presence of anti-CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3) antibody and interleukin-2 followed by
      retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-CD19 CAR. Total culture time is between
      7-10 days. Patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy composed of cyclophosphamide
      and fludarabine prior to cell infusion, and on day 0 will receive one million CAR T cells per
      kilogram. Patients will be monitored for toxicity including cytokine release syndrome,
      hematologic toxicities and B-cell aplasia; for response of their underlying malignancy; and
      for CAR-T cell persistence in the blood, marrow and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).
