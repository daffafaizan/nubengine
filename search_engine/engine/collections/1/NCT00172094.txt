      the basis of a clinical history of intermittent headache with autonomic, constitutional, and
      neurologic disturbances.

      Many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have demonstrated efficacy as acute and/or prophylaxis
      therapy for migraine, even though the mechanism of action of the various AEDs is poorly
      understood.

      NPS 1776, isovaleramide, is a neutral aliphatic amide. The mechanism by which NPS 1776 exerts
      its therapeutic actions in nonclinical animal models of disease is unclear. The same is true
      for many antiepileptics on the market today. NPS 1776 does not appear to bind directly to
      various CNS receptor centers, although it shows a broad range of anticonvulsant activity in
      multiple animal models of seizures. This broad profile of anticonvulsant activity is similar
      to that of valproic acid (VPA), and may also predict NPS 1776 efficacy in the treatment of
      migraine.
