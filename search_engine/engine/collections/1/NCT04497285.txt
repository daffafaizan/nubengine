    
      Eligible patients are those who are 18 or older, either female or male, confirmed locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer of any subtype and who have received, are receiving, or
      will receive any line of treatment from metastatic disease.

      Demographic data, disease characteristics, treatment history, and quality of life data will
      be collected through a digital tool by the patient. The data are de-identified and will be
      used to advance multiple areas of research into mBC. The study will be complemented by a
      patient empowerment program that will include informative workshops and video-tutorials about
      precision medicine and the HOPE study itself. Tumor tissue samples must be submitted for
      genomic profiling using FoundationOne CDx. Blood samples for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
      profiling using Guardant360 also will be collected.

      Molecular reports will be reviewed by the Molecular Advisory Board (MAB) and recommendations
      according to the molecular profile will be sent to the patients and physicians through the
      digital tool to let them know these treatment options and also notified about clinical trials
      for which they may be eligible.

      The primary objective is to assess the real-world clinical practice of integration of
      molecular profiling in the Standard of Care (SoC) management of mBC patients connected
      through a digital tool. Secondary objectives include: to describe genetic mutational profile
      from both tests, to evaluate if a patient-centric strategy could achieve better enrollment
      than the classical approach site-physician-patient, and to assess the efficacy of the program
      to allocate patients in clinical trials.
