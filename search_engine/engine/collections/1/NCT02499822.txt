      and organ damage in hypertensive subjects. An antihypertensive treatment able to reduce BPV
      independently of BP lowering effect might thus provide additional protection in terms of
      cardiovascular risk in subjects with elevated BPV, independently on its effect of BP itself.
      However, data on the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on BPV are
      limited and inconsistent. Some studies have suggested a possible usefulness of calcium
      antagonists in this setting. Based on the above considerations the investigators hypothesize
      that a calcium channel blocker nifedipine GITS, will provide a greater BPV lowering effect,
      when compared with ramipril, independently from the reduction in mean BP level. Based on the
      above considerations, the primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of
      nifedipine GITS and ramipril on different estimates of BPV (24 h BPV, home BPV, and
      visit-to-visit BPV) in subjects with elevated BPV. The secondary objective is to assess
      whether the degree of treatment-induced changes in BPV, is related to the degree of
      regression (or progression) of organ damage, after accounting for mean BP reduction by
      treatment.
