    
      For patients whose tumors express one (1) or more of these TAPAs (Sp17, ropporin, AKAP-4,
      PTTG1, Span-xb, Her-2/neu, HM1.24, NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-1), whole blood will be obtained by
      phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis performed for generation of autologous DCs. Patient's DCs
      will be generated in Kiromic's Cell Processing GMP facility, according to established
      Standard Operating Procedures, and activated by pulsing/loading them with the TAPA(s)
      relevant for each particular patient. Patients will receive five (5) days of low-dose
      cyclophosphamide 5 to 7 days prior to each vaccination with TAPA-pulsed DCs to decrease Treg
      activity. Patients will also receive a single dose of topical Imiquimod cream after each
      vaccination. TAPA-pulsed DCs will be administered at a fixed dose of up to 1 X 107 DCs. DC
      vaccination schedule will be weekly via intradermal (ID) injections for a total of 3
      vaccinations. Topical Imiquimod cream will also be administered once after the vaccination.
      Patients will be followed on a weekly basis (or more frequently if required) to evaluate
      treatment-related toxicity. Immune efficacy and anti-tumor responses will be evaluated per
      protocol specifications. Continuation and stopping rules for the study will be defined based
      on toxicity/tolerability (Phase I) and immune efficacy (Phase II).
