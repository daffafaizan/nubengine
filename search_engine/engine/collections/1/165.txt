nucleic acid metabolism in the lens iii. effect of x-radiation .a previous communication reported an increased in vivo incorporationof p-32 into the albuminoid rna fraction of the rat lens 6 hours afterthe animal had been exposed to x-radiation (1,500 r) .in the present study, the in vitro uptake of p-32 and c-14-adenine byalbuminoid, ribosomal, and soluble rna fractions of normal and x-irradiated rat lenses was measured . the rna fractions were extracted bysodium dodecyl sulfate in 0.9 per cent nacl . the specific rna fractionswere also hydrolyzed, chromatographed (on paper), and the activity ofthe individual nucleotides (as well as the specific rna fractions) wasdetermined . an experiment was also performed in which the capsules wereremoved (after the 3 hour incubation period) and the activitiesdetermined in the nucleic acids extracted from the capsules and in thethree rna fractions of the remaining lens matter .the results of these experiments indicate that the incorporation ofp-32 and c-14-adenine into albuminoid rna was markedly stimulated 1 hourafter 1,500 r whole body radiation . there was no significant effect onribosomal or soluble fractions .the effect of formaldehyde and heating on x-irradiated albuminoid rnawas much less than on the albuminoid rna derived from control animals .
