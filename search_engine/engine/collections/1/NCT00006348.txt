      advanced cancer who suffer from chronic nausea and emesis that is not due to antineoplastic
      therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy). II. Determine
      the toxicity of ondansetron in these patients. III. Evaluate the use of other concurrent
      antiemetics in these patients when treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to abdominal carcinomatosis (yes vs no), renal insufficiency
      (creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL vs creatinine at least 2.0 mg/dL), type of cancer (brain vs
      gastrointestinal vs other), and narcotic use (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of
      two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral ondansetron twice daily on days 1-7 and oral
      placebo twice daily on days 8-14 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients
      receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-7 and oral ondansetron twice daily on days 8-14 in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      1 year.
