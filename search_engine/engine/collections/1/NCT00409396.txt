      functional symptoms. Placebo response rates in clinical trials are high. Several non-invasive
      biomarkers are currently available for assessing IBD disease activity including erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin. Although these markers hold
      some promise, their performance is less than ideal. what is needed is a simple, non-invasive
      biologic measure of UC disease.

      Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and is expressed in
      epithelial inflammatory conditions and some cancers. We have developed an assay to quantify
      the major urinary metabolite of PGE2, PGE-M. PGE-M has been previously shown to be elevated
      in the urine of patients with advanced colorectal neoplasia relative to controls. We recently
      showed that PGEm was a sensitive and specific marker of Crohn's disease activity (Accepted
      for publication at DDW 2006).
