      characterized by widespread aching and stiffness in muscles. Although there have been
      numerous studies of fibromyalgia, its etiology has remained unclear, but it is generally
      believed that central pain processing abnormalities are involved. Neurotropin, a non-protein
      extract of inflamed cutaneous tissue from rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus, has been
      used extensively in Japan for many years to treat a variety of chronic painful conditions,
      including fibromyalgia. This present protocol is a double blind, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study designed to examine the clinical efficacy of Neurotropin in treating women
      (neither pregnant nor lactating) suffering from fibromyalgia without evidence of any other
      cause of their complaint of pain. Patients must meet the American College of Rheumatology
      (ACR) diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and must agree to maintain a stable therapeutic
      regimen throughout the 25-week study.
