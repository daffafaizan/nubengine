(on the erythropoietic effect of differenttissue suspensions)the stimulating effect on erythropoiesis of regenerated liver and hyper-trophic kidney tissue after partial hepatectomy and unilateral nephrectomyrespectively was studied in the rat by means of the erythrocyte count, haemo-globin determination, reticulocyte count and 59fe utilization.  thereticulocyte count and 59fe utilization increased significantly after treatmentwith normal liver and renal tissue and more strongly after regenerated liverand hypertrophic kidney tissue.  the same effect was seen after treatmentwith the sera of rats which had undergone partial hepatectomy or unilateralnephrectomy.
