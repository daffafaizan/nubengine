    
      This is an open-label dose escalation safety study of PVS-10200 in 30 subjects with
      peripheral artery disease (PAD) requiring balloon angioplasty and stent placement in the
      superficial femoral artery (SFA). The study will be completed sequentially in two dose
      cohorts of 10 subjects (low dose group, Cohort A) and 20 subjects (high dose group, Cohort
      B). A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will conduct regular safety reviews.

      Each subject will receive one treatment of PVS-10200 delivered by ultrasound guided injection
      to the perivascular region (external to the vessel) of the stented target lesion. The
      treatment will be administered within 24 hours after balloon angioplasty/stent placement.
