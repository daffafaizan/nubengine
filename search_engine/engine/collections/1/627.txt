labial supportive appliancethe patient with a repaired cleft lip and palate and an associateddisplacement and deficiency of the premaxilla presents problems whichmay be of concern to the plastic surgeon, speech pathologist, orthodontist,and prosthodontist.the upper lip may appear flat or retruded in relation to the lower lip.when maxillary anterior teeth are missing, either congenitally, naturally(as in the mixed dentition period), or because of neglect, the upper lipmay appear to be rolled under the premaxilla.  the lower lip usuallyassumes a characteristic 'pouty' appearance.this complex of tissue deformities also may be important in the articulationof speech sounds.  fricatives and plosives are difficult to producecorrectly because of the malposition of the lip.  there may be interferencewith direction of air current, contact of tongue to alveolar ridge, andnormal contact of lips.corrective procedures are designed to improve the labial profile and toestablish more normal relationships of intraoral structures.  theseprocedures, employed individually or in combination, may include othodonticmovement of maxillary segments, dental prosthesis, and cheiloplasty.another more recently developed adjunct involves autogenousosscous implantation in the cleft areas.
