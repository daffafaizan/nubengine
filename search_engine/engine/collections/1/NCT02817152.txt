      (LLLT) for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic periodontitis in type 2 diabetic
      patients. Twenty poorly-controlled type 2 diabetic patients with moderate to severe
      generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. Two periodontal pockets with Probing Depth
      (PD) and Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) â‰¥ 5mm received ultrasonic periodontal debridement
      (UPD) only (control group) or UPD with LLLT (test group). Clinical measures, such as PD, CAL,
      Gingival Recession (GR), Bleeding on Probing (BoP), and Plaque Index (PI), were collected and
      compared at baseline, 30, 90, and 180 days. The adjunct application of LLLT to UPD had no
      additional benefits for PD reduction and CAL gain, meaning that both investigated therapies
      were efficient for the treatment of chronic periodontitis in type 2 diabetics. Nevertheless,
      additional LLLT application showed better results for GR then UPD only.
