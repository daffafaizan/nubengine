    
      Renal colic, an intensely painful condition, is a common presenting complaint to the
      emergency department. Parenteral opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
      acetaminophen are commonly used to provide relief from renal colic. The aim of the present
      trial was to investigate the analgesic efficacy and safety of Transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation treatment in patients with renal colic within the emergency department.

      Study Design and Setting: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      single-center, clinical trial will be conducted in emergency department of a tertiary care
      university hospital.
