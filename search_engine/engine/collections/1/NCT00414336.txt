    
      AMA1-C1 + CPG 7909 is a blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. The primary objective of this
      Phase 1 study is to evaluate safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine in semi-immune adults
      in Mali. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine. The study is
      a double blind Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be
      screened and 24 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the two groups:
      12 volunteers will receive two doses of 80 microgram AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500 microgram CPG;
      12 volunteers will receive 80 microgram AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel, both at a 1-month dosing
      interval. Safety outcome measures are local and systemic (including laboratory) adverse
      events. Immune responses to vaccination will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA) and growth inhibition assay (GIA), and will be compared between groups. Peripheral
      blood lymphocytes will be assayed for the presence of AMA-1-specific memory B cells and for
      the total number of memory B cells.
