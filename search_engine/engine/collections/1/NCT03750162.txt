      periodontitis which needed retreatment were selected for this study. Teeth were randomly
      divided into 3 groups according to the supplementary disinfection techniques used: Passive
      ultrasonic irrigation, Manual dynamic activation and Photodynamic therapy. Microbiological
      samples were taken before any intervention, after conventional chemo-mechanical preparation,
      and after disinfection techniques with sterile paper points and held in thioglycollate broth,
      and then were transferred to the microbiological laboratory. The amounts of e.faecalis in
      these samples was measured by using PCR.
