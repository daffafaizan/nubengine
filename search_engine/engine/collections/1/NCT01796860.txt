      place at the David M. Crowley Research and Rehabilitation Lab in the School of Health
      Professions at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The outcome measures for the
      study include: 1. GAITRite System for temporal and spatial parameters, 2. EMG of the anterior
      tibialis, gastrocnemius, and vastus lateralis muscles, 3. 6 Minute Walk Test (gait endurance)
      4. Lower extremity strength, 5. MS Fatigue scale, 6. Observational Gait Analysis - Video tape
      of over ground walking. This study will be 13 weeks long. Over the 13 week period, the
      subject will participate in 5 gait training sessions which will be at weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, and
      10. They will be 60 minutes in duration. Outcome measures will be assessed at the following
      times: initial (T1), week 5 (T2), and week 13 (T3). Subjects will be closely monitored
      throughout the 13 week study and will be un-enrolled by self-request or the following medical
      reasons: 1. Acute exacerbation of MS symptoms, 2. New diagnosis with direct consequences
      affecting gait training, 3. Inability to tolerate the study AFO.
