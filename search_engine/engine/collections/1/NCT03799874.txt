      veteran, and civilian populations. ARDS is a syndrome of severe acute lung inflammation and
      hypoxemic respiratory failure with an incidence of 180,000 cases annually in the United
      States. Despite recent advances in critical care management and lung protective ventilation
      strategies, ARDS morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. The lack of specific
      effective therapies for ARDS indicates a need for new treatments that target novel pathways.
      Carbon monoxide (CO) represents a novel therapeutic modality in ARDS based on data obtained
      in experimental models of ARDS over the past decade.

      CO has been shown to be protective in experimental models of acute lung injury (ALI) and
      sepsis. Furthermore, multiple human studies have demonstrated that experimental
      administration of several different concentrations of CO is well tolerated and that low dose
      inhaled CO can be safely administered to subjects in a controlled research environment. The
      investigators have previously conducted a Phase I trial of low dose iCO in ARDS which
      demonstrated that precise administration of low dose iCO (100 and 200 ppm) is feasible,
      well-tolerated, and safe in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of low dose inhaled carbon
      monoxide (iCO) therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS.
