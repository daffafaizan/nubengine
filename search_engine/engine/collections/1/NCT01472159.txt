      T1D and their families have routinely felt burden related to the introduction of this
      technology into their care management. Additionally, there can be difficulties with
      calibration, skin irritation, frequent skips, excessive or nuisance alarms and inaccurate
      readings which often lead to diminished use or discontinuation entirely. The purpose of this
      protocol is to implement and evaluate a family-focused behavioral teamwork intervention aimed
      at overcoming barriers to sustained CGM use in youth with T1D. In this 2-year RCT, we will
      assess the long-term acceptability and durability of CGM use and its associated glycemic and
      psychological outcomes in youth with T1D and their families. We will randomize 120 families
      to one of two groups: (1) CGM implemented according to usual care (CGM-Usual Care, CGM-UC) or
      (2) CGM implemented with a family teamwork intervention (CGM-Teamwork, CGM-TW). This
      intervention will allow participants and families to overcome barriers to sustained CGM use
      and achieve glycemic benefits that have been afforded to adults using CGM as demonstrated in
      other research. In year 1, all CGM supplies will be provided and covered by study resources.
      In year 2, study participants will be asked to cover the costs associated with sensor use and
      any costs associated with replacement of CGM components in a manner consistent with routine
      clinical care as the investigators believe that it is important to assess durability of CGM
      use in clinical practice.
