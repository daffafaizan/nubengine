    
      The Dräger Antigen Test SARS-CoV-2 is a rapid lateral flow immunoassay for the qualitative
      detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein directly from less invasive nasal swabs, to be
      performed at the point of care. The test kit contains all components required to carry out a
      test detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein.

      The study is designed to demonstrate suitability of the Dräger Antigen Test for SARS-CoV-2
      detection in clinical nasal specimens. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on
      specimens collected by pharyngeal swabs serves as a reference method.

      The goal of the study is to compare Dräger test results to the corresponding PCR data for
      overall sensitivity and specificity. Specimens are collected from patients showing COVID-19
      symptoms as well as asymptomatic participants. Participants are recruited across all genders
      and eligible age groups. Study staff records participants' information such as symptoms and
      time since symptom onset. For each study participant, the specimen for RT-PCR is collected
      first, then the Dräger test specimen. The Dräger test result is read after 15 min to 20 min.
