      clinic in faculty of Medicine, Cairo University Hospital, will be enrolled by the
      investigator in the study in a consecutive order after being examined for methotrexate
      induced oral ulceration by means of history and clinical examination.

      Since oral mucositis associated with Methotrexate include production of free radicals,
      increase of inflammatory cytokines, and alteration of intracellular signal transduction, this
      suggests that Rebamipide should be useful for its treatment and prevention. Thus, this RCT
      will be the first to evaluate the treatment of Methotrexate-induced oral mucositis using
      Rebamipide and Rebamipide nanoparticles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
