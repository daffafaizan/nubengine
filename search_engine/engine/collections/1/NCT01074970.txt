    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Safety Run-in will be for the first 12 patients on study only (6 in cohort 1 and 6 in cohort
      2). Patients in the safety run will be included in the efficacy analysis on intent to treat
      basis:

      Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles; Rucaparib 16-30 mg IV D 1,2,3 every 3
      weeks x 4 cycles

      If cycle 1 is well tolerated, the dose of Rucaparib will be escalated from 16 mg to 24 mg for
      subsequent cycles in the cohort 1, and 24 mg to 30 mg in the cohort 2.

      If ≤ 1 of 6 patients in cohort 1 experiences DLT, cohort 2 will commence. If 2 or more of 6
      patients in cohort 1 experience DLT, the study will be suspended and an amendment to explore
      lower doses will be considered.

      If ≤ 1 of 6 patients in cohort 2 experiences DLT, the randomized portion of the study will
      commence. If 2 or more of 6 patients experience DLT, the study will be suspended and an
      amendment to proceed with the randomized portion at the cohort 2 dose (24 mg) will be
      considered.

      During the randomized portion of the study, patients will be randomized to either Arm A or
      Arm B.

      Stratification factors:

        -  Anthracycline vs. not

        -  Residual LN involvement vs. No Residual LN involvement

      Arm A (Cisplatin Monotherapy) Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles

      Arm B (Combination Therapy) Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV D1 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles; Rucaparib
      16-30 mg IV D1,2,3 every 3 weeks x 4 cycles

      Rucaparib maintenance 30 mg IV weekly x 24 weeks

      ECOG Performance Status 0-1

      Life Expectancy: Not Specified

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) > 9.0 g/dL

        -  Platelets > 100 K/ mm3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 1.5 K/mm3

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin < upper limit of normal (except in patients with documented Gilbert's disease,
           who must have a total bilirubin < 3.0 mg/dL)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) < 2.5 x ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) < 2.5 x ULN

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of > 50 cc/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

      Cardiovascular:

        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction within normal limits.

        -  Patients with an unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 12 months of study
           entry are excluded.

        -  No clinically significant arrhythmia or baseline ECG abnormalities in the opinion of the
           treating investigator.
