      development and growth of cancer.

      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will receive treatment with RAD001 by
      mouth every day for as long as you stay on study. Four weeks (28 days) of treatment is
      considered one course of therapy. The first 3 to 6 participants on study will receive the
      lowest dose of RAD001. If that dose is safe, the next group of 3 to 6 patients will receive
      double the dose as the first 3-6 participants. If that dose is safe, all further participants
      will start treatment at that dose.

      While on study, you will have weekly blood tests (about 2 teaspoons). Bone marrow aspirates
      and/or biopsies, x-rays and/or scans will be performed every 4-12 weeks and as often as the
      physician feels it is necessary. A physical exam will be done at Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11 and
      anytime the physician sees fit. Vital signs will be taken every week.

      You may be removed from this study if you don't respond after 4 courses of therapy,
      intolerable side effects occur, or if the disease worsens. Your dose may be temporarily held
      or decreased if certain side effects occur. If you are benefitting from the therapy, you may
      continue on it indefinitely as long as continue to benefit.

      Once you come off study, a physical exam, measurement of vital signs, a blood test (about 2
      teaspoons), a bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy, x-rays, and/or scans will be done.

      This is an investigational study. The FDA has authorized RAD001 for use in research only. A
      total of 70 -125 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.
      Anderson.
