      Upon signed informed consent, women will be asked to rank their anxiety level on a scale of
      0-10 (Verbal Numeric Anxiety Score). This scale has been used for previous studies to assess
      anxiety (Orbach-Zinger, Danon)

      In the operating room, a gastric ultrasound will be performed in the supine position and the
      antral cross sectional area will be measured. This study is purely observational, the gastric
      ultrasound assessment is non-invasive and will not cause any adverse effects or discomfort to
      the patient. Participation in the study will not affect clinical management in any way.

      Each one of the ultrasound assessments will be performed by one of the study's'
      investigators.

      Anesthesia will be induced in standard procedure and positive pressure will be instituted
      according to the standard protocol accepted in our hospital.

      At the end of the procedure, the gastric ultrasound circumference will be measured again.
