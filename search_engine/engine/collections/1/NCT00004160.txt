      and paclitaxel in combination with radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced stage IIIA
      or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. II. Assess response rate, duration of response, disease
      free survival and failure in this patient population on this regimen. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine and paclitaxel during the chemoradiotherapy phase.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Induction phase: Patients receive
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses. Chemoradiotherapy phase: Patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes beginning 2 hours into
      paclitaxel infusion on day 1 of weeks 6, 9, and 12. Patients undergo conventional chest
      radiotherapy on Monday though Friday for weeks 6-11. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive
      escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 5 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 17 patients will be accrued for this study.
