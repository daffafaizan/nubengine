    
      Primary Objective: Determine the effectiveness of mPATH-Lung on receipt of LCS in a
      randomized pragmatic clinical trial of 1318 patients recruited from two large health
      networks, Wake Forest Baptist Health and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Elucidate the drivers of patients' decisions to receive or forgo LCS through a values
           clarification exercise embedded within mPATH-Lung and supplemental semi-structured
           interviews of at least 50 patients.

        -  Assess several critical implementation outcomes (reach, acceptability, and
           appropriateness) to inform the sustainability and scalability of mPATH-Lung across
           diverse primary care settings
