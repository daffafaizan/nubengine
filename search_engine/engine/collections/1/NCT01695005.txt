    
      In Part A of this study, participants with advanced/metastatic cancer (including lymphoma)
      will receive increasing doses of LY3039478 to define the dose level for Part B, C, D and E.
      In Part B, C, D and E LY3039478 will be explored at a predefined fixed dose level.
      Participants in Part B and D must have a defined alteration in a certain molecular pathway.
      Enrollment of participants in Part B, C, D and E will start once Part A is completed. In Part
      F participants will receive increasing doses of LY3039478 in combination with prednisone to
      define the maximum tolerated dose level.
