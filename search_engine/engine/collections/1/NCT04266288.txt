      attempt, or severe depression, or if the patient indicates during intake assessment that they
      have thoughts of harming or killing their self. Identified patients will be assessed by the
      ED provider for inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient is a candidate for the trial
      and gives their informed consent for enrollment, they will be randomized to receive either
      ketamine or placebo by a computer program that maintains blinding. The patient will be
      assessed by psychiatry for disposition and treatment plan prior to receiving the study drug,
      and will be reassessed four hours after the infusion. Thirty days after the patient leaves
      the hospital (either leaves from the ED or is discharged from inpatient admission), they will
      be contacted to follow up on their healthcare utilization after discharge.
