      hypoglycaemia in totally pancreatectomised patients and at the same time evaluate whether
      hypoglycaemia affects a range of other products from endocrine cells in the gastrointestinal
      tract including ghrelin, gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucose-dependent insulinotropic
      polypeptide (GIP), GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), oxyntomodulin and peptide YY
      (PYY). Furthermore the investigators will evaluate how hypoglycaemia in these patients
      affects other counter-regulatory mechanisms including plasma responses of the hormones
      adrenaline, noradrenaline, growth hormone and cortisol as well as the rate of gastric
      emptying rate (which under normal circumstances accelerates during hypoglycaemia) during an
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
