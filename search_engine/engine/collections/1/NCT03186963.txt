      distal radius fractures. The need for postoperative immobilization after this type of
      fixation is controversial, with some authors advocating its use for analgesia. Conversely,
      the use of immobilization might retard the recovery of wrist range of motion and function.
      The objective of this study is to compare the level of pain and function of patients
      undergoing surgical fixation of distal radius fractures using or not postoperative
      immobilization. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive a plaster splint or
      conventional dressing immediately after the surgery. The main outcome is the level of pain in
      the first two weeks postoperatively.
