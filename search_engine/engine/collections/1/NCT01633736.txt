      training is effective at improving hip muscle contribution to stability then single leg
      balance may be improved. This may be functionally evident when weight bearing is taken by say
      the left leg in gait (percentage stance phase of gait) and as a consequence the opposing
      swing phase will be optimised as measured by stride. Thus the research question is does
      strengthening of the rotating and sideways moving hip muscles improve the walking of children
      with CP as measured by appropriate aspects of gait? Secondly, does this targeted
      strengthening also increase duration of single leg balance which is a simple easy to use
      measure in the community without the need for specialised equipment? The primary outcome
      measure will use a laboratory based 4 camera Codsmotion (CODA) biomechanical analysis system
      to measure stride (a) and percentage duration of stance phase of gait (b). Secondarily the
      duration of single leg balance in terms of seconds will be recorded. Gross motor functional
      and quality of life as also being assessed. The intervention is strengthening which will be
      implemented with the principles of progressive resistance training. Children with CP's
      therapists would ask for this type of intervention to be carried out
