      health status will be evaluated through a complete blood count. On the day of the experiment
      and after overnight fasting, the volunteers will consume g of mastiha oil (1ml) and blood
      samples will be obtained on timepoints 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h and 24h after intake. Until
      timepoint 6h, they will be allowed to consume only water. After collection, the monoterpenes
      will be identified in plasma samples applying a GC-MS-MS technique. Additionally, oxidative
      stress will be evaluated through the CuSO4 technique in serum samples.
