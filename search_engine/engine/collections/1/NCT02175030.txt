      United States continues to have one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancy among
      developed countries. To combat this problem, we are studying initiation of the highly
      effective intrauterine device (IUD) for women presenting for emergency contraception (EC).
      This is an ideal population to initiate highly effective reversible contraception (HERC) as
      they are at high risk of unintended pregnancy and are acting to reduce that risk. We have
      recently demonstrated significantly lower pregnancy rates 12 months after presenting for EC
      among women who selected the copper IUD versus those who selected oral Levonorgestrel (LNG).

      Not only is the copper IUD the most effective method of EC, it is considered a top tier
      anticipatory contraception method and its ability to prevent pregnancy is on par with tubal
      sterilization (less than 1% in the first year with lower failure rates in subsequent years).
      However, women selecting intrauterine contraception have shown a strong preference for the
      LNG IUD. The LNG IUD, is as effective at preventing pregnancy as the Copper IUD, and has some
      non-contraceptive effects that many women see as benefits such as the reduction or
      elimination of menstrual bleeding and menstrual related discomfort. Of currently available
      reversible contraceptives, the LNG IUD has the highest levels of user satisfaction and
      continuation. However, its effectiveness as an emergency contraceptive remains unknown. A
      randomized control trial is necessary to assess the safety and efficacy of the LNG IUD as EC.
      Demonstrating the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of the LNG IUD for EC will improve
      options for women seeking EC and who desire a highly effective method of contraception.
