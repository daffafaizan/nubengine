      studies to be effective in patients with advanced multiple myeloma. This study is being done
      to learn more about the best way to administer these drugs, either alone or in combination.
      Since it is not known at this time which treatment is the best, participants will be placed
      by chance in one of the three treatment groups:

        -  BORTEZOMIB alone

        -  BORTEZOMIB + REVLIMID

        -  BORTEZOMIB in a lower dose + REVLIMID.

      This chance selection process is called randomization and is often used in research studies.
