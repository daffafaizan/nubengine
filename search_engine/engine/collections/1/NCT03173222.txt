      of life. Most patients have associated nausea and vomiting. Pain control for such patients is
      the mainstay of AP management. Opioids are safe and effective for pain control in patients
      with AP. Compared with other analgesic options, opioids may decrease the need for
      supplementary analgesia. However, frequent administration of opioid analgesics may result in
      opioid dependency. Unfortunately, any innovative treatment for the pain better than opioids
      has not been developed in the medical science so far. Therefore, the development of novel
      treatment for pain relief without triggering dependency is urgent. Acupuncture originated in
      China approximately 2000 years ago and is one of the oldest medical procedures in the world.
      Acupuncture continued to be developed and codified in texts over the subsequent centuries and
      gradually became one of the standard therapies used in China. Later, acupuncture was
      introduced to other countries including Asia, Europe, and Unites States. The most thoroughly
      studied application of acupuncture is for pain relief. In this sense, acupuncture in the
      oriental medicine could be an appropriate alternative for opioid analgesics, since it has
      been known as an effective treatment for pain relief without dependency. Electroacupuncture
      (EA) is a form of acupuncture where a small electric current is passed between pairs of
      acupuncture needles. Previous studies suggested that EA blocks pain by activating a variety
      of bioactive chemicals through peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal mechanisms. Therefore, we
      plan to prove the efficacy of EA for pain relief in patients with AP compared with
      conventional treatment.
