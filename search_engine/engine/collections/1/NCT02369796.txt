      overweight/obese males with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This study will look at the
      effects of TAK-448 on serum testosterone at different doses and different dosing frequencies.

      The study will enroll 15 patients. There will be 5 cohorts and participants will be assigned
      to cohorts in sequential order. Cohorts will be assigned to the following treatment groups:

        -  TAK-448 3 µg once weekly

        -  TAK-448 1 µg once weekly

        -  TAK-448 0.3 µg once weekly

        -  TAK-448 0.3 µg twice weekly

        -  TAK-448 0.1 µg twice weekly

      All participants will be administered study drug via SC injection once or twice a week
      depending on their assigned cohort for four weeks.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 32 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the
      clinic (depending once-weekly or twice-weekly dosing), and will be contacted by telephone 1
      week after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
