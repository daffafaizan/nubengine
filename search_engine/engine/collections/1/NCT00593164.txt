      recommended for comatose post resuscitation patients by the International Liaison Committee
      on Resuscitation (ILCOR), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the European
      Resuscitation Council. This prospective cohort pilot study will evaluate the clinical
      performance of a new device, the ThermoSuitâ„¢ System, to achieve therapeutic hypothermia in
      comatose patients following resuscitation from cardiac arrest, and the impact of the
      vasodilator, magnesium sulfate, on cooling performance and hemodynamics in these patients. 14
      patients will be prospectively randomized to receive either magnesium sulfate or normal
      saline (placebo) in this study.
