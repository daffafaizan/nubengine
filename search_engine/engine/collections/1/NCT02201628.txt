      gold standard of core temperature measurement, namely the temperature of blood in the heart.
      It is not known if oesophageal and nasopharyngeal temperatures correlate in children on a
      breathing machine via a tube with leak. If this study were to find a good correlation between
      oesophageal and nasopharyngeal temperature, this would allow clinicians to confidently use
      the more feasible nasopharyngeal temperature probes.

      For this study 100 children will have both nasopharyngeal and oesophageal temperatures
      measured during general anaesthesia, both in the presence and absence of a leak around the
      endotracheal tube.

      It is hypothesised that even in the presence of a leak, the temperature difference between
      the two methods will be less than 0.5 degrees centigrade.
