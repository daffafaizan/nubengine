        -  Determine the ability to recruit survivors of estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor
           (ER/PR)-negative stage I-III breast cancer to participate in a 3-month, soy-based,
           meal-replacement (Almased®) weight loss intervention.

        -  Assess the patient's ability to adhere to this intervention protocol.

        -  Measure changes in anthropometrics (body weight, bioelectrical impedance, waist
           circumference) and biomarkers (serum levels of glucose, insulin, highly specific
           C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor, insulin-like growth factor binding
           protein-3, lipids).

        -  Measure changes in health-related quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, longitudinal, pilot study.

      Patients undergo goal-oriented, cognitive-behavioral therapy comprising group counseling
      weekly for 3 weeks and individual counseling once a month. Weight loss interventions include
      behavioral techniques, dietary modification (using a portion-controlled diet and soy-based
      meal-replacement [Almased®] once or twice daily), physical activity (≥ 15 minutes per day, 6
      days a week), and social support. Weight loss is monitored weekly and patients complete daily
      logs of dietary intake and physical activity. Therapy continues for 12 weeks.

      Health-related quality of life is assessed at baseline and then weekly for 12 weeks.

      Patients undergo blood draws at baseline and at 12 weeks for analysis of C-reactive protein,
      glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor (ILGF), and ILGF-binding protein-3.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
