increased staturethe fact that some patients respond to growth-hormoneadministration with linear growth does not indicate growth-hormonedeficiency or hypopituitarism.  yet this appears tobe the main factor that led these authors to assume thattheir patients were suffering from hypopituitarism.  theconclusion that children with growth retardation should besubjected to a short trial period of treatment with growthhormone to single out those who are deficient in growth hormoneis therefore of questionable validity.rather, because of the limited supply of human growthhormone, it appears that much more stringent criteria foradministration of human growth hormone should be advocated.every effort should be made to uncover the patientswho might benefit from growth hormone by utilizing reliabletests of pituitary function and perfecting a suitable growth-hormoneassay.  those who have more than suggestive evidenceof hypopituitarism and growth-hormone deficiencyshould then be treated and carefully evaluated for responseafter long-term treatment.
