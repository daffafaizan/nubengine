experiments on the contribution of somatotrophin to prenatal growth in the rathypophyseoprivus in a fetal rat induced by decapitating the fetus in uteroretards fetal growth.  this effect can be prevented by injected somatotrophin.these observations substantially support the view that in the normal ratshortly before birth the fetal somatotrophin from the developing hypophysisgoverns in part the prenatal growth which occurs at that time.  althoughcomplete hypophysectomy of a pregnant rat retardsthe growth of fetuses, the mannerof its action is obscure.  in an individual litter, combined hypophysectomyof the mother and hypophyseoprivus in a fetus retards fetal growth but notto any greater extent than hypophysectomy of the mother withouthypophyseoprivus in the fetus.  in the intact fetus injections of somatotrophin(armour) do not accelerate fetal growth, presumably because ample fetalsomatotrophin from the developing hypophysis is present.
