      patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), most of the patients were not aware of their
      respiratory problems due to restriction in their activities.

      Respiratory dysfunction in patients with PD has not been well characterized. However, there
      are many studies showing restrictive or obstructive type respiratory disorders and decreased
      respiratory muscle strength in the literature. Ineffective cough due to decreased respiratory
      muscle strength may cause to secretion retention and secondary infections in PD patients who
      have severe symptoms. Therefore, the assessment and rehabilitation of these respiratory
      problems is important in PD patients treatment. There are studies in the literature showing
      that respiratory muscle training is effective in PD.

      Walking difficulty is seen as a common problem in PD. Typically, walking is slow despite
      adequate Levodopa therapy. It is known that exercise capacity may be affected by respiratory
      impairment, walking difficulties and personal exercise habits in patients with PD.
      Respiratory and walking problems lead to limitation of physical activity in PD, which leads
      to a decrease in exercise capacity. In a recently published article reported that walking is
      a good example of exercise.

      Although walking training is important for PD patients, there is no studies what happens to
      pulmonary function and functional exercise capacity when walking training is combined with
      respiratory muscle training in patients with Parkinson's disease. Therefore, this study
      planned to investigate the effects of walking and respiratory muscle training on pulmonary
      function and functional exercise capacity in PD.
