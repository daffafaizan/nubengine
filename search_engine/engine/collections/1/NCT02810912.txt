      continuous monitoring with the novel technique of MII-pH during the perioperative period of a
      variety of common surgical procedures under SAD-based general anesthesia in this pilot study.
      Furthermore, investigators will also determine the factors associated with the occurrence of
      gastroesophageal regurgitation during these various surgical procedures under general
      anesthesia.

      Investigators include the patients who will receive scheduled surgery under SAD-based general
      anesthesia and aged >= 20 will be enrolled. All subjects provide basic demographic data and
      fill in standard symptom questionnaire for evaluation of baseline severity of
      gastroesophageal reflux and other associated gastrointestinal and sleep symptoms.
      Supraglottic airway device with i-gel will be inserted to establish airway, and the gastric
      content will be suctioned out through the esophageal vent of i-gel. MII-pH catheter will be
      inserted though the esophageal vent of i-gel to detect and characterize gastroesophageal
      reflux events in the perioperative period. After removal of SAD, the patients were follow the
      saturation, sore throat or hoarseness in the postoperative care unit, as well as the possible
      complications.

      Investigators will not only elucidate the clinical characteristics and risk factors in
      patients receiving elective surgeries, but also determine the severity of gastric
      regurgitation during the intraoperative period.

      Investigators will correlate the reflux pattern, frequency, content and proximal extent of
      all reflux events and symptom correlation with clinical features in the intraoperative
      period. The study results could help us study more in the gastric regurgitation in
      perioperative period.
