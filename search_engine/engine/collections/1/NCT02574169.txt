    
      Two ARM are compared in this study:

        -  The eSigh or extended sigh with increase of PEEP for 10 minutes to maintain plateau
           pressure at 40 cmH2O. During ARM, the peak pressure is limited to 50 cm H2O with
           decrease of tidal volume (Vt) if necessary.

        -  The continuous positive airway pressure, or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
           with application of a positive pressure of 40 cm H2O for 40 seconds without tidal
           volume.

      Patients are randomized to receive in cross-over 2 ARM: CPAP and Extended Sigh (eSigh). The
      following data: oxygen tissue partial pressure (PtiO2), respiratory parameters, systemic and
      intracerebral hemodynamic parameters are collected before, after 1 minute, 10 minutes and 60
      minutes for each ARM.
