      I. To evaluate the safety of adoptive therapy with ex vivo expanded autologous CD8+ plus CD4+
      T cells transduced to express a human B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeting chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) for patients with relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence and the phenotype of long lived CAR-T
      cells.

      II. To determine the degree to which adoptively transferred T cells traffic to multiple
      myeloma (MM) cells in the bone marrow (BM) and function in vivo.

      III. To estimate the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred BCMA-specific
      CAR-expressing T lymphocytes (BCMA CAR-T cells).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of BCMA-specific CAR-expressing T lymphocytes.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain their immune cells, from which CAR-T cells are
      produced. A few weeks later, patients then receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days
      -4 to -2. Beginning 36-96 hours after chemotherapy, patients receive BCMA-specific
      CAR-expressing T lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes on day 0. Patients may
      receive a second dose of BCMA-specific CAR-expressing T lymphocytes IV with or without
      additional cytoreductive chemotherapy at the discretion of the principal investigator or
      their designee (sub-investigator).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60, 90, 120, 180, and 365
      days and then annually up to 15 years.
