      participate in this prospective non interventional study in 2 CF centers ( UCL and UZ
      Leuven). Jointly we take care of more than 40 % of the Belgian CF population. Median FEV1 of
      children (6 - <18 y, n >120) from these CTN centers is high ( around 100% pred), defining a
      study group of great interest in the current context.

      To assess the predictive value of LCI over 2 years, the time to next pulmonary exacerbation
      will be evaluated in the entire cohort. To assess the predictive value of LCI over 2 years,
      the time to next pulmonary exacerbation will be evaluated in the entire cohort.

      Repeat LCI measurements will be done at subsequent patient visits.

      2 devices measuring the LCI will be tested and compared : Ecomedics and NDD.

      LCI and spirometry will be measured in 120 healthy Belgian children and young adults. These
      subjects must be free of respiratory symptoms for at least two weeks and will not have any
      chronic or recurrent chest problem.
