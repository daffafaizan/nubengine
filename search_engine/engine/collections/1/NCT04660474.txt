      However, arrhythmias after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly VAs, also occur in
      the early post-MI phase, leading to increased mortality. Previous studies have shown benefits
      of late reperfusion to electrical stability. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      association between different reperfusion timing and VAs to provide evidence for clinical
      decision-making for STEMI. In this multicenter, prospective, observational study, STEMI
      participants from July 2019 to December 2020 confirmed according to the 4th universal
      definition of myocardial infarction were enrolled, with a follow-up of 1, 6, 12 months,
      respectively. SO2RT was defined as the time interval between symptom onset and reperfusion
      timing which referred to the timing when coronary angiography showed Thrombolysis In
      Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) blood flow level 2~3 immediately after percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI). The primary end point was VAs on 24h-dynamic electrocardiogram. Secondary
      outcomes included a composite of death from coronary heart disease, fetal of non-fetal
      ischemic stroke, revascularization, or chest pain requiring readmission.
