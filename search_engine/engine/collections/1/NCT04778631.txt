      experience perineal lesions and 20% an episiotomy. Obstetrical anal sphincter injuries
      (OASIS) are the most feared due to the risk of anal incontinence, but they concerned a
      minority of women (0.8%). For most of the women with simple lesions of the perineum, the
      primary consequence is pain. This moderate to severe perineal pain affects between 40% and
      95% of women and peaks in intensity the day after childbirth. This pain might be disabling,
      impair the mobility, the establishment of breastfeeding, the mother-infant bond, alter the
      emotional state and overall might affect the quality of life of mothers.

      Thermotherapy provides a minimally invasive and inexpensive alternative to limit perineal
      pain in postpartum, thanks to the effects of local heating or cooling application to the
      perineum :

        -  Heat therapy with warm compresses, to protect the perineum during active second stage of
           labor and reduce the degree of perineal injury : the application promotes vasodilation
           and extensibility of tissues;

        -  Cryotherapy with instant cold pack, to prevent the onset of pain in the immediate
           postpartum period: the application limits the development of oedema or hematoma.

      Midwives frequently use thermotherapy with heat or cold. However, these practices cannot be
      recommended due to a lack of data. Moreover, the potentially synergic effect of consecutive
      application of heat and cold therapy into the perineum during active second stage of labor
      and immediate postpartum period has never been evaluated. We hypothesize that thermotherapy
      during childbirth may reduce postpartum perineal pain.
