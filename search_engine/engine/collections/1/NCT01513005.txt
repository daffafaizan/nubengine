    
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the patients with morbid obesity
      requiring a surgical approach by Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy could be operated according
      to a "day-case surgery" modality.

      The sequence of this study is the following:

        2. medical records of each patient are reviewed by an obesity-related staff: Laparoscopic
           Sleeve Gastrectomy is proposed.

        3. during a second consultation, the surgeon informed the patient about the proposition of
           the staff and his potential inclusion in this study

        4. after obtained his consent, the surgical procedure is planned and Laparoscopic Sleeve
           Gastrectomy is done in the Day-Case Surgery Unit.

        5. the following day the surgery, a nurse calls the patient to identify a potential
           postoperative outcome (nausea, vomiting, uncontrolled pain...)

        6. the 8th postoperative day, a consultation is done with laboratory tests and dietary
           follow-up.
