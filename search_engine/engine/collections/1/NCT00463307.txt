      with a "golden standard" methode, in an area of Kenya where the infection transmission is
      low. Furthermore will the urine test strip be evaluatied in its ability to monitor the
      intensity of infections in school children before and after they are been treated for the
      infections.

      A total of 1100 school children in the age between 10 and 18 years will be included in the
      study. Children have to submitt a stool and a urine sample on three consecutive days.
      Children who are found to be infected with the schistosomiasis parasite will be offered
      treatment.
