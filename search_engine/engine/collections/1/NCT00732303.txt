    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Pemetrexed (Alimta) 500mg/m2 administered intravenously over approximately 10-minutes on
           Day 1 of a 21-day cycle x 3 cycles

        -  Radiation will start between days -1 to 2 from day 1 of cycle 1. Day 1 radiotherapy must
           be a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.

      The planned radiation dose is 60 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions. The entire PTV, including primary
      tumor and areas of known nodal disease, shall receive 60 Gy at 2.0 Gy fractions, 5
      fractions/week for 30 fractions over 6 weeks.
