        -  Measure the effects of surgery and radiation on concentrations of high-sensitivity
           C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in women with newly diagnosed stage I-III invasive breast
           cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.

        -  Measure the effects of chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy on concentrations of hsCRP
           in these patients.

        -  Summarize the differences in preoperative to peri-chemotherapy hsCRP concentrations
           separately for patients who do and who do not receive growth factors during
           chemotherapy.

        -  Observe the change in hsCRP concentrations and gene methylation over time with local and
           systemic treatment in these patients.

        -  Explore prevalence of baseline and change in methylation in a panel of genes that is
           known to be frequently and specifically hypermethylated in breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      A blood sample is collected at baseline, approximately 1 week after surgery, and at the time
      of a routine follow-up visit 3-6 months after completion of all local and systemic therapy,
      except for patients receiving endocrine therapy. For patients receiving adjuvant
      chemotherapy, a blood sample is collected prior to beginning chemotherapy and once during the
      final 2 courses of chemotherapy. For patients receiving radiotherapy, a blood sample is
      collected during the final 2 weeks of radiotherapy. For patients receiving endocrine therapy,
      a blood sample is collected between 2 and 6 months after starting endocrine therapy. Patients
      also complete a questionnaire about overall health and concurrent medications at baseline and
      during each follow-up visit.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
