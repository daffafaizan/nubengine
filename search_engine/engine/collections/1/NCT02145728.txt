    
      A multi-centre randomised study with 6 month, 12 month and 36 month follow up will be used.
      Patient with non- specific chronic low back pain will be assessed for eligibility. The
      patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be randomised to receive either the individual
      CFT or the group classes consisting of education and exercise. Participants' pain,
      disability, socio-economic status, beliefs, fear, catastrophizing, self-efficacy, general
      health, stress levels, as well as number and cost of treatments will be evaluated using a
      range of outcome measures at the start and on completion of the treatment. Patients will
      receive another copy of the questionnaires in the post at 6 month, 12 months and 36 months
      after treatment to reassess clinical outcomes. If a participant does not respond to
      follow-up, they will be telephoned to ask if they wish to complete the questionnaires.
