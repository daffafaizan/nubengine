    
      Fifteen (15) participants, aged 12 months and over, requiring a high energy peptide based
      oral nutritional supplement drink for the dietary management.

      The ACBS requirement for evaluable data on 15 participants has informed the trial's
      recruitment target; however, we may need to exceed this target if any patients give their
      consent to join the study but then decide not to participate in the study. Participants who
      join the study and begin using the product would count towards the recruitment total and
      their data would be included in a submission to the ACBS whether they complete the 7-day
      study period or not.

      Each potential participant must meet all of the inclusion criteria and not meet any of the
      exclusion criteria.
