    
      It is a monocentric interventional prospective study. Each subject will have to pass two MRI.
      Phase contrast MRI (PC-MRI) will be calibrated for each subject by assessing the optimal
      encoding velocity. Three sequences including the aqueduct and the two interventricular
      foramina (IVF) will be done. The signal will be analysed by syngo.via software after defining
      by two different investigators the region of interest (ROI) which correspond to the IVF or
      the aqueductal lumen. Descriptive statistics will test the intra-individual and
      inter-observer consistency based on 4 flow parameters.
