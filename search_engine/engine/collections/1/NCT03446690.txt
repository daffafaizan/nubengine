      decalcification, with the latter occurring at a much higher frequency. While the processes
      that lead to enamel demineralization are understood, methods to diminish or perhaps eliminate
      degradation of enamel surfaces are being searched for. A new product, MI Varnish, is current
      available and has been shown in some initial case reports to be useful in reducing white spot
      lesions. It contains a special milk-derived protein RECALDENT TM (CPP-ACP) in which the
      casein phosphopeptides (CPP) bind to teeth, dentin, and oral mucosa while the amorphous
      calcium phosphate (ACP) releases calcium and phosphate. The current study aimed to determine
      if MI Varnish has an effect in preventing the formation of white spot lesions for patients
      undergoing orthodontic treatment. 33 subjects were prospectively recruited for the project as
      the MI Varnish group, with a control group of 29 orthodontically treated subjects who
      received routine treatment and oral hygiene regimes. The study group received the MI Varnish
      on the day of bracket bonding. Subjects were recalled initially for 4 weeks (twice) and then
      at 3 monthly intervals. Difference in prevention of white spot formation between the control
      and the study groups were evaluated through photographic records and clinical examination by
      using the Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI) scores.
