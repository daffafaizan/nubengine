      causing detrimental effects on cardiovascular outcomes being anxiety as one of the first
      responses to chest pain and hospital admission causing tachycardia. This study is designed to
      achieve the goals of lowering the heart using the anxiolytic property of alprazolam. This
      randomized, parallel group, close label, placebo-controlled, event driven, interventional
      clinical superiority study will be conducted in Cardiology department of Shaikh Zayed
      Hospital with a sample size of 48 allocating using lottery method in both experimental and
      control group. Heart Rate at baseline and after 6 hours will be monitored in both groups to
      establish the fall of heart rate in both patients. Data will be collected by using
      pre-designed performa and will be entered and analyzed via SAS 9.4. Statistical analysis will
      be done using T-test and p value <0.05 will be considered significant.

      Significance of the study is to lower the required dosage of beta-blockers in order to
      achieve optimum beta-blockade using an anxiolytic while not affecting the blood pressure.
