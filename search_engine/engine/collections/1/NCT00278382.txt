      I. Determine the overall response rate, including complete and partial responses, in patients
      with chemosensitive, relapsed, aggressive, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with sorafenib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      II. Determine response duration in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
