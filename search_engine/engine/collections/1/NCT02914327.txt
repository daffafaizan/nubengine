      considered curable outside of allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      BTK is a critical kinase in the B cell receptor signaling pathway. This pathway is amplified
      in CLL and results in amplification of proliferation and anti-apoptotic signals. By
      inhibiting BTK, ibrutinib eliminates the activation of these pro-survival pathways and
      microenvironment survival signals. While response to ibrutinib has been high with therapy
      well-tolerated overall, some patients have relapsed while others have been taken off therapy
      for toxicity or other reasons. Relapse in CLL can be mediated by at least two separate
      mechanisms. One is by mutations in BTK, which both decrease ibrutinib's affinity for BTK, and
      also changes the binding from irreversible to reversible. This is a proof of concept study to
      investigate whether the addition of SNX-5422 to an established dose of ibrutinib will reduce
      mutated BTK from CLL cells and/or prevents or delays disease progression of subjects with
      CLL.

      This is an open-label study of SNX-5422 combined with ibrutinib. In each 28 day cycle,
      SNX-5422 will be dosed in the morning once every other day for 21 days, followed by a 7-day
      drug-free period. Subjects will continue to receive daily oral ibrutinib at their established
      dose level in the afternoon every day for 28 days. cycle
