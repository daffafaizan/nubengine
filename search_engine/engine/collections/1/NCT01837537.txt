    
      Volunteer subjects from a hospital setting (see specific inclusion/exclusion criteria) over
      the age of 18, male and female, who provide written informed consent prior to the procedure,
      and are without any contact skin allergies to adhesives found in standard pulse oximetry
      sensors. A cross section of demographics - cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic type
      cases should be considered for a broad distribution of medical and surgical patients.

      The study consists of measuring parameters related to respiration in hospitalized volunteers
      by means of the Bedside Respiratory Patient Monitoring System with RR V2.0 (Nightingale). The
      production-equivalent Nightingale device and multiparameter reference devices will be
      attached to the subject via sensors, nasal cannulas and ECG leads and the information from
      all devices will be captured continuously for up to 40 minutes to allow for at least 30
      minutes of artifact free data 30 minutes.
