      and cardiovascular disorders has been increasingly recognized, as well as the features these
      disorders have in common: insulin resistance and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Therefore,
      we are interested in the mechanisms underlying the impairment of endothelial function in
      insulin-resistant states. In particular, we have recently found that insulin stimulates the
      vascular activity of both ET-1 and NO in the normal human vasculature. It is therefore
      reasonable to speculate that the occurrence of insulin resistance and/or endothelial
      dysfunction may lead to an imbalance in this mechanism with a resulting increased vascular
      activity of ET-1.

      A new class of insulin sensitizing agents, the thiazolidinediones, have been shown to
      possess, in addition to their numerous metabolic roles, positive effects on blood pressure
      and on vascular endothelial function, including decreased endothelin-1 production and reduced
      circulating levels of endothelial surface molecules. Based on these data, we plan to
      investigate the hypothesis that thiazolidinediones may improve both insulin resistance and
      endothelial dysfunction in essential hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. We hypothesize
      that treatment with rosiglitazone improves endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in both
      conductance and resistance vessels, decreases vascular endothelin-1 activity and reduces
      plasma levels of leptin and of markers of endothelial activation.
