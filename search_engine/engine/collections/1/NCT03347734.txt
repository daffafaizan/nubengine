      included in our study. 60 participants were randomly divided into three groups: eye
      exercises, convergence exercises and oculomotor exercise groups. Home exercise protocols were
      given to all groups for 2 sessions per day for 6 weeks, and regular phone calls were made
      once a week. Participants were assessed for their hypermetropic grades by autorefractometry,
      visual acuity by snellen chart, near and sharp visual acuity by activities of daily vision
      scale, and the health-related quality of life by pediatric quality of life inventory 4.0
      version (PEDSQI 4.0) children report.
