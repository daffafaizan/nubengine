      lifestyles in children addressing the development of the social and emotional competence.
      This research followed the first three stages of the Medical Research Council framework for
      complex interventions: the theoretical, modeling phase and the exploratory trial. A
      randomised control trial with 37 children (5 y 6 years old) was conducted at the exploratory
      trial. The first unit was implemented in 8 sessions. A multi-method and multi-informant
      approach was used to assess the preliminary efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of the
      programme.
