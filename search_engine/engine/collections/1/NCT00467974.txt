      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, The drawback of conventional
      chemoembolization (TACE) for liver cancer is that it cannot effectively embolize portal
      venules supplying the tumors, therefore chemoembolization is difficult to completely
      eradicate the tumor. Usually multiple treatments are required and tumor recurrences are
      common.

      Transarterial Ethanol Ablation (LEM) can potentially provide a better treatment outcome with
      fewer treatment sessions. Preliminary results from a clinical study showed that the
      complication rate is reduced while survival rate may be improved. This study aims to compare
      survival duration and response rate between the treatments TACE and LEM.
