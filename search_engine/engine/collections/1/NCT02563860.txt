      investigators hypothesise that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the CNS will reduce
      neuronal cholesterol and lead to improvement in Rett syndrome related symptoms.

      Goal: To determine the optimal dosing regiment of Lovastatin for patients with RTT and to
      identify the most appropriate primary outcome measure for the subsequent Phase 3 study.

      Phase 2, dose escalation study.

      Primary outcome: Gait speed Secondary outcomes: respiratory function, cognition, EEG
      (encephalopathy), Rett syndrome severity scale, neurodevelopmental assessment (QOL)

      20 ambulatory female patients with genetically confirmed.
