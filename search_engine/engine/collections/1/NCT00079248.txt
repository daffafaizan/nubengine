        -  Compare disease-free survival and overall survival of postmenopausal women with prior
           stage I or II breast cancer treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) vs
           nonhormonal alternatives to HRT.

        -  Compare relief of menopausal symptoms and quality of life of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare cardiovascular and osteoporotic events in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, age (< 40 years vs ≥ 40 years), and years from diagnosis (≤ 2 vs > 2 to
      < 5 vs ≥ 5). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral or transdermal HRT comprising estrogen with or without
           progesterone for at least 2 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients are offered advice on nonhormonal HRT alternatives. Menopausal symptoms
           are assessed at baseline, at 3, 6, and 12 months, every 6 months for 4 years, and then
           annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 3, 6, and 12 months,
           every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,800-3,000 patients (1,400-1,500 per treatment arm) will be
      accrued for this study.
