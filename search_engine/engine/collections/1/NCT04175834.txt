      indication of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) and Primary Progressive Multiple
      Sclerosis (PPMS). The landmark studies used to gain approval found ocrelizumab (OCR) to be
      well tolerated, but that at least one Infusion-Related Reaction (IRR) occurred in about
      one-third of patients. Because of this, neurologists typically prescribe prophylactic
      premedication with 100mg of methylprednisolone, 1 gram of acetaminophen, and 50 mg of IV
      diphenhydramine. However, many patients experience extreme sedation that interferes with
      their lifestyle considerably.

      This 6-month randomized controlled pilot study will determine whether there is some evidence
      that cetirizine is better tolerated than diphenhydramine without an increase in IRRs.
      Fifty-two patients, 26 patients per arm, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      cetirizine or diphenhydramine as premedication prior to OCR infusions on day 0 (1st half dose
      of 300mg), day 14 (2nd half dose of 300mg) and week 24 (1st full dose of 600mg).
