    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and
      clinical efficacies of HLA-A*2402 or HLA-A*0201 restricted epitope peptides (VEGF-R1 and
      VEGF-R2) emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for advanced solid tumors.

      In this phase I/II trial, the investigators examine using a combination of the two peptides
      the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A*2402 or
      HLA-A*0201-positive advanced solid tumor patients who are refractory to standard therapy.
