    
      One hundred (100) healthy volunteers, 50 normal weight (NW) and 50 overweight (OW), age 6-30
      will be recruited for the current study. All participants and/or their parents will sign
      informed consent prior to their participation. Participants will visit the clinic 4 times,
      with a week's difference between them. Participants will arrive at the clinic after 12 hours
      of fasting and avoiding physical activity for 14 hours. During the first visit, their RMR
      will be measured, and 15min later they will perform 60 min of aerobic training, and 15
      minutes later they will be asked to drink 300ml of water, followed by a second RMR test. In
      the consecutive visits they will follow the same routine without the first RMR test, and
      drink either carbohydrate enriched shake, protein enriched shake or fat enriched shake; in a
      random order.
