      International Staging System (ISS) stage 1, 2, or 3 multiple myeloma with MAGE-A3 tumor
      antigen expression. Subjects received a total of 8 immunizations with 300 µg of recMAGE-A3 +
      AS15. The first immunization was administered approximately 6 to 15 weeks prior to auto-SCT
      (Day 0), with subsequent immunizations administered every 3 weeks (± 3 days) starting 10 days
      after auto-SCT (ie, Days 10, 31, 52, 73, and 94). Two additional immunizations were
      administered at 3-month intervals (± 7 days, ie, Days 180 and 270). No dose adjustments were
      allowed. Platelet counts must have been ≥ 50 x 10E9/L prior to immunization, with blood
      product transfusions permitted as necessary.

      The process for auto-SCT comprised the following: (1) up to 3 steady-state leukopheresis
      procedures to collect and freeze a sufficient quantity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs), with the first leukopheresis performed 3 weeks (± 6 days) after the first
      immunization; (2) stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide, granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) and/or plerixafor; (3) high-dose melphalan (total dose 200 mg/m2)
      on Days -3 through -1; (4) auto-SCT on Day 0; and (5) re-infusion with thawed PBMCs on Day 3.
