      be randomly assigned to receive an antiretroviral regimen based on Zidovudine
      (AZT)+Lamivudine (3TC)+Raltegravir or AZT+3TC+Lopinavir/r (LPV/r). They will be followed up
      to the delivery, and plasma viral load will be measured. The rate of HIV
      mother-to-child-transmission will be compared between groups. The newborns will be followed
      up to 6 months, to register any adverse event during this period of time.
