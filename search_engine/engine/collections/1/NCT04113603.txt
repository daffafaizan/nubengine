      following equation:

      n2=〖(Z∝+Zβ/2)〗^2/〖(δ-|ε|)〗^2 [p1(1-p1)/k+p1(1-p2)]

      ∝=0.05, β=0.2, δ=0.05, p1=0.96, p2=0.80 Then, the number of each arm patient should be ≥ 141
      patients. However, if 20 % of the enrolled patients by fitting inclusion criteria are
      excluded by fitting exclusion criteria, the number of each arem should be ≥ 176 patients.
      Thus, this study plans to enroll 352 patients (for two arms). The enrolled patients are
      randomized to two groups (using single-bolus CTU versus using split-bolus CTU) using permuted
      block method.
