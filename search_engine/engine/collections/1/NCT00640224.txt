      1) to compare effects of treatment with drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol (Yasmin)versus
      rosiglitazone (Avandia) on hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, adrenal
      hyperresponsiveness, body composition, chronic inflammation, bone mass and turnover.

      OCPs are the first-line therapy for PCOS, however, they do not address the insulin resistance
      or the inflammation. Insulin sensitizers have been used successfully to treat PCOS but
      thiazolidinediones such as rosiglitazone have not been used in adolescents. Therefore we will
      investigate the effects of treatment with drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol versus rosiglitazone
      in overweight adolescents with PCOS. We will obtain comprehensive evaluations before and 6
      months after randomization, to the respective treatment arms to determine the differences
      between the 2 treatment modalities.
