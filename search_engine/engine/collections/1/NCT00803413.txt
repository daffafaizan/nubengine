    
      From August 2002 to March 2004, one hundred nineteen volunteers sedentary women with chronic
      LBP and age ranging from 32 to 60 years old, randomly allocated to four groups of
      participants assigned as Back School (BS; N=28), Supervised Walking (W; N=32), Back School
      and Supervised Walking (BS+W; N=29), and Control Group (CG; N=30) were submitted to
      interventions once a week for 5 consecutive weeks and followed for up to 6 months. The groups
      BS, W, and BS+W received LBP-targeted lectures and on-place practical sessions of each
      respective intervention. CG received print information about LBP and 5 different lectures
      unrelated to LBP.
