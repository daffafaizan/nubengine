    
      Phase A Approximately 150 consecutive patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery (bypass
      and / or valve surgery)

        -  Data regarding standard of care post-operative pacing and treatment of POAF, if
           applicable, will be collected from time of surgery until discharge

        -  No use of an external bi-atrial pacing device

        -  No use of Defipace

        -  In-hospital data will be collected for all patients

        -  Patients that developed POAF (n=50) will be followed-up with a phone call 30 days after
           surgery.

      Phase B Approximately 300 consecutive patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery (bypass
      and / or valve surgery) with planned TMA implantation

        -  In-hospital data will be collected for all patients

        -  Use of the DefiPace system for the treatment (low-energy cardioversion) and
           post-operative prevention (bi-atrial pacing) of POAF will be documented (n=100). These
           patients will be followed-up with a phone call 30 days after surgery
