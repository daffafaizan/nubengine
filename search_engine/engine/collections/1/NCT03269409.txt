      agent for the treatment of ON. However, to the authors knowledge no RCT in the United States
      has formally evaluated safety of ADRC in the setting of ON. Therefore, the primary endeavor
      of this Phase I pilot study will be to evaluate safety of ADRC for pre-collapse ON of the
      femoral head.

      The Celution 800/GP System (Cytori Therapeutics, San Diego, USA) for preparation of ADRC from
      lipoaspirate is currently being evaluated in FDA approved clinical trials including an
      orthopedic indication (osteoarthritis). In addition, the device has a CE Mark registration in
      Europe and Class I approval in Japan. As such, it serves as a known platform that produces a
      clinical grade product for human use. Other devices on the market process lipoaspirate by
      either mechanical, washing, or centrifugation methods; however, the remaining components of
      original adipose tissue are significant and impair the regenerative process. Derivation of
      relatively pure ADRC has been achieved by few devices and the Cytori Celution 800/GP System
      is the only one to our knowledge with a sufficient safety and efficacy track record enabling
      multiple investigational device exemption (IDE) approvals. The reagent used (CelaseÂ®) is of a
      clinical and pharmacologic grade for use in humans. The production of Celase is free of
      mammalian products.
