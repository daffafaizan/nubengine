      retinopathy progresses when poorly controlled Type 2 diabetic patients initiate intensive
      blood sugar control and (2) to determine if there are biomarkers that predict progression of
      diabetic retinopathy. Typically, the retina is thought to undergo rapid progression of
      diabetic retinopathy, although this has been poorly characterized in a formal study.

      The first goal will be quantified by taking initial photos of the retina with the Pictor Plus
      hand-held fundus camera, as well as monthly photos (when the patient is scheduled for their
      endocrinology appointments, throughout a 90 day period). The second goal will be accomplished
      by testing the patient's blood. There will be an initial blood withdraw, as well as blood
      withdraws at monthly intervals throughout the same 90 day period as the fundus photos.

      This study will help us to understand the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, as well as
      potentially lead to an improved understanding of progression of diabetic retinopathy.
