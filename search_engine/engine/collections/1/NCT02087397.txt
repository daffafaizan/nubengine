      anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The adipose
      tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of the adipose tissue derived
      stem cells. In addition, peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of platelet rich
      plasma, which are then combined with the ASC's for direct injection to the Corpus Cavernosum
      (Penis).
