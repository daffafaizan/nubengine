      certified coated balloon and an uncoated balloon is evaluated in patients with in-stent
      restenoses/reocclusions of the lower limb artery. The whole lesion length should be covered
      by the balloon so that proximal and distal overlap of the lesion by a minimum of 5mm is
      assured. Based on the current literature the average restenoses rate of the lower limb
      arteries after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of an in-stent restenosis is 70% after 6
      months. Assuming the restenosis rate reduces to 30% after percutaneous transluminal
      angioplasty using a drug-coated balloon, with a significance level of Alpha=0.05 (bilateral)
      and a power Beta=0.8, the enrolment of 100 patients is required in order to show a
      significant difference between treatment groups, considering a dropout rate of 30%. The
      choice of treatment will be distributed in a randomised, double blind procedure.

      The study duration per patient is 2 years. Clinical follow-up evaluations will take place
      after 3 and 6 months and after 1 and 2 years. After 3 month and 12 months an angiography of
      the target vessel will be performed.
