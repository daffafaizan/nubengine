      becomes the leading causes of death in East and South-East Asia. Though hepatectomy is the
      treatment of choice for early stage cancer, the recurrence has been reported as 30%, 62% and
      79% in 1st, 3rd and 5th year respectively. Chulabhorn hospital, a cancer institute
      established in 2011, has been performing a 3-years retrospective study on the influencing
      factors and its correlation to liver carcinoma after surgery.
