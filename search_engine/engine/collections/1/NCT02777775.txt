      Apart from surgery, very few treatment options exist. In comparison to other types of tumors
      in NF1, skin tumors receive less attention in the research world because they almost never
      turn into cancer. Under the microscope, skin tumors and plexiform tumors look similar,
      however they do not share the same growth potential, nor do they appear at the same time
      during development. These differences suggest that skin tumors are driven by different
      factors than plexiform tumors.

      In this study we will be harvesting CNFs from 3 groups of subjects in order to obtain a
      minimum of 18 tumors in three size categories: <5mm, 5-10mm, and >1cm. These sizes were
      selected based on the variable natural history of CNF progression where incipient lesions
      (typically <5mm) are more numerous and demonstrate a less aggressive growth pattern, whereas
      the intermediate group (5-10mm) represent a transition state towards growth to larger (>1cm)
      lesions. Interestingly, CNF growth tends to stall out at 3cm. We plan to do experiments that
      identify which factors are important to CNF progression, and then find matching drugs that
      can shrink the tumors.
