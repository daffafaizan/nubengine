      safe and tolerable dose of ASN003 for subjects with advanced solid tumors. Part A will also
      characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASN003 through blood sampling and
      optional biopsies.. Part B will only enroll subjects in three groups:

      Group 1: subjects who have metastatic or recurrent melanoma with the BRAFv600 mutation.

      Group 2: subjects who have advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, or colorectal
      cancer with the BRAFv600 mutation.

      Group 3: subjects who have advanced or metastatic cancers with phosphatidylinositide
      3-kinases (PI3K) mutations, or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss mutation. Subjects
      will be treated with the highest safe and tolerable dose determined in Part A of the study to
      determine preliminary efficacy. Subjects may continue to receive ASN003 for up to 1 year in
      the absence of severe side effects or disease progression.
