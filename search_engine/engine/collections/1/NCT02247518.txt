    
      This study is a randomized, open-label, mutiple dosing, 2-way crossover design to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetic effect of tamsulosin(0.2mg) on tadalafil(5mg) in healthy male subjects.
      Subjects will receive repeated dose of tadalafil (5mg*1t/day) or tadalafil (5mg*1t/day) /
      tamsulosin (0.2mg*1t/day) for 5days. Each treatment period was separated by a washout period
      of at least 10 days.

      Each period of study will enroll 8 healthy male subjects. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic
      analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be assessed by
      measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, safety laboratory data, and review of adverse
      events.
