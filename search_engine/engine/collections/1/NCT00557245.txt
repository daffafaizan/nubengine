      HIV-acquisition. The majority of HIV-1 transmissions to adults in Africa occur within stable,
      HIV-1 discordant couples.

      Pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis, in which an HIV-1 uninfected individual at high risk for
      contracting HIV-1 takes antiretroviral medications to maintain blood and genital drug levels
      sufficient to prevent HIV-1 acquisition, has been proposed as a potential HIV-1 prevention
      strategy.

      This study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial to demonstrate if pre-exposure
      prophylaxis decreases HIV-1 acquisition among HIV-1 uninfected individuals within HIV-1
      discordant couples. The HIV-1 uninfected partner was randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of
      three arms: once daily Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF), Emtricitabine/Tenofovir
      Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/TDF) or Placebo.

      Couples were followed up to 36 months; the HIV uninfected partner attended monthly visits and
      the HIV infected partner quarterly visits. All participants received a comprehensive package
      of HIV prevention services including individual and couples counseling, free condoms, and
      male circumcision referrals.

      Participants who seroconverted during follow-up stopped the study drug but continued with
      follow-up.
