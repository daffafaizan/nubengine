    
      This study includes a Prestudy Period; a treatment period where subjects will receive
      treatment every 4 weeks until the initiation of puberty (age 12 for males and age 11 for
      females); a follow-up period where subjects will be observed every 6 months until physical
      and laboratory observations are at pubertal levels, then every 12 months for 5 years; lastly
      a final follow-up questionnaire is given to all subjects when they are at least 18 years old.

      At the treatment visits, efficacy assessments are Tanner staging (suppression of breast
      development in females and genital development in males), gonadotropins (LH and FSH), sex
      steroids (estradiol in females and testosterone in males), ratio of bone age to chronological
      age, adult height compared to a standard population and predicted mature height, and age and
      time to regular menses in females. This protocol will also capture data from the final
      questionnaire about female reproductive status at adulthood including the presence of regular
      menses and number of pregnancies.
