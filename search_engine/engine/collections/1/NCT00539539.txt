    
      A subset of emergency medical services (EMS) agencies that are participating in the
      Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) are adopting new monitor/defibrillators that are
      capable of monitoring CPR process during attempted resuscitation of patients in cardiac
      arrest, as well as providing automated real-time feedback about this process to EMS providers
      so as to improve compliance with recommended guidelines for CPR. Monitoring of CPR process
      during attempted resuscitation is an important step towards reducing the potential for
      poorly-performed CPR to modify the effect of the study interventions upon outcome. Clusters
      formed of rigs, an individual agency or groups of agencies were randomized to turn feedback
      on or off. After a fixed period of time, each cluster crossed over to the other arm. An
      unequal number of subjects were enrolled during each period.
