        -  Measure the pharmacokinetics, whole body retention of isotope, and biodistribution of
           C11-methionine and FDG by PET imaging and serial sampling of blood in men with
           progressive prostate cancer.

        -  Explore metabolism of each PET scan by comparing the sensitivity of C11-methionine or
           FDG by PET scanning in androgen independent prostate cancer metastases with the
           sensitivity of C11-methionine or FDG in androgen dependent metastases on a site by site
           basis.

        -  Compare C11-methionine and FDG PET scanning to standard of care diagnostic studies which
           include the Tc 99m bone scan, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

      Patients fast for 6 hours prior to PET imaging with the exception of liberal water intake
      which is encouraged. A two way catheter is placed in the urinary bladder, and continuous
      isotonic saline irrigation is performed throughout scan acquisition to reduce the
      interference in imaging lesions in the pelvic lymph nodes and adjacent pelvic bones caused by
      radiation excreted in urine held in the bladder.

      Each patient receives C11-methionine intravenously. PET imaging begins immediately after
      injection for approximately 60 minutes total using standard imaging procedures. Immediately
      following the completion of imaging after C11-methionine administration, each patient
      receives FDG intravenously. PET imaging begins approximately 45 minutes thereafter for
      approximately 60 minutes using standard imaging procedures.
