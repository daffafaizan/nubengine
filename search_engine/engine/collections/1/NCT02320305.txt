      I. Evaluate the immune response of each immunization regimen to determine an optimal regimen
      in terms of immune response to recommend for phase II testing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the adverse events profile of each immunization regimen.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the immunological efficacy of the vaccine preparations as measured by the
      frequency and interferon (IFN) gamma production of peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes
      (CTL).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive MART-1 antigen and TLR4 antagonist GLA-SE intramuscularly (IM) on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive MART-1 antigen IM on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up
      to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, stage II patients are followed up at 10 weeks and then
      at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and stage III-IV patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18,
      21, and 24 months.
