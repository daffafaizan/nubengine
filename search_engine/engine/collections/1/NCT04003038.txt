      I. Determine the impact of negative pressure wound therapy on wound healing as measured by
      wound dehiscence rate.

      II. Long-term follow-up on wound healing complications.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive wound care with a standard dressing (bandage) after surgery for 7
      days.

      GROUP II: Patients receive negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) after surgery for 7 days.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, and at 1 and 3 months.
