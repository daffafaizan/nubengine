      of enoxaparin treatment. A same initial dose of 1 mg/kg will be administrated to all
      patients. According to creatinine clearance, the next doses (every 12 hours subcutaneously)
      will be adjusted with a 25% dose reduction if creatinine clearance is comprised between 30
      and 50 ml/min. After the fourth dose, the anti-Xa plasma levels (main endpoint) will be
      measured at peak (between 3 and 5 hours after dose administration). Residual values of antiXa
      will also be measured before the fifth dose administration (secondary criteria).

      The objective is to demonstrate a bio-equivalence of efficacy on the anti-Xa values obtained
      in patients with moderate rela failure compared with patients with creatinine clearance
      higher than 50 ml/min.

      Thrombotic and bleeding events will be recorded during hospitalisation. 140 per-protocol
      evaluable consecutive patients will have to be obtained: 70 with creatinine clearance higher
      than 50 ml/min and 70 patients with creatinin clearance between 30 and 50 ml/min.
