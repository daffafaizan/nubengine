      I. To evaluate the efficacy of dovitinib (dovitinib lactate) in patients with progressive
      well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas (PNETs) in reference to 6-month
      progression free survival (PFS) historical-controlled patients and in two cohorts defined by
      prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-inhibitor therapy (Cohort 1 - no prior VEGF,
      Cohort 2 - prior VEGF).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of dovitinib in patients with progressive well-differentiated
      PNETs.

      II. To evaluate time to treatment failure, time to progression, and overall survival.

      III. To evaluate radiographic and biochemical response rates.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effect of dovitinib on plasma biomarkers by measuring
      concentrations of circulating growth factors and soluble receptors (e.g. basic fibroblast
      growth factor [bFGF], VEGF, placental growth factor [PLGF], soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sVEGFR1)
      and 2, collagen IV, fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF23]).

      II. Archival tissue collected from patients prior to registration will be banked to later
      analyze baseline expression of potential biomarkers (e.g., bFGF, FGFR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dovitinib lactate orally (PO) on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months,
      every 3 months for 6 months, and then periodically for 2 years.
