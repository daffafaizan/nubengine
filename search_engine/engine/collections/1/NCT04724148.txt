      most clinical consequences of cirrhosis. The most reliable method for assessing portal
      hypertension is the measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG). The HVPG is
      the gold-standard methods for assessing clinically significant portal hypertension and
      becoming increasingly used clinically. It is useful in the differential diagnosis of portal
      hypertension and provides a prognostic index in cirrhotic patients. Many patients are painful
      and reluctant to undergo serial HVPG measurements. But interventionists are reluctant to use
      analgesics because they always pay more attention to the accuracy of HVPG measurements. May
      be since it is difficult to monitor HVPG for anesthesiologist during liver surgery, there are
      very few and controversial studies on the effects of sedation and analgesics on HVPG. M.
      Susan Mandell et al concluded that desflurane alters HVPG measurements, whereas propofol did
      not change it (Anesth Analg 2003). However, Enric Reverter et al considered that deep
      sedation with propofol and remifentanil adds substantial variability and uncertainty to HVPG
      measurements (Liver International 2013). Although Adam F. et al concluded that low-dose
      midazolam sedation is an option for patients undergoing serial hepatic venous pressure
      measurements (Hepatology 1999), the effects of using opioid analgesics alone on hepatic
      venous pressure measurements have not yet been defined. The objective of this study was to
      evaluate the effects of fentanyl on the HVPG measurements.
