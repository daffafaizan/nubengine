      dose (MTD) was defined.

      43 patients with advanced solid tumours were treated in Part 1 of the study. A recommended
      Phase II dose (RP2D) has been proposed from the safety, pharmacokinetic, and proof of
      mechanism of lactate transport inhibition in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
      results from Part 1.

      All patients in Part 2 will be treated at this RP2D to further explore the tolerability of
      this dose and schedule and to explore proof of principle of MCT1 inhibition in tumour types
      that were shown to express MCT1 and in which AZD3965 showed some effect pre-clinically
      (diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt's Lymphoma).
