      organ protects remote organs from a sustained episode of ischemia. It is known that one-lung
      ventilation in patients undergoing pulmonary resection, which may cause acute lung injury.
      The investigators did a single-blinded randomised controlled study to establish whether
      remote ischemic preconditioning reduces lung injury in these patients.
