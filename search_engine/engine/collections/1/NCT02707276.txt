      depression in a population aged 21-60. Here the investigators hope to extend these results to
      a similar but new population, geriatric bipolar depression (GPD). In addition to the
      evaluation of the effect of multiple treatments, as well as observation of the duration of
      the effect after a delay of one week in this population, the investigators will assess
      whether this population presents any noticeable difference in tolerance or effect.

      The protocol involves five treatments on consecutive days with one follow-up visit; this is a
      randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study (subjects will either receive active
      treatment or sham treatment for all five treatment sessions).

      The mechanisms of depression in a geriatric population may differ from those in a younger
      population. In particular, brain structures and connectivity have changed, and there is the
      increased risk of comorbid diagnoses such as dementia that might confound treatment and
      assessment. In this study the investigators hope to extend the findings of LFMS in the
      general population to directly address the treatment of bipolar depression in a geriatric
      population.
