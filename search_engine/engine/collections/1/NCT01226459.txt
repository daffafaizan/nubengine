    
      This is a phase 3, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multi-center,
      24-week, parallel design trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety in women with Female
      Pattern Hair Loss (FPHL), comparing the 5% MTF formulation versus the foam vehicle
      formulation.

      This clinical trial is designed to compare the risk/benefit profile of the new 5% MTF
      formulation applied once a day (OD) versus the foam vehicle formulation applied once a day
      (OD), using objective efficacy measures and safety assessments.

      Study centers will screen a sufficient number of participants so that a minimum of 300 female
      participants with FPHL will be enrolled, to ensure 260 complete. There will be at least 16
      participants enrolled per center at multiple centers located across the US and globally.
      Approximately 300 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to use either 5% MTF
      OD or foam vehicle OD, for 24 weeks for efficacy and safety evaluations.

      Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in the order of their
      enrollment at each site. The signing of the informed consent and assignment of a participant
      number to a subject shall constitute enrollment.

      During the trial following enrollment at Baseline, participants will return to the study site
      at Weeks 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 for safety assessments, adverse events monitoring, and
      compliance assessments. At the Week 12 and 24 visits, efficacy assessments will also be
      conducted, using Target Area Hair Counts (TAHC), measured by macrophotography.
