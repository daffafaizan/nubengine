    
      This is a descriptive phase I trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the RH5.1/AS01
      vaccine in healthy volunteers at different doses, and to establish whether the RH5.1/AS01
      vaccine can demonstrate a reduced parasite multiplication rate in vaccinated subjects
      compared to infectivity controls in a blood-stage controlled human malaria infection model.

      There will be 6 study groups across two phases of the trial, with a total of 66 - 78
      volunteers.

      Vaccination of groups will be sequential from Group 1 to Group 3. Group 3 and 4 can be
      recruited simultaneously. Volunteers will be able to choose which group they are allocated
      to.

      The vaccination dose for Group 5 has been decided following the analysis of safety and
      exploratory immunology assays from Groups 1, 2 and 4. They will undergo blood-stage CHMI 2
      weeks after the final vaccination and will be followed up until approximately 6 months after
      the final vaccination.

      Group 6 volunteers will be infectivity controls, so will not receive any vaccinations.

      Volunteers will be recruited and undergo screening visits, vaccination and clinic visits
      post-vaccination at their local trial site. Procedures will be performed on the visit time
      points indicated in the schedule of attendances.. Additional procedures or laboratory tests
      may be performed, at the discretion of the Investigators.
