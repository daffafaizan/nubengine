      2 intramuscular (IM) injections of the same formulation, either Formulation A or Formulation
      B, administered 24 weeks apart. The first 150 subjects were to receive Formulation A for both
      injections and the next 150 subjects were to receive Formulation B for both injections. The
      sponsor was to conduct an ongoing review of the primary endpoint data (suppression of
      testosterone <= 50 ng/dL) and planned to stop enrollment of Formulation A or Formulation B,
      or not to administer the second injection of Formulation A or Formulation B, if 15 or more
      subjects did not achieve testosterone suppression by Week 4 or failed to maintain
      testosterone suppression during the treatment period.

      All analyses and summaries were to be conducted separately for subjects who received
      Formulation A or Formulation B.

      This study was to be conducted at approximately 60-80 investigative sites. Subjects
      participated in the trial for approximately 14 months.

      This trial was to include a Screening Period (up to 4 weeks), a 12-month Treatment Period
      (two 6-month treatment cycles), and a Follow-Up Period (30 days).
