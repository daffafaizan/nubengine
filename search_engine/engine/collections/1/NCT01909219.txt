      for colon cleansing. This study evaluates whether split dosing is associated to a further
      increase in efficacy and acceptability in comparison to the standard dose regimen. This is a
      multicenter, randomized, single-blind study performed in 15 endoscopic services in Italy.

      Adult outpatients undergoing colonoscopy will receive picosulphate/magnesium citrate either
      in the standard dosing (group A, two sachets the day before endoscopy), or in the split
      dosing (group B, the second dose in the morning of colonoscopy). Bowel cleansing will be
      assessed using the Boston Scale (BBPS) and rated as adequate if >2 in each segment. Patient
      acceptance, satisfaction, and related symptoms will be also recorded.
