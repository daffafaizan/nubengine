      disease and is associated with impaired exercise performance, functional limitation and
      reduced health-related quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that identification and
      treatment of OSA in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation will improve the response to
      rehabilitation. The proposed study will test this hypothesis using a parallel group,
      randomized, clinical trial comparing OSA treatment with continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) to an educational control group in patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation who
      screen positive for previously undiagnosed OSA.
