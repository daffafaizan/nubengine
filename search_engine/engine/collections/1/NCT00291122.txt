      gene transcription products that may be useful as predictors or indicators of response to
      celecoxib, the feasibility of performing six different molecular assays by qRTPCR on formalin
      fixed paraffin embedded tissue obtained from breast cancer core biopsies and breast cancer
      reexcision patients, to assess change in Ki-67, PCNA, and several other markers by qRTPCR,
      correlate change in expression of Ki-67, PCNA, CAX-2, and bcl-2, measured by
      immunohistochemistry to change measured by qRTPCR, and to determine the reliability of the
      qRTPCR and immunohistochemical assays by performed selected assays on the same tissue in two
      different institutions
