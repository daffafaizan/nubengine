      reported outcomes between the Revo investigational prosthetic foot and a comparative
      prosthetic foot (Taleo or Proflex XC) when compared to the control foot which is the
      subject's currently used energy storage and return (ESR) prosthetic foot. The data obtained
      from this study may also serve to determine the long-term performance of Revo.
