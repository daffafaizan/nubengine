    
      Primary Objective

      1.Evaluate in a standardized manner in each subpopulation the humoral immune response to
      Covid-19 vaccination at 1, 6, 12, 24 months (M) after the last dose of vaccine (1 or 2 dose
      schedule depending on the vaccines).

      Secondary objectives

        1. Compare the humoral immune response at 1, 6, 12, 24 months after the last vaccine dose
           (1 or 2 dose schedule depending on the vaccine) of each subpopulation with a control
           group of subjects without the chronic diseases of interest .

        2. In each subpopulation, study the factors associated with the humoral immune response at
           1 month and the persistence of the humoral immune response at 6, 12, 24 months as a
           function of age, stage of disease, treatments, type of vaccine (as well as
           characteristics specific to the subpopulations studied).

        3. Compare the humoral immune response between different specific subpopulations.

        4. Study the seroconversion for anti-nucleoprotein antibodies.

        5. Immuno-virologically characterize vaccine failures (SARS-CoV2 infection) during
           follow-up.

        6. Identify genetic determinants of the immune response based on the underlying pathology
           and ongoing treatments if applicable (response and resistance to vaccination).
