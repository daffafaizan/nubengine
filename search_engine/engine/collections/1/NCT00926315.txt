      unaffected ones. Calcitriol supplementation may be indicated to post-menopausal women to
      reduce bone loss. Vitamin D has antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cell lines and
      breast cancer xenografts.

      Post-menopausal breast cancer patients will be prescribed calcitriol supplementation, in
      doses indicated to prevent osteoporosis, while they are submitted to biopsy, staging exams
      and have their breast surgery scheduled (approximately one month). Tumor dimension and
      proliferation rate (as determined by Ki67 expression), 25(OH)D3 and/or 1,25(OH)2D3 serum
      concentration, will be evaluated before and after calcitriol supplementation. Tumor gene
      expression will be evaluated in samples collected before and after supplementation to analyze
      the differential profile.
