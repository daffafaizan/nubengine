      rehabilitation in knee or hip arthroplasty patients, by increasing their ability to attend
      and adhere to rehabilitation recommendations following surgery. Half of the subjects in this
      study will be assigned to an intervention that meets with a study therapist to discuss
      implementing healthy habits (physical activity, nutrition, pain-coping techniques, etc). The
      other half of subjects will assigned to an intervention group that meets with a study
      therapists to discuss implementing healthy sleep habits. Both groups will undergo several
      physical and cognitive assessments at baseline (prior to surgery), in-hospital,
      post-hospital, post-intervention and at a 6 month follow-up visit.
