    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of six IV infusions of ILV-094
      administered to subjects with atopic dermatitis. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned in
      a 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatments arms (ILV-094 vs placebo). Forty patients will be
      enrolled in the ILV-094 treatment arm and 20 in the placebo-treatment arm, accordingly. A
      loading IV dose of 600 mg of ILV-094 or placebo will be given at baseline (Day 0), followed
      by five additional IV doses of 300 mg of ILV-094 or placebo every two weeks (Weeks 2, 4, 6,
      8, and 10). We will continue to follow the patients every two weeks for an additional 10
      weeks after the last IV dose (20 weeks post baseline).
