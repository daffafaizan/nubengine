      intervention components tailored to the Stimulation Phase and Waiting Phases of IVF. The
      cognitive component of the CCRI is the PRCI intervention (Boivin & Lancastle, 2008) tailored
      to the stimulation/waiting phases of an IVF cycle. The PRCI intervention consists of a series
      of ten statements that facilitate the use of cognitive reappraisal coping, a form of coping
      that helps people think more about the positive aspects of a difficult situation and dwell
      less on problems or uncertainties of the future.

      The relaxation components of the CCRI consists of techniques that have been used for two
      decades in the mind/body infertility program as well as in randomized controlled research
      trials. For the Stimulation phase, participants will receive instructions on how to do "mini
      relaxation" techniques which are specifically designed to reduce anxiety in the moment, for
      example feelings of tension, worry, and nervousness that might occur prior to and during
      Stimulation phase procedures (e.g. injections, blood tests, and ultrasounds). For the Waiting
      Phase the relaxation intervention will include a relaxation CD. The CD contains narrated
      instruction on how to elicit the relaxation response through several techniques

      This is a randomized, controlled prospective study conducted at a private
      academically-affiliated infertility clinic and includes women ages 44 and below scheduled to
      undergo their first IVF cycle. Subjects are randomized to a CCRI or a control group. The
      primary outcome measure is dropout rates.
