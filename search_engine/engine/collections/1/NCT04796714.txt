      ischemic stroke. Although oral anticoagulation (OAC) is recommended in patients with
      CHADS2VA2SC score â‰¥ 1, this medication is associated with severe haemorrhagic complications.
      Several trials showed that percutaneous LAAC with the Watchman device (Boston Scientific,
      Natick, Massachusetts) or the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP) /Amulet device (St. Jude Medical,
      Minneapolis, Minnesota) was shown to be non-inferior but also superior as compared to
      warfarin in preventing the combined outcome of stroke, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular
      death. Therefore, LAAC has become an integral part of treatment guidelines in AF patients.

      However, the post procedural management of antithrombotic therapy in these patients remains a
      challenge, as bleeding risk needs to be balanced against risk for thrombus formation on the
      device and thromboembolic complications. After LAAC, various antithrombotic protocols have
      been proposed by different teams but the optimal postprocedural antithrombotic medication and
      its duration are still debated. The Investigators recently showed in a prospective registry
      that LAAC using ACP devices followed by a single antiplatelet therapy could be a reasonable
      alternative for stroke prevention in patients with high bleeding risk.

      The APPENDAGE study is a phase 4 multicentre randomized opened clinical trial comparing 2
      different antithrombotic strategies (aspirin versus aspirin + clopidogrel) following LAAC.
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of these 2 strategies after
      LAAC by comparing the occurrence of ischemic lesions on cerebrovascular MRI studies performed
      immediately after the procedure (D 0) and after 3 months of follow-up.
