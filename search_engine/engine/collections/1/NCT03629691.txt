      lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, multiline chemotherapy failure and lack
      of standard treatment, received oral apatinib 250 mg daily at the Affiliated Hospital of
      Qingdao University. Histologically proven were identified retrospectively using the Clinical
      Research Information Systems (CRIS) database. All patients were with Karnofsky performance
      status â‰¥70% or an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, with
      stable hepatic, hematologic, and renal functions. Cardiac disease and hemorrhagic disease
      were excluded. All patients had pre-therapy chest computed tomography (CT) prior to apatinib
      treatment, and follow-up chest CT at least every 4 weeks. The primary end point was
      progression-free survival (PFS), secondary end points included duration of locoregional
      control (LRC), overall survival (OS), quality of life and safety. For metastatic lung cancer,
      LRC is the local control of metastatic lung tumor here. Other patient demographic and
      clinical data, including age, gender; stage of disease, apatinib administered inclusion and
      withdrawal date, adverse events, oncologic clinical response, comorbid conditions, and
      smoking history, were retrieved from the CRIS database.
