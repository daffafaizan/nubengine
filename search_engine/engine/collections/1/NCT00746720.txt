      group study conducted in male and female adult patients undergoing elective primary single
      hip arthroplasty. In part 1 of the study 12 patients will be enrolled in the study and will
      be administrated 120 mg Etoricoxib or placebo orally on day one post surgery. The results
      from part 1 should help to adjust sampling time points (for blood, cerebrospinal fluid and
      hip drain fluid) if necessary. In part 2 of the study 40 patients will be enrolled and should
      receive 120 mg etoricoxib or placebo two hours before and 24 hours after surgery.

      Primary end points will be the inflammatory mediators on peripheral and central levels. After
      surgical manipulation we expect increased mediators on both sides. It will be investigated if
      the medication could reduce the mediators compared to placebo and if the effect is related to
      pharmacokinetic parameters.
