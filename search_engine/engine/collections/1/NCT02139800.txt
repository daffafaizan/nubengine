      of this trial is an unacceptable rate of poor long-term outcomes of preterm infants born as
      Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns (ELGAN) <1000 g birthweight (BW), but especially for
      those born between 23-26 weeks' gestational age (GA). Such infants are the most vulnerable
      and immature in all organ systems, including the lungs and the brain. These infants are at
      high risk of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) during their initial hospitalization,
      neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) and pulmonary problems in infancy and childhood.

      The SAIL trial focuses on facilitating the difficult transition of these most vulnerable
      infants from a liquid filled in-utero lung to an ex-utero air-filled lung. Sustained
      Inflation (SI) is a promising delivery room (DR) intervention, with evidence of short-term
      efficacy with minimal risk of additional harm beyond current standard accepted Newborn
      Resuscitation Program (NRP) Guidelines. This protocol proposes a fully informed consenting
      procedure. We propose to evaluate the impact of a SI in the DR on the need for mechanical
      ventilation in the first week of life which would also impact mortality rates and the
      incidence and severity of BPD.
