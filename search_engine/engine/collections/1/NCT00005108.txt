      contribute to stiffening of arteries that increases the risk of myocardial infarction and
      stroke. Accordingly, therapies that reduce vascular inflammation may reduce cardiovascular
      risk. The effect of estrogen therapy on serum markers of inflammation in postmenopausal women
      is divergent: Estrogen increases the levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and matrix
      metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9), but decreases levels of the soluble cell adhesion molecules
      ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin. MMP-9 is secreted by macrophages and cytokine-activated smooth
      muscle cells, with increased expression in the vicinity of atherosclerotic plaques. Although
      activation of MMP-9 by estrogen could be deleterious in women with coronary artery disease by
      digesting the fibrous caps of vulnerable plaques and provoking thrombosis (consistent with
      the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study), activation of MMP-9 in healthy
      postmenopausal women may remove excess matrix proteins that contribute to arterial stiffness
      (reduced compliance), thus reducing cardiovascular risk (consistent with the Nurses' Health
      Study). Reduction of levels of cell adhesion molecules might protect against new plaque
      development in both groups of women. The purposes of this protocol are to determine the net
      effects of estrogen therapy on 1) vascular inflammation in postmenopausal women, using
      MRI/MRA imaging of the carotid arteries, and 2) arterial compliance, derived from carotid
      ultrasonography and blood pressure measurements.
