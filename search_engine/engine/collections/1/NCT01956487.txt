      assess the bioequivalence of propafenone hydrochloride manufactured at two different sites in
      healthy adult volunteers. Approximately 36 subjects will receive a 3 single doses of
      propafenone hydrochloride 425mg, each administered separately, in the fasted state with a 7
      day washout period between doses. Propafenone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic indicated to
      prolong the time to recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation in patients with episodic
      (most likely paroxysmal or persistent) atrial fibrillation who do not have structural heart
      disease. A follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days after the final dose of study drug.
