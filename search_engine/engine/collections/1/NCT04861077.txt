    
      Pre-study visit/Consent

      This visit will take about 1 hour. Participants will be asked to sign this consent form
      before any study procedures. Once consented, vital signs will be taken, a blood draw to
      determine kidney function, and a pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing
      potential. Participants will be asked to fill out an MRI questionnaire and they will be given
      an additional information sheet on the gadolinium-based contrast agent, Prohance, that the
      FDA requires for all patients receiving this type of drug. Because the PET/MRI is smaller
      than most MRI scanners, participants will have a PET/MRI fit test to ensure a proper fit. If
      eligible for this study, participants will be scheduled for the first PET imaging visit which
      will occur before they start immunotherapy.

      Imaging visits

      During this study participants will be scheduled for up to 3 imaging visits. The first
      imaging visit must be performed before participants start immunotherapy and is necessary for
      remaining eligible for this study. If, for some reason, the participant misses the following
      (i.e, 2nd) scheduled imaging visit, they are still eligible to continue in this study as long
      as they can complete a second imaging visit after finishing the 1st cycle of immunotherapy
      and before starting the 4th cycle of immunotherapy.

      Imaging Visit #1

      This visit will take about 4 hours and will take place before the participant starts
      immunotherapy. No special preparation is required before the study. Upon arrival at the
      Advanced Imaging Facility (AIF) participants will have a chance to have any remaining
      questions answered about the procedure. Baseline vital signs, including resting blood
      pressure, pulse rate, and breathing rate, will be measured and recorded. Women of
      childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test. An intravenous, plastic catheter will be
      placed in the arm and participants will be injected with the investigational radioactive
      drug, [18F]FMISO. Afterwards participants will wait 120 minutes to allow the drug to
      distribute throughout their body. Participants will then be positioned in the PET/MRI
      scanner. Based on your PET/MRI fit test, participants will either be positioned face down on
      their stomach or on their back. Once positioned in the PET/MRI, participants will be imaged
      for up to 60 minutes during which time they must remain still. During imaging, participants
      will receive an injection of FDA approved gadolinium-contrast agent called Prohance
      (gadoteridol) to improve the images.

      During any of the imaging visits, if the PET/MRI is unavailable due to scheduling problems or
      maintenance, participants may be imaged in the PET/CT scanner located in an adjacent room in
      the AIF. Participants will be scanned for up to 60 minutes. Before or after the PET/CT, but
      during this visit, participants will receive a separate MRI scan.

      When all procedures are complete, the plastic tube will be removed. Unless participants
      cannot have children because of surgery or other medical reasons, they must agree to use an
      effective form of birth control for 24 hours after taking the study drug. Effective forms of
      birth control include birth control pills, patch, IUD, condom, sponge, diaphragm with
      spermicide, or avoiding sexual activity that could cause pregnancy. Participants may resume
      normal activities after that 24-hour waiting period. Participants will be contacted by
      telephone 48 hours after the procedure to make sure they have not had any type of reaction
      from the investigational drug.

      Imaging Visit #2

      The second imaging visit will take about 4 hours and will be scheduled after the participant
      has finished their 1st cycle of immunotherapy and before they start their 2nd cycle.

      No special preparation is required before the study. Upon arrival at the Advanced Imaging
      Facility (AIF) participants will have a chance to have any remaining questions answered about
      the procedure. Baseline vital signs, including resting blood pressure, pulse rate, and
      breathing rate, will be measured and recorded. Women of childbearing potential will have a
      pregnancy test. An intravenous, plastic catheter will be placed in the arm and participants
      will be injected with the investigational radioactive drug, [18F]FMISO. Afterwards
      participants will wait 120 minutes to allow the drug to distribute throughout their body.
      Participants will then be positioned in the PET/MRI scanner. Based on your PET/MRI fit test,
      participants will either be positioned face down on their stomach or on their back. Once
      positioned in the PET/MRI, participants will be imaged for up to 60 minutes during which time
      they must remain still. During imaging, participants will receive an injection of FDA
      approved gadolinium-contrast agent called Prohance (gadoteridol) to improve the images.

      If participants miss this imaging visit but have completed the 1st imaging visit, they are
      still eligible to continue in this study if they can complete Imaging Visit #3.

      When all procedures are complete, the plastic tube will be removed. Unless participants
      cannot have children because of surgery or other medical reasons, they must agree to use an
      effective form of birth control for 24 hours after taking the study drug. Effective forms of
      birth control include birth control pills, patch, IUD, condom, sponge, diaphragm with
      spermicide, or avoiding sexual activity that could cause pregnancy. Participants may resume
      normal activities after that 24-hour waiting period. Participants will be contacted by
      telephone 48 hours after the procedure to make sure they have not had any type of reaction
      from the investigational drug.

      Imaging Visit #3

      The third PET imaging visit will take about 4 hours and will be scheduled after participants
      finish their 2nd cycle of immunotherapy and before they start their 4th cycle of
      immunotherapy

      No special preparation is required before the study. Upon arrival at the Advanced Imaging
      Facility (AIF) participants will have a chance to have any remaining questions answered about

      We will follow participants for up to 5 years or to disease progression by reviewing their
      medical records including pathology data obtained from surgery to see how they are doing.
