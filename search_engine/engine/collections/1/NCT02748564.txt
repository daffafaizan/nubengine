      I. To determine an optimal tolerated dose (OTD) of aldesleukin (interleukin [IL]-2) that is
      effective and tolerable in combination with pembrolizumab.

      II. To characterize the efficacy of the OTD of IL-2 in combination with pembrolizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the safety of IL-2 in doses ranging up to the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)- approved dose when administered in combination with pembrolizumab.

      II. To characterize clinical endpoints, including overall survival, progression-free
      survival, and complete response rate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize immune parameters in the blood and tumor microenvironment and cellular and
      molecular features of the tumor tissue that correlate with response to combination therapy
      for study as potential predictive biomarkers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks and
      aldesleukin IV every 8 hours for up to 14 doses at weeks 4, 7, 16, 19, 28, and 31 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months up to 10 years.
