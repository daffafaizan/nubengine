      consecutives therapeutic sequences during the same night, after randomization of the passage
      order:

        -  autotitrating pressure phase: sleep parameters and respiratory events vs results of the
           polysomnographic registration,

        -  manual titration phase: concordance between events respiratory analyzed on the
           polysomnographic recordings and the events detected by the CPAP / auto-CPAP.
