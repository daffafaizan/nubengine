      there are many studies reporting adverse effects of this intervention and final data on
      benefits are not available. There are no prospective studies in cardiac surgery regarding red
      blood cell transfusions requirements. There are retrospective studies in cardiac surgery
      suggesting worse outcomes including higher rates of mortality in patients submitted to red
      blood transfusion. Hematocrit levels around 30% are usually recommended not evidence based.
      Our purpose is to prospectively evaluate two strategies of transfusion in 500 patients
      submitted to elective cardiac surgery: a liberal strategy - patients receive blood
      transfusion when hematocrit is lower than 30% since the intraoperative period until the ICU
      discharge; a restrictive strategy - patients receive blood transfusion only when hematocrit
      is lower than 24%.

      Clinical outcomes, costs and quality of life will be compared.
