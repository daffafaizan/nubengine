    
      This study was a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled multicenter study to
      compare efficacy and safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 to SOF and DCV in treatment-na√Øve chronic HCV
      GT3-infected participants without cirrhosis. The study consisted of 2 periods, a treatment
      period (participants received 8 or 12 weeks of ABT-493/ABT-530 or 12 weeks of SOF with DCV)
      and a post-treatment period (participants who completed or prematurely discontinued the
      treatment period were followed for 24 weeks after their last dose of study drug to evaluate
      efficacy and to monitor HCV RNA and the emergence and persistence of viral variants).
