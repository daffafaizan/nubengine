    
      Design study:

      Single-blind crossover randomized clinical trial

      Hypothesis:

      A meal with high GI and high fiber content determines a lower glycemic response compared to a
      meal with high GI and low fiber content (fiber beneficial effect on glycemic response
      independent of glycemic index.

      Test meals:

      Four test meals isocaloric and with the same proportion of macronutrients will be evaluated
      (5 kcal/kg, 17% of energy provided by protein, 58% of energy provided by carbohydrates, and
      25% of energy provided by fat):

      Test Meal A:high glycemic index (GI= 60.3%) and high fiber content(5.88g) Test Meal B:high
      glycemic index (GI= 62.8%) and LOW fiber content(2.05g) Test Meal C:low glycemic index (GI=
      37.0%) and high fiber content(5.75g) Test Meal D:low glycemic index (GI= 38.4%) and high
      fiber content(1.91g)

      Outcomes:

      Glycemic response: serum glucose and insulin Satiety response: serum ghrelin and subjective
      assessment of satiety by a specific scale for measurement of appetite in single test meal
      studies.

      Logistic:

      Patients will undergo a clinical, nutritional and laboratory evaluation for confirm the
      inclusion criteria and will be request to give their written informed consent.

      All participants will test each meal with a mean of seven days separating the individual test
      days.A 12h fast will precede all the study visits.Pre-and postprandial blood samples will be
      draw to determine the concentrations of serum insulin and plasma glucose, and ghrelin through
      an antecubital cannula before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min after the test meals.
      The VAS scale will be applied in these times.
