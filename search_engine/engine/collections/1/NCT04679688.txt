      define the follicles whose hCG day is measured more clearly on the day of OPU in patients
      with whom we performed controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation(IVF).
      The localizations and diameters of these follicles in both ovaries will be drawn and the hCG
      day will be numbered and their measurements will be indicated. On the day of opu, the marked
      and numbered follicles will be measured, noted and aspirated one by one, the collected eggs
      will be followed in individually numbered culture dish and it will be evaluated whether they
      are mature or not prepared for microinjection. And mature oocytes will be followed in
      numbered culture dishes after microinjection. The relationship between hCG and OPU day
      follicle diameter will be evaluated by following the follicle diameter and follicle diameters
      on the day of egg collection, the relationship between the mature egg, the rate of reaching
      the blastocyst stage, the clinical pregnancy and live birth rates

      Especially the relationship between mature egg and follicle diameter and the resulting
      clinical results may guide clinicians in practice.
