      pneumococcal vaccine was unknown. We compare the immunogenicity of simultaneous
      administration of quadrivalent influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine with that of
      separate administration.

      162 Participants are randomly assigned to one of the two study groups; Simultaneous
      administration group: receive injections of pneumococcal vaccine and influenza vaccine
      simultaneously.

      Sequential administration group: receive injections of pneumococcal vaccine 2 weeks after the
      injection of the influenza vaccine.

      We compare the immunogenicity of the two groups.
