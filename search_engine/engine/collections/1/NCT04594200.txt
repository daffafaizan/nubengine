    
      Active family physicians across Ontario, Canada will receive an antibiotic prescribing
      feedback report in fall, 2020. The report will include personalized data regarding total
      antibiotic prescribing per 1000 patient visits and proportion of antibiotic prescriptions
      provided for a duration of >7 days. The feedback report will be mailed to each physicians'
      primary practice address. The report will feature the prescribing quality indicators, graphic
      visuals as well as accompanying content, informed by a user-centered design process.

      The data needed to measure the prescribing quality indicators in the feedback report (and the
      outcomes) will be derived from the ICES data repository. An independent biostatistician will
      perform the randomization in SAS once the list of eligible physicians is provided to PHO from
      ICES. Randomization will be conducted at level of the physician, stratified by involvement in
      prior PHO letter trial. The lists will then be sent to another independent individual at PHO
      responsible for creating the mailing envelopes.
