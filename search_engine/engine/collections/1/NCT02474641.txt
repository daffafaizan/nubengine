      Conventionaly fractionated radiotherapy of the breast 28 × 1.8 Gy = 50.4 Gy followed by a
      tumor bed boost sequentially 5 to 8 × 2.0 Gy = 10.0 Gy to 16.0 Gy, total dose 60.4 Gy to 66.4
      Gy.

      or Conventionaly fractionated radiotherapy of the breast 28 × 1.8 Gy = 50.4 Gy with
      simultaneous integrated boost to the tumor bed, total dose 28 × 0.3 Gy or 0.45 Gy= 8.4 Gy or
      12,6 Gy, total dose 58,8 Gy to 63.0 Gy.

      or Hypofractionated radiotherapy of the breast 16 × 2.66 Gy = 42.56 Gy followed by a tumor
      bed boost sequentially 5 to 8 × 2.0 Gy = 10.0 Gy to 16.0 Gy, total dose 52.56 Gy to 58.56 Gy.

      Experimental Arm:

      Hypofractionated radiotherapy of the breast 16 × 2.50 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost
      to the tumor bed, total dose within the boost volume 16 × 3.00 Gy.
