      cardiac and thoracic surgery. The system consists of an electronic control module, drainage
      kit (fluid collection canister and drainage line), and chest tube kit with novel chest tube.
      The system continuously monitors chest tube and drainage line patency, automatically clears
      the chest tube and drainage line from build-up, and provides digital readings of fluid output
      trends. Additionally, the system has patient safety alarms to notify clinical staff of an
      unexpected event associated with post-operative drainage. These functions offer significant
      improvements over current standard of care. Reliable post-operative drainage, reduced
      workload, and decreased variability in chest tube maintenance procedures have the potential
      to increase patient safety, reduce complications, and improve patient experience.
