      high risk group for adverse event/adverse drug reaction and calculate the adverse
      event/adverse drug reaction incidence rate, a large sample size clinical trial has been
      designed. This trial is an observational study. The investigators would screen several
      hospitals from different provinces and prospectively collect the main clinical
      manifestations,treatment, outcome, influence factors about patients using ulinastatin either
      in general clinical departments or in ICU. This study would be expected to provide evidence
      for appropriate medication to administration department of health authority.
