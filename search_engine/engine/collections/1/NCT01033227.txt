      improve blood flow.

      The pain associated with vaso-occlusive crisis (pain crisis) in sickle cell disease is caused
      in part by lack of oxygen and increased tissue acid because blood flow is blocked by stiff
      sickle red cells. Administration of sodium nitrite should generate nitric oxide in this area
      of hypoxia and acidosis and improve blood flow.
