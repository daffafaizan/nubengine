      Aim 1: To investigate whether aripiprazole is effective in the treatment of bipolar
      depression.

      Hypothesis 1: Aripiprazole will lead to a significant decrease in scores on the Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) during an 8-week treatment course.

      a. Study Population:

      A total number of 10 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study.

      c. Study Design and Method

      This proposal will use an open label design. Aripiprazole will be added to the treatment of
      patients with DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) BDD. Patients will be allowed
      to continue their psychotropic medication, at a stable dose, as long as they meet inclusion
      criteria as described below. Aripiprazole will be started at a dose of 10 mg for two weeks,
      15 mg for an additional two weeks, and 20 mg for the last four weeks. The length of time a
      patient stays on the maximum dose (20 mg) depends upon the patient's tolerance and treatment
      response. Treatment will continue for 8 weeks with weekly visits and ratings on the 17-item
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D 17) and other ratings scales.
