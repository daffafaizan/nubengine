      mitochondrial metabolomics -- panels of small molecules that affect mitochondrial function --
      to diagnose pre-symptomatic, pre-manifest, and symptomatic Huntington's disease and serve as
      biomarkers for HD severity and progression. It also seeks to demonstrate that this novel
      biomarker in the blood has comparable value to the same analysis in spinal fluid. This
      research study involves 3-4 visits over 18 months. Forty volunteers with HD and 25 volunteers
      without HD will be included. Volunteers who have HD will have a physical examination and
      blood draw at each study visit. Some participants will also volunteer for optional lumbar
      puncture.
