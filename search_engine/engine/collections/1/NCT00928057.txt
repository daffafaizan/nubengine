    
      Within each dose group, subjects were randomly assigned at baseline to one of two study arms.
      One study arm (4/5 mm PN) compared the BD 4mm PN to the 5mm PN, and the other arm (4/8 mm PN)
      compared the BD 4mm PN to the 8mm PN, in a crossover fashion. Based on the randomization,
      subjects used either the 4mm or the other assigned PN (5mm or 8mm) for the first 3 weeks,
      then switched to the alternate PN for the next 3 weeks. Glycemic control was assessed by
      serum fructosamine (FRU) levels at the end of each 3 week period.

      Based on their baseline insulin regimen, subjects were also assigned to an insulin dosing
      group (Low or Regular) to help ensure balance among treatment arms. Requirements for each
      group were as follows: Low Dose: largest single dose of insulin each day with a pen device
      must be less than or equal to 20 units. Regular Dose: largest single dose of insulin each
      day, with a pen device, must be 21-40 units.
