    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of infusion with chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD19
      and CD22.

      II. To find the recommended phase II dose for recurrent/refractory CD19+CD22+ B cell
      malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the overall response rate and complete response rate of relapsed B cell
      malignancies treated with CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and CD22.

      II. To assess other response variables including minimal residual disease (MRD) negative
      remission, overall survival (OS), and event free survival (EFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the immune reconstitution and persistence of CAR T cells for one year post
      infusion.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of autologous CD19/CD22 chimeric antigen
      receptor T-cells (CD19-CD22 CAR T cells) followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive standard of care cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and
      fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5, -4, and -3, and then receive CD19-CD22 CAR T cells
      IV on day 0. Patients with relapsed or persistent disease after a protocol assessment may
      receive a second infusion of CD19-CD22 CAR T cells.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months.
