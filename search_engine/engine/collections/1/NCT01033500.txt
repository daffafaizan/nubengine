    
      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, prospective, pilot study of 8 Type 1
      diabetic/uremic patients, ages 18-60 undergoing simultaneous islet-kidney transplantation.
      Study to include both male and/or female subjects.

      We hypothesize that a calcineurin inhibitor-free, steroid-free, co-stimulatory blockade-based
      immunosuppressive regimen, in combination with a GLP-1 agonist, will reduce the islet mass
      required to achieve and sustain insulin independence following simultaneous islet-kidney
      transplantation.

      Furthermore, we anticipate an improvement in creatinine clearance and a reduction in
      Interstitial Fibrosis/Tubular Atrophy in the transplanted renal allograft, and a reduction of
      "de novo" human anti-HLA antibody and auto-antibody formation against the respective donors.

      Without calcineurin inhibitors or steroids, we hypothesize that belatacept, in conjunction
      with sirolimus and mycophenolic acid will provide balanced immunosuppression for combined
      islet-kidney transplantation.
