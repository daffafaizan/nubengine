      the effectiveness, safety and feasibility of a new retrograde infraclavicular brachial plexus
      block as compared with interscalene and supraclavicular approaches. 90 patients scheduled for
      elective upper limb surgery were recruited and randomized into three groups, 30 for each
      group. Patients of Group A received retrograde infraclavicular block, interscalene (by
      Winnie) approach for Group B and supraclavicular (by Kulenkampff) approach for Group C. The
      retrograde infraclavicular block was performed with the insertion point medial to the
      coracoid process and the needle advanced to ipsilateral interscalene groove. Neurostimulation
      was used and 40ml of 0.5% ropivacaine were injected. Sensory block, adverse effects and
      complications were evaluated and recorded every 5 minutes until 30min after local anesthetic
      injection. The needle insertion depth, angles in coronary and sagittal planes of Group A were
      also recorded. Success rate of each nerve sensory block, sensory block result, complications,
      rate of satisfaction, rate of failure and incidence rate of adverse effects are all compared
      among groups.
