      the BIOFINITY® MULTIFOCAL lens and respectively the AIR OPTIX® AQUA MULTIFOCAL lens (lenses
      allocated on a ratio of 1/0.5) and the PUREVISION® MULTIFOCAL lens (lenses allocated on a
      ratio of 1/0.5), in presbyopic patients.

      Each subject will have 5 visits with the investigator:

        -  (V1) An inclusion visit during which the first pair of lenses are fitted;

        -  (V2) An optimization visit after 7 to 9 days of wearing the first lens;

        -  (V3) An evaluation visit after an additional 10 to 15 days of wearing the first lens (17
           to 24 days) and at which time the second pair of lenses are fitted;

        -  (V4, V5) Visits are conducted as in V 2 and V3 with the second pair of lenses.
