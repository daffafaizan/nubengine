      potato consumption with the incidence of mortality in the China Health and Nutrition Survey
      (CHNS).We analyzed the CHNS data and the participants (n = 14,116) over 20 years old were
      followed for up to 22 years. The participants were initially free of cancer, myocardial
      infarction, apoplexy, and pregnancy. Potato consumption was assessed using validated
      semi-quantitative food questionnaires (FFQ) in interviews. In each wave of interviews, the
      participants' situations such as alive, dead, or dying was listed and the death months were
      recorded. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox
      proportional hazard models with adjustment of potential confounders.In the CHNS cohort, total
      potato, fried potato, unfried potato, and sweet potato consumption were all strongly
      associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in both Chinese women and men.
