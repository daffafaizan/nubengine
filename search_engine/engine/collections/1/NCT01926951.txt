      the experimental externally focused ultrasound renal denervation therapy. It will be
      conducted on a maximum of twenty patients who meet the eligibility criteria and have signed
      the informed consent form.

      Safety is the primary endpoint of this study. Safety will be assessed by incidence and
      evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure
      through the 52-week evaluation. Clinical utility is a secondary endpoint of this study.
      Clinical utility will be evaluated by comparing pre and post therapy systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure.
