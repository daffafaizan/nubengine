      controlled access of the Micra system when used as intended. All subjects enrolled in the
      Micra CA Study will be prospectively followed from implant, at 6-month intervals until study
      closure (i.e. FDA approval). Patients with previous or existing inactive implanted cardiac
      stimulation systems will have additional follow ups.
