      operative technique for colon cancer. D3 resection implies ligation of the blood vessels at
      their origin. There is evidence that the recurrence free period and survival improves with
      the number of lymph nodes harvested at surgery. However, the current practice in Norway,
      while performing right hemicolectomy for cancer is to ligate the feeding vessels for the
      right colon on the right hand side of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV). Significant
      arterial stumps have been demonstrated in patients operated for right colon cancer with this
      technique (right colic artery and ileocolic artery vascular stumps with an average length of
      3.5 cm and 2.5 cm, respectively). This leaves reason to believe that a certain number of
      central lymph nodes remain after the procedure.

      The complex anatomical relationship between the right colic artery and ileocolic artery with
      the superior mesenteric vein make D3 resection demanding, especially if the right colic
      artery lies posterior to the SMV. These relationships are investigated in detail in
      postmortem anatomical studies. These studies show that the right colic artery lies most often
      anterior to the SMV, while the ileocolic artery lies most often posterior to the SMV. Data
      has also been provided that a CT angiography can verify these relations as well as postmortem
      anatomical studies in living patients, thus allowing the surgeon to be aware of them prior to
      surgery. This could prove to be crucial in planning the procedure.
