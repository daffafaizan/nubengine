195. properties of a cold-precipitable protein fraction in thelensa soluble protein fraction which precipitatesin aqueous solutions at temperaturesbelow 10  c has been isolated from the ratlens.  this fraction appears to be re-sponsible for the reversible 'cold cataract'which has been seen to develop whenyoung mammals are exposed to temperaturesbelow 10  c.  as the rat ages, theconcentration of this protein fractiondecreases, but the fraction does not com-pletely disappear, even from the lensesof 3-year-old rats.  although the molecularspecies comprising this fraction appear tobe homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge,disc electrophoresis and immunodiffusionhave shown that they are a heterogeneousmixture of a-, b- and y-crystallin subunits.the ability of the cold-precipitableprotein (ccp) fraction to precipitate in thecold depends upon its concentration andthe ionic strength and ph of the solvent.  insolutions of ph 4.0, some aggregationof the 4 s cpp occurs to form a 17 s component,which no longer precipitates inthe cold.  the ability of this protein fraction toprecipitate in the cold may dependon hydrophobic bonding and its influence on theconformation of the protein.
