    
      The objective of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of Uro-TainerÂ®
      Polihexadine 0.02% intended as routine rinsing and bacterial decolonization of urinary
      catheters in long-term catheterized patients. After each instillation patients will be
      assessed for vital signs, skin reactions and other symptoms suggesting intolerance or
      sensitivity and/or allergic reaction. In addition, pain will be assessed in the first 5
      patients and any other patients with sustained pain sensation in the bladder.

      Catheters will be rinsed by gravity feed with 100ml solution of UT-P 0.02% once a day for a
      maximum of 5 instillations. A minimum interval of 24 hours must be guaranteed for the
      enrolment of the first 5 patients and their first irrigation with the investigational
      product.
