    
      This is a 3-year prospective randomized comparative trial that will examine the impact of an
      intervention that incorporates peer navigators to improve health education (heiQ), health
      related quality of life (HRQOL-14), healthcare utilization, and medical outcomes compared to
      usual care among formerly incarcerated individuals as they transition from the correctional
      system into the community over the course of 18 months. Multiple studies have shown the
      efficacy of patient navigators in improving healthcare utilization and outcomes in
      marginalized populations, but neither intervention has been studied with the formerly
      incarcerated population. A total of 300 formerly incarcerated individuals will be enrolled
      into the trial. This intervention is inherently patient-centered, as it facilitates a process
      by which patients continuously define and shape their engagement with the health care system.
      The potential impact of the study findings include: 1) evidence for or against the use of
      patient navigators to enhance linkage and engagement into care; 2) health outcomes that
      either support or discourage the use of patient navigators with formerly incarcerated people;
      3) expansion of knowledge to inform the development of targeted interventions for this
      vulnerable population; and 4) dissemination of results that may contribute to larger scale
      studies that can be implemented widely with the aim at eliminating health disparities in a
      highly marginalized group of people. The investigators specific aim is to conduct a
      randomized comparative trial that will provide the evidence base to address two primary
      research questions:

        1. How does the use of patient navigators impact health education and health related
           quality of life of individuals as they transition from the correctional system into the
           community?

        2. How does a patient navigator for formerly incarcerated patients improve metrics of
           health care utilization (adherence to medical appointments, fewer visits to emergency
           rooms) and health outcomes (glycemic index, blood pressure control, and/or virological
           suppression in HIV-infected) compared to usual care of automated appointment reminder
           phone calls?
