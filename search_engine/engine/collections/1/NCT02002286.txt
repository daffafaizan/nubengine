      clinic. They were all immunological non-responders. Nineteen patients will receive Triptolide
      wilfordii Hook F extract (10mg tid po) plus current cART, while 4 patients will continue
      their current cART. This study will last for 12 months. Patients will be followed up at month
      0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. During each follow-up time point, adverse effects, T cell subsets, T cell
      activation markers and other routine tests will be ordered. The investigators hypothesis that
      TwHF might boost CD4 cell recovery by reducing immune activation.
