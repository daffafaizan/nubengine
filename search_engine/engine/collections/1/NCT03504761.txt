      System. The ClariCore System is designed to improve how the biopsies are being collected from
      the prostate by using light sensors (fiber optics) that can see changes in the prostate
      tissue. Researchers will study the information collected from the light sensors to study a
      method that has been developed to tell the difference between normal and suspicious (possibly
      cancerous) prostate tissue during the biopsy. This information will be given to the doctor in
      real-time. From this study, researchers hope to learn if this method can tell the difference
      between normal and suspicious prostate tissue, and if this can improve the evaluation of
      prostate tissue (biopsies).
