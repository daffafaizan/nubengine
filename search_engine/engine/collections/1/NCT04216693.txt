      controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of digoxin in the treatment of
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The participants will take study drug digoxin, which is
      approved by FDA for the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), orally daily based on
      the body weight, titrated to the level of 0.7 to 1 ng/ml for total of 6 cycles (4
      weeks/cycle). A liver biopsy will be performed at the beginning of the study and 24 weeks
      after randomization to evaluate the efficacy of digoxin in the treatment of nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis.
