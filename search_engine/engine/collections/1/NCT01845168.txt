      bleeding. On average 1-2% of patients using NSAID and Aspirin will develope gastric ulcer
      bleeding. But for patients with one or more risk-factors, the risk increases to 9% per 6
      months. The mortality in this case is 10-15%. Approximately 3200 patients are admitted to the
      hospital with bleeding ulcer annually in Denmark.

      Danish investigations have shown that 80% of all peptic ulcer bleedings admitted to hospital
      are related to the use of NSAID or Aspirin.

      The consumption of NSAID and Aspirin is large. A third of people over 60 are treated within a
      year with these preparations. The risk of developing gastric ulcer related to NSAID and
      Aspirin can be reduced by concomitant therapy with antacids. Several studies have shown that
      only 20-30% of patients with risk-factors receive ulcer preventive medicine.
