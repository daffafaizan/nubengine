      middle hepatic vein (MHV) at caval confluence trisectionectomy (TS) is generally performed,
      and central hepatectomy or mesohepatectomy (MH) (Segments 4, 5 and 8), is considered by some
      authors to be the conservative alternative to the previously cited approach. Between these
      two surgical interventions there is not, up to now, any evidence that one of them should be
      clearly preferred; anyway both are mojor resections. We previously reported that a surgical
      approach based on ultrasound-guided hepatectomy might minimize the need for major resection,
      whose rates of morbidity and mortality are not negligible. This policy could be useful also
      for disclosing new, more conservative, and better tolerated approaches for tumors invading
      the MHV at caval confluence in alternative to MH and TS. This study analyses the feasibility,
      safety and effectiveness of ultrasound-guided resections applied to these patients enrolled
      prospectively from a cohort of consecutive patients who undergo hepatectomy for tumors.
