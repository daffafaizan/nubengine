      change in the pharmacological regimen will be done with consult of the tending doctor and the
      change will be reported.

      Tools and Methods A patient, whom volunteers to take part in the research, will be invited to
      the Ichilov Pain clinic in order to fill-in questionnaires and sign an informed consent form.

      Each participant in the experiment group will participate in a series of 6 sessions lasting 1
      hour each, extending between 6 to 8 consecutive weeks, with one of the qualified GM
      practitioners partaking in the experiment. Each participant will have all their sessions with
      the same GM practitioner throughout the experiment. Immediately after the last session, the
      participants will fill-in the same questionnaires given at the beginning of the experiment.
