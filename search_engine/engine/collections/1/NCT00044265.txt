      headache. Rare cases of angioedema have been reported. When used in pregnancy during the
      second and third trimesters, ACE inhibitors can cause injury and even death to the developing
      fetus. When pregnancy is detected, ramipril should be discontinued as soon as possible.
      Ramipril is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to the product or have a
      history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor.
