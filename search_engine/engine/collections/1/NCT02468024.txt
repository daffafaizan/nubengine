      cohort studies to be effective at controlling primary early lung cancer. Recent pooled
      analysis of both the STARS and ROSEL randomized trials comparing SABR versus lobectomy have
      shown a significantly improved 3-year survival with SABR, giving further impetus for
      successful completion of a randomized trial .

      Pre-randomized trial- Patients will be screened and pre-randomized to either SR or SAbR.
      Informed consent will be obtained after patients are made aware of the randomized assignment.
      Despite pre-randomization prior to consent, patients maintain their right to accept or
      decline any/all study activities. Only consenting patients will be allowed to participate in
      study activities, including observation after either randomized treatments or observation
      after standard of care treatment, while those declining consent will be managed by their
      physician(s) off study.Patients will be accrued and followed for a minimum of 2-years after
      treatment.
