      (Group III) all patients were followed up for another treatment free 4 weeks observational
      period. Photographs of the most severe lesion were taken (Marker lesion) in each patient and
      analyzed for Total Ulcerative Area (TUA), Total Atrophic Area (TAA), and Total Reticular Area
      (TRA), patients were also assessed using clinical scores (CS) and visual analogue scale
