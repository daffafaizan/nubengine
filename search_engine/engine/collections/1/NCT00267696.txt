      bevacizumab once every two weeks. As long as there is evidence that the tumor is not growing
      and the participant is not experiencing any unacceptable side effects, participation can
      continue up to 2 years. The study is being done to find the effectiveness, safety and
      tolerability of this combination of chemotherapy drugs. Bevacizumab affects the growth of new
      blood vessels in the body. It is part of this study to see if stopping the growth of new
      blood vessels in the body will help stop the growth and the spread of cancer. The other two
      chemotherapy drugs, gemcitabine and carboplatin, are currently being used together for the
      treatment of ovarian cancer.
