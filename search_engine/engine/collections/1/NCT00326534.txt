        1. A serological survey of rickettsial immunoglobin G (IgG)-antibodies in 50 patients with
           sarcoidosis compared to 50 blood donors without sarcoidosis.

        2. An archival study using pre-existing lymph node biopsies, where immunohistochemical
           analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction will be
           applied to samples from 50 patients with sarcoidosis and compared to 50 patients without
           sarcoidosis and 10 patients with tuberculosis.

        3. A prospective study using bronchoscopically obtained samples from 20 patients with
           sarcoidosis, compared to 20 patients without sarcoidosis. The study applies the same
           techniques as the second study, but enhancing the information from the patients.
