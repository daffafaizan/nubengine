      the device can improve the grasping ability of stroke patients. The investigators now aim to
      make the controls more intuitive and accurate for the users, to enable subjects to grasp a
      wider array of objects, to make the donning and doffing of the device easier, and to continue
      to assess the MyHand as it helps subjects in functional tasks.
