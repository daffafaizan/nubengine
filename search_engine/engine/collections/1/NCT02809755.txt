      primary outcome variable will be change in STP from > 4 before to after treatment in the PACU
      after primary laparoscopic gastric banding, band revision, band replacement, sleeve
      gastrectomy, or revision of sleeve gastrectomy. Investigators hope to achieve a decline in
      STP in 2 units after treatment.
