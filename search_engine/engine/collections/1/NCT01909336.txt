    
      Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled clinical trial.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if isotonic solutions reduce the risk of hospital
      acquired hyponatremia compared with hypotonic solutions

      This study will include 150 patients in 2 groups according to these type of pathology: group
      1: medical conditions which includes respiratory problems (pneumonia, bronchiolitis, acute
      asthma attack) and acute gastrointestinal problems (bacterial or viral gastroenteritis) and
      group 2: surgical conditions (pre, peri or postoperative patients will be included). Each
      group will be randomized to receive 3 types of interventions: 0.3% Saline (hypotonic
      solution), 0.45% Saline (hypotonic solution) or 0.9% Saline (isotonic solution). In
      non-dehydrated patients the daily total volume of liquid infused will be determined by the
      volumetric Holliday- Segar* formula and the daily total volume will be calculated by adding
      the maintenance requirements (using the Holliday Segar formula) to the fluid deficit
      (according to percent of estimated weight**) in dehydrated patients.

      The glucose concentrations in the first group will be 3.3%, and in group 2 and 3 will be 5%.
      The potassium concentration will be 20mEq/L in all groups. Blood samples will be collected
      before, 8 hours and 24 hours after the start of intravenous fluid, for the analysis of
      sodium, potassium, glucose, urea and creatinine. The adverse clinical outcomes at 8 and 24
      hours of the start of intravenous fluid will also be recorded. The sodium plasma level, the
      incidence of hyponatremia and the adverse clinical outcomes will be compared.

      *0-10 kilogram (kg): 100ml/kg per day; 10-20 kg: 1000 ml + 50 ml/kg/day over 10 kg; >20 kg:
      1500 ml + 20ml/ kg over 20kg

      ** In patients under 10 kg correspond to a loss of 5% (50 mL/kg) in mild dehydration and 10%
      in moderate dehydration. In 10 kg or more: 3% (30 mL/kg) in mild dehydration and 6% (60
      mL/kg) in moderate dehydration.
