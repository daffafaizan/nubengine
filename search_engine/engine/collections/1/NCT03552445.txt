      Actually, The World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that vaccination averts 2-3 million
      deaths per year. In adults, several vaccines are recommended based on age and medical
      conditions if they have not receive vaccination before, and lack evidence of past infection:
      influenza, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, human papilloma virus (HPV),
      tetanus-diphtheria (Td), pneumococcl vaccines and etc. In particular, when the patient visits
      a vaccination clinic, Td and the pneumococcal vaccines are commonly administered at the same
      time. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Td vaccine and
      PCV13 after concomitant administration in adults aged 50 years. This single-center, open
      label randomized trial was conducted (Clinical Trial Number - NCT02215863) at Korea
      University Guro Hospital from November 2013 to April 2016. Adults â‰¥50 years of age were
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Td + PCV13 (Group 1), PCV13 alone (Group 2) or Td
      alone (Group 3).
