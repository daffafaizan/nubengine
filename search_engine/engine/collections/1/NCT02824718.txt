      study with blind end-point evaluation.

      Patients will come for an inclusion visit and will receive treatment with 0.5 µg/day
      alfacalcidol for 4 weeks (28±3 days, run-in). They will be instructed to maintain dietary
      calcium intakes (1 g/day) for the duration of the study and will be supplemented throughout
      the study with native vitamin D in order to maintain the concentration of 25OH vitamin D ≥ 40
      ng/L. Magnesium supplementation (100 mg/day) will be maintained throughout the study.

      At inclusion, patients will be randomly assigned to receive at the end of run-in period, in
      cross-over either an association hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day (ESIDREX®) + amiloride 5
      mg/day (MODAMIDE®) + 0.5 µg/day alfacalcidol (ALFACALCIDOL®) or 40 µg/day rhPTH(1-34)
      (teriparatide or FORSTEO® 20 µg twice daily) over 7 to 8 weeks (52±3 days).

      After a washout period of 28±3 days under 0.5 µg alfacalcidol /day, the patients will follow
      the second period of treatment. The study will end with a final period of 28±3 days under 0.5
      µg alfacalcidol /day. Patients will ambulatory monitor serum calcium, sodium, potassium, and
      creatinine levels at days 15 of run in and run out periods and at day 7 and day 28 of each
      treatment period.
