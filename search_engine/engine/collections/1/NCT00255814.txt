      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of high dose per fraction, highly conformal
           radiotherapy in patients with liver metastases.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the failure patterns and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate dose-volume characteristics with possible toxic effects of this regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the local control rate within irradiated fields in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo highly conformal radiotherapy (HCR) to the liver once daily, 5 days a week,
      for 2 weeks.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of HCR until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
