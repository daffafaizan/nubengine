    
      Protocol Number: SJS-CT-001 Phase: Pilot study Methodology: Open label, single-arm Study
      Duration: Six months after accrual and treatment of the last patient Study Center(s):
      Single-center Objectives: To demonstrate the safety of subcutaneous administration of
      autologous ADSC-SVF-002 in a population of subjects with soft tissue defects or abnormal
      wound healing who are still symptomatic despite being managed by conventional therapies.

      Number of Subjects: 10 Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Subject has soft tissue
      deficiencies, soft tissue post traumatic malformations, scars, and/or abnormal wound healing.

      Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen: ADSC-SVF-002. 1.0x106 cells/mL defect (when administered
      without fat) to 1.2x106 cells/mL defect (when administered with fat). Subcutaneous injection.

      Duration of administration: Administration of the product takes approximately 30 minutes.
      Administered once.

      Reference therapy: N/A

      Statistical Methodology: Safety outcomes will be reported with descriptive statistics.
      Secondary (efficacy) outcomes will be assessed relative to baseline (screening) as follows:

        -  For outcomes assessed at multiple follow-up visits, one-way ANOVAs followed by the
           Tukey's test will be conducted

        -  For outcomes assessed at one follow-up visit, a Student's t-test will be conducted.

      Data will be reported as mean Â± SD and p<0.05 will be considered significant.
