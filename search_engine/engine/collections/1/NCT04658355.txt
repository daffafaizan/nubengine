      preparations on the vaginal tissue and microbiome. Our primary working hypothesis is that
      chlorhexidine prep is more deleterious to vaginal tissue than povidone-iodine preparations.

      Hypothesis 1: chlorhexidine gluconate is more disruptive to the vaginal microbiome than
      povidone-iodine Hypothesis 2: chlorhexidine gluconate leads to more vaginal atrophy than
      povidone-iodine
