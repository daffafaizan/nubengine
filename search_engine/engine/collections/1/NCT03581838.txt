      These patients tend to cut their food small, chew extensively, take copious liquids with
      meals, and avoid foods that cause symptoms. No studies to date have directly evaluated these
      eating behaviors in patients with EoE with observation. Furthermore, none of the
      investigators' current metrics for patient symptom assessment visually evaluate the eating
      process nor are they compared before and after treatment. As a result, it is unclear if a
      patient's subjective perception of their eating difficulties and improvement matches with
      objective measures.
