      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study.
      Subjects were randomly divided into CLSP Group for crossed leg sitting position (n=105) and
      TSP Group for traditional sitting position (n=106). Non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP)
      monitor, eletrocardiography (ECG), oxygen nasal cannula and pulse-oxymetry was set on the
      subjects in the operation room. Baseline information was recorded. Spinal anesthesia was done
      by anesthesiology registrars that have done 50 spinal anesthesia procedures and have been
      explained about the protocol of spinal anesthesia injection in this study (to avoid bias).
      Outcome measures were the number of successful spinal needle placement in the first attempt,
      the difficulty level of landmark palpation for injection, and the number of needle-bone
      contact. Data was analyzed by SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scientist) using
      Chi-Square test, Fisher Exact test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Significance value used was
      5% with 80% power.
