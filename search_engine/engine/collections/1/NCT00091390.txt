      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of late grade 3 or greater genitourinary and gastrointestinal
           toxicity after treatment with external beam radiotherapy and high-dose rate
           brachytherapy in patients with stage II or III adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine acute grade 3 or greater genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine freedom from biochemical failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine disease-specific survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine clinical relapse (local and/or distant) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Develop a quality assurance process for high-dose rate prostate brachytherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prostate-specific
      antigen (â‰¤ 10 ng/mL vs 11-20 ng/mL), T stage (T1c-T2c vs T3a-T3b), combined Gleason score
      (2-6 vs 7 vs 8-10), prior hormonal therapy (no vs yes), and timing of high-dose rate
      brachytherapy (before external beam radiotherapy vs after external beam radiotherapy).

      Patients are followed at 3, 7, 9, and 12 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
