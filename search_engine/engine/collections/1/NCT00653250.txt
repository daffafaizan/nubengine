        -  To assess cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity in patients with early-stage non-small cell
           lung cancer (NSCLC) and correlate the results with serum vascular endothelial growth
           factor (VEGF) levels, tumor microvessel density score, tumor prostaglandin E2 (PGE_2)
           and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) levels, and the major urinary metabolite of PGE_2,
           PGE-M.

        -  To assess the effect of specific COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib) on COX-2 expression within
           the primary tumor, serum VEGF levels and tumor microvascular density, tumor PGE_2 and
           MMP levels, and urinary PGE-M in a cohort of patients with early-stage NSCLC.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib 400 mg twice a day for 5 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unaccepted toxicity. Patients with early-stage disease then undergo
      surgery.

      Biopsy, serum, and urine samples are obtained at baseline and after celecoxib treatment. The
      biopsy specimen are examined for the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), PGE_2, and
      selected MMPs by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and northern blotting. Serum and
      urine samples are analyzed for VEGF and PGE-M expression. COX-2 tumor expression is
      correlated with serum VEGF levels; tumor MMP-2, MMP-9, and PGE_2 expression; urinary PGE-M
      and microvessel density scores.
