      imperative to employ the least invasive approach for the functional evaluation of adrenal
      masses (e.g., adrenal venous sampling) without compromising efficacy. The conventional
      functional diagnosis protocol of adrenal masses is based on a combination of clinical
      symptoms, the presence of adrenal hormonal disorders, and radiographic features. However, the
      clinical manifestations of endocrine diseases are diverse, and a lack of uniformity in
      diagnostic protocols and assay methods for determining hormonal activation in adrenal
      disorders results in a significant variability in measurements. Besides, conventional imaging
      provides information of the morphology of a lesion, but not its functional status. Thus, an
      effective and non-invasive workup is needed for the characterization of adrenal masses and
      their therapeutic management.
