      cancer is undefined. Strategies of radiotherapy dose intensification with minimization of
      overall treatment time are felt to improve cure rates for LS-SCLC. Hypofractionation (giving
      higher than standard daily doses) facilitates both of these goals. In this study, we propose
      to use a dose escalated hypofractionated regimen of chest radiotherapy for patients with
      LS-SCLC.
