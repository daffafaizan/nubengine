      Despite effective TB chemotherapy, mortality rates remain extremely high, and no simple,
      inexpensive intervention is available. Prior to the discovery of antibiotic treatment,
      cod-liver oil, a potent source of Vitamin A, was the standard treatment for TB. Vitamin A is
      essential for normal immune function, and Vitamin A supplementation is used in many countries
      to reduce mortality in children. Vitamin A deficiency in HIV infected people has been
      associated with increased mortality in the United States, Haiti, Malawi, and Uganda. This
      study will determine whether daily Vitamin A supplementation, given concurrently with TB
      chemotherapy, will reduce mortality in adults with HIV and TB.

      All study participants will receive standard TB chemotherapy (isoniazid, rifampicin,
      streptomycin, pyrazinamide) for the first 2 months, followed by isoniazid and ethambutol for
      the following 6 months. Participants will be randomized to receive either a daily vitamin and
      mineral supplement or placebo. Participants will be followed for 24 months after study
      enrollment.
