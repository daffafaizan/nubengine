    
      This is an observational study of patients with neck and back pain followed by a pain
      management clinic. Patients with particular pain generators in the neck and back will be
      defined by a positive response to one of several targeted interventional pain procedures.
      Each patient may undergo a physical exam to determine whether they have hypermobile joints.
      The study will thus evaluate the rate of hypermobility for each pain generator. In addition
      blood, urine, or saliva samples may be taken for biomarkers for pain or rheumatologic
      factors.
