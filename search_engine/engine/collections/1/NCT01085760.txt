      antibiotics vancomycin and metronidazole on liver biochemistries, liver related symptoms and
      Mayo risk score in patients with PSC. The patients will be randomized into four groups of ten
      patients: one group will receive low dose vancomycin, one group will receive high dose
      vancomycin, one group will receive low dose metronidazole and one group will receive high
      dose metronidazole. Each group will be treated for three months.
