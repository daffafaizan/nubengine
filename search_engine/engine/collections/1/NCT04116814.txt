      in the general population. The patient with renal insufficiency is therefore at high
      cardiovascular risk. An increase in the wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR) is an early sign of
      microvascular damage, predictive of the risk of a cardiovascular event. The benefits of WLR
      measurement are therefore at the level of both the diagnosis and prognosis of vascular
      disease. Recently, a fundus camera coupled with an adaptive optics system has been able to
      measure for the first time in vivo non-invasively and reproducibly the wall thickness of the
      small arteries of the retina, and therefore the WLR, among other biomarkers relating to
      microvascular remodelling.

      Studies in hypertension have confirmed that the rtX1 camera allows reliable and reproducible
      measurements of the WLR. The main aim of our study is to evaluate the value of the WLR as a
      biomarker of the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with renal
      insufficiency.

      The objectives are to better understand, in the dialysis patient, the relationships between
      microvascular morphometry and cardiovascular events, survival, arterial hypertension, the
      pathology responsible for renal failure, the age of dialysis and metabolic parameters.

      The investigator team also want to better understand the relationship between the diameter of
      small arteries and parameters such as hypertension, the pathology that causes kidney failure,
      the age of dialysis, the use of VKA or EPO, metabolic parameters (HbA1c, NFS, reticulocytes,
      BNP, lipid balance, phosphocalcic balance).
