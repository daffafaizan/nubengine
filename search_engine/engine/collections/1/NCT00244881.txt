      I. Evaluation of the fraction of patients with increased levels of circulating endothelial
      cells after 3 weeks of treatment with AZD2171.

      II. Estimation of the objective response rate (ORR = CR + PR) among patients with refractory
      breast cancer receiving AZD2171.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimation of the response/stable disease rate (RSDR = CR + PR + SD). II. Characterization
      of the toxicity associated with AZD2171 in this cohort of patients.

      III. Analyses to correlate serial quantification of circulating endothelial cells and
      circulating tumor cells with traditional clinical endpoints including RR and TTP.

      IV. Develop pharmacodynamic measures of AZ2171 activity based on monocyte count and VEGFR-1
      phosphorylation within monocytes.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily for 42 days. Courses repeat every 42 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study.
