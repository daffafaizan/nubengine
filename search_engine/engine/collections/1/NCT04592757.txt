      unknown and underutilized in this field. In this study a new virtual reality (VR) application
      will be implemented and tested in two groups of stroke patients (10 acute phase/10 chronic
      phase). In an attempt to reactivate the affected upper limb in stroke patients, therapists
      often use mirror therapy. Using a mirror, the movement of a paralyzed limb is feigned in
      order to reprogram the brain. A patient performs exercises with the healthy limb, but through
      the mirror the patient seems to use the affected limb. A high number of repetitions is
      essential to stimulate the so-called neuroplasticity of the brain, but this makes mirror
      therapy monotonous. In addition, the therapy also has its limitations. Activities are limited
      by the physical boundaries of the modality, with exercises largely limited to distal
      movements and simple functional activities. Larger, free-standing mirrors provide a wider
      range of motion for therapeutic activities, but offer less protection against environmental
      distraction. With VR, these obstacles can be overcome. By focusing on virtual mirror therapy
      using a VR headset, therapists hope to create a more pleasant and realistic experience for
      the patients.
