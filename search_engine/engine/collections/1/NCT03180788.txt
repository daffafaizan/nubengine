      Smaller lesions and pedunculated lesions can be removed by conventional polypectomy,
      Endoscopic mucosa resection (EMR). However, large sessile and flat lesions are difficult to
      remove En bloc with EMR, resulting in a high level of tumor recurrence. Endoscopic submucosal
      dissection (ESD) was developed during the 1990s in Japan to achieve En bloc resection of
      large neoplasms in the stomach but has in recent years also been extended into management of
      large (>2 cm) and technically challenging colorectal polyps. Large series on the efficacy of
      ESD in removing benign lesions show high En bloc resection rates resulting in low numbers of
      recurrences. Traction assisted ESD was developed in Japan to further improve the technique
      and reduce procedural time, the literature on the efficacy of traction assisted ESD is
      however scarce and limited to Japanese studies.

      The aim in this study is to investigate the impact of this novel technique in comparison to
      traditional ESD on procedural time, En bloc resection rate, R0 resection rate and
      complication incidence.
