      who receive antibiotics for other infections. The current antibiotics used to treat C diff
      infection (CDI) are usually successful in treating the initial episode of CDI, but may not
      prevent recurrent infection. To prevent recurrent CDI, standard oral antibiotic treatment
      with vancomycin is extended by gradually reducing the dose over 4-8 weeks. This is called
      antibiotic taper. Bezlotoxumab (BEZLO), a monoclonal antibody targeting C. difficile toxin B,
      is an approved medication that has also been shown to reduce CDI recurrence in patients
      receiving antibacterial drug treatment of CDI. In this study, approximately 12 people with
      multi-recurrent CDI will be treated with BEZLO in combination with standard oral tapered
      vancomycin. Study participation will last 16 weeks. The rate of CDI recurrence in this group
      will be compared to information collected from approximately 72 historical patients with
      multi-recurrent CDI treated with oral tapered vancomycin only.
