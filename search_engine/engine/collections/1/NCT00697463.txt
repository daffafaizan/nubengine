      individuals sustain one or more low-trauma fractures. In studies of IOP in men,
      histomorphometric indices of bone formation are depressed, and affected men respond to
      PTH(1-34) with robust increases in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD). This is the
      beginning of the third year of an R01 (AR4989603) investigating the etiology and
      pathogenesis, as well as the histomorphometric and bone microarchitectural features of IOP in
      premenopausal women. There is evidence of markedly decreased bone formation and
      microarchitectural deterioration with decreased mechanical competence/strength.

      Teriparatide [PTH(1-34)] is an anabolic agent that stimulates bone formation and improves
      bone microarchitecture. Based on findings, the investigators hypothesize that teriparatide
      will significantly increase BMD and improve microarchitecture in premenopausal women with
      IOP.

      This is an open-label study of carefully characterized premenopausal women with IOP who are
      participating in a NIH-funded study and who have fragility fractures or very low bone
      density. Participants in the study will receive 18-24 months of teriparatide and the effects
      on BMD and microstructure, bone mechanical competence, and bone turnover will be assessed. In
      order to assess whether teriparatide stimulates bone formation to the same extent in women
      with IOP as it does in normal women, the study will compare the short-term changes (2 and 4
      weeks) in biochemical markers of bone formation in response to teriparatide between women
      with IOP and normal women who are participating in another NIH-funded study as controls.
