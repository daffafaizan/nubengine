      intended to assess safety. Two groups of patients are planned: patients with lymphoma and
      patients with multiple myeloma. Each subject will receive a haploidentical stem cell
      transplantation using peripheral blood stem cells. Bendamustine-fludarabine-rituximab-TBI
      conditioning will be used, followed by stem cell infusion, with Post-Transplant
      Cyclophosphamide and tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis. Patients will receive a CD56-selected
      DLI on day +8. Evaluations will be taken at baseline and at each of the study visits.
      Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. Total
      duration of subject participation will be one year. Total duration of the study is expected
      to be three years.
