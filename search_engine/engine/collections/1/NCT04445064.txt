      of the first studied vaccine " IO102 " is the enzyme Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The
      vaccine is a amino acid peptide from indoleamine 2,3-dioxigenase. We are planning to add
      several other arms when other vaccines become clinically available.

      The main objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the T-cell peptide-specific response to the vaccine in a interferon(INF)-Î³
           ELISpot assay.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the vaccine.

        -  To investigate the decreased action of the IDO enzyme in evaluating the increased
           tumoral infiltration by CD8+ T-lymphocytes and by measuring the serum levels of
           kynurenin, tryptophan,...

        -  To evaluate the anti-tumor effect (objective response rate, overall survival, disease
           free- survival, disease specific survival).

        -  To evaluate the pre-operative activity of peptide vaccine using MRI (Magnetic Resonance
           Imaging), DWI-MRI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging-MRI) and MRS (Magnetic Resonance
           Spectroscopy) to visualize possible significant tumor modifications.
