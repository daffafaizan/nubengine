      receiving antibiotic treatment. The same is true for Clostridium difficile-associated
      diarrhoea (CDAD) with even more grave consequences of increased morbidity and mortality. The
      development and evaluation of preventive strategies is one key public health challenge. In
      the absence of clinically evaluated alternatives, probiotics have been suggested to be
      beneficial for the prevention of AAD and CDAD. However, data have so far been inconclusive
      and recently published meta-analyses strongly recommended large state-of-the-art clinical
      trials on probiotic substances for the prevention of AAD and CDAD. Since the efficacy,
      side-effects and modes of action of different probiotic bacteria and yeast are strain
      specific, benefits and risks cannot be generalised. The non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae var. boulardii (Sac. boulardii) is considered the most promising probiotic
      substance for the prevention of AAD and CDAD. We carry out a randomised, placebo controlled,
      double blind multicentre clinical trial to evaluate Sac. boulardii for the indication of
      prevention of AAD and CDAD in 1520 adult, hospitalised patients.
