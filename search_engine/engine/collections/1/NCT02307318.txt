      patients with radial procedures will be used in this study.

      Study Procedure For patients with a 4 French catheter, SoftSeal will be applied per physician
      instruction. Current protocol for use includes compression of ulnar artery on the same visit.

      Any bleeding observed at the site after manual pressure hold with SoftSeal will constitute a
      failure to achieve hemostasis patient will be managed per standard of care (SOC).

      Data Plan Following completion of clinical care we will extract data related to primary and
      secondary objectives. Data extraction will include documentation of CMS, reverse Barbeau and
      incidence of hematoma and ecchymosis. Any additional statistical analysis or manuscript
      writing will be done as part of a separate agreement to be met with the approval of both
      HaelaTheast Medical Research Institute and Chitogen.

      Sample Size Calculation Since this is a real-world data analysis project with no control
      group, there is not a sample size calculation. We believe approximately 50 patients will be
      enough to provide an understanding of use instructions for the SoftSeal product.
