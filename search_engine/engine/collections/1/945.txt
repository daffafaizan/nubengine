studies on the sweat in renal diabetes insipidus duringtreatment with saluretics.description of a 5-month-old boy sufferingfrom familial diabetes insipidus.  hissweat as well as that of his mother had anincreased nacl content.  chlorthalidoneand fursemide had a different effect bothon the quantity and on the nacl content ofthe sweat.  a single dose of chlorthalidonedecreased the nacl content for a shorttime, but increased the quantity of sweatduring 3 days.  fursemide given intermittentlyproduced a decrease of the sweat naclalso during the intervals and an increaseof the quantity of sweat; however, as acontraregulation during the intervals, thequantity of sweat decreased and at the sametime the urea content increased.  fromthe isotonic serum filtrate in the sweatglands ho and nacl were reabsorbed inthe ducts and the urea concentrationincreased but the reabsorption of ho and nacldid not go parallel, therefore the sweat ishypotonic.  this regulation is altered indiabetes insipidus, therefore the high valuesof nacl.  without changing the osmolarity,na is exchanged with k.  this mechanismis accentuated if the na-concentrationis high.
