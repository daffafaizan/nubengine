      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of cisplatin and irinotecan followed by carboplatin, etoposide,
           and radiotherapy, in terms of 2-year survival, in patients with limited stage small cell
           lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall response rate, overall survival, and failure-free survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with induction therapy comprising
           irinotecan and cisplatin.

        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes and irinotecan IV over
           90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Immediately after the completion of induction therapy, patients
           receive carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days
           1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Radiotherapy: Beginning on day 1 of consolidation therapy, patients undergo chest
           radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6-7 weeks.

      After the completion of consolidation therapy, patients who achieve a complete remission or
      very good partial remission may undergo prophylactic radiotherapy to the brain.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 15-24 months.
