    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety of concurrent single/low dose radiation therapy (radiotherapy) (8
      Gy/1fx) in combination with pembrolizumab in relapsed or refractory myeloma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize late toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] >
      grade 2 toxicity at 6 and 12 months) and the effect of radiation in combination with
      pembrolizumab on systemic response rates using international myeloma working group (IMWG)
      uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma at 6 months and 12 months.

      II. To assess changes in positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a
      result of combining pembrolizumab and radiotherapy at 6 months and 12 months.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy on day 1. Patients also receive pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 2 or 3. Courses with pembrolizumab repeat every 3
      weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
