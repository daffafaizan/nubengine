      treatments to reduce pain and improve function have included therapeutic exercises, NSAIDs,
      subacromial corticosteroid injections. However, some patients are resistant to these
      conservative treatments. In recent years, prolotherapy has increased in popularity for the
      treatment of musculosketal conditions. Regenerative injection methods can be applied in
      resistant chronic rotator cuff disease. In this prospective, randomized controlled, single
      blind, interventional study, a total of 60 patients with shoulder pain due to rotator cuff
      disease who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. Eligible participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups using computer-generated random numbers.
      In the dextrose prolotherapy group, ultrasound-guided prolotherapy injections will be applied
      under aseptic conditions at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. In the salin injection group, salin injections
      will be applied under aseptic conditions at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. Home exercise program will be
      apply to both groups. Participants are going to evaluate before injection, and at the 1-month
      follow-up and 3-month follow-up using the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain during
      activity, at rest, and at night, with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) change
      in pain and disability score, with The University of California and Los Angeles Rating Score
      (UCLA) change in pain and functional score and the change in the Ultrasound Shoulder
      Pathology Rating Scale (USPRS).
