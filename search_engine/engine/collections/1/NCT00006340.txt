        -  Determine the safety, toxicity, and the reversibility of toxicity of arginine butyrate
           in patients with Epstein Barr virus-induced malignancies or lymphoproliferative
           disorders.

        -  Determine the clinical pharmacology of arginine butyrate when administered with
           ganciclovir, including plasma half life and major routes of elimination in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the biologic effects of arginine butyrate in terms of inducing sensitivity to
           ganciclovir in tissue samples from selected patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ganciclovir IV over 1 hour twice a day on days -1 to 21 for the
      first course (days 0-21 for all subsequent courses) and escalating doses of arginine butyrate
      IV continuously on days 0-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for a minimum of 42 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
