      weight-loss programs often give up healthy eating habits and regain weight. We examined
      whether taste-based goal setting, which minimizes perceived deprivation by promoting taste
      and moderation, would sustain long-term reductions in saturated fat and body mass index
      (BMI). Participants were randomized to Taste-Based Choices (taste-based goal setting + a
      standard 6-month behavioral weight-loss intervention), Smart Consumers (a standard 6-month
      intervention alone) or Community Access (access to commercial/community-based behavioral
      weight-loss programs) and followed over 18 months. To test our hypotheses, we examined a set
      of orthogonal contrasts (TBC and SC vs. CA; TBC vs. SC) on reductions in saturated fat (Block
      FFQ) and clinic-measured BMI.
