      hormone. Radioiodine ablation and diagnosis with rhTSH became the standard of care treatment
      for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Stably supplying rhTSH has been the unmet
      need for management and follow-up procedure for thyroid remnant. GX-30 is an investigational
      product, developed to provide inexpensive rhTSH to patients in order to ensure stable supply
      of rhTSH.
