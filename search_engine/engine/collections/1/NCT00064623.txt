    
      The C107 study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled dose finding study of NGX-4010 for
      the treatment of painful symptoms of HIV-associated neuropathy. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive initial treatment according to one of three doses (application
      durations), and to receive double-blind NGX-4010 patch (high-concentration capsaicin) or
      matching control (low-concentration capsaicin).

      Participants who complete study evaluations through Week 12 will have the option of receiving
      up to 3 additional open-label treatments.
