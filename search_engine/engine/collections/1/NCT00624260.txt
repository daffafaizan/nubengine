    
      Patients will be randomized in two groups: one (PET-TDM group) including a semi-annual
      systematic PET-TDM during usual follow-up (M6, M12, M18, M24, M30 and M36 after initial
      surgery) and the second (control group) in which one PET-TDM will be realized only for
      current indication (high isolated markers or before a metastasis curative resection) during
      usual follow-up. Will be included patients with a high risk of recurrence of a colorectal
      tumor N+ or M+ completely removed (R0 or R1) or tumor stage 4, no regional lymph node
      metastasis, no distant metastasis (T4N0M0) operated in emergency (tumoral perforation).

      Patients will be followed-up during 3 years since the date of initial surgery. Conventional
      follow-up will be performed by consensual recommendations for all the patients. In the case
      of detecting a recurrence, the adapted treatment (surgery or chemotherapy or both) with
      curative aim will be implemented and the follow-up will be carried out in its term or death.
      In the case of non curable recurrence, the follow-up will be carried out in its term or
      death, and the PET-TDM will not be realised any more.
