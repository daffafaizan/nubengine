    
      Funded by PCORI, the objective of this retrospective observational study is to perform
      several safety and effectiveness comparisons on commonly prescribed bipolar disorder
      medications, engaging patient focus groups in generating additional questions and
      interpreting results.

      The study will be a retrospective cohort study conducted with administrative claims data from
      the Truven MarketScan Commerical Claims and Encounters and Medicare database from 2010-2016.

      The database contains approximately 100 million patients within the US population in every
      state and nearly every county in the nation, across all ages, ethnicities and socioeconomic
      categories, including privately insured, and Medicare patients. The study will focus on
      approximately 1.3 million patients with two or more diagnoses of bipolar disorder in the
      claims records according to ICD-9 and/or ICD-10 coding.

      The treatments that will be compared are lithium carbonate; first generation antipsychotics:
      haloperidol and perphenazine; second generation antipsychotics: clozapine, risperidone,
      olanzapine, aripiprazole, quetiapine, ziprasidone, asenapine, lurasidone, and paliperidone;
      mood stabilizing anticonvulsants: valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine;
      antidepressants: mirtazapine, bupropion, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, citalopram,
      escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vilazodone, and doxepin.

      The investigators will perform cross-sectional and survival based analysis using regression,
      propensity scoring, and local control to perform bias-corrected comparisons of the above
      treatments for for their impact on: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) risk of hospitalization; (3)
      frequency of manic and depressive mood episodes; (4) risk of suicide attempts and self-harm;
      and (5) risk of drug-induced adverse effects such as kidney disease/failure and metabolic
      syndrome. In addition, the investigators will examine heterogeneity of treatment effect by
      co-morbidity within pediatric, adult, and elderly sub-populations.
