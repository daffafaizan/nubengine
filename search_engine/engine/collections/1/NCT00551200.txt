      combines this nitrogen with other molecules to create a harmless substance called urea, which
      is excreted in the urine. Patients with Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) are unable to create as
      much urea from nitrogen, and therefore, toxic levels of nitrogen can accumulate in the body,
      causing harm. To treat these patients, doctors usually have the patient consume less protein
      and supplement certain amino acids that may be lacking. A drug called Buphenyl速 is sometimes
      prescribed as an adjunctive treatment for the chronic maintenance of UCD patients in order to
      keep ammonia levels down. Some issues with Buphenyl速 include a high pill burden (up to 40
      pills per day), bad taste and odor, and high sodium content. Like Buphenyl速, HPN-100 provides
      an alternate way for the body to dispose of nitrogen, other than through the urea cycle.
      Unlike Buphenyl速, HPN-100 is an odorless, tasteless, concentrated oil that does not contain
      large amounts of sodium.
