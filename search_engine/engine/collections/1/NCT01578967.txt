    
      This study is designed as a single arm pilot feasibility trial using an induction of 2-6
      cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy followed
      by 6 cycles of brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) consolidation for previously untreated patients
      with stage I and II non-bulky Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL).

      Feasibility will be determined by the percentage of patients who have no clinical evidence of
      HL, and achieve positron emission tomograph (PET) negative disease post brentuximab
      consolidation. We anticipate approximately 40 patients will be eligible across participating
      centers (including UNC, Mayo Clinic, and the UNC Cancer Network (UNCCN)) over a 2 year
      period. A future phase II study evaluating progression free survival (PFS) after ABVD
      followed by brentuximab vedotin will be considered feasible if â‰¥ 13 of 15 patients enrolled
      in this pilot trial become PET negative after brentuximab vedotin consolidation.
