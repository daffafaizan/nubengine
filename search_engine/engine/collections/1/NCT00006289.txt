    
      Patients with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD), re-named Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,
      type I (CRPS-I), have chronic, post-traumatic pain that spreads beyond the distribution of
      any single peripheral nerve without evidence of major peripheral nerve damage. A similar
      disorder, Causalgia, re-named CRPS-II, presents with clear evidence of nerve injury. No
      successful drug treatment exists for these disorders. Neurotropin is a non-protein extract of
      cutaneous tissue from rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus. Neurotropin has been used
      extensively in Japan to treat RSD and other painful conditions; however, the drug has not
      undergone clinical therapeutic testing in the United States. This protocol is to carry out
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies about clinical efficacy of Neurotropin
      for acute pain in dental outpatients and for chronic pain in outpatients with CRPS-I or II.
