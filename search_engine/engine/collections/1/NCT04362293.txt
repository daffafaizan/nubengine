      hematopoietic cell transplant for patients with sickle cell disease. In this study, patients
      with SCD who would be expected to benefit from an allogeneic HCT will receive an
      unmanipulated peripheral blood derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) graft
      from either an MSD or HAPLO donor after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen comprising
      of alemtuzumab, thiotepa and low dose total body irradiation. All patients will receive a
      pre-conditioning phase comprising of hydroxyurea and azathioprine to reduce the risk of graft
      rejection. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of sirolimus. Patients on the HAPLO arm will also
      receive two doses of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. All patients will receive regularly
      scheduled low dose donor lymphocyte infusions till donor lymphocyte chimerism reaches at
      least 90% donor. The main objective of this study is to improve graft function and immune
      reconstitution after a reduced intensity conditioning based transplant.
