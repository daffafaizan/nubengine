      of task unrelated thought or mind-wandering. Older adults report less mind-wandering in
      sustained tasks than younger adults, something that is surprising due to the reduced
      performance on tasks. It is clear that both cognitive and emotional processes underlie
      comprehension and sustained attention and relate to prevalence of task unrelated thought and
      performance. A complex process such as reading comprehension presents a challenge for
      improvement because of the wide range of changes that occur with age. Pharmacological
      therapies can target only a limited number of the many changes believed to underlie
      functional decline. One way that may mitigate these declines in performance in a broad way is
      mindfulness training. Thus, the investigators conducted a randomized study to assess the
      effects of mindfulness training relative to an active health education control group on mind
      wandering and controlled processing abilities in older adults. All individuals that contact
      the Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory (CNLab) with interest underwent a phone screening
      assessing inclusion/exclusion criteria.Those participants meeting I/E criteria were invited
      to participate in the study. During the first assessment session, written informed consent
      was obtained; additional inclusion/exclusion measures were administered; and self-report
      questionnaires and assessment measures were completed. Following the first assessment
      session, four training sessions took place. Participants were randomized into either the a
      mindfulness training intervention or a health education intervention. Subsequently, all
      participants were invited back for post-assessment session.
