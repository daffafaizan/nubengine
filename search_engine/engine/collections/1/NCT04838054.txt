      and randomized into two groups to analyze clinical parameters and results of this study: 1)
      test group (stabilized chlorine dioxide rinse) and 2) control group (placebo). Each group
      will be associated with periodontal basic therapy.

      Treatment Protocol After inclusion of the patients, medical history and initial examination
      are performed, patients will be randomly divided into the following two groups: 1) test
      (stabilized chlorine dioxide rinse associated with periodontal basic therapy); and 2) control
      (placebo associated with periodontal basic therapy).

      Periodontal basic therapy will consist of oral hygiene instruction, motivation, retentive
      factor removal, and an adaptation of the protocol of full-mouth scaling and root planing
      (stabilized chlorine dioxide mouthwash will be used). Plastic currets are used to instrument
      the implants and metal currets to instrument teeth. Immediately after instrumentation,
      chemical solutions of chlorine dioxide or placebo will be dispensed to the subjects.

      The subjects will follow their normal oral-hygiene procedures with the addition of using the
      study rinse toothbrush and toothpaste provided to them.
