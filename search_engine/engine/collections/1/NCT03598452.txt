      antiviral drug delivery was used as first-line treatment in several studies when systematic
      injection has been ruled out. The reported dose of intravitreal injections of ganciclovir
      (IVG) varied from 200 Î¼g/0.1 ml to 5mg/0.1 ml in patients with AIDS. There was no consensus
      on the dose of ganciclovir in the treatment of CMVR in HIV-negative patients. Previous work
      showed the safety and the efficacy of 1mg IVG. The investigators proposed that a higher dose
      of ganciclovir (6mg/0.1ml) for the first injection followed by lower dose for maintenance may
      indicate a better result. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the therapeutic
      effect and safety of initial high-dose IVG for CMVR in HIV-negative patients.
