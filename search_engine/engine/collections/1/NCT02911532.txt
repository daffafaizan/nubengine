      operation. Now the best way to prevent the recurrence is autologous conjunctival stem cell
      transplantation, but this way of operation can cause lack of conjunctiva and conjunctival
      scar, even may effect the later glaucoma surgery. For the atretoblepharia patients, amniotic
      membrane transplantation and autologous oral mucosa transplantation can not make effect to
      alleviate it. In this pilot project, investigators would like to study the effect of tissue
      engineering conjunctiva transplantation in the treatment of pterygium and tissue engineering
      conjunctiva transplantation combined with conjunctiva sac formation for the treatment of
      atretoblepharia. This will allow us to determine if useful data can be obtained, and if so,
      lead to further studies in various conjunctiva loss caused by trauma, infections, and so on.
