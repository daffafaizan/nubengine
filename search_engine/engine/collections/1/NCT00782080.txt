      behavior. Clinical evidence suggests that a herbal drug combination of St. JohnÂ´s Wort
      /Valerian extract may be effective in treating ADHD symptoms in methylphenidate and
      atomoxetine naive patients. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of an herbal
      treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either an herbal product or placebo twice a
      day for the duration of 8 weeks. Participants will come in for study visits after 2 and 8
      weeks for the assessment of ADHD symptoms, performance and spontaneous movements. Side
      effects will be monitored continuously and also assessed by rating scales.
