      physically active because this is one of the most important things that patients can do to
      benefit their health. The Physical Activity Counselling (PAC) randomized controlled trial
      examined what happens when a physical activity counsellor is added to the family health care
      team. For the project, HCPs did a brief, 2-4 minute counselling session with their patients
      who reported doing less than 150 minutes of physical activity a week. Half (59) of the
      patients in the PAC Project only received this brief counselling from their HCP (brief
      counselling group) while the other half (61) also received six sessions with the physical
      activity counsellor over a three month period (intensive counselling group). The purpose of
      the project was to compare these 2 groups. The HCPs and the PAC used the 7 As shared-care
      model for physical activity counselling in primary care (Fortier et al., 2006). The HCPs and
      the PAC tried to help the patients want to (be motivated to) and to feel able to (be
      confident that they can) increase their level of physical activity. A number of validated
      questionnaires as well as some interviews were used to look at the effects of the counselling
      on motivation, confidence and physical activity. As well patients wore wear a small gadget
      known as an accelerometer to measure their actual physical activity. Quality of life was
      measured in all patients. Some patients (one third) had physical and metabolic testing three
      times during the trial. The cost of adding a PAC to a family health care team was also
      assessed.
