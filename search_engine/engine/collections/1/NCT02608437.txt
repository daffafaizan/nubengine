      Pharmacologic reversion of such alterations is feasible, and second generation "epigenetic
      drugs" are in development and have demonstrated to possess significant immunomodulatory
      properties. This knowledge, together with the availability of new and highly effective
      immuno-therapeutic agents including immune check-point(s) blocking monoclonal antibodies,
      allows us to plan for highly innovative proof-of-principle combination studies that will
      likely open the path to more effective anti-cancer therapies.

      Targeting immune check-point(s) with immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a novel
      and rapidly evolving strategy to treat cancer, that is rapidly spreading to different tumor
      histologies. The prototype approach of this therapeutic modality relies on the inhibition of
      negative signals delivered by CTLA-4 expressed on T lymphocytes. CTLA-4 blockade has
      profoundly changed the therapeutic landscape of metastatic melanoma (MM), significantly
      improving the survival of MM patients; however, objective clinical responses are limited, and
      only a minority of patients achieves long-term disease control.1 Therefore, several
      combination approaches are being explored to improve the efficacy of CTLA-4 blockade. Along
      this line, based on the preclinical evidence the investigators gained on the broad
      immunomodulatory activity of SGI-110, the exploratory phase 1 combination study NIBIT-M4 has
      been designed to provide proof-of-concept evidence to the immunologic and clinical efficacy
      of CTLA-4 blockade combined with DNA-HypomethylatingAgent (DHA). Progressing Stage III or
      Stage IV MM patients, amenable to serial tumor biopsies will be enrolled in the study.
