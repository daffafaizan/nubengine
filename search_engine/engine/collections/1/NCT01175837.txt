      I. Assess the safety and feasibility of short-term fasting prior to administration of
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate weight changes in patients who are exposed to short-term fasting prior to
      chemotherapy.

      II. Get a preliminary estimate of the longest feasible fasting period prior to chemotherapy.

      III. Evaluate the toxicity profile of systemic chemotherapy treatment in patients who undergo
      short-term fasting prior to treatment.

      IV. Investigate changes in plasma glucose, insulin, Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and
      IGF-1binding proteins (BP) in patients who undertake short-term fasting.

      OUTLINE:

      COHORT I: Patients fast 24 hours before day 1 of course 2 of chemotherapy. If fast is well
      tolerated, patients may escalate fasting by 12 hours for each subsequent course of
      chemotherapy for up to 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients fast at the longest fasting regimen found to be safe and tolerable in
      cohort I before day 1 of each course of course of chemotherapy for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.
