    
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the
      parenteral synthetic carbohydrate-based conjugate vaccine against Shigella flexneri 2a
      (Shigella flexneri 2a-Tetanus Toxoid15 (SF2a-TT15)) adjuvanted or not with Alhydrogel in
      infants in an endemic country (Kenya), the target population for the vaccine, using an
      age-descending approach. In total, 232 participants will be enrolled in the study: 16 adults
      (18-50 years-old), 16 children (2-5 years-old) and 200 infants (9 months-old +/ 1 mo).

      The vaccine will be tested in adults first, then in children and eventually in infants in
      Kenya (where Shigella infection is present), based on the safety/tolerability in each group
      before to moving to the other. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the study
      vaccine or a placebo control (same solution but without the vaccine component). The
      participants will have to go through all the trial procedures including the 14 visits (3
      injections and 11 follow-up) during a 16 months period.
