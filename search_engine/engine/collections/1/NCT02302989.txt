    
      This is an open-label, prospective, randomized study of intravitreally administered
      ranibizumab 0.5 mg in subjects with unilateral neovascular AMD in which the fellow (study)
      eye is at high-risk for also developing conversion to neovascular AMD.

      The Study will determine the efficacy of a quarterly injection of Ranibizumab to prevent the
      conversion of dry age-related macular degeneration to neovascular AMD in high risk eyes.
