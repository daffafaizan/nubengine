      immunocompromised children. Many of the drugs used for fungal prophylaxis have been
      associated with kidney and liver toxicity. Also, breakthrough infections have been reported
      with the use of some of the oral agents due to poor oral absorption. An alternative approach
      is the use of intravenous micafungin for fungal prophylaxis. Micafungin has a distinct
      advantage due to its better safety profile, specifically in terms of liver and kidney
      toxicity. Currently, children who receive micafungin are given daily dosing. This study will
      examine the pharmacokinetics of micafungin when it is given on an every other day schedule.
      It will examine whether every other day micafungin will provide drug exposure equivalent to
      daily dosing while reducing administration costs and improving patient convenience. Both
      animal and adult human data support the use of this approach. Fifteen patients will be
      enrolled on this study and will be given a single dose of micafungin (3 mg/kg). Blood samples
      will be drawn for pharmacokinetic measurements after administration of micafungin.
