      • To determine the maximum tolerated doses Gemcitabine and Taxotere when given weekly with
      concurrent radiation in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the
      extremities.

      Secondary Objective:

      • To evaluate immunological changes induced by gemcitabine and docetaxel with radiation in
      patient with high risk-soft tissue sarcomas in blood. This would include T cell subsets, NK,
      and dendritic cells and tumor macrophages all of which make up the tumor microenvironment.
