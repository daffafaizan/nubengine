      later diagnosis. The time from screening to diagnosis is critical to optimizing cancer care,
      yet the efficacy of navigation in reducing it is insufficiently documented. Here the
      investigators evaluate a culturally sensitive patient navigation program to reduce the time
      to diagnosis and increase the proportions of women diagnosed within 30 days and 60 days.
      METHODS. The investigators analyzed 425 Latinas who had Breast Imaging Reporting and Data
      System (BI-RADS) radiologic abnormalities categorized as BI-RADS-3, BI-RADS-4, or BI-RADS-5
      from July 2008 to January 2011. There were 217 women in the navigated group and 208 women in
      the control group. Women were navigated by locally trained navigators or were not navigated
      (data for this group were abstracted from charts). The Kaplan-Meier method, Cox proportional
      hazards regression, and logistic regression were used to determine differences between
      groups. RESULTS. The time to diagnosis was shorter in the navigated group (mean, 32.5 days vs
      44.6 days in the control group; hazard ratio, 1.32; P ¼ .007). Stratified analysis revealed
      that navigation significantly shortened the time to diagnosis among women who had BI-RADS-3
      radiologic abnormalities (mean, 21.3 days vs 63.0 days; hazard ratio, 2.42; P < .001) but not
      among those who had BI-RADS-4 or BI-RADS-5 radiologic abnormalities (mean, 37.6 days vs 36.9
      days; hazard ratio, 0.98; P ¼ .989). Timely diagnosis occurred more frequently among
      navigated Latinas (within 30 days: 67.3% vs 57.7%; P ¼ .045; within 60 days: 86.2% vs 78.4%;
      P ¼ .023). This was driven by the BI-RADS-3 strata (within 30 days: 83.6% vs 50%; P < .001;
      within 60 days: 94.5% vs 67.2%; P < .001). A lack of missed appointments was associated with
      timely diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS. Patient-centered navigation to assist Latina women with
      abnormal screening mammograms appeared to reduced the time to diagnosis and increase rates of
      timely diagnosis overall. However, in stratified analyses, only navigated Latinas with an
      initial BI-RADS-3 screen benefited, probably because of a reduction in missed diagnostic
      appointments in this group.
