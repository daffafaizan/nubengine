    
      •Primary Aim:

      o To describe participants 6 months to <18 years of age with hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      infection in a prospective cohort in the United States (US) and Canada and identify
      predictors of disease activation and progression

      Secondary Aims:

        -  To describe clinical, virological, and immunological characteristics of participants
           with HBV in the US and Canada.

        -  To evaluate changes in HBV infection status and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
           levels and factors associated with those changes.

        -  To verify whether a baseline HBsAg below 1,000 IU/mL and HBV DNA below 1,000 IU/mL is an
           accurate predictor of people who are, or who will become, inactive carriers, defined as
           people who are HBsAg positive, hepatitis B "e" antigen (HBeAg) negative, have normal
           alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and HBV DNA under 1,000 IU/mL on at least two occasions
           over a period of at least 6 months with HBV DNA under 1,000 IU/mL.

        -  To assess the health related quality of life (HRQOL) of treatment naïve hepatitis B
           surface antigen (HBsAg) positive children and adolescents

        -  To develop a bank of biospecimens (e.g., serum, plasma, DNA, liver tissue) obtained from
           participants with HBV infection.

        -  To identify pediatric participants from 2 years to <18 years of age with chronic HBV
           infection for potential participation in treatment study to be conducted by the
           Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN).
