      treat it. Blood vessel elasticity, or compliance, can be depicted as the ability of the
      vessels to convert intermittent blood flow (cardiac ejection during systole) to continuous
      blood flow throughout the cardiac cycle. The compliance, or ability of vessels to accept
      energy, can be subdivided into elasticity of large and small vessels. Pulse wave tonometry is
      a non-invasive technique performed using a hand-held tonometer that generates two indices
      which correspond to large artery elasticity (LAE) and small artery elasticity (SAE). LAE and
      SAE estimates by pulse waveform analysis have previously shown greater correlation to
      Framingham risk when directly compared with other techniques such as flow-mediated diltation,
      and both LAE and SAE are associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors (smoking,
      insulin resistance, hypertension).

      It is unclear what the net effect of maraviroc, a chemokine-receptor blocker is on
      cardiovascular function.

      The aims of this substudy are:

        -  To compare changes in the vascular endothelium between the control arm ((N(t)RTI) plus
           PI/r) and each of the maraviroc switch arms over 48 weeks of follow-up.

        -  To compare the changes in biomarkers and selected immunological markers between the
           control arm ((N(t)RTI) plus PI/r) and each of the maraviroc switch arms over 48 weeks of
           follow-up.
