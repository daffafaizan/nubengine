      participants received a single infusion of 60±5 IU/kg of Human-cl rhFVIII; blood samples were
      collected for 72 hours following the infusion. (2) Prophylactic Treatment-Phase I during
      which participants received infusions of 30-40 IU/kg of human-cl rhFVIII every other day or
      3x/week for 1-3 months. (3) Prophylactic Treatment-Phase II during which the dose and dosing
      interval were determined individually from data gathered in the initial PK assessment. The
      maximum dosing interval with a dose of ≤ 60-80 IU/kg that maintains a trough level of ≥ 0.01
      IU/mL was determined. Participants were treated for 6 months.
