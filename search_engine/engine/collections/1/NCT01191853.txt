      vaccination. The H1N1 (swine flu) influenza virus is an emerging pathogen which has the
      potential to cause devastating morbidity and mortality in the coming months. In June 2009,
      the World Health Organization declared the H1N1 outbreak to be a global pandemic. At present
      there are limited data on the cellular and molecular immune responses in adult recipients of
      either the seasonal or the H1N1 influenza vaccines.

      Therefore, the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases proposes
      this protocol designed to obtain blood from healthy adult subjects (NIH employees) prior to
      vaccination and then at various time points after receiving the FDA-licensed seasonal and
      H1N1 influenza vaccine. These samples will be used to perform a comprehensive and detailed
      analysis of the immune system at baseline and in response to vaccination. To our knowledge,
      this protocol will be the first study to characterize the human cellular and molecular immune
      system parameters, or immunome, in a large number of healthy adults (NIH employees). This
      information may be useful in designing newer, more effective vaccines to prevent the spread
      of H1N1 influenza.

      The primary objective is to perform laboratory studies to characterize the immune response in
      healthy adult volunteers at baseline and after immunization with the seasonal or H1N1
      influenza vaccines. Primary endpoint is the results of the research laboratory assessments.
      As samples will be stored indefinitely, the time frame for primary endpoint is indefinite.
