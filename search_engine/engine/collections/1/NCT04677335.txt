      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and similar cholesterol-rich lipoproteins
      containing apolipoprotein B (ApoB) within the arterial wall is a key initiating event in
      CVDs. Statins are the mainstay of pharmacological cholesterol-reduction therapy. However, a
      significant proportion of patients report some degree of statin intolerance, which typically
      fade away when the statin is switched, discontinued or the dosage reduced. A growing
      attention has been devoted to the correction of increased LDL-C levels through the use of
      dietary supplements, either because some patients have milder forms of hypercholesterolemia
      or as an alternative to statins in patients who may have experienced or are worried of side
      effects. Nutraceutical combinations are increasingly used in clinical practice. In this pilot
      randomized study, we sought to evaluate of the effect on LDL-C and other blood lipid
      parameters of a nutraceutical combining Red Yeast Rice extract (also known by its scientific
      name Monascus purpureus) containing 10 mg of monacolin K, plus 1 billion colony forming units
      (cfu) of the AB-LIFE probiotic formula. The later is composed of three L. plantarum strains,
      namely CECT7527 (also known as KABP011™), CECT7528 (also known as KABP012™) and CECT7529
      (also known as KABP013™).
