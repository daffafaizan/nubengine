    
      A randomized, open-label clinical trial will be conducted with a one-year follow-up. For
      which basal measurement of calciuria, citraturia, serum creatinine, serum and urinary
      electrolytes, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D levels and renal ultrasound, as well as dietary
      intake (protein, energy, salt and water). The dietary intake per day of food and
      pharmacological treatment will be evaluated quarterly, body composition (anthropometry) and
      serum and urinary electrolyte levels will be measured; Bone constitution (DXA, quantitative
      bone ultrasound), IL-1 (as inflammatory markers) and vitamin D will be evaluated every six
      months.

      Participants will be blinded to the pharmacological treatment they will receive. The
      randomization of the participants will be done through the page www.randomization.com. The
      randomization was performed by blocks, where blocks of 6 members each were made i. Group 1:
      only recommendations of water intake and reduction of salt intake and hydrochlorothiazide
      will be given (the dose will be assigned according to weight and sex by a pediatric
      nephrologist, dose of 0.5-1.5mg / kg / day, starting with the dose 1 mg / kg).
      Hydrochlorothiazide will be provided to the patient.

      ii. Group 2: placebo capsules and a strict diet plan will be given. The placebo will look
      similar to that of hydrochlorothiazide and will be prepared in the Nephrology Research
      Laboratory by Biol. Ana María Hernández Sánchez and Quim Lourdes Ortiz. The feeding plan will
      be appropriate for the patient, it will consist of:

        1. 40 ml / Kg / day of water

        2. Protein according to age and sex
