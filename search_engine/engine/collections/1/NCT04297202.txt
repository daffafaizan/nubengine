    
      This is an Open, Single Arm, Exploratory and Phase II Clinical Trial of Apatinib Combined
      With SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor) in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) as
      Perioperative Treatment. we conduct this study in order to observe and evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of Apatinib combined with SHR-1210 (an Anti-PD-1 Inhibitor) in treatment of
      patients with HCC. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Major pathologic response (MPR), Secondary
      Efficacy Endpoints: Pathological complete response Rate (pCR), Objective Response(ORR)
      (According to RECIST Version 1.1), Recurrence-free survival(RFS) and Overall survival rate of
      6 months (OS %-6 m). Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and
      outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.3.
