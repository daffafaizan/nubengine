    
      Primary aim:

      The overall goal is to improve the care of patients with Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis
      (RRP) - and the investigators aim to do this by determining the most effective and safe RRP
      treatments currently being used in patients in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals within
      the United Kingdom (UK) (information which is currently lacking).

      By determining the most effective treatments of RRP, the investigators will be able to
      increase the time interval between surgical interventions to maintain symptomatic control,
      reduce overall number of RRP interventions, severity and spread of papillomas in the airway,
      hospital visits, medications and ultimately improve quality of life in those suffering from
      RRP. By also capturing peri- and post-procedural details the investigators will be able to
      determine the relative safety of treatments and identify those which slow the progression of
      disease.

      From the data collected the investigators intend to identify patient subgroups (based on
      patient characteristics such as age, gender, human papillomavirus (HPV) type, location of
      papillomas, RRP severity and spread, comorbidities) who respond better to specific
      treatments, and also identify patient risk factors which contribute to the complication
      outcomes (such as tracheostomy).

      Secondary aims:

        -  build an evidence base of the different RRP treatments used across the UK which will
           help to formulate hypotheses for future research in RRP and improve quality of life for
           RRP patients;

        -  inform National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) interventional procedure
           guidance on radiofrequency cold ablation (IPG434,2012), which is currently under special
           arrangements due to lack of safety and efficacy evidence;

        -  identify common symptoms or signs associated with RRP disease profile, to aid future
           diagnosis of RRP;

        -  determine the geographical spread of RRP patients across the UK, to inform effective use
           of future NHS resources and inform the Department of Health strategy in its quadrivalent
           HPV vaccination programme (protecting against four types of HPV including types 6 and 11
           commonly associated with RRP) currently offered to 12-13 year old girls within the NHS
           childhood vaccination programme;

        -  inform future development of national clinical guidance on management of RRP to ensure
           that everyone receives the best care based on best available current knowledge;

        -  determine impact of COVID on RRP patients including changes to RRP management, RRP
           symptoms.

      Objectives:

      The investigators will make use of an existing secure online database platform (the Airway
      Intervention Registry, AIR - developed and hosted by The Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS
      Foundation Trust, NUTH) and its associated infrastructure and develop it to capture
      additional observational outcomes from standard clinical practice and quality of life
      questionnaires from RRP patients. All RRP patients (any age) receiving treatment in any UK
      NHS hospital will be eligible for inclusion. Data collection will be open for 41 months with
      no minimum follow-up required for patients. Due to its recurrent nature (requiring regular
      hospital visits to maintain an open airway), following this patient population will allow the
      investigators to determine both the short- and long-term relative safety and efficacy of RRP
      treatments used in the UK. Consent will be required (from patients/parent/guardian) before
      data are entered into the online database.
