      symptoms of oral or genital HSV infections. Genital samples will include internal and
      external genital lesions such as those collected from lesions of the anus, buttocks, vagina,
      labia, or penis. Oral samples will include those collected from lip, gum, and mouth lesions.
      For concordance testing, the sample size is based on historical study design and estimates of
      the expected prevalence of HSV1 and/or HSV2 in the population enrolled.
