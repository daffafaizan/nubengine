      in the general population. Problems of visual attention generally appear immediately
      following a stroke, and may impair driving and other functions. While it is thought that
      there is a natural course of improvement over time, little is known about how this
      improvement occurs. Some studies suggest that recovery is only partial, meaning certain
      aspects of visual attention may improve while other aspects remain but escape notice.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of stroke on a person's visual attention
      when looking at objects nearby versus far away, and to learn why a person's visual attention
      may become more distracted at near versus far distances. The purpose of this study is also to
      understand how modeled interventions, such as eye patching or prism goggles, affect
      impairment measures of visual attention.

      After an initial screening (including attention, thinking, memory, and visual judgment
      tests), participants will be given a neurological examination. Participants may be asked to
      perform visual tasks while wearing an eye patch or prism goggles. Next, they will be asked to
      perform a line bisection task by looking at lines on a video screen either at close or far
      distances and, using a laser pointer, marking the center of the lines as they appear
      on-screen. Participants may be asked to perform other, similar visual tasks as well.

      Duration of the study for participants varies, ranging from 1 or 2 sessions totaling
      approximately 2 hours to multiple sessions spanning a year.

      Research from this study may help researchers better understand problems associated with
      stroke and may lead to therapies designed to promote improved visual attention.
