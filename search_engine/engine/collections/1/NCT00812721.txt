      come to the UIHC Department of Ophthalmology at designated times for approximately one hour
      on five different days, for a total time commitment of approximately 5 hours. Each subject
      will receive the same 4 artificial tear substitutes and saline, one different drop each day.
      One of the four tear substitutes (brands: Systane, Systane Ultra, Optive, and Refresh) will
      be tested on each of the days. One drop will be used each day and the protocol of each day
      will be the same, the only factor changing from day to day is the drop that is being
      evaluated. On each study day, the subject will have a pre-instillation measurement of their
      higher order aberrometry of each eye. One drop of the designated drop will be placed into
      each of the eyes. Subsequent aberrometry measurements of each eye will be taken at
      immediately post-instillation, 5 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes post instillation. The
      same protocol will be followed with a saline drop and thus each patient will act as a
      control.

      There is no long-term follow-up.
