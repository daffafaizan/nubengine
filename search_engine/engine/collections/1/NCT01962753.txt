      subjects using PET with [F18]AV45. The investigators hypothesize that the brain amyloid load
      will be higher in non or partially remitting depressed subjects treated with antidepressants
      than in fully remitting ones. An additional two years follow-up will allow comparing the
      brain amyloid load at baseline between those who will have evolved towards MCI or MA and
      those who will not, including ApoE genotype, the cognitive performances at baseline, the
      hippocampus volume as assessed by MRI, the type and profile of mood disorder (number of past
      episodes, age at first episode, vascular risk factor profile, response profile to
      antidepressants), as covariates.
