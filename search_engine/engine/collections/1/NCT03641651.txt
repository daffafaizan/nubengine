      with new technology in four trailblazer clinics. This will enable them to provide intensive
      therapy to the patients in accordance with the study protocol. If this setting is integrated
      into the clinical routine, the investigators will be able to collect data to get some first
      insight into economic and functional data required to calculate changes in socioeconomic
      costs
