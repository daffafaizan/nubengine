    
      Patients are randomized to either weekly treatment with paclitaxel (arm A) or endocrine
      treatment in combination with palbociclib (arm B) for 12 weeks. Choice of endocrine treatment
      is for pre- and perimenopausal women and all men tamoxifen 20 mg daily, alternatively for
      women in this age cohort, an LHRH analogue in combination with an aromatase inhibitor, for
      all postmenopausal women treatment with an aromatase inhibitor. The aromatase inhibitors to
      be used according to local practice are anastrozole 1 mg daily, exemestane 25 mg daily, or
      letrozole 2.5 mg daily. Pre- or perimenopausal women and all men are treated with tamoxifen,
      alternatively with an LHRH analogue in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (only women).
      Postmenopausal women receive an aromatase inhibitor.

      After 12 weeks, patients without signs of disease progression (PD) are switched to either
      endocrine treatment in combination with palbociclib (arm A) or weekly treatment with
      paclitaxel (arm B) for 12 weeks. Postoperatively, patients receive three 3-weekly courses of
      chemotherapy with a combination of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide.

      Before start, after 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks of treatment, radiological assessments of tumor
      size are performed using mammography and ultrasound alt. MRI breast; PET-CT, confined to the
      breast and regional lymph nodes, before start, after 12 and 24 weeks, blood tests before
      start, after 1 week, 12, 18 and 24 weeks. Physical examinations are performed before start
      and then four-weekly after weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 weeks of treatment.

      In case of disease progression during ongoing study treatment, individualized management in
      the patient's best interest must be considered, in which case surgery is the primary option.
