      with special training in osteopathic palpation and manipulation approaches, touches, and
      administers a slight inhibition of occipital bone motion for five minutes per stage. Both
      will have a non invasive skin sensor (probe), called a laser Doppler flow meter, attached to
      their forehead to detect changes in subcutaneous blood flow velocity. The signal from the
      device will be augmented and transmitted for display onto a digital polygraph recorder. Then,
      using Fourier transformation software, the signal will be displayed as a graph for spectral
      analysis to determine the effect on specific wave forms related to autonomic activity. The
      interaction between the two individuals will be assessed for evidence of entrainment
      phenomenon, i.e., the influence of one biorhythm upon another.
