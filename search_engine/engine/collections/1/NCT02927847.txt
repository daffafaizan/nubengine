      conditions. In the BA +VLNC condition (n = 24) smokers will switch to smoking very low
      nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) while wearing a 21 mg/d nicotine patch for 5 weeks prior to their
      quit date. They will also participate in weekly behavioral activation (BA) treatment
      sessions. Smokers in the VLNC Only group (n = 24) will undergo the same pharmacological
      pretreatment but will undergo standard counseling and health education instead of BA.
      Following the quit date, both groups will receive standard nicotine replacement therapy. At
      baseline and pre-quit, BOLD response to smoking and non-smoking rewards will be measured
      using fMRI after 24 hr abstinence. Latency to relapse will serve as a continuous clinical
      outcome measure.
