      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an intensive integrated
      treatment for Veterans with comorbid chronic pain and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A
      secondary objective is to examine potential mechanisms of action that might account for
      improvements in pain or PTSD. Third, exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess the
      relationship between participation in treatment and cognitive functioning. It is hypothesized
      that 1) participants receiving the intensive treatment (PT) will report significantly greater
      decreases in symptoms of pain and PTSD from pre-treatment to post-treatment when compared to
      participants randomized to a standard care (SC) condition, and 2) participants receiving PT
      will show greater maintenance of change on measures of pain and PTSD at 3 months following
      the completion of treatment when compared to participants randomized to the SC condition.
