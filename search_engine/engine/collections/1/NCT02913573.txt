    
      Patients undergoing total mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction with a tissue
      expander or implant under general anesthesia will be randomly assigned to the addition of a
      pectoral nerve block or no regional block after induction of general anesthesia and prior to
      the start of surgery. Post-operative pain scores and post-operative pain medication usage
      will be recorded. Post-operative nausea/vomiting scores and post-op anti-emetic medication
      usage will be recorded. The clinical impact of pectoral nerve block on this expanding
      population of patients will be determined.
