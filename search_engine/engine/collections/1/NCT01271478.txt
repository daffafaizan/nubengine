      list) to one of the following groups: group 1 will receive Captopril, group 2 Telmisartan,
      group 3 Captopril plus Telmisartan, and group 4 Placebo. Drugs will be provided as tablets
      during a period of 3 months. All patients will have 3 HD sessions per week, with the same
      kind of single-use dialysis membrane and dialysate Monthly visits will be scheduled for
      clinical and biochemical evaluations. A blood sample will be taken at baseline and every
      month for measurement of complete blood count, urea, creatinine, glucose, albumin, lipids,
      and electrolytes (measured by usual methods). In serum samples at 0, 1 and 3 months, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentrations will be measured by
      ELISA using high sensitivity kits. Additionally, in the same serum samples, C-reactive
      protein (CRP) concentrations will be measured by nephelometry using high sensitivity kits.
      All laboratory measurements, including inflammation markers, will be performed in the Central
      Laboratory (Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Médico Nacional de Occidente), by the same
      personnel blinded to patient's details.

      Treatment compliance will be recorded by counting tablets left in the container at the end of
      each monthly visit.
