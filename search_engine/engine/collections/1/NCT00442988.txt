      thus also fasting plasma glucose concentration) in the first week after renal
      transplantation. This testing for DM or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is part of our
      standard clinical protocol and data are collected prospectively in all these patients in an
      electronic patient medical file. The development of diabetes mellitus in all transplant
      patients is documented, including DM therapy.
