      kidney function. Kidney failure is a medical condition in which kidneys fail to filter
      metabolic wastes and toxins out of the body and a series of symptoms will be developed .It is
      common, frequently un recognised and often exists together with other conditions (for
      example, cardiovascular disease and diabetes). When advanced, it also carries a higher risk
      of mortality. The risk of developing CKD(Chronic Kidney diseases ) increases with increasing
      age, and some conditions that coexist with CKD become more severe as kidney dysfunction
      advances CKD can progress to established renal failure in a small but significant percentage
      of people. This classification divides CKD into five stages. Stages 3-5 may be defined by
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) alone, whereas stages 1 and 2 also require the presence of
      persistent proteinuria, albuminuria or haematuria, or structural abnormalities.

      Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them from other types of
      cells. First, they are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for long periods through
      cell division. The second is that under certain physiologic or experimental conditions, they
      can be induced to become cells with special function such as the beating cells of heart
      muscle or the insulin- producing cells of the pancreas as well as the neurons of brain.So our
      approach is to prove safety and efficacy of stem cell in CRF
