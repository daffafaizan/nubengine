    
      Open, multicentre, 1:1 randomised, parallel group phase III study to compare safety and
      efficacy of tacrolimus (FK506) with monoclonal anti-IL2R antibodies (daclizumab) vs
      tacrolimus (FK506) with steroids and evaluate pharmacokinetics in liver allograft recipients
      receiving suboptimal livers.

      Patients receiving primary suboptimal liver allograft transplantation (from donors > 65 years
      and/or liver macrosteatosis >15%) will be randomised to one of the following treatment arms:

      Group I: steroid bolus (intraoperative) monoclonal anti-IL2R antibodies (daclizumab)
      induction tacrolimus Group II: steroid bolus (intraoperative) tacrolimus steroids
