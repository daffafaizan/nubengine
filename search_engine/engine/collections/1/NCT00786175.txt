      major burden to the health care system. Over 30-40% of patients admitted to the medical wards
      of the Hospital Authority hospitals have diabetes as a contributory factor. It was estimated
      that thirty to fifty percent of patients with stroke, heart failure or acute myocardial
      infarction have diabetes as a key causative factor. However, the exact prevalence rate of
      diabetes, including asymptomatic undiagnosed glucose intolerance, among subjects with
      coronary heart disease is still unknown in Hong Kong. Many heart disease patients with
      undiagnosed diabetes remained being untreated on their abnormal glycemic status, which will
      further aggravate the heart disease and impair the prognosis.

      The investigators plan to conduct a cross-sectional survey to study the rate of undiagnosed
      diabetes and glucose intolerance among the Chinese patients with coronary heart disease in
      Hong Kong. The survey results will be important for us to plan the logistics to investigate
      and manage the potential glucose abnormality of our heart disease patient.
