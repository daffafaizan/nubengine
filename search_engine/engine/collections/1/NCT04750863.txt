    
      Adult Onset Still Disease (AOSD) is an acquired inflammatory disease of unknown etiology,
      presenting with non specific symptoms. Other conditions such as cancer, infection or other
      inflammatory disease might mimick its symptoms. Its diagnosis rely on sets of criteria, i.e.
      Fautrel Criteria and Yamaguchi Criteria. However, differential diagnosis might appear during
      follow-up after an initial diagnosis of AOSD. The aim of this study is to assess diagnostic
      performance of Fautral and Yamaguchi Criteria after 18 months of follow-up, and to describe
      differential diagnosis appearing during follow-up.
