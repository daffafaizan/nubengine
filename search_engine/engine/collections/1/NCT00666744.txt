      will be randomised into either a 'control' group that will receive routine therapy or an
      'experimental' group that will receive routine therapy AND additional 'family mediated
      exercise therapy.

      Training will be provided to the nominated family member (s)/friends of participants in the
      'intervention' group on a weekly basis by the research physiotherapist (R1). Family
      members/friends will be requested to keep an exercise diary on a daily basis to document
      completion of exercises. The trial will continue for eight weeks with an expectation that at
      least 1200 additional minutes of FAME therapy will be delivered over this time period. Each
      FAME session is expected to last 35-40 minutes.

      Exercises will include repetitive sit to stand exercises with an emphasis on improving
      symmetry, weight bearing exercises during standing, bridging, straight leg raises, quadriceps
      strengthening exercises, active/active assisted range of movement exercises for the lower
      limb and walking. Outcome will be assessed by a blinded outcome assessor (R2) on entry to the
      study, at eight weeks (post-intervention) and again three months post-intervention
      (follow-up)

      In addition, a semi-structured interview will be carried out with a random sample of the
      participants and their family member (s)/friends to gain a more qualitative insight into the
      impact of the programme on those involved. This interview will be completed by a person
      unknown to the participant. (R3)
