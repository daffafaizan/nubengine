      medications and have a moderate or higher CV risk. The survey will be conducted in the
      Russian Federation.

      Data collection for each study subject will be done within one physician visit. If an
      enrolled subject comes to the visit not fasting (for at least 8 hours), an appointment for
      the blood tests will be made for another day.

      Prior to the assessment of the first subject at a site, each investigator will complete an
      investigator questionnaire on his/her experience and perception of the management of
      hypercholesterolemia in his/her patients.

      Prior to the assessment, subjects will record on a patient questionnaire their awareness of
      hypercholesterolemia, their current treatment schedule, their perception, and compliance.

      The investigator will complete a Case Report Form (CRF) with the subject's demographics,
      known cardiovascular risk factors, cardiovascular medical history, current lipid-lowering
      drug therapy, and the reason for this therapy.

      Fasting blood samples will be taken in tubes to test for total cholesterol, low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), glucose,
      creatinine, hemoglobin A1c, hemoglobin, and hematocrit at a central laboratory in the Russian
      Federation.
