      disorder (ASD) will:

      Hypothesis 1a. will produce greater increases in Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and Nucleus
      Accumbens (NAc) activation during social reward anticipation compared to placebo, providing
      evidence that OT increases activation in brain regions critical for social motivation. (NICHD
      funding for this section/aim- Dr. Joe Piven -U54 HD079124-01)

      Hypothesis 1b. will spend proportionally more time attending to the social image on a screen
      vs. the non-social image compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis 2a. will produce differential effects in VTA and NAc activation during social
      reward anticipation compared with the oxytocin 8 IU vs. oxytocin 40 IU dose, providing
      evidence that OT dose-dependently increases activation in brain regions critical for social
      motivation.

      Hypothesis 2b. will differentially attend to the social image on a screen vs. the non-social
      image compared in the oxytocin 8 IU vs. oxytocin 40 IU dose, providing evidence that OT
      dose-dependently changes the value of social stimuli.
