      stem cell transplantation after intensive, but non-myeloablative chemotherapy with
      fludarabine/cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia. II.
      Determine the engraftment kinetics and degree of chimerism available with this strategy.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, dose-seeking study. Stem cell donors receive G-CSF for 4
      days prior to and throughout stem cell harvest. Patients receive intensive chemotherapy with
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide for 3 days, with patients entered at increasing doses of
      both drugs until the dose allowing engraftment is determined. Three days after intensive
      chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cells are infused. Responding patients who do not experience
      worse than grade 1 acute graft-vs.-host disease receive additional stem cell infusions after
      60 and 120 days. Patients are followed monthly for 4 months, at 6 and 12 months, then yearly
      for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 25 patients will be entered.
