      to 5 days, with careful monitoring of hematological parameters before and after each dose. In
      addition to the general CMP14 safety criteria, any subject who displays a fractional
      hemoglobin drop of 15% below his/her baseline value, then drug administration will stop (e.g.
      for baseline Hgb of 14 g/dL, if there is at any point a decrease of 2.1 g/dL). Hematocrit
      will be similarly monitored, with proportional stop criteria. Elevation in total bilirubin to
      2.0 mg/dL or greater will also be used as a stopping criterion. After stopping drug
      administration (5 days or whenever stop criteria are met), subjects will have a 3-week
      washout period, and the study repeated with the other enantiomer, and similarly with Placebo.
