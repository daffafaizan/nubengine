      participation when PCI is indicated for complex coronary lesions. If patients comply with
      inclusion and exclusion and provide written informed consent they will be randomized in a 1:1
      fashion between the two study treatments, (7 Fr. radial access with a Glideslender sheath or
      7 Fr. femoral access with a standard femoral sheath) , in a 1:1 ratio.

      During hospitalization (before discharge) the access site(s) will be checked for bleeding and
      vascular complications. All access sites should be checked for absent pulsations and
      hematomas and the size should be defined (length and width, cm) and accompanied complaints.
      Radial artery occlusion should be checked with the reverse Barbeau test. The femoral access
      site should be checked for murmurs and absence of pulsations. Ultrasound or Doppler of the
      access sites should be performed in those patients with suspected radial or femoral occlusion
      and the presence of other vascular complications, like (pseudo) aneurysms or arteriovenous
      (AV) fistula within 1 month.

      Patient-reported extremity dysfunction will be evaluated at baseline (before the procedure)
      and 1-month follow-up. Upper extremity function will be evaluated with the Quick Disabilities
      of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) and lower extremity function with
      Lower Extremity Functional Scale questionnaire (LEFS). The occurrence of Major Adverse
      Cardiac Events (MACE) will be evaluated at discharge and 1-month follow-up.
