      management of obesity by the primary care sector. With patient and other stakeholder input,
      the C3PO intervention will be designed to leverage existing primary care professionals and
      technologies to implement a scalable framework for population obesity management that
      coordinates primary care services with extant intensive lifestyle interventions in community
      settings to achieve wider reach and population-level effectiveness. A rigorous, mixed-method
      pilot and feasibility study will provide critical information needed to optimize the
      intervention design and prepare us for a larger and definitive future trial.
