      intake since the last 20 years. Important data supporting this fact can be reflected on
      incidence and prevalence of Metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia.

      A peculiar effect of fructose intake demonstrated in animal models is the development of
      elevated uric acid levels; also some studies have found a clear association between
      hyperuricemia as an important risk factor for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney
      disease and metabolic syndrome.

      Taking into account the existing evidence, our clinical research team presents this protocol
      as a way to evaluate the effect of uric acid treatment and its relation with Fructose
      consumption, metabolic syndrome parameters, hyperuricemia and risk of hypertension.

      Confirming evidence with clinical basis may be the initial strategy to create primary
      prevention programs to control this health problems affecting Mexican Population.
