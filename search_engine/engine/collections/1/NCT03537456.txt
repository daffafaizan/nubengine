      by an increasing number of specialists in Aesthetics due to their clinical performance
      regarding volume restoration and favorable safety profile.

      An evaluation of pre-clinical data was performed before the clinical investigation design.

      Similar dermal fillers have been used in several clinical investigations in humans with a
      good rate of clinical success and good safety profiles.

      During January - March 2018, review of the scientific literature was performed, to find
      similar investigations to determine the minimal clinically significant difference between
      Baseline and a period of 30 days after the end the treatment.

      Considering the exploratory nature of this study and the fact that this investigation is
      first-in-human, the clinical investigation is designed to have a number of 7 study visits and
      a treatment period of 60 days.

      In a similar dermal filler study, Takanobu Mashiko et al used a 5-grade WSRS and showed that
      at 4 weeks after treatment, they achieved a 1.7 ± 0.5 (mean ± SD) improvement between those
      visits.

      The primary objectives included in the present clinical investigation are the performance of
      the medical device in terms of absolute change of Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) score
      assessed by Investigator at 90 days after the initiation of treatment with mRDX-02-17 dermal
      filler, compared to Baseline Visit (day 0), and overall safety of the medical device.
