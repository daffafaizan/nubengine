    
      The investigators will conduct a retrospective case-series study of at least 40 patients ,
      who underwent medial open-wedge HTO for treatment of medial knee osteoarthritis between
      January 2016 and January 2019 in our Arthroscopy and Sports Injuries Unit in Orthopaedics
      Department of Assiut University. Inclusion criteria is Kellgren-Lawrence classification
      grades 1 to 3; symptomatic unicompartmental osteoarthritis

      Pre-operative :

      assessment of patients is done clinically using Knee society score (KSS) and visual analogue
      scale (VAS) (0 mm, no pain;100 mm, worst pain) and radiographic assessment according to
      Kellgren and Lawrence using anteroposterior (AP) and lateral x-ray views of the knee , a
      two-leg long standing view with or without slight flexion assessing Femoral-tibial angle
      (FTA) .

      Intra-operative :

      After anaesthesia is induced, an arthroscopic examination is performed to define the status
      of the menisci (excluding significant damage of the lateral compartment), cruciate ligaments,
      and articular cartilage. meniscal surgery (partial menisectomy/meniscal repair) is performed
      when necessary, then The medial open wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO) is performed.

      Post-operative :

      follow up after at least 1 year post-operative clinically using knee society score (KSS) ,
      visual analogue scale (VAS),Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score(KOOS) , Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index scores and radiological
      assessment using Anteroposterior and lateral views xrays assessing union two-leg long
      standing view x ray with or without slight flexion assessing Femoral-tibial angle (FTA) and
      joint line .
