      performed before the initiation of the curative intended radiotherapy. After the radiotherapy
      treatment the patients attend the routine clinical follow-up programme at Rigshospitalet to
      follow the loco-regional control, signs of metastasis and the overall survival. These
      relapse- and survival parameters will be correlated to the SUVmax, SUVmean and the TNM stage
      obtained from the uPAR scan and will be compared to the findings on the routine FDG scan to
      clarify which tracer is the strongest prognostic marker in HNC.

      If any previous tissue samples have been taken from the tumour before the patient enters the
      study the uPAR immunohistopathology of the tissue sample will be compared to the uPAR-PET/CT
      findings. We will not perform any biopsies or tissue samples in this study.
