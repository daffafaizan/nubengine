    
      This intervention, offered to participants after completing oncology rehabilitation,
      integrates known preferences and determinants of physical activity participation in women and
      breast cancers survivors including social support, professional guidance, self-efficacy, goal
      setting, self-regulation, and environmental awareness delivered through accessible
      technology. For the iteration phase, the investigators will conduct an initial, abbreviated
      intervention wave lasting 4 weeks; the investigators will then incorporate participant input
      and feedback on the specific components to refine the intervention prior to a pilot trial.
      Means of delivering the components include communication and support through tailored text
      messaging, health coaching phone calls, self-monitoring of physical activity through a
      wearable sensor, and environmental assessment of community physical activity options (e.g.,
      parks, fitness centers, trails) based on global positioning system information.
