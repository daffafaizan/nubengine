      Settings,' is a dual-arm, cluster randomized trial to evaluate the use of routine plasma
      HIV-1 VL monitoring to improve survival and decrease HIV disease progression in patients
      receiving ART. The primary objective is to assess mortality at 36 months among ART na√Øve
      patients initiating therapy and receiving care at facilities with access to routine HIV VL
      testing (at ART initiation, at 3 months and at every 6 months thereafter) compared to those
      initiating first regimens and receiving care at facilities according to our local standard of
      care (which uses immunological [i.e. CD4+ lymphocyte count-based]and clinical criteria to
      diagnose treatment failure, with discretionary VL testing when the two do not agree).
