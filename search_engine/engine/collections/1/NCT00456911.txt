      recommendations to prevent obesity. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that
      family dietary coaching would improve nutritional intakes and health indicators in
      free-living children and adults.

      Intervention: the 1013 participating families (1013 children and 1013 parents) are randomly
      assigned to Group A (advice to reduce fat and to increase complex carbohydrates), Group B
      (advice to reduce both fat and sugars and to increase complex carbohydrates) or a control
      group (no advice). GA and GB receive monthly phone counseling and Internet-based monitoring.
      Main outcome measures are changes in nutritional intakes and body mass index throughout the
      intervention in both children and adults. Secondary outcomes included changes in fat mass,
      physical activity, fasting blood indicators and food-related quality of life.
