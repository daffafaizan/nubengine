      injection, no wetting agent will be delivered. Within 72hours after this first intravitreal
      injections, patients will be contacted by phone by a nurse to complete questionnaires on
      quality of life and on ocular pain and eye discomfort.

      After the second injection, a treatment with wetting agent will be prescribed. With 72hours
      after the second injection, quality of life, ocular discomfort as well as acceptability and
      tolerance of the eye drops will also be assessed by a phone questionnaire.
