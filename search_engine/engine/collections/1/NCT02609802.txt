      that equi-minimum alveolar concentration of various volatile anesthetics produced different
      EEG-derived indices such as bispectral index. However, there was no controlled study that
      demonstrates the difference of analgesic potency. The aim of this clinical trial is to
      evaluate the difference of analgesic potency of sevoflurane and desflurane at equi-minimum
      alveolar concentration using a surgical pleth index.
