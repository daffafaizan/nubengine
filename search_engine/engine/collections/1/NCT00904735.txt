      Primary

        -  Assess the progression-free survival of patients with recurrent or progressive
           meningiomas treated with hydroxyurea with vs without imatinib mesylate after surgery and
           radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival, and response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to WHO grade (I vs
      II-III). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea twice daily and oral imatinib mesylate once
           daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral hydroxyurea twice daily in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 1 year.
