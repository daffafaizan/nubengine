      hotspot-targeted interventions on overall malaria transmission. Hotspots will be detected in
      the 100km2 study area. Hotspots are defined as areas with a level of transmission intensity
      that exceeds that in the surrounding area; indicated by a higher sero-conversion rate and/or
      age-adjusted density of malaria-specific antibodies.

      Clusters for the intervention are defined as a hotspot and the area surrounding this hotspot
      in each direction up to 500 meters.

      INTERVENTION Half of the clusters will be randomized to hotspot-targeted interventions, while
      the other half will serve as control. The plausible impact of hotspot targeted interventions
      will be evaluated by comparing malaria indices in intervention clusters with their baseline
      and with control clusters.

      In each phase four hotspot-targeted interventions will be superimposed on ongoing control
      measures: hotspots will be targeted with a combination IRS, long-lasting insecticide treated
      nets (LLINs), larviciding and a focal screening and treatment (FSAT).

      EVALUATION The primary outcome will be parasite prevalence in evaluation zones (i.e. the area
      surrounding malaria hotspots) of targeted and untargeted clusters. In addition, parasite
      prevalence will be determined inside hotspots of malaria transmission and in evaluation zones
      in relation to distance to the hotspot boundary. For this, community surveys are planned
      prior to the intervention and at two time-points after the intervention.

      An entomological evaluation will take place concurrently in which mosquito breeding sites are
      monitored for productivity and mosquitoes will be sampled indoors and outdoors.

      Malaria morbidity is assessed by passive case detection.
