      no consensus on what constitutes optimal therapy. Previous studiesoids and have shown
      complete and partial response rates between 40% and 60%. More recently, calcineurin
      inhibitors (CNI) have become an effective second line therapy with similar response rates
      between 50%-70%. However, both treatment regiments are limited by the risk for infection as
      well as the development of vvvvvvv CNI-induced nephrotoxicity and progressive renal disease.
      Acthar gel is a porcine pituitary preparation composed of ACTH and for treatment of
      idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Previous studies, as well as more current studies, have shown
      that ACTHar gel can effectively reduce proteinuriammmmmmmm in idiopathic membranous
      glomerulonephritis and other forms of glomerulopathy including focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and advanced diabetic nephropathy. While the mechanism is unknown,
      previous studies have shown that melanocortin 1-receptors are expressed in glomerular
      podocytes and thatpathway could be involved in the protein lowering effects of ACTHar
      bbbbbbbbgel. Incubation of cultured podocytes with ACTH leads to activation of MCR-1
      receptors and the subsequent stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) through a
      G-protein-dependent pathway. The downstream phosphorylation and stabilization of Rho GTPases,
      synaptopodin and other cell-cytoskeletal associated proteins may stabilize podocyte function
      and density.
