    
      The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of pediatric Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) patients using an experimental group and a control group. The subjects in the
      experimental group will be administered a commercially available pharmacogenomics (PGx) test
      panel of 38 genes specifically related to drug metabolism rates and drug response. A subset
      of these genes are known to be involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ADHD
      medications.

      The PGx test report indicates if there are genetic variants detected related to ADHD
      medications and consequently provides recommendations for the clinician on which medications
      and doses may be optimally effective. The control group is the "treatment as usual" (TAU)
      group whose subjects are treated with medications for ADHD based on the treating clinician's
      customary method(s) for selecting medications and doses.

      The hypotheses to be tested are that PGx testing guidance will reduce the time it takes to
      reach a treatment regimen that improves patient symptom relief, reduces the frequency and
      severity of adverse drug reactions, improves patient quality of life, and reduces parental
      emotional stress. Additionally, since the test is performed using next-generation sequencing,
      we wish to tabulate relevant allele frequencies and use variant call files to discover
      previously unknown PGx genetic variants.
