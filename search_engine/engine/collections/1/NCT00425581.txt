      regulation of extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure.It is secreted from the cardiac
      ventricle myocytes in response to myocardial stress. This hormone serves as a marker of
      ventricular dysfunction in adults but its role in newborns and especially preterm infants has
      not been well studied yet. Following birth of a healthy infant there is a surge in NT-proBNP
      levels which is then followed by a rapid decrease. One explanation for this surge is the
      transition in hemodynamics from fetal circulation into postnatal one. Few studies conducted
      in this area have shown association between NT-proBNP level and patency of ductus arteriosus
      and with respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT)is a specific
      cardiac protein which serves as a specific indicator of cardiac damage in adults, it is
      usually not detected at birth but following myocardial injury its serum levels will slowly
      rise and generally will not be detectable until at least 4 hours after onset of injury. There
      is no "gold standard" test for diagnosis of hemodynamic instability in very low birth weight
      infants. Myocardial dysfunction is thought to be the major cause for this condition in VLBW
      population. Since this condition is associated with severe short and long term morbidity
      early recognition and specific treatment may be detrimental. We hypothesized that NT-proBNP
      and cTnT levels may serve as a more accurate markers for diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome
      prediction in VLBW infants during the first days of life, than the methods we currently use
      (blood pressure, urine output etc.)
