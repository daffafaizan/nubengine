      I. Evaluate the safety of the combination of alemtuzumab and bendamustine (bendamustine
      hydrochloride) in patients with advanced CLL.

      II. Establish the maximum tolerated dose of alemtuzumab up to the standard dose of 30mg
      thrice weekly when combined with bendamustine at a standard dose of 70 mg/m^2 day 8 and 9
      monthly.

      III. Define a recommended dose for subsequent Phase II studies. IV. Evaluate preliminary
      evidence of activity as determined by response rates with correlation to EAS flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alemtuzumab.

      Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 8
      and 9 for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and
      alemtuzumab subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
