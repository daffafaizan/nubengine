    
      VA106483 is intended to be used as a treatment for patients suffering from nocturia (defined
      as waking to urinate at least once per night between periods of sleep). Nocturia is a
      condition that often worsens as sufferers get older. This may be due to an over-active
      bladder muscle, the bladder being able to hold less urine at night-time or over production of
      urine in the bladder at night.

      The only antidiuretic approved for the treatment (in some countries) of nocturia is the
      peptide drug, desmopressin. However, as it can cause hyponatraemia in a proportion of
      patients above the age of 65 years it is contra-indicated in the elderly. This side-effect
      has not been observed with VA106483, making it potentially suitable for treating the elderly.
      The purpose of this study is to confirm that duration of action of VA106483 can be
      effectively controlled by dose and therefore that satisfactory clinical outcome in the
      treatment of nocturia can be achieved by individual dose titration.

      Subjects will be water-loaded, dosed with either VA106483 or placebo and then urine
      production will be monitored to assess any anti-diuretic effect.
