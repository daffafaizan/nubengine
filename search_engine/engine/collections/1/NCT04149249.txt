      will start at the time an individual is receiving lung cancer screening (LCS). CONNECT will
      include an interactive Video Doctor which will provide participants with information tailored
      to their individual responses as well as proactive outreach using brief telephone calls and
      text messaging to follow up smokers with motivation enhancement to refer and engage patients
      in evidence based smoking cessation interventions (such as quitline utilization). After
      development and usability testing, we will conduct a small feasibility study followed by a
      pilot randomized controlled trial to estimate the impact of CONNECT on biochemically
      confirmed 30-day smoking abstinence among diverse current smokers seen at the San Francisco
      Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of California San Francisco Division of
      General Internal Medicine. Participants will be randomized to CONNECT or a control condition.
      Data will include self-report from participants obtained at baseline, 1 and 3 months, and the
      electronic health record. Outcomes will be biochemically confirmed 30-day smoking abstinence
      at 3 months post LCS and satisfaction as well as self-reported quit attempts, and use of
      evidence-based smoking cessation resources (quitline, pharmacotherapy or counseling). The
      knowledge gained will provide the pilot data necessary to apply for a larger study to test
      our novel intervention for promoting smoking cessation among a diverse population of
      high-risk smokers undergoing Lung Cancer Screening.
