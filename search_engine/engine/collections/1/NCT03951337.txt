      predicting histological response to neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy treatment in patients
      with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      Patients receive pre-therapeutic CT scan, Pelvic MRI and 18FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/CT
      (positron emission tomography) scan within 45 days before enrollment.

      64Cu-ATSM PET/CT scan is done before chemoradiotherapy treatment start. About 3 MBq/Kg of
      64Cu-ATSM are injected intravenously, two acquisition sequences are performed 1 hour and 23
      to 25 hours after injection in order to evaluate early and late tumor uptake of 64Cu-ATSM.

      Patients are treated for 5 weeks by Capecitabine chemotherapy (1600 mg/m2/day) combined to 50
      Gy radiotherapy.

      Pelvic MRI is performed 4 weeks after chemotherapy in order to evaluate the treatment
      efficacy.

      Surgery is scheduled 6 to 8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy. Tissue samples from previously
      collected rectal biopsy (obtained for diagnosis) and from surgery are used for assessing
      oxidative stress markers by Immuno-histochemical analysis.

      Chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scan is performed every 6 months after surgery in order to
      assess progression free survival.
