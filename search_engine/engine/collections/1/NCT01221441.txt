    
      Protocol TGC09201 is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. A
      total of one hundred (100) adults with grade 3 chronic degenerative joint disease (DJD) of
      the knee joint (as determined by radiographic examination) will be enrolled into the study.
      TissueGene-C will be administered intra-articularly once via x-ray guidance. TissueGene-C
      will be administered at a dose of 3 x 10e7 cells. Patients receiving control treatment will
      receive a single normal saline injection.

      The objectives of this study are to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of TissueGene-C with regard to knee functionality and symptoms of
           knee osteoarthritis including pain.

        2. Evaluate the safety of administration of a single intra-articular dose of TissueGene-C
           as evidenced by observation of the injection site for irritation or other abnormalities,
           the incidence and severity of adverse events, and the changes in physical examination
           findings and laboratory tests, including immune analyses.

        3. Evaluate the incidence and dose of analgesia and/or anti-inflammatory medication.

        4. Evaluate the regeneration of hyaline cartilage as determined by 3T magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI).

        5. Evaluate distribution of hChonJb#7 cells out of the injection site.

        6. Evaluate the efficacy of TissueGene-C by evaluating the need for total knee arthroplasty
           after treatment
