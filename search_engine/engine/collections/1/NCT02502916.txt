      of the Hospital weekly from the diapers of the infants during their stay at the Neonatal
      Intensive Care Unit.

      To evaluate the potential role of the enteral feeding systems as a site for colonization by
      nosocomial bacteria, and, its impact on early gut colonization of preterm neonates, mother's
      own milk, donor milk and preterm formula samples were obtained after passing through the
      external part of the enteral feeding tubes and cultured.

      Later, when the infants reached 2 years of age, parents were contacted by phone to provide an
      additional fecal sample if their infants had not taken antibiotics within the previous 2
      months.
