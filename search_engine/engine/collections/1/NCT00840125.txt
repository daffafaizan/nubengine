      This will be a Phase II, open-label, single-center, repeat dose, study. After a two-week
      screening phase, eligible subjects will receive combined docetaxel and erlotinib treatment
      over six cycles. Each 22-day treatment cycle will consist of two infusion of docetaxel,
      one-week apart followed by one week rest, and daily administration of erlotinib. Subjects,
      who complete six cycles of combination therapy, will continue receiving erlotinib monotherapy
      for as long as they are benefiting from this therapy in the opinion of the investigator (i.e.
      until continued toxicity or disease progression or withdrawal from the study). Subjects will
      be evaluated for safety and radiologic tumor assessment throughout the study until death. The
      study will be terminated after every living patient has had a follow up of at least 6 months
      after stopping TarcevaTM, or when all patients have died.
