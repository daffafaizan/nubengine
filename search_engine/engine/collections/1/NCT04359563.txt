      groups, which start their training with half a week time lag. Within each group, participants
      will be randomised to a baseline phase of 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 or 4 weeks, with 3-4 days between
      starting points of individual participants. Thus, the baseline phase will start at different
      time points for participants within the same group to enable them to start the intervention
      simultaneously while having baseline phases of varying length. Participants from different
      groups may begin their baseline phase at the same time while their intervention starts at a
      different time point. The same procedure will be repeated for the second pool of 15
      participants.
