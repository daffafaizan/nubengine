      hypertrophic AKs, defined as more than 3mm in thickness, on each dorsal hand. Cryotherapy
      will be standardized in all patients and for all treated lesions: 1-2 sprays, 5 seconds each,
      with a 5 second interval. All subjects will be treated with the same cryo-spray. Following
      cryotherapy, subjects will be randomized to treat either their right or left dorsal hand with
      ingenol mebutate gel. The decision to treat the right vs. the left hand will be chosen by
      chance, like flipping a coin. Neither the subject nor the study doctor will choose what arm
      receives the ingenol mebutate gel. The study doctor will not know which arm is treated with
      ingenol mebutate, so the subject should not reveal that information to him or her at any time
      during the study. Subjects will treat the randomized dorsal hand with ingenol mebutate 0.05%
      gel starting on the same day as the cryotherapy (Day 0). Subjects will utilize the once daily
      for two days regimen. Subjects will be followed on day 4 after their initial visit, day 8,
      day 15, day 29, and day 57, with a two day window period.
