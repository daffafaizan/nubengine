      B (ATB), a Chinese herbal mixture.

      This randomized Window of Opportunity trial will enroll patients with resectable stage I-IVB
      squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity who are candidates for surgical tumor resection.
      Participants will agree to allow a portion of the standard of care (diagnostic tumor biopsy)
      to be used for the study, and to take study agents or placebo for a duration (14 to 21 days)
      until the time of their surgery. A second, post-treatment tumor biopsy is not needed because
      the OR-resected tumor will serve this purpose.
