      receive either weekly TOCOSOL Paclitaxel or weekly Taxol (paclitaxel injection). Patients
      will undergo radiographic imaging of their disease to assess response to therapy. The primary
      endpoint of this study is a comparison of the objective response rates observed in patients
      receiving TOCOSOL Paclitaxel, to those receiving Taxol. Time-to-disease progression and
      overall survival will also be compared. The toxicities of the two treatment regimens will be
      compared.
