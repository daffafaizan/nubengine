      meaningful everyday life context, aiming for improving function in the face and oral tract
      that is as normal as possible. The goal is maximum participation in daily life. The treatment
      encourages learning of helpful functional movements or patterns of movement for safe
      swallowing, protection of airway, oral hygiene, eating, drinking, breathing, voice and
      articulation.
