      in terms of the cultural structure and system of values in which they live. Their objectives,
      expectations, standards and concerns, whereas health related quality of life is defined as
      the patient subjective perception of the impact of their disease or its treatment.(1) Cardiac
      disease is the most common congenital defect in children, with an incidence of eight in every
      1000 live births. Multiple factors have improved and prolonged the lives of children and
      adolescents with congenital heart disease over the last few decades(2) Diagnosis of a
      life-threatening illness during a child's formative years can have far-reaching effects that
      ripple through the family and across a lifetime. Infants with complex CHD experience a range
      of uncommon and painful events, such as separation from their mother at birth, urgent
      transfer to specialized intensive care, frequent invasive medical procedures, feeding
      difficultiesand withdrawal from narcotic pain relief. These earlylife experiences can have
      profound consequences for the developing child, shaping brain development, the body's immune
      system and responses to stress.(5) From a neurodevelopmental perspective, children with CHD
      experience greater difficulties compared with their healthy peers. The risk and severity of
      neurodevelopmental impairment increases with greater CHD complexity, the presence of a
      genetic disorder or syndrome, and greater psychological stress. During infancy, the most
      pronounced difficulties occur in motor functioning. By early childhood, studies show that
      children with complex CHD have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, in fine
      and gross motor skills, and language, attention, executive functioning, emotion regulation
      and behaviour.(7)
