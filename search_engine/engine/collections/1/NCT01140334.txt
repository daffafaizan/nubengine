      psychiatric disorder (N = 100) will be randomly assigned to one of two psychiatric service
      conditions: 1) reinforced on-site integrated care (ROIC), with voucher incentives contingent
      on attending weekly psychiatric sessions; or 2) standard on-site integrated care (SOIC).
      Participants in both conditions will receive access to the same schedule and range of
      psychiatric and substance abuse treatment services. Participants will be assessed for
      3-months post-randomization to determine rates of service utilization and adherence to
      psychiatric care, changes in scope and severity of psychiatric and psychosocial problems, and
      rates of drug use and treatment retention. Positive findings would have considerable
      heuristic and health care policy and practice implications. The entire study, including
      dissemination of the major findings at a national meeting and submission of the first
      manuscript, is designed to be completed within 2-years.
