      human lifespan. Effective vaccines stimulate the cells of the immune system to activate genes
      and associated functions that bring about protective immunity. If we can better understand
      the factors that influence vaccine success versus failure, we may be able to improve current
      vaccines and/or develop new vaccines against prevalent infectious diseases.

      Certain groups of people do not respond well to particular vaccines. For example, vaccines
      can be less effective in immunocompromised patients, elderly individuals, and people with
      chronic inflammatory diseases. Often it is these groups of people that have the greatest need
      for protection against infectious disease.

      People chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at increased risk of serious
      liver disease. As a result, they should receive the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, which
      can protect them from infection by HBV, another virus that targets the liver. However, people
      chronically infected with HCV do not respond to the HBV vaccine as effectively as healthy
      people without HCV. Chronic HCV infection is not thought to cause general problems with the
      immune system, and the reasons for this poor vaccine response are poorly understood. Previous
      work has shown that chronic HCV infection leads to production of chemical ("innate immune")
      signals that can affect function of the immune system, but it is currently unknown how this
      might impact vaccination.
