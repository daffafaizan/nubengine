      I. To assess the clinical benefit rate (objective response rate and rate of stable disease
      for at least 4 months) of AZD2171 (cediranib maleate) given to patients with progressive
      unresectable or, recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      II. To assess the duration of response or stable disease, progression free, median and
      overall survival rates, and safety and tolerability of AZD2171.

      III. To measure baseline and post treatment levels of soluble markers of angiogenic growth
      factors and receptors as well as levels of circulating endothelial cells, and correlate these
      with clinical outcome.

      IV. To assess changes in blood flow and vessel permeability using dynamic contrast enhanced
      magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) pre and post treatment and to correlate these changes
      with clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
