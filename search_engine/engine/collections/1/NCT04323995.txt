      "anthropometric measures","body mass index", "fat %" lean muscle mass will be searched
      through e-databases namely Pubmed (including MEDLINE), Pedro-search, Science Direct, Google
      Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library for the suitable original full text
      studies. Only randomized control trails will be included in this study and the "Tool for the
      assEssment of Study qualiTy and reporting in EXercise" (TESTEX) would be utilized to assess
      each individual study. TESTEX has been validated and is specific to exercise training. The
      authors wish to use TESTEX as it addresses several shortcomings that PEDro does not e.g.
      exercise adherence, withdrawal, relative exercise training intensity. In addition, study
      quality assessment of training studies is more robust with TESTEX. 2 independent evaluators
      will examine and screen each study for its efficacy to be included in the data analysis.
