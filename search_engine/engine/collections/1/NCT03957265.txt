      with conventional dentures. Patients will receive four to six maxillary implants loaded three
      months after surgery. Clinical, microbiological and immunoinflammatory parameters will be
      evaluated at baseline, three, and six months following overdenture prosthesis.
      Patient-centered/reported outcomes concerning general satisfaction with the prostheses as
      well as comfort, ability to speak, stability, esthetics, ease of cleaning and occlusion, will
      be evaluated at baseline (conventional denture evaluation) and after 6 months (overdenture
      evaluation).
