      anxiolytic medications in selected patients, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for anxiety.
      Capsules are color coded and taken under double-blind conditions. Compliance is monitored
      with the Medication Event Monitoring System, which automatically registers the date and time
      each bottle is opened.

      The physician directs therapy administration, using some combination of the following: blind
      choice test, antianxiety agent(s), placebo, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.
