    
      This study is designed as a side study to the multicenter, international phase I-II trial
      with the HSP90 inhibitor AUY922 (protocol CAUY922A2101), as part of the biomarker assessment.
      In protocol CAUY922A2101, section 4, the design of this phase I-II trial is described (p36,
      37). Briefly, a dose-escalation study is performed according to phase I design. This part is
      followed by a dose-expansion study according to a phase II design. In the latter part, breast
      cancer patients are enrolled that are either refractory to hormone- or trastuzumab treatment
      (both treatment arms, n=40 patients). Patients with HER2 positive, trastuzumab refractory
      breast cancer, will receive a 89Zr-trastuzumab PET scan as part of the present side study
      protocol, which will be performed in collaboration with the Royal Marsden Hospital (United
      Kingdom).

      To this end, a 89Zr-trastuzumab PET scan will be performed before (baseline) and during
      treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor AUY922, as described below.

      A minimum of six patients are needed to evaluate whether the 89Zr-trastuzumab PET scan can be
      used for the detection of a decrease of HER2 expression, induced by HSP90 inhibition.
