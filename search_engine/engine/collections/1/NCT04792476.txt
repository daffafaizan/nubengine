      common side effect, occurring mainly during the first months after the start of antipsychotic
      treatment. Patients with schizophrenia have a risk of obesity 1.5-2 times higher than the
      general population and the chances of developing physical problems such as hypertension,
      diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and coronary heart disease are also higher. Patients diagnosed
      with schizophrenia have a life expectancy of up to 25 years lower than the general
      population, with cardiovascular disease being the main cause of premature death. The first
      months of treatment constitute a critical period for the implementation of strategies that
      could prevent or mitigate this side effect of the medication, as well as the adverse
      consequences derived from weight gain.

      This project is the response to the need to implement physical exercise interventions to
      prevent weight gain in patients with a first psychotic episode.To date, there is little
      evidence from randomized clinical trials that have used physical exercise as the only
      intervention to prevent weight gain in the first weeks from the start of antipsychotic
      treatment.

      Numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated non-pharmacological
      interventions to reduce weight in people with severe mental illness, including chronic
      psychotic disorders. However, there is little research on this type of intervention in
      patients with a first episode of psychosis. Studies are needed that implement physical
      exercise programs from the initial phases of antipsychotic treatment, and that are capable of
      defining the parameters used in the design of an effective physical exercise intervention for
      the prevention of weight gain in first psychotic episodes.
