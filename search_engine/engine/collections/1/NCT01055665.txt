      program to measure self-efficacy and depression. The first is the Pain Self-Efficacy Scale
      (PSEQ) which is a measure of self-efficacy in persons with chronic pain. The second
      questionnaire is the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) which is a
      measure of depressive symptoms in persons with chronic pain. Both scales will also be used
      for clinical information. Persons who score 27 or higher on the CES-D will be approached for
      potential consent to this evidence based project. Each patient in the PRC will participate in
      up to 6 CBT sessions but only persons who, upon admission, score 27 or greater on the CES-D
      will be studied for any changes in scores from admission to discharge.
