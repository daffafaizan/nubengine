    
      This study will be a dose escalation, cohort staggering (slow enrollment) for the 3 dose
      levels (low, medium or high dose level) with a placebo-controlled group:

        -  Cohort 1: A first cohort of one hundred nineteen subjects (119) will be randomized; of
           these, seventy five (75) will be dosed with the lowest dose of the quadrivalent VLP
           vaccine, nineteen (19) will be dosed with the medium dose of the quadrivalent VLP
           vaccine, and twenty five (25) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the
           immunization will be collected and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board
           (DSMB) consisting of the Principal Investigator (PI), the Sponsor's Medical Officer and
           three external medical experts as voting members, prior to permitting immunization with
           the cohort 2.

        -  Cohort 2: A second cohort of one hundred subjects (100) subjects will be randomized; of
           these, fifty six (56) will be dosed with the medium dose of the quadrivalent VLP
           vaccine, nineteen (19) be dosed with the high dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine, and
           twenty five (25) will receive a placebo. The 7-day safety data after the immunization
           will be collected and reviewed by the DSMB, prior to permitting immunization with the
           highest dose.

        -  Cohort 3: A third cohort of eighty one subjects (81) subjects will be randomized; of
           these fifty six (56) dosed with the high dose of the quadrivalent VLP vaccine and twenty
           five (25) will receive a placebo.

      Three (3) and 21 days after immunization, key safety (Day 3) and immunogenicity (Day 21) data
      will be collected and analyzed. All subjects will be followed for safety until Day 201
      (6-month follow up), regardless the phase of the study.
