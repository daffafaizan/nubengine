      specific diagnostic tests or clinical findings. Current diagnostic recommendations include a
      multi-factorial approach involving symptom inventory, baseline and post-injury
      neuropsychological assessment, and balance testing.

      Lacking from this paradigm is a truly objective measure of physiological changes associated
      with concussion. In addition, post-concussion symptoms are unique to each individual and vary
      in occurrence, degree, and severity. For these reasons, a clinical diagnosis of concussion
      should be made by a healthcare provider familiar with the athlete and knowledgeable in
      concussion symptom recognition and evaluation.

      This study aims to determine ICP measurements derived from the HS-1000 non-invasive device in
      children and adolescents seen in the Akron Children's Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic for
      concussion (anytime during their care) compared to ICP values obtained in age and gender
      matched Akron Children's Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic patients with no history of head
      injury.

      Patients with a history and/or symptoms of head trauma cared for in the Akron Children's
      Hospital Sports Medicine Clinic will be invited to participate in this study. Study
      participants will receive HS-1000 ICP readings for a continuous 16 minute interval in a 30
      degree supine position. Recordings will be obtained in one session. When possible, these
      recordings will be obtained at their initial examination and all follow-up visits. Sports
      Medicine staff will coordinate the HS-1000 device earplug insertion and recordings so as not
      to interfere with, nor marginally delay the patient's normal, routine clinical evaluation.
