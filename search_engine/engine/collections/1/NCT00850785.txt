    
      Ten patients will be enrolled. Study treatment is as follows: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 will be
      given on day 1. Intradermal vaccinations of DRibbles from 5-20 x 106 cell equivalents per
      vaccine will begin 14 days after docetaxel. Immediately following vaccination, subcutaneous
      infusion of GM-CSF (50 micrograms/24 hrs) will be initiated. GM-CSF will be infused into the
      vaccination site for 6 days using the CADD-MS 3 pump.

      A second docetaxel injection will be given at day 29 followed by a second vaccination 14 days
      later and 3 additional vaccines will be given at 2-week intervals. Following each
      vaccination, GM-CSF will again be infused over 6 days via the CADD-MS 3 pump.

      Peripheral blood will be obtained for immune monitoring at each vaccination. DTH to
      autologous tumor and to DRibble vaccine will be tested before the first and fifth vaccines. A
      second leukapheresis for immune monitoring will be obtained at 12 weeks. Clinical tumor
      response will be assessed after the fifth vaccination unless clinical evidence of tumor
      progression occurs sooner.

      Immune response will be assessed by DTH, T-cell function, T-cell migration into the vaccine
      sites and cytokine release assays. Sophisticated flow cytometry assays will be used to detect
      active T-cell subsets. Safety will be monitored by physical and laboratory exams at each
      vaccine visit and adverse events will be recorded and reported as appropriate. Clinical
      response will be assessed by tumor measurements by CT scan and/or physical exam at study
      entry and after 12 weeks. PFS and OS will be recorded.
