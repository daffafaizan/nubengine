      multivitamin supplements at doses resembling the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) during
      pregnancy to HIV positive women decreases the risks of low birth weight (<2500 g), and
      pre-term birth (< 37 weeks gestation), compared to multivitamin supplements at doses above
      the RDA. All women receive standard prenatal care, including nevirapine for the prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
