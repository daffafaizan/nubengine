      I. To compare rates for grade 3-4 immune-related adverse event (IRAE)s in the first 6 months
      in patients treated with combination checkpoint blockade (CCB) therapy (anti-CTLA4 and
      anti-PD1) as a part of standard of care for advanced melanoma who are treated with a single
      course of 4 weekly doses of rituximab and hyaluronidase human (Rituxan) therapy versus those
      who are not treated with Rituxan.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability (in terms of Rituxan-related adverse events) in
      patients with melanoma receiving CCB.

      II. To compare objective response rate in patients receiving CCB therapy + Rituxan versus CCB
      therapy alone.

      III. To compare 1 year overall and progression-free survival in patients receiving CCB
      therapy + Rituxan versus CCB therapy alone.

      IV. To compare changes in cluster of differentiation 21lo (CD21lo) B cells in patients
      receiving CCB therapy + Rituxan versus CCB therapy alone.

      V. To compare changes in T cells in patients receiving CCB therapy + Rituxan versus CCB
      therapy alone.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Participants receive standard of care ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy.

      ARM B: Participants receive standard of care ipilimumab and nivolumab therapy. On day 2 of
      each cycle, participants also receive rituximab and hyaluronidase human intravenously (IV) or
      subcutaneously (SC) weekly starting week 1 for 4 doses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 4 weeks.
