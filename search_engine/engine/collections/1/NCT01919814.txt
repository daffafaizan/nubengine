      that will contain either the Appethylâ„¢ or placebo. Participants will be given a lunch of
      about 750 calories and 40% fat prepared by the Metabolic Kitchen and be asked to eat all of
      it. Participants will have food choice testing performed 4 hours after starting their lunch
      meal. This will be done in two ways. Participants will be given a list of two foods that are
      made of carbohydrate like bread and pretzels and be asked which is most preferred.
      Participants will also be given a list of foods that differ in the amounts of fat,
      carbohydrate and protein that they contain and will be asked to mark the ones that appeal to
      them.

      Participants will be presented with a pizza in a quantity more than they could reasonably be
      expected to eat 5 hours after the start of their lunch meal and be asked to eat to their
      satisfaction over 30 minutes. Participants are not expected to eat all of the pizza.
