      in the treatment of Wagner Grades 3 and 4 DFU. Experience with the use of a cryopreserved
      umbilical cord (UC) product in treating such wounds, both prior to this IND and under this
      IND, has indicated that a frequency of application of no shorter than every 4 weeks is
      associated with better than expected outcomes. Although treatment cannot be blinded, a
      "standard care only" arm is included to control for the benefits of aggressive baseline
      debridement combined with aggressive (6 weeks systemic) antibiotics. Current treatment
      guidelines indicate that aggressive debridement plus 1-2 weeks of antibiotics, or, minor
      debridement plus 6 weeks of antibiotics, would produce equivalent outcomes, although the
      evidence is not strong. By utilizing both maximum debridement and maximum antimicrobial
      therapy, the standard care described in this protocol may result in healing rates somewhat
      superior to current standard practice.

      The design of this second confirmatory study is matched to the design of the Phase 2 efficacy
      study TTCRNE-1501, with the exception of extending the primary endpoint from a landmark
      analysis at 16 to a "wound survival" analysis through 26 weeks, utilizing a proportional risk
      analysis rather than a simple test of proportions. This design consideration is based on
      analysis of previous studies (see Background section), and a desire to fold data from every
      visit into the primary analysis, rather than generating an excessive number of secondary
      endpoints.
