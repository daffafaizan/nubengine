      rapidly growing clinical demand for tight glycemic control in the intensive care unit (ICU),
      operating room (OR), and intermediate care units. The system automatically measures glucose
      and other analytes by spectroscopically analyzing blood as it passes through a disposable
      Sensor Set. Our unique optical measurement does not chemically interact with blood, is
      insensitive to sensor fouling, and, unlike a biosensor, does not require frequent
      recalibration.
