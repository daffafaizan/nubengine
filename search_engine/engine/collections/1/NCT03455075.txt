      Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and the University of Washington. The sites
      propose to enroll approximately 100 men with a goal of enrolling 20 healthy male subjects in
      each of the 4 active groups and 20 in the placebo group for 12 weeks of treatment. The goal
      is to complete at least 17 efficacy evaluable subjects in each group. The DMAU for this study
      will be castor oil formulation administered after a 25 to 30 g fat meal. The oral dose of LNG
      will be 30 mcg per day. The study volunteers will be randomized to one of five treatment
      groups:

      Group 1: Lower DMAU dose (100 mg per day) + LNG (30 mcg per day) (n=20) Group 2: Middle DMAU
      dose (200mg per day) + LNG (30 mcg per day) (n=20) Group 3: Middle DMAU dose (200 mg per day)
      + placebo LNG (n=20) Group 4: Higher DMAU dose (400 mg per day) + placebo LNG (n=20) Group 5:
      Placebo DMAU capsules and placebo LNG capsules (n=20)

      Each treatment group will receive the identical number of capsules in blinded fashion so that
      each subject will receive an identical number of capsules in order to maintain the blind.
