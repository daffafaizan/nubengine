      cardiac disease, or advanced lung disease. Advanced cardiac disease is defined as a marked
      limitation of physical activity, or discomfort upon physical activity. The patients in the
      advanced cardiac disease group must also have been hospitalized for heart failure within the
      last 12 months.

      Advanced lung disease is defined as patients who have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) or interstitial lung disease (ILD). Patients in the COPD group must
      have abnormalities in their forced expiratory volume (FEV) test, which measures the amount of
      air exhaled. They may or may not need supplemental oxygen. Patients in the ILD group must
      have been diagnosed with ILD and require supplement oxygen at all times.
