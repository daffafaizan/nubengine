      minocycline in patients with resistent hypertension. After providing informed consent,
      patients will have baseline and followup visits during which a brief physical examination
      will be performed, medical history, assessment of medication compliance and tolerance, and
      vital signs will be completed.

      Subjects will undergo blood (lipid panel, high sensitivity-C reactive protein, high
      sensitivity troponin, glucose, metabolic profile, lipid panel, Cystatin C and albumin) and
      urine studies at the baseline visit and at 16, 19, 35 and 54 weeks. Patients will have
      ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline and at the end of each treatment period.

      Patients will be randomized to drug scheme A or B. One scheme will follow the following
      order: 16 weeks of minocycline, followed by a 3 week wash out period, then 16 weeks of
      placebo, then 3 weeks of wash out and a final 16 week period of minocycline. The other scheme
      will consist of 16 weeks of placebo, followed by 3 week wash out period, followed by 16 weeks
      of minocycline, then 3 week wash out and a final 16 weeks of placebo. Study visits will occur
      at study entry (baseline/randomization), 16 weeks, 19 weeks, 35 weeks, 38 weeks, and 54 weeks
      for each group. Patient participation will end after 56 weeks.
