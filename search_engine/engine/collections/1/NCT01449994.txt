      even stay away from competition. Usually elite athletes run through an abundance of tests and
      diagnostic features-too often these high cost diagnostics donÂ´t provide useful information
      for treatment. Treating the symptoms in the first place (after ruling out severe pathology)
      will reduce the need for extensive diagnostic routines and bring athletes back to competition
      earlier.

      In our outpatient department of young elite sportsmen chiropractic instrumental treatment is
      performed routinely- mostly a pain reduction of 3-4 levels in VAS is achieved within the
      first session of treatment.

      The following study is thought to prove the efficacy of the Chiropractic Instrumental
      Treatment performed at our sports-medicine outpatient department.
