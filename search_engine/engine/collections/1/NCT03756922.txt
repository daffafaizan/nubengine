      independent parts. Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single
      doses of FDL176 with and without co-administration of FDL169. Part 2 will assess the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of repeated doses of FDL169 with and without
      co-administration of FDL176.
