      and how your disease reacts to ciprofloxacin in combination with etoposide. This study will
      try to find the highest tolerated dose of ciprofloxacin without causing serious side effects.

      Ciprofloxacin is a commonly used antibiotic drug that is approved for use by the United
      States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has not approved ciprofloxacin to treat
      AML. Etoposide is an anticancer chemotherapy drug that is approved for use by the FDA for the
      treatment of small cell lung cancer and testicular cancer. Etoposide is also used for
      treatment of various blood cancers.

      There is laboratory research that has shown that ciprofloxacin can make leukemia cells more
      sensitive to etoposide chemotherapy. This observation indicates that ciprofloxacin may help
      improve the effectiveness of etoposide in the treatment of resistant AML.
