      a 53% reduction in mortality from colon cancer. While this clearly validates the practice of
      screening colonoscopy, missed adenomas, especially in the proximal colon, defined as
      including cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon, remains a concern. This was
      demonstrated in a study of 183 patients who underwent back-to-back colonoscopies. In this
      population the overall miss rate for adenomas was 24% with proximal adenomas missed more
      often (27%) than left colon adenomas (21%). Another study looked at 4192 patients in the SEER
      (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Medicare database who developed "interval
      cancers", that is colon cancer in a patient who had a colonoscopy done in the previous 6-36
      months. These interval cancers were predominantly in the proximal colon (Proximal 68%, Distal
      19.5%, rectum 10.4%, and unspecified 2.1%). This also suggests that pre-cancerous lesions are
      being missed in the proximal colon. As such a method that can increase proximal adenoma
      detection rate would be a welcome change.

      One such emerging technique which shows promise for improving adenoma detection rate is water
      colonoscopy. In one of the early studies employing the water method a trend towards a higher
      ADR in the water method group was recognized (37% vs. 26%). The observation prompted a
      retrospective analysis of 1178 cases of screening and surveillance colonoscopy performed by a
      single endoscopist at the Sacramento VAMC, which showed an overall ADR (presence of at least
      one adenoma) of 27% with air colonoscopy whereas that for the water method colonoscopy was
      35% (p=0.007). In a subsequent combined analysis of two prospective RCT of air vs. water
      colonoscopy for screening and surveillance using scheduled unsedated colonoscopy [5] and
      on-demand sedation [6], more patients were found to have at least one diminutive adenoma in
      the proximal colon in the water method group than in the air group (28% vs. 14%,
      respectively, p=0.0298). Another quasi randomized study of screening patients performed at
      Phoenix VAMC using high definition equipment confirmed a significantly higher overall ADR
      with the water method (n=177) compared with the air method (n=191) (57% vs. 46%) (p=0.03).
      The odds of detecting an adenoma was 81% higher with the water method (OR 1.81; 95% CI:
      1.12-2.90) and independent of age, body mass index (BMI), current smoking and alcohol use,
      withdrawal time & quality of bowel preparation. In the proximal colon ADR was significantly
      higher in patients examined with the water method than with air method (46% vs. 35%)
      (p=0.03), particularly for adenomas <10 mm in size (38% vs. 25%) (p=007). These encouraging
      preliminary data reflect the potential benefits of water method colonoscopy.

      Our current research question is whether this benefit is seen in a community based population
      as opposed to the VA population which is mostly male and Caucasian.

      The investigators plan to perform a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing
      proximal adenoma detection rate between a water exchange colonoscopy group and an air
      colonoscopy group. The investigators intend to employ scheduled sedation, instead of
      on-demand sedation, to continue the current protocol in place at our institution.

      Patients in both the study arms will undergo a split bowel preparation before colonoscopy.
