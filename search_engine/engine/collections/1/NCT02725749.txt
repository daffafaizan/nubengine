      insertion points in the supraspinatus muscle region, three points on the bursa subacromial,
      and three points along the bicipital groove, at 3 Joules per point. Total dose per shoulder
      was 27 Joules per treatment, using a previously calibrated Irradia Class 3B (Stockholm,
      Sweden). Pen's semiconductor consisted of gallium arsenide with a wavelength of 904 nm,
      frequency of 700 Hz, average potency of 60 mW, peak potency of 20 W, pulse duration of 4.3
      ms, and 50 seconds per point (0.5cm2 area). The parameters followed the recommendation of the
      World Association of Laser Therapy for subacromial impact syndrome.

      The participants received application of laser three times or week for eight weeks.

      The groups treated with exercise followed the same training program. Isotonic strengthening
      exercises were performed for the scapular pivot, scapula stabilizer, and humeral propellant
      muscle groups. Three sets of 15 repetitions of each isotonic strengthening exercise were
      performed. The isometric exercises were performed in ten sets of ten seconds each. Analytical
      stretching of each muscle group was performed at the beginning of the session for 30 seconds.

      The participants performed the exercises three times a week for eight weeks.
