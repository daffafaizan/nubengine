      adipose tissue function and whole-body metabolism. Both acute and chronic aerobic exercise
      enhance adipocyte catecholamine sensitivity in humans and animals. Although relatively few
      studies have investigated whether adipose adrenergic signaling is affected by resistance
      exercise (RE), it is known that a single bout of RE can increase circulating NEFA and resting
      energy expenditure and decrease respiratory quotient for up to 24 hours, indicative of
      increased adipocyte lipolysis and muscle fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, the lipolytic
      response to RE is impaired in obese men. Using synergist ablation, a model of RE in mice, the
      investigators show that adipose transcriptional responses are exosome-dependent, and that
      serum exosomes enhance adipocyte catecholamine sensitivity and lipolysis for at least 24
      hours. To the investigator's knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a potential
      mechanism whereby RE imparts metabolic adaptations in adipose. Since adipose metabolic
      function is crucial for determining whole-body metabolic outcomes, the ability of RE-induced
      exosomes to improve adipose metabolism has significant clinical implications.
