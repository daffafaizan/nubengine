      fractions of 5 Gy over 5 days to the pelvis and XELOX consolidating chemotherapy after one
      week. Investigators arbitrarily assumed that palliative radiotherapy to the pelvis can
      replace the immediate surgery if at least 30% of patients would avoid delayed surgery until
      the end of their lives, or for at least 18 months in the case of long-term survival.
