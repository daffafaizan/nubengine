      placebo-controlled trial. The volunteers will be randomly allocated to two intervention
      groups: APT™ T3X or placebo. The volunteers will be blinded to the treatment received.

      One hundred volunteers will be recruited for the study (50 volunteers per group). As this is
      a preliminary study, the number of volunteers was determined by a convenience sample.

      The volunteers randomly allocated to the two groups will be instructed to use the APT™ T3X or
      placebo, once a day, every day for 21 days (except health professionals that will be
      instructed to use APT™ T3X or placebo twice a day, every day for 21 days).

      All data will be collected by a blinded assessor. The investigators will analyze:

        1. COVID-19 contamination rate.

        2. Presence of adverse events.

        3. Number of adverse events.

        4. Frequency of adverse events.

        5. Other virus or bacteria contamination rate.

      Statistical analysis: The results obtained will first be tested for normality using the
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for two independent
      proportions will be used in the statistical analysis of the primary outcome of this study,
      the COVID-19 contamination rate and for the secondary outcomes: presence of adverse events
      and other virus or bacteria contamination rate. For the other secondary outcomes, the number
      of adverse events and frequency of adverse events, the Wilcoxon test will be used if this
      outcome does not present a normal distribution. If this outcome presents a normal
      distribution, the two-tailed, unpaired t test will be used. The level of significance used
      will be 5% (p <0.05).
