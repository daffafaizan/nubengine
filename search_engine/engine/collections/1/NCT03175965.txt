      predictor of poor neurologic outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients. However, interpretation
      of N20 is affected by the background noise levels. Reliable analysis of N20 is limited with
      high noise levels and artifacts. Moreover, presence of N20 does not guarantee good neurologic
      outcome. P30 is a positive deflection of N20 occurring on 25-35 msec. According to our pilot
      study, N20 without following P30 is related with poor outcome, while N20 followed by P30 is
      highly related with good outcome. P30 is evident even when the N20 is ambiguous in patients
      with good outcome. We hypothesized that the negative-positive deflection of N20-P30
      components is more valuable predictor than the N20 alone. In this observational study, we
      will identify whether presence of P30 checked on 24 and 72 hours after cardiac arrest
      predicts neurologic outcome more accurately than the presence of N20 alone.
