      comprehension and Phase II - usability. For Phase I, subjects will be asked to review the
      outer packaging of the mÄ“ device. Each subject will be taken through an interview which will
      evaluate messages on the external product labeling regarding product use and self-selection
      criteria. Subjects, who are not self-excluders and/or contraindicated for use of the device
      will continue with Phase II of the study. This usability phase will consist of watching the
      instructional DVD, reading the User Guide and then performing a skin sensitivity test.
      Subjects will be expected to self-administer the hair removal treatment in a simulated
      home-use environment under observation of the study personnel. The users will have a
      telephone in the room and may call a phone number and request assistance while performing the
      treatment, simulating the toll-free hotline that will be available to consumers in commercial
      use.
