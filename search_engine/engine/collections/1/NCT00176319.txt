    
      A total of 60 healthy subjects and 60 heart failure patients (in each group 30 <55 years, 30
      >65 years) are prospectively randomized to either 4 weeks of aerobic ergometer training or
      control group.

      Before and after the intervention period maximal exercise tolerance is determined by
      ergospirometry, endothelial function is measured by high-resolution A-mode ultrasound, left
      ventricular function by echocardiography including tissue Doppler imaging, and thigh muscle
      mass is assessed by CT. Skeletal muscle biopsies are obtained at both time-points and are
      analysed for inflammatory cytokines and markers of catabolism/anabolism.
