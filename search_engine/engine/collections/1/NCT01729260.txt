      advances in treatment the majority of patients die within two years of diagnosis. During
      routine animal studies we serendipitously observed that fenbendazole, a benzimidazole
      antihelminthic used for pinworms, prevented tumor engraftment. Subsequent in vitro and in
      vivo experiments with benzimidazoles identified mebendazole as the drug having the best
      results in preclinical testing 1. In GBM cell lines, mebendazole displayed cytotoxicity with
      IC50s ranging from 0.1-0.3 Î¼M. Mebendazole disrupted microtubule formation in GBM cells and
      it's in vitro activity was correlated with reduced tubulin polymerization. In two orthotopic
      mouse glioma models, one syngeneic and one xenograft, mebendazole significantly extended
      average survival up to 63% compared to untreated controls 1.

      Mebendazole is an FDA approved antiparasitic agent with a well-established side effect and
      safety record and was effective in our animal models in dosing schedules that are documented
      as safe in humans. Therefore, mebendazole is a possible anti-cancer therapeutic with
      pre-clinical safety and efficacy and provides a promising opportunity for a clinical trial in
      patients with malignant gliomas.

      In addition, a recently published case report case report from the University of Michigan
      documented successful long term control in metastatic adrenocortical adenocarcinoma using
      mebendazole 2. Mebendazole was well tolerated at 200 mg/day and used as the sole treatment
      after the patient failed other chemotherapies.
