    
      This is a multi-center, single group, open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) treatment study to describe the overall clinical experience in participants
      with moderate to severe chronic low back pain or OA pain of the hip or knee, after conversion
      from hydrocodone, oxycodone CR, and/or morphine SR, using dose-conversion ratios of 1:5, 1:5
      and 1:2.5, respectively.

      Approximately 150 participants taking hydrocodone, oxycodone CR, and/or morphine SR with
      baseline pain intensity â‰¥4 (ie, pain intensity scores averaged over the last 4 days of the
      screening period on an 11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) will be converted to an initial
      dose of tapentadol ER 100, 150 or 200 mg approximately every 12 hours based on their total
      daily dose of prior opioids. Enrollment of participants in any prior opioid group
      (hydrocodone, oxycodone CR, and/or morphine SR) may be stopped at any time during the study
      to ensure adequate representation of each prior opioid.

      The study will consist of two periods: screening (1 Week) and treatment (4 weeks). The
      expected duration of participation for individual participants is approximately 5 weeks,
      including 4 weeks of active study treatment. The study will include scheduled visits and may
      also include unscheduled phone calls and site visits for dose adjustment and/or for safety
      evaluations.
