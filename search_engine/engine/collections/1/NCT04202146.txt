    
      The primary aim of this study is to examine cannabis use and rates of abstinence and relapse
      in individuals with moderate to severe Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) after intensive 7-day
      contingency management (CM) procedure to reinforce abstinence from cannabis use. In addition,
      this study will evaluate the effect of CM with two sessions of brief MI on the severity of
      cannabis withdrawal signs during the first 7-days of CM treatment and then during the
      following month.

      The study will also focus on prospectively monitoring the sustenance of abstinence and time
      to lapse and relapse to cannabis use over a 90-day period, using ecological momentary
      assessment (EMA) via a smartphone-based application. An additional aim will be to evaluate
      changes in symptoms of CUD during the period following the 7-day using the diagnostic
      criteria of the DSM-5.
