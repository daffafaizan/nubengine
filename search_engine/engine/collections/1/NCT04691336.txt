      based on the results, a care plan adapted to the specific needs and objectives was initiated.
      This care plan involved monitoring using different channels (face-to-face, telephone), with
      the main objective of monitoring the evolution of compliance, adherence and improving the
      quality of life of patients. The interventions that were carried out were educational and
      formative (using counseling communication skills), and technological (using monitoring tools
      in specific cases). The empowerment program was an educational session in which the nurse
      discussed content about dyspnea, the benefits of therapy, etc.
