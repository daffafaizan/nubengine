      but also on neuroimaging and neuropsychological markers using paradigms of time reactions or
      measurement of evoked potentials. We hope to identify sensitive markers of the degenerative
      process of Huntington's disease even when patients carrying the gene may or may not have
      reported the disease.

      The project is centered on 2 axes:

        1. identification of the genetic polymorphism which may explain the phenotypic variability
           seeing in Huntington's disease

        2. identification of biological, genetic and imaging biomarkers that could be used as
           predictors of clinical progression of Huntington's disease This research is based on the
           existence of a well followed and well characterized cohort of patients through the
           Francophone Huntington Network ("RESEAU HUNTINGTON de LANGUE FRANCAISE", RHLF).
           Therefore, this will help to combine the clinical and biological expertise of RHLF.
