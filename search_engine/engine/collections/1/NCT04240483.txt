      injections (ISWI) for treatment of acute low back pain in patients presenting to the
      emergency department. The primary aim is to determine if ISWI provides pain relief for acute
      low back pain in the ED. The secondary aim is to evaluate whether ISWI provides improved
      patient satisfaction in the ED setting. The hypothesis is that ISWI will improve pain amongst
      patients presenting with acute low back pain to the ED.

      This pilot study will use a randomized controlled trial design to compare the effects of ISWI
      to intracutaneous dry injections in patients presenting to the ED with acute low back pain.
