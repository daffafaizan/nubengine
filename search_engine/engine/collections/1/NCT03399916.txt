      to determine which personal (e.g. fatigue, mood, and stress level), behavioral (e.g. watching
      TV, working at desk, and eating meals), environmental (e.g. being at home or work, time of
      the day, and weather) and contextual factors were associated with sedentary behavior. Three
      EMAs per day will be sent randomly sent to participants on weekdays (Monday to Friday), for
      four consecutive weeks (total of 20 days). During these days, participants will also wear an
      activPAL device to objectively measure sedentary behavior. The purpose of the study is to
      identify the combination of factors most likely to precede and proceed short (<30 min) and
      long (â‰¥30 min) bouts of sedentary behavior.

      Phase 2: A micro-randomized trial will be used to evaluate the efficacy of an email-based
      prompt to elicit a proximal effect (e.g., a postural response defined as a transition from
      seated to standing or seated to moving within 5 minutes to interrupt prolonged sitting)
      compared to a no prompt condition. A secondary aim of this study is to determine whether
      prompts that encourage standing are more likely to elicit a response than those that
      encourage moving. An exploratory aim is to examine whether varying the content of the stand
      or move prompt to include combinations of short term goals and employer approval, influence
      the magnitude of response.
