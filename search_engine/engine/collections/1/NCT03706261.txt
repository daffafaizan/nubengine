      diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal
      degeneration, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Tau is
      a microtubular protein and its native function is to provide structural support to neurons.
      Paired helical filaments composed of dysfunctional tau protein are found in several
      neurodegenerative diseases. In AD, the clinical progression of dementia has been shown to
      correlate with the amount and topographical spread of tau throughout the brain. Therefore,
      detecting and quantifying tau aggregate load in brain would have diagnostic and prognostic
      potential in clinical management of several neurological diseases. As disease modifying drugs
      that target tau are being developed, there is a critical need for a reliable method of
      detecting tau aggregates to confirm pathology in patients entering clinical trials.
