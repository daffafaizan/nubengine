      combined - and a control group. The intervention is carried out over 3 months, with a
      frequency of 5 weekly sessions of 45 minutes each. Cognitive training is applied through a
      computerized program, physical training consists of a walking aerobic program, and combined
      training arises from the addition of the two previous ones.

      140 participants will undergo an exhaustive pre- and post-intervention evaluation that
      includes neuropsychological, neuroimaging, genetic and biochemical analysis before and after
      the intervention as well as physical and health status assessment.

      The present project aims to examine the independent and combined effects of exercise and
      cognitive stimulation in functional and structural brain plasticity, cognitive performance,
      emotional state and quality of life, and will determine the demographic and clinical factors
      that can modulate neuroplasticity. It will allow us to study the neurophysiological
      mechanisms by which the different types of intervention have an effect on the structure and
      functioning of the brain and cognition within an omics framework.
