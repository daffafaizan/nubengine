    
      The TAVI program was initiated in Rabin Medical Center in 2008 and the institutional review
      board approved the prospective collection of our TAVI Database (i.e. RECORD TAVI). During
      these years, several oncology patients were treated with TAVI. Also, in daily practice a few
      asymptomatic AS patients in whom TAVI was indicated before cancer related surgery /
      cardiotoxic anti-cancer therapy underwent TAVI.

      This study will initiate a multicenter, international registry designed to collect data on
      TAVI in cancer patients in correspondence to medical records within each center. Data will be
      collected retrospectively for cases performed before registry initiation and prospectively
      thereafter. All inconsistencies regarding data collection will be resolved directly with
      local investigators and on-site data monitoring. Patients' inclusion approval is by a local
      ethics committee in each center.

      Saving Data: Data will be recorded in Excel table; each center and patient will receive a
      unique code so the data file will be anonymous.
