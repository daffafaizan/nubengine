      non-pharmacological interventions during the actual eye examination. Management of pain
      related to increased light sensitivity during the post-mydriasis period has not been
      described.

      This prospective, randomized study evaluated the impact of protecting the eyes from ambient
      light exposure post mydriasis. Vital signs and pain scales were recorded in infants
      randomized to either wear or not wear eye patches after mydriasis for their ROP exam. Infants
      less than 30 weeks gestational age or less than 1500 grams at birth were included. Standard
      statistical methods were used to compare vital signs and pain scores for each group at
      baseline, 1 and 3 hours after mydriasis.
