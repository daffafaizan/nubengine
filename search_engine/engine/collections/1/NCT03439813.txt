      potentially debilitating. Currently, post-stoke psychological care is inadequate. There is no
      definitive evidence to guide treatment of anxiety post-stroke.

      The TASK intervention is a centralized model for delivering personalised therapy for treating
      anxiety post-stroke using telephone and web-technology.

      The TASK intervention includes:

        -  Treatment website and telephone support

        -  Learning ways to overcome anxiety after stroke/'mini-stroke'

        -  Relaxation techniques

        -  Weekly online tasks

        -  Therapeutic videos

        -  Text reminders and participant record card

        -  Useful links to stroke resources and websites

      The investigators designed the TASK trial to be web-enabled, so that it can be conducted
      entirely remotely.

      In the TASK feasibility randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to evaluate the
      feasibility of:

      i) web-enabled trial procedures: online recruitment, remote eligibility checking, electronic
      informed consent, online self-reported outcome surveys

      ii) feasibility of the TASK intervention in stroke and TIA patients

      This trial received a favourable opinion from the South East Scotland Research Ethics
      Committee (ref: 17/SS/0143)
