      of multidimensional consequences according the International Classification of Function and
      Disability (CIF). Measures should demonstrate established psychometric properties, in terms
      of validity, reproducibility and responsiveness to change. The ArmA allows standardized
      measurement of both passive and active functions of the upper limb in terms of perceived
      performance under the activity level of the CIF. To date there is no measure that allows
      assessment of both upper limb functions of perceived performance in the French language.

      Prior to this study, a translation and cross-cultural adaptation (TCCA) of the ArmA was
      performed in accordance with study objectives and identified gap in the literature. TCCA was
      conducted in accordance with guidelines for subjective outcome measures contributing to
      evidence-based practice (Beaton et al., 2000). A six-step translation procedure for
      self-reported outcome measures was relevant of clinical use in a foreign language. A
      multidisciplinary team ensured a forwards-backwards translation and cross-cultural
      adaptation.

      An observational, single-center, cross-sectional study design will be implemented to
      determine the psychometric properties of the French ArmA.

      Participants will be from a post-stroke rehabilitation service (as part of their usual care).
      For the analysis of reliability properties, participants will be hospitalized as part of
      routine care and participation in the protocol (T0, T1 and T2 assessments) will add 1 to 2
      hours of assessment to routine care.

      Assessors will be trained Occupational Therapists having participated in the development of
      the measure.
