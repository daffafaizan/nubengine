      The cohort comprises 50-69 year-old male and female members of the American Association of
      Retired Persons (AARP). In 1995-96 we mailed baseline questionnaires to 3.5 million AARP
      members. Over 615,000 AARP members responded, with over 540,000 providing adequate dietary
      data. Preliminary analysis indicates that the cohort, both men and women, has the desired
      wide distributions of percent calories from fat, dietary fiber, fruits and vegetables, and
      red meat. Approximately 330,000 of the initial respondents (with satisfactory data) returned
      a second questionnaire containing questions on exposures not assessed in the first
      instrument. In 2004-2006 we mailed a follow-up questionnaire to all living participants to
      assess non-cancer endpoints and lifestyle factors.
