      in LUS group received ultrasound examination and guided the treatment according to the
      ultrasound results, while the control group did not receive ultrasound examination, just the
      same as the routine clinical practice. This study aims to explore whether ultrasound-guided
      clinical treatment can reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in
      moderate to highrisk patients. Before operation, informed consent was signed according to the
      inclusion criteria, and the incidence of pulmonary complications within 5 days after
      operation (or before discharge) was recorded after operation.
