c-acetyl bovine growth hormonea procedure is described for labeling bovine growth hormoneand human albumin with c-acetylation.  the labeled moleculewas biologically and antigenically similar to unlabeled bovinegrowth hormone.  following administration of the labeledhormone to animals, the label appeared to remain attached tothe growth hormone molecule for at least 4 hours.  administra-tion of the labeled hormone promoted growth in hypophysec-tomized rats and increased the free fatty acid concentrationin rabbit serum to a degree comparable with that seen followingadministration of unlabeled growth hormone.  rabbit anti-bovine growth hormone serum neutralized the rat growthresponse to the acetylated hormone, and immunized rabbitshad altered isotope dilution and no increase in serum free fattyacids after intravenous injection of the labeled hormone.
