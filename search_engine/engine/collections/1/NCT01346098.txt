      after the resection of the pancreatic head. In an effort to decrease morbidity and mortality,
      the referral of patients who need a pancreaticoduodenectomy to institutions (and surgeons)
      performing a high volume of this surgical procedure has been championed. Nonetheless, the
      role of prophylactic medications and the best surgical technique(s) for the removal of the
      pancreatic head are still debated. However, very few prospective randomized clinical trials
      have been conducted to compare different surgical techniques.

      Our study will address for the first time the role for preemptive total pancreatectomy and
      IAT in selected patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy that are considered high risk for
      pancreaticojejunostomy disruption (eg, small pancreatic duct, soft pancreas). The information
      expected is the identification of total pancreatectomy and the IAT as the standard treatment
      in a subgroup of patient with pathologies of the pancreatic head at high risk for leakage of
      pancreatic anastomosis. Ultimately this project will lead to reserve more innovative cell
      therapy for patients with the highest risk of anastomosis failure reducing pancreatojejunal
      reconstruction related morbidity and mortality
