      response to VNS, subjects will undergo progressive training on a visuomotor task that
      requires fine gradation of voluntary motor output to control a moving object through target
      boundaries. In separate groups, VNS or sham stimulation will be paired with movement when a
      minimal time-on-target (ToT) is achieved.
