    
      Patients with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) hospitalized (>24h) and presenting at
      least a risk factor for readmission after discharge at home, will be randomized, at time of
      discharge, between 2 groups: an "intervention" group and a control group (usual management).
      Intervention will consist in optimized organization of discharge at home followed by a
      ambulatory individualized coaching by a nurse including an initial situation assessment, a
      consultation meeting with the patient's GP in order to propose a Health Personalized Plan,
      then a follow up program with a face to face session each trimester in order to remind the
      objectives, to assess compliance to the plan, to evaluate difficulties encountered and to
      help to find solutions. Final data collection will be done in both groups by questioning the
      patient's general practitioner (GP) and by collecting data on potential hospitalization.
      Expected duration : 3 years. Readmission rate, duration and causes of hospitalization will be
      compared between both groups. Impact of the results : Reduction of costs, improved use of
      hospital specialized resources.
