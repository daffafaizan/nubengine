    
      200 Patients will be included from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm and will receive a multimodal analgesia
      under the nurse-directed pain management protocol (paracetamol +/- oral oxycodone +/-
      methoxyflurane) as part of routine medical care.

      The pain will be evaluated (Numerical rating scale) prior to the administration and
      reassessed by a nurse every 5 minutes for 30 minutes and then at 45min and 1 hour after
      administration of the pain protocol. Satisfaction of patients and caregivers will also be
      assessed at the end of care.
