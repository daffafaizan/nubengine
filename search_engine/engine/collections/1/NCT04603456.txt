    
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is an inflammatory state characterized by a disturbance of
      immunoregulatory mechanisms that leads to an amplified T helper "Th-2" response. Micro-RNAs
      (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNA molecules that post transcriptionally control gene
      expression and can mediate allergic process. The aim of this study was to explore miRNA-155
      change in response to sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), probiotics and combined treatment with
      SLIT and probiotics in AR children.
