      obese. However, existing VA programs are not designed for younger Veterans who are
      comfortable with technology-mediated interventions, may not yet have developed
      obesity-related illnesses, and contain a relatively high percentage of women compared to
      previous Veteran cohorts. Technology-mediated lifestyle interventions that include
      continuous, objective home monitoring of physical activity, automated internet mediated
      feedback, and e-coaching increase physical activity and improve weight loss in non-Veteran
      populations. When delivered on a large scale, such interventions represent low cost but
      effective alternatives to face-to-face lifestyle change interventions that can be implemented
      widely in the VA health care system. Thus, this project will test the feasibility and
      effectiveness of the prevention focused, internet-mediated healthy lifestyle physical
      activity program, Stay Strong w/coaching, tailored to the needs, preferences and demographics
      of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. Specifically, Stay Strong w/coaching relies on use of a wearable
      device, the Fitbit Charge 2, and incorporates coaching support, tailored messages, and
      personalized physical activity goals. Stay Strong w/coaching will be compared to the use of
      the Fitbit Charge 2 with standard online support (Stay Strong).
