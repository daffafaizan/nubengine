      Performed by surgeons, LIA provides effective postoperative pain relief and reduces opioid
      requirements. Similar analgesic benefits have also been attributed to adductor canal and
      iPACK blocks, which partially block sensory innervation to the knee and its posterior
      capsule. Performed by anesthesiologist preoperatively, these blocks have also been
      incorporated into the care standard in numerous centers. However, it is not clear whether
      adding the adductor canal and iPACK blocks yields any incremental analgesic benefits. The
      investigators aimed to evaluate the benefits of adding adductor canal and iPACK blocks to LIA
      in patients having total knee arthroplasty.
