      reduced oxygen availability as a result of lung dysfunction. The prevalence of cognitive
      impairment in COPD patients ranges from 10% to 61%. A wide variety of tools have been
      developed for screening cognitive functions. The most widely used tests covering multiple
      cognitive domains are the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA).

      When two tasks are performed at the same time, they compete for sources of attention,
      resulting in decreased performance on one or two tasks. Balance or postural control is a
      complex skill required for independent mobility and preventing falls. Balance performance
      naturally decreases with age; however, certain conditions are associated with more pronounced
      and rapid declines. Balance problems and fall risk are increased in COPD patients.From this
      perspective aim of this study is to assess the effect of square-step exercise and
      strengthening exercise applied with telerehabilitation on cognitive status and balance in
      patients with COPD.
