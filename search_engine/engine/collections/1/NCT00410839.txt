    
      Objective: We determined the effect of an ALA rich diet in reducing recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation as a further example of a cardiac arrhythmia.

      Design: Randomized parallel design efficacy study. Setting: Three university hospital centers
      in the Bordeaux region, France. Patients: 98 successive patients successfully underwent
      electro cardioversion of whom 75 completed the study without major deviations according to
      the protocol.

      Intervention: A canola margarine and oil together with a Mediterranean diet (ALA Ï‰-3, 1.4
      g/d) versus a conventional diet (control), with a one year follow-up.

      Main outcome measure: Length of time to first recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

      Significance: If ALA is antiarrhythmic this action may explain its cardioprotective effect in
      clinical trials and cohort studies.
