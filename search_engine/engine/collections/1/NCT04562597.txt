    
      First 20 subjects: 5 participants will be randomized to each dose group (placebo, 50, 100,
      and 150 mg/kg) to estimate the dose response curve and to identify the optimal dose.

      If the dose response curve is adequate and the optimal dose identified, 15 additional
      participants will be randomized to placebo and 15 to the optimal dose to estimate the
      difference in opioid consumption between participants on placebo vs. the optimal dose. (Total
      of 50 subjects with 20 from dose response curve and 30 to estimate the difference in opioid
      consumption.)

      If the dose response curve is not adequate after the initial 20 subjects 5 per each dose
      group, then an additional 5 participants will be randomized and to each dose group (placebo,
      50, 100, and 150 mg/kg) to estimate the dose response curve and to identify the optimal dose.
      Once the optimal dose is identified with these initial 40 patients, 10 additional
      participants will be randomized to placebo and 10 to the optimal dose to estimate the
      difference in opioid consumption between participants on placebo vs. the optimal dose. (60
      patients total with 40 to create the dose response curve and 20 more to estimate the
      difference in opioid consumption.)

      A sample size of 20 subjects per group (placebo and optimal dose) allows us to estimate a 95%
      confidence interval for the mean difference in opioid consumption with a width of + 0.64
      standard deviations from the mean. 70 subjects may be enrolled to account for withdrawal but
      the study will be completed once 50 or 60 subjects (based on the number of subjects required
      to create the dose response curve) have completed the protocol.
