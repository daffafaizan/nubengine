      failure. By injecting ASCs, these regions may become populated with the ASCs, thereby
      potentially restoring kidney function. ASCs are a patient-derived ("autologous") cell
      transplantation technology that is delivered to the patient. The therapy is composed of cells
      derived from a patients' own adipose tissue that are isolated within approximately 1 hour and
      immediately delivered back to the patient.
