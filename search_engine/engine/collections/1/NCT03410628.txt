    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, unblinded, multi-center feasibility study; 25 subjects
      will be enrolled at up to 5 study centers. Subjects considered for participation in this
      study will be those who have a diagnosis and documented history at least 2 episodes of acute
      headache pain and allodynia associated with migraine per month, but no more than 15 headache
      days per month. Subjects may, but are not required to experience prodromal symptoms, such as
      aura, or concomitant photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea with their migraine episodes, so
      long as their headaches meet the IHS-Classification criteria for migraine. Subjects will be
      screened for study eligibility and consented for study participation at presentation to the
      headache clinic. Once consented, subjects will be trained by the Investigator(s) at the study
      center on at-home use of the GammaCore device and on study data collection and other
      requirements.

      Each subject enrolled in this study will treat up to 3 migraine headaches at home over a
      period of up to 6 weeks.

      From the onset of headache pain, the subject will withhold usual migraine medications and
      wait until the pain becomes moderate or severe, or 30 minutes, whichever is sooner. At that
      point, the subject will self-administer a first stimulation treatment, which is 90 seconds in
      duration.
