      cavernoma treatment and known genetic causes of most familial forms of cavernoma,
      uncertainties remain about cause, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and care. According to the
      recently published CM treatment guideline, surgical and conservative treatments are both
      first-line therapeutic options in previously untreated CMs (U-CMs). However, given current
      data, neurosurgeons are still unable to counsel patients on which would be the best option.
      To address the absence of high level evidence to support cerebral CM treatment decisions,
      there is a need for a large sample size study of cerebral CM treatment with a prospective
      concurrent group. China has the largest population in the world and may have the most
      extensive and valuable clinical resources of U-CMs. But, till now, the current treatment and
      outcome situation of the disease in China is not well known. Thus, the investigators are
      conducting a nationwide multicenter prospective registry study in China to determine the
      effect of different treatments on long-term outcomes in patients with untreated cerebral
      cavernous malformations.At least 2000 patients with untreated cerebral cavernous malformation
      will be enrolled from 20 Grade â…¢ A level hospitals distributed all over China. Clinical data
      and laboratory data are prospectively collected by electric case report form (CRF) and
      uploaded online by each neurosurgery center to form the prospective clinical database in
      First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. This is a cohort follow-up study
      across a 5-year period with a 2 years interval of enrollment and 3 years follow up for each
      patient.
