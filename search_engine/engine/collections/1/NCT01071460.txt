      Superficial Femoral (SFA) and Popliteal arteries. These arteries represent a harsh
      environment for any endovascular device. This disease is characterized by long occlusions
      with relatively low flow and with the vessels exposed to enormous mechanical stress. During
      flexing of the knee, the SFA/Popliteal arteries can bend, rotate, elongate and compress
      dramatically. An ideal stent designed for use in the SFA/Popliteal arteries would offer great
      ranges of movement while adequately supporting the arteries.

      The FlexStent® stent provides a great range of motions for a highly flexible femoral artery
      while adequately supporting the vessel. The intended use for the FlexStent® stent is for the
      treatment of symptomatic femoropopliteal disease, primarily for atherosclerotic de novo
      native superficial femoral artery lesions.

      The intent of this clinical registry is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the
      FlexStent® stent in patients with superficial femoral/ popliteal artery disease.

      Hypothesis: the FlexStent® will be safe and efficacious in treating SFA/popliteal artery
      diseases.

      Primary object: evaluation of efficacy of the FlexStent® measured by the in-stent restenosis
      using DUS following treatment, 6 and 12 MFU visits.
