3107. lipids of human placentathe chloroform-methanol-solublecomponents of 4 human placentae were isolatedby rubber membrane dialysis and gaschromatography, and analysed.  two thirdsof the total lipids consisted of phosphatideswith lecithin as the main component(22.5%), colamine cephalin (13%)and sphingomyelin (7.5%).  free cholesterol form-ed 14% of the total lipids, whilecholesterol esters accounted for 6% and trigly-cerides for 13%.  investigation ofthe phosphatide fatty acids by gas chromatographyshowed a content of 60% saturated,27% simple unsaturated and 12% polyunsaturatedacids.  the fatty acids of the triglyceridesconsisted of about 50% saturated and25% each of simple and polyunsaturatedacids.  the polyenoic acids (30%) of thecholesterol fatty acids had a high contentof linoleic acid, about one quarter thatof the total acids.
