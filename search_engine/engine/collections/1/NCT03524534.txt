      hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries. Reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HF)
      and subsequent readmissions shortly after discharge is a nationally recognized health care
      delivery system priority. More than 20% of Medicare patients hospitalized for HF are
      readmitted within 30 days and this rate has not been declining over the past decade despite
      increasing attention to this problem. The data that will be collected could allow the study
      team to tailor the post-discharge follow-up program to patient characteristics to further
      improve the effectiveness of the interventions.
