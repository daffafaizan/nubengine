      I. To test the hypothesis that AZD0530 will improve the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) in comparison with historical controls for
      patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).

      II. Evaluate the time to treatment failure and overall survival of patients with HRPC treated
      with AZD0530.

      III. Evaluate the toxicities and tolerance of AZD0530 therapy in the HRPC population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD0530 once daily. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for the first 2
      years and then yearly thereafter.
