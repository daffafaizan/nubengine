        -  Determine the frequency of complications associated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
           in patients with low-risk papillary thyroid cancer undergoing thyroidectomy.

        -  Determine the utility of RFA as a treatment option for these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      An electrosurgical probe is placed by ultrasound guidance into the center of the thyroid
      tumor. Patients undergo radiofrequency ablation directly to the tumor until the target
      temperature is reached* for 5 minutes. Patients then undergo standard thyroidectomy.

      NOTE: *Takes approximately 15-30 minutes to reach target temperature.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 1, between days 14-21, and
      then periodically as deemed necessary.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
