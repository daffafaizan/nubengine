      involved rinsing with slurries of two sodium fluoride-silica dentifrices containing zinc
      chloride and sodium citrate, and with water alone. The study consisted of four Visits: Visit
      1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Treatment 1), Visit 3 (Treatment 2), Visit 4 (Treatment 3). There was
      a minimum two days wash out period before the first treatment visit and between treatment
      visits to avoid any treatment carry-over effect. During that time participants brushed as
      normal (twice-daily) at home with a washout toothpaste and a toothbrush which was provided at
      screening. Participants were required not to brush their teeth on the morning of the
      treatment visits and not to eat or drink for 2 hours prior to the treatment visits.
