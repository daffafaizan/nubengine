      occurs immediately after surgery, and its nature is traumatic pain. It may develop into a
      chronic pain, such as a neuropathic pain or a mixed pain, if it is not fully controlled at
      the initial state. It will seriously impact the physiology and psychology of a patient.
      According to the study, the postoperative acute pain is one of the risks for postoperative
      complications, and it may result in the death of a patient. However, the alleviation of a
      postoperative acute pain can shorten the duration of stay in hospital, and reduce the overall
      cost for treatment of a patient.

      The risk of acute and chronic pain after thoracic surgery is high. The multi-disciplinary
      postoperative pain management strategy is the best way to control postoperative pain in
      thoracic surgery. Through nearly one year of experience in implementation of the pMDT in the
      thoracic surgery department of Peking University People's Hospital, the investigators have
      summarized the experience in multidisciplinary pain management and promoted this study in
      multi-centers across the country, hoping that this study can improve the current situation of
      acute pain management in patients after thoracic surgery, and at the same time, the
      deficiencies of this clinical protocol can be found out and improved.
