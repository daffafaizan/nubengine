      been included from five different University hospitals in Norway. The last patient was
      included November 9th 2006, final inclusion date was December 31th 2006. At this time a total
      of 64 patients with probable MOH according to the International Classification of Headache
      Disorders, 2nd Edition (2004) were included.

      The included patients were randomized to one out of three possible options:

        1. Abrupt withdrawal of the acute medication(s) they have been overusing. After 3 month:
           use of preventative medication (best choice)in those who need such treatment, 12 month
           follow-up.

        2. Start with preventative medication (best choice) directly without abrupt withdrawal, 12
           month follow-up.

        3. No specific treatment (controls), 5 month follow-up.
