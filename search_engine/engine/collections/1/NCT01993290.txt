      single-penetration multiple-injection-technique at the SCL, LIC and AX level for
      upper-extremity surgery (elbow, forearm, wrist, hand). The investigators want to investigate
      whether the single-penetration multiple-injection-technique would provide for safe surgical
      anaesthesia with lower volumes of local anaesthetics than has previously been described in a
      comparative study at the three different levels.

      120 patients will prospectively be randomized to an USG BP block administered as a
      single-penetration multiple-injection-technique at one of three different levels: (1) SCL (2)
      LIC (3) AX. Ropivacaine 0.75% (20 mL) will be used for all blocks prior to surgery.
