      processing of muscle samples. The aim of this work is to evaluate the feasibility and
      reproducibility of a method of analysis on muscle fibers only permeabilized, while coupling
      two complementary techniques, oxygraphy and fluorimetry. Its principle is based on the
      knowledge that the opening of the mPTP leads to an inhibition of respiration at the level of
      the complex I of the respiratory chain. This inhibition is the consequence of the escape from
      mitochondria of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH, i.e. substrate
      of complex I) concomitant with the opening of mPTP. Thus, the oxygraphy must allow the
      observation of the inhibition of respiration synonymous with the non-availability of the
      substrate of the complex I and thus indirectly reflect the opening of the mPTP. For its part,
      the fluorimetry must allow, in the presence of a fluorescent calcium indicator (i.e. Calcium
      Green), the observation of the release of calcium synonymous with the opening of the mPTP.

      Once validated, this technique should make it possible to evaluate in situ the sensitivity of
      mPTP to calcium. In a context of application within clinical protocols, the evaluation of the
      mPTP calcium sensitivity should contribute to a better understanding of the physiological and
      physio-pathological mechanisms of adaptation of muscle tissue.
