      to study the safety and efficacy of Concerta therapy in adults with ADHD NOS. Adult ADHD NOS
      is operationalized by either

        -  An adult satisfying current diagnostic criteria for ADHD but with insufficient number of
           childhood symptoms to fulfill the required diagnostic threshold for this disorder set
           forth in DSM-IV

        -  An adult who has five current symptoms of inattention and/or five current symptoms of
           impulsivity/hyperactivity, but does not meet the full diagnosis criteria of six current
           symptoms within one of these categories.

      Our hypotheses will be examined in two phases of an open label, pilot study. Phase I of the
      study consists of a six-week acute effectiveness trial. Phase II consists of continuation for
      responders in which subjects who respond in Phase I will be re-assessed every four weeks for
      six months. Effectiveness will be measured by improvements in clinician-rated scales,
      including: ADHD Symptom Checklist, Clinical Global Impression: ADHD, and Global Assessment of
      Functioning.
