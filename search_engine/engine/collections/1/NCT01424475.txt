      disease (PKD). An inhibitor for the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is in pre-clinical
      development for potential use in treating Parkinson's disease. Patients with PKD have
      cognitive impairments which develop alongside the typical motor symptoms but a full
      characterisation of the neurocognitive phenotype of PKD patients with LRRK2 mutation is
      currently lacking. This observational study conducted on a single visit will assess the
      phenotypic neurocognitive abnormalities of PKD patients with the LRRK2 mutation with the aim
      of identifying potential PD endpoints related to the LRRK2 mutation for future Phase I or II
      clinical trials of LRRK2 inhibitors.

      Approximately 20 subjects with PKD bearing one of the known LRRK2 mutations will be
      investigated. Approximately 20 healthy subjects without the LRRK2 mutation who are matched
      with PKD patients will also be evaluated.

      Healthy subjects are not expected to be taking medications for PKD. Subjects with PKD may
      continue their medications for PKD treatment throughout the study, Testing will take place
      within 30 days of screening, depending on the subject's availability.
