      ingestible event marker (IEM), a wearable sensor (skin patch), and application software to

      Physician and self-report are the most commonly used to assess medication compliance yet
      studies have consistently found that healthcare providers' subjective judgments of medication
      compliance are often inaccurate, with a tendency for practitioners to overestimate subject
      adherence. The sponsor's intent is to develop a system that will benefit future subjects by
      providing the ability to measure their medication-taking behavior in an objective manner and
      being able to monitor several physiologic parameters.
