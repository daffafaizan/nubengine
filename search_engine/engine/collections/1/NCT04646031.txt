      the water extract of two widely used herb medicines: Danshen (Radix Saliva Miltiorrhize Bge.,
      RSM) and Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng, RN).

      A large number of researches have shown that T89 has the effects of activating blood
      circulation and removing blood stasis. Clinical trials conducted in China and US also show
      that T89 can significantly improve blood oxygen saturation at high altitudes and alleviate
      the symptoms of hypoxia. It has been also reported that T89 is effective in treating
      myocardial ischemic diseases.

      Basic studies show that T89 can improve red blood cell oxygen delivery capacity, reduce
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) related tissue damage, alleviate tissue and organ injuries
      caused by ischemia by improving microcirculation, improve energy metabolism and increase
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in myocardial tissue, inhibit the reduction of
      hematocrit, albumin leakage, neutrophil CD18 and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1
      (ICAM-1), preventing deterioration of microcirculation caused by ischemia and hypoxia, and
      inhibit platelet aggregation and adhesion.

      The objective of this expanded access program is to provide T89 for treatment use in an
      intermediate-size population with severe COVID-19, with the dosing regimen of 300mg (four T89
      capsules) each time, orally, three time daily for 14 days, followed by a follow-up visit by
      call on Day 21.
