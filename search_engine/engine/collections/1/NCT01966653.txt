      nitrofurantoin is now being prescribed frequently given the rise in multi-resistant
      gram-negative pathogens. Doubts remain regarding fosfomycin's long-term clinical
      effectiveness. A randomized, controlled trial is needed to explore the clinical effectiveness
      and better define the side effect profiles of both nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. From autumn
      2013 through summer 2016, this multi-center open trial will randomize 600 non-pregnant women
      at three international sites (200 each in Poland, Switzerland, and Israel) at increased risk
      for carriage of resistant uropathogens and with suspicion of uncomplicated lower urinary
      tract infection to receive either oral nitrofurantoin 100 mg three times daily for 5 days or
      a single 3g dose of oral fosfomycin. Patients will be followed for clinical and bacteriologic
      response at days 14 and 28 post therapy completion. The study hypothesis holds that
      nitrofurantoin will be superior to fosfomycin in clinical efficacy at final follow-up.
