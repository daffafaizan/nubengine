    
      Individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (10 participants each) will consume a Ross
      Chocolate or conventional sugar-sweetened dark chocolate bar on two occasions in a randomized
      crossover trial. Blood glucose levels will be measured by finger prick for 120 minutes after
      consumption to determine postprandial glucose excursions after consumption of each type of
      chocolate bar.

      Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was converted to be completed remotely/virtually with
      participants completing the testing at their home under the supervision of a research team
      member who will describe the study procedures and monitor testing via video conferencing.
