      club. It will be designed as a crossover study. Half of the participants will consume the new
      bar for five days and the other half will consume the control bar. After the five-day washout
      period, the groups will consume the bar which was not consumed in the first period.

      At baseline, at the end of every intervention and washout period, the blood samples will be
      withdrawn, and the body composition will be analyzed.

      The analyzed biochemical parameters will be basic serum parameters, such as fasting glucose,
      total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and parameters related to the muscle
      regeneration and inflammation, such as creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, insulin-like
      growth factor (IGF), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), monocyte
      chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1).

      In the second part of the study, the acute effect of consuming each bar after training will
      be tested. Each participant will consume both bars on separate days. The mentioned parameters
      will be assessed after training and immediately and 3h after bar consumption.
