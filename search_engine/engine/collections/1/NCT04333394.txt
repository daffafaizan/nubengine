      four weeks the dosage will increase to 0.5mg/kg. Those who weighed more than 30 kg receive
      0.5 mg/kg with the same pattern that reaches the highest point of 0.7 mg/kg by week four.
      Each dosage will be administrated trice a day with breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In the
      middle of the study patients who consumes less than 80% of their supplements will be omitted
      from the study.
