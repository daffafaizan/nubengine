      mammograms, and acquaintances with breast cancer. They then were randomly assigned one of two
      articles (one favorable and one unfavorable) that had been published in the newspaper
      regarding the USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines. Their attitudes towards the safety
      of the guidelines and their willingness to comply with them was then measured.
