    
      This is a prospective, single arm, phase 2 clinical trial. This patient population will have
      low (1 = Gleason 3 + 3) or intermediate risk (2 = 3 + 4; 3 = 4 + 3) prostate cancer. It will
      also enroll those who are at high risk of significant prostate cancer (4Kscore >20%,
      SelectMDx >20%, PSA density >0.15). Patients will be scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) as part of routine care for either surgical planning or for further biopsy. Following
      the informed consent process, patients who enroll in the study will receive a PSMA positron
      emission tomography (PET) study along with their standard of care (SOC) MRI on an integrated
      PET-MRI. Registration of PET and MRI will be done using software to generate the PET-MRI
      images. Patients receiving SOC MRI guided biopsy will receive additional PET guided biopsies
      as indicated in a single session. The sensitivity and specificity will be evaluated along
      with the ability of the tracer to inform the treatment planning. Patients receiving surgical
      removal of the prostate will have a slice-by-slice whole mount analysis to assess the
      sensitivity and specificity the PSMA PET.

      Primary Objectives Define the accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT for detecting the location and
      size of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions in low and intermediate risk disease.

      Secondary Objectives Evaluate how knowledge of the PSMA-PET might inform treatment planning.

      Exploratory Objectives Generate pilot data for future larger clinical trials
