      nonmyeloablative, related-donor, HLA (human leukocyte antigen)-matched or HLA-haploidentical
      BMT with post-transplantation high-dose cyclosphosphamide administered for prophylaxis of
      graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection. Rituximab is added to the transplant regimen
      with the goal of augmenting anti-tumor activity. In patients with B-cell lymphomas, specific
      polymorphisms in the immunoglobulin Fc receptor have been associated with greater sensitivity
      to rituximab or rituximab-based therapies, translating in some series into higher response
      rates and improved progression-free survival. This raises the possibility of selecting donors
      who carry this permissive polymorphism. This trial identifies and selects donors who have the
      favorable polymorphism at FcgammaR3A-158, thereby potentially conferring greater sensitivity
      to rituximab in the host after BMT.
