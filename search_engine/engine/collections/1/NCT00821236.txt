    
      The primary objective of this study is to compare WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVE™ wavefront guided
      or optimized excimer laser treatment with the AMO/VISX CustomVue™ and the LADARVision 4000
      excimer laser treatment using both subjective and objective outcome measures. This comparison
      will be made between fellow eyes of the same patient following excimer laser ablation using
      the WaveLight ALLEGRETTO WAVE™ Excimer Laser System in one eye and the AMO/VISX CustomVue™ or
      the LADARVision 4000 excimer laser in the contralateral eye .
