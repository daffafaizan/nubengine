      substantial public health, social, and economic problems (e.g., high medical costs, crime,
      lost productivity). Cocaine and heroin use disorders often co-occur, and this conjunction is
      associated with higher rates of medical and psychiatric problems and worse drug abuse
      treatment outcome.

      Many medications have been tested, but have failed, for treating cocaine dependence alone or
      in cocaine abusers who also use heroin.

      This clinical trial will test whether SR-AMP is more effective than placebo for preventing
      relapse to cocaine use, using SR-AMP for patients with only cocaine dependence, or in
      combination with buprenorphine (for those patients who are also dependent on heroin).

      Participants will first be an outpatient and must come to the Jefferson Avenue Research
      Program three times per week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday, Friday) to measure drug use and
      drug-related symptoms. This phase will last at least 2 weeks.

      Next, participants will live on an inpatient research unit for seven (7) consecutive nights.
      During the weeklong inpatient stay, in addition to receiving SR-AMP or placebo capsules,
      participants will begin counseling treatment to help prepare to avoid relapse after they are
      discharged from the inpatient unit.

      After the inpatient stay, participants will then be an outpatient and come to the Jefferson
      Ave. Research Program daily for eight (8) weeks. Throughout all eight weeks, three urine
      samples will be collected each week to assess illicit drug use, and questionnaires related to
      drug symptoms and to assess mood and risk behaviors will be given.
