      to treat metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed on both anthracyclines and
      taxanes. We hypothesize that the combination of digoxin with metronomic capecitabine may lead
      to increased efficacy and duration of treatment without progression with decreased side
      effects than standard regimen.
