    
      This is an observational imaging study to evaluate the value of multimodal [18F]DCFPyL
      positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) for solid tumor
      characterization and disease staging.

      This research study involves:

        -  Screening visit, and 1-3 study Multimodal [18F]DCFPyL PET/MRI visits

        -  Two cohorts of participants will be enrolled in this study: primary prostate cancer
           patients and patients with known or suspected solid tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma,
           glioma, clear cell renal carcinoma)

        -  It is expected that about 135 people will take part in this research study

             -  The PET dye used in this study is called [18F]DCFPyL. [18F]DCFPyL is not approved
                by the U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA). This means [18F]DCFPyL can only be
                used in research studies.

             -  The PET/MRI scanner was approved by the U.S. FDA.
