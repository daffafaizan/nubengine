      intervention groups was carried out; 9 children performed the combination of the Pilates
      Method and Therapeutic Exercise (experimental) and 7 children performed the Therapeutic
      Exercise (control). At the beginning and at the end of the study, pain measurements have been
      made through the Visual Analogue Scale (EVA), and the Kinovea programme for the alignment of
      shoulder, scapula and hip postures.
