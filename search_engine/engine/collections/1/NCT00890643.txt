      PTSD. Placebo-controlled trials demonstrate that the centrally acting alpha-1 antagonist
      prazosin is clinically effective for several core symptoms of PTSD in combat veterans.
      However, no detailed assessment of the impact of prazosin on human neurophysiology and
      cognition have been conducted. Our hypotheses are based on studies that demonstrate (1) the
      importance of central adrenergic receptors in regulating fundamental neurophysiologic and
      cognitive functions, (2) the alteration of these functions in PTSD, and (3) the efficacy of
      prazosin in improving the clinical symptoms of PTSD. The primary objective of this study is
      to measure the subtle neurocognitive and neurophysiologic effects on prazosin in combat
      veterans with PTSD.
