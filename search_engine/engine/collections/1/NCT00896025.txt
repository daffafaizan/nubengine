      who are thought not to have acetaminophen toxicity, mushroom poisoning, pregnancy-related
      liver failure, or malignancy will be eligible. Each patient will receive intravenously in
      solution of 5% dextrose in water containing N-acetylcysteine, beginning at a dose of 150
      mg/kg bodyweight in 250 ml 5% dextrose over one hour, and in declining doses over a total of
      72 hours. Care of patients and consideration of transplantation or other clinical decisions
      will not be affected by the study or the use of study drug.
