        -  Determine the efficacy of SarCNU in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal
           cancer.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral SarCNU on days 1, 5, and 9. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve
      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond documentation of CR. Patients who
      achieve partial response (PR) receive 4 additional courses beyond documentation of PR.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-8
      months.
