      the abdomen and pelvis, often refractory to conventional treatments, lasting more than six
      months The presence of trigger points in the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) is a frequent
      condition in individuals with CPP and is associated with higher levels of pain, disability
      and functional decline. Secondary dysfunctions associated with the clinical picture of
      chronic pelvic pain can be treated with muscle training through the use of biofeedback and
      dry needling. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of two interventions:
      pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training with biofeedback and PFM training with the addition of
      trigger point dry needling applied over(Lumbar square, psoas, external obliques, gluteus
      medius, piriformis and adductors) on pain and quality of life of women with CPP.

      We will recruit 44 women aged 18 to 60 years with CPP lasting for a minimum of six months. We
      will exclude women with urinary incontinence, neurological conditions, malignancy, fractures,
      pregnancy and those that did not agree to receive treatment with needles will be excluded.

      Individuals will be randomized into two groups: PFM training with biofeedback and Dry
      Needling Group and PFM training with biofeedback. Participants will receive a total of 4
      sessions twice a week,,for two weeks. This investigation's primary outcome will be pain (NRS)
      Immediately after the 4 visits. Quality of life, global impression of recovery and sexual
      function evaluated at Immediately after the 4 visits will be secondary outcomes.
