      Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA -IIA epithelial ovarian cancer, undergo completion
      staging surgery including systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy versus
      comprehensive staging surgery without lymphadenectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized phase III multicenter study. Patients will receive
      comprehensive staging surgery without Lymphadenectomy or completion staging surgery including
      systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, and the adjuvant chemotherapy will accord
      to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Patients are followed up every 3
      months within the first 2 years, and then every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 656 patients will be recruited for this study within 5 years.
