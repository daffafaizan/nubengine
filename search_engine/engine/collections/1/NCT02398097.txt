      (18 to 60 years): inactivated intramuscular vaccine (Agripal), reduced-content intradermal
      vaccine (IDflu9μg) and standard-content intradermal vaccine (IDflu15μg). Serum
      hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies and INF-γ ELISpot assay were measured at the time
      of vaccination and 1 month after vaccination. Adverse events were recorded for 7 days.
