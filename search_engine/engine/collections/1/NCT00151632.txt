      prevention of acute and chronic rejection in liver transplantation. Adverse effects of
      tacrolimus are dose-dependent and appear early after the onset of treatment. To prevent side
      effects, we propose to combine reduced doses of tacrolimus with another immunosuppressant,
      i.e. mycophenolate mofetil, administered at usual doses. This study evaluates the interest of
      this combination and, subsequently, the pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil in this
      therapeutic context. Patients undergoing liver transplantation will be randomized to
      tacrolimus at normal doses or to the combination of tacrolimus at half doses and
      mycophenolate mofetil. A corticotherapy will be associated in both groups. The safety will be
      evaluated on the number of graft rejections between day 1 after transplantation and week 48;
      the onset of complications (hypertension, renal failure, diabetes, etc.) will allow to
      evaluate the efficacy of both treatment schedules.
