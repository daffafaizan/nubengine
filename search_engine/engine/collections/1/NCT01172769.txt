      of cell cycle progression. It was approved in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.
      Temsirolimus demonstrated also antitumor activity in a variety of other human cancer models,
      such as gliomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, neuroblastomas, prostata and breast cancer through
      induction of apoptosis or inhibition of proliferation. A similar effect was noted in HNSCC
      cell lines.

      This is the first study evaluating the efficacy and safety of temsirolimus in
      platinum/cetuximab-refractory HNSCC.
