      (CellCept) for the treatment of symptomatic pulmonary alveolitis due to systemic sclerosis
      (SSc). This study utilizes a prospective, open-label, experimental design.

      Primary Hypothesis: The alveolitis in patients with SSc, as defined by decreased forced vital
      capacity (FVC), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and High Resolution Chest Tomography (HRCT) is
      responsive to 1 year of daily mycophenolate mofetil therapy.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Quality of life, six-minute walk and single-breath diffusing capacity
      for carbon monoxide (DLCO) improve in patients with SSc mediated alveolitis after therapy
      with mycophenolate mofetil. This response to therapy is associated with a change in the
      inflammatory cytokine profile present in BAL fluid.
