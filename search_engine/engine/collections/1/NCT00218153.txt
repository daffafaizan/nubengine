      used to help reduce cigarette use and craving for cigarettes. Eligible participants will
      receive 21mg transdermal nicotine as an outpatient. In addition, participants will receive
      one of three doses of naltrexone (25,50 or 100mg) or a placebo and brief counseling over the
      course of six weeks with follow-up appointments three, six, and twelve months after the
      beginning of treatment.
