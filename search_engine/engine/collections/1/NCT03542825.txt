      The oral route is preferred to the parenteral route to replace iron stores. This allows the
      normal mechanism of absorption to be used, in addition to being an inexpensive and effective
      treatment [Sharma JB; et al., 2004]. Inorganic iron has poor bio-availability in addition to
      many side effects, including gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and
      constipation and it may sometimes increase susceptibility to infection [ SoÂ¨lvell L; et al.,
      1970].

      Furthermore, routine iron supplementation has recently been challenged. The British Society
      for Hematology, Obstetric Hematology Group (BSH OHG) and the British Committee for Standards
      in Hematology (BCSH) recommend screening by Full blood count (FBC) at booking and at 28 weeks
      instead of universal iron supplementation [Pavord S. 2012]. Lactoferrin is a high-affinity
      cationic iron binding glycoprotein [Baker EN, 2005]. Bovine Lactoferrin is currently
      available pharmaceutical preparation. It is in to safe and effective in treating pregnant
      women suffering from ID and IDA [Mohamed Rezk, et al. 2015]. This study will compare the
      efficacy of these three available options.
