      worldwide and in the China. In the past decade, survivals of patients with advanced HCC or
      those who have progressed diseases following locoregional treatments can be increased with
      the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, the first evidence identified drug for HCC. Recent
      clinical trials further verified some novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as regorafenib
      and cabozantinib, and two programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitors
      (ICIs), nivolumab and pembrolizumab, as useful therapies in second line setting following
      sorafenib.

      Advances in programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade have shown an ORR of 15-17% and
      median survival time of 12.9-15.0 months among patients with advanced HCC. Of these,
      nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been accelerated approved as second-line treatment of
      advanced HCC. Notably, patients who have tumor responses maintain long-lasting disease
      control for 9.9-17months and still a large proportion of patients (81-83%) do not respond to
      mono PD-1 blockade, which emphasizing the need to explore strategies to increase the efficacy
      of immunotherapy.

      An approach to expanding the benefit of ICIs may involve combinations with locoregional
      therapy like radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), such
      treatments have been shown to boost tumor-specific T-cell response through release of TAAs
      from HCC cells. The intent-to-treat population of this study was a subset of patients
      receiving ongoing ICIs therapy for advanced HCC and is with stable disease or atypical
      responses in different lesions of the same individuals.
