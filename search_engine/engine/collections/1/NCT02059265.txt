      I. To assess the clinical activity of dasatinib in patients with recurrent or persistent
      ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, and endometrial clear cell carcinoma using
      objective tumor response (complete and partial): in patients without loss of BRG-associated
      factor 250a (BAF250a) expression and in patients with loss of BAF250a expression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the nature and degree of toxicity in this patient population treated with this
      regimen in patients with and without loss of BAF250a expression.

      II. To examine the progression-free survival and overall survival for this patient population
      receiving dasatinib in patients with and without loss of BAF250a expression.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the agreement between BAF250a immunohistochemistry and AT rich interactive
      domain 1A (SWI-like) (ARID1A) mutation status using next generation sequencing performed in
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
