      of one year. The test foods will be rice, rice with egg, rice with fish, rice with chicken
      and rice with beancurd.Potential participants will have to come on one morning in an
      overnight fasted state for consenting and screening procedures. Only those fulfilling the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be admitted into the study. Each participant will be
      required to come on 5 non-consecutive days, with each session lasting approximately 4 hours.
      On each day, participants will arrive at the laboratory between 8-9 am following an overnight
      fast. An indwelling catheter will be inserted into a vein in their forearm or antecubital
      fossa and kept patent. Baseline blood samples will be obtained after which they will be given
      the test food to consume. Further blood samples will be taken at periodic intervals for the
      subsequent 3.5 hours. Blood samples will be taken every 15 minutes in the first 60 minutes
      and every 30 minutes for the remaining 150 minutes. At every time point blood samples will be
      extracted from a finger prick (for measuring glucose) and from the cannula (for measuring all
      other metabolites). At the same time points subjects will have to fill in visual analogue
      scales on feelings of hunger and satiety.
