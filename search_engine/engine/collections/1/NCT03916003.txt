      acute infection. Recurrent infections can be associated with a febrile illness, a cumulative
      risk of severe anaemia, direct and indirect mortality, and are the most important source of
      onward transmission of the parasite. In co-endemic areas, there is a very high risk (up to
      50%) of patients representing with P. vivax malaria following treatment of P. falciparum.
      Hence, in co-endemic regions there is a strong rationale for eradicating P. vivax hypnozoites
      from the liver in patients presenting with uncomplicated P. falciparum infections.

      The recently completed multicentre IMPROV study compared the efficacy of a 7 day primaquine
      regimen (1.0 mg/kg/day for 7 days) with a 14 day regimen (0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days). The 7
      day PQ regimen was non-inferior to the 14 day regimen and 5-fold more efficacious at reducing
      P. vivax recurrence than the control.

      This study is designed as a multicentre randomized, open label trial to compare the safety
      and efficacy of a high dose PQ treatment in G6PD normal patients with P. falciparum to reduce
      the risk of subsequent P. vivax episodes to current standard practice of providing only
      schizontocidal treatment.
