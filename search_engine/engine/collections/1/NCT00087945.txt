      currently recommended ABC doses are appropriate for adolescents. Previous data suggest ABC
      clearance in children is about twice that found in adults, but limited data exist on the
      pharmacokinetics of ABC in adolescents. This study will evaluate the 8-hour pharmacokinetics
      of ABC in HIV infected adolescents who are currently on ABC-containing treatment regimens.

      There will be two groups in this study. Group 1 participants will be 13 to 17 years old.
      Group 2 participants will be 18 to 25 years old. All participants will receive a 300 mg dose
      of ABC as either a single-agent tablet or a combination tablet of ABC, lamivudine, and
      zidovudine (whichever they are currently taking). Participants will have a medical history
      assessment and a physical exam at screening and study entry. Participants will also be asked
      about adherence to their ABC-containing regimen at study entry. During the 8-hour drug level
      study, blood collection for pharmacokinetic analysis will occur prior to taking ABC, and at
      0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after taking ABC.
