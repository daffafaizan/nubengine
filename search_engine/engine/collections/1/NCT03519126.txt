    
      Objective: To compare the efficacy between intravaginal and transcutaneous electrostimulation
      of the posterior tibial nerve in the treatment of women with symptoms of idiopathic
      overactive bladder or mixed urinary incontinence.

      METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial with comparative
      analysis between study groups and a control, performed at three moments: pre and post
      clinical intervention and one month after the end of treatment. Vaginal electrostimulation
      group (GV), transcutaneous electrostimulation group of the posterior tibial nerve (GTP) and
      control group (CG - without intervention). The intervention groups will be treated with
      biphasic current with a frequency of 10 Hz and a pulse width of 200 Î¼s for 12 sessions of 30
      minutes each. Participants will be evaluated and reevaluated by means of a general data
      questionnaire, 3-day urinary diary and an International Consultation on Incontinence
      Questionnaire Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB). Statistical analysis will be performed using
      SPSS version 22 and the level of significance adopted will be p <0.05.
