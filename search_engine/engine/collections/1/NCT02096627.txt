      patients will receive treatment that is FDA approved for cataract surgery. Because all study
      participants will have been scheduled for elective cataract extraction regardless of their
      participation in this study, there will be little or no additional surgical risk associated
      with participation. A total of 720 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study during a
      period of 2 years. The investigators will recruit patients with bilateral operable cataracts.
      One eye will undergo cataract surgery using conventional cataract extraction technique
      including phacoemulsification whereas the second eye will undergo FLACS. No significant
      increased risk to the patient is expected in either arm of the study compared to routine
      cataract surgery. The patients will be examined as per previous post-operative cataract
      surgery guidelines on POD1, POW1, POM1, POM3, POM6, POY1 and POY2. The only treatment
      difference will take place at the time of the cataract surgery. Post-operatively, endothelial
      cell count will be obtained by the no-touch technology of specular microscopy at baseline as
      well as three months after surgery. If the study ends prematurely, the investigators do not
      anticipate any significant change in the care of the patient.
