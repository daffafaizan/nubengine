      address increasing health disparities among underserved communities. One promising approach
      to increase test uptake is the secondary distribution of self-tests, where an individual
      distributes test kits to contacts in their social network and encourages them to self-test.
      By decentralizing testing, this approach does not require individuals to have contact with
      medical systems, and can lower potential barriers to obtaining testing. This approach can
      increase case detection by facilitating testing among exposed individuals, and potentially
      ameliorate stigma, fear, and medical mistrust associated with COVID-19 among vulnerable
      populations because the testing process is decentralized.

      The investigators will conduct a 1:1 randomized controlled trial randomizing individuals to
      receive either multiple self-test kits to distribute within their social circles, or
      referrals for standard clinic-based tests. All study participants will be offered testing
      upon enrollment. Study participants, deemed "Index Participants," will be randomized to
      receive multiple self-testing kits (intervention) or test referral cards and text messages
      (control) to encourage individuals in their social networks, deemed "network contacts" to
      test. Participants will complete a baseline evaluation and a follow-up evaluation at 8 weeks.
      We will measure network contact test uptake in both study arms. The central hypothesis of
      this trial is that distribution of self-test kits will increase test uptake compared with
      distribution of test referrals.
