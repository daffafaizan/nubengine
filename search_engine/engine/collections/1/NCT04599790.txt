    
      This is a Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with lenvatinib
      and sintilimab in patients with advanced HCC.

      30 subjects with advanced HCC (Barcelona-Clinic- Liver-Cancer [BCLC] stage C, or China liver
      cancer staging [CNLC] IIIa and IIIb) will be enrolled in the study.

      Lenvatinib 12mg (body weight â‰¥60kg) or 8mg (body weight <60kg) P.O. qd and sintilimab (200mg
      I.V. q3w) will be started at 3-7 days after the first TACE. TACE will be repeated if
      clinically indicated based on the evaluation of follow-up laboratory and imaging examination.
      Lenvatinib will last until disease progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed
      consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances that require termination of
      treatment, whichever occurs first. Sintilimab will last up to 24 months, or until disease
      progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death,
      or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first.
      Patients will be allowed to have lenvatinib or sintilimab as a sigle agent and will be still
      considered on study when the other drug cause intolerable toxicity.
