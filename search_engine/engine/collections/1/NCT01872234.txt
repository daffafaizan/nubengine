    
      MADIT-ASIA is a multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical study. The primary aim is to
      show that two lead CRT-P with guideline-based optimal pharmacological therapy is associated
      with a significantly greater improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 6
      months compared with guideline-based optimal pharmacologic therapy only.

      The study will be initially conducted at approximately 25 centers in up to 9 countries in
      Asia including India, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. If
      necessary, more sites may be invited to participate to meet the enrollment goal.

      Following randomization, subjects will have scheduled clinic visit follow-ups at 1, 3 and
      6-month intervals. Relevant event history, cardiac medications, physical assessment, device
      interrogation/programming status and adverse events will be collected at each follow-up
      visit. At the 6-month visit, a repeat echocardiogram and a 12-lead ECG will be obtained.
      Subjects will be followed through the 6 month visit. After that, subjects will have a safety
      follow up contact at the end of the study. The study will end when the last randomized
      subject reaches the 6 months visit.
