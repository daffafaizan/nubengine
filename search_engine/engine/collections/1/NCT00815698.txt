      technique for inguinal hernia repair in adults is the Lichtenstein mesh repair, where a
      polypropylene mesh is sutured to the tissue in the inguinal region. We therefore want to
      evaluate the effect of suture for mesh fixation on the occurrence of chronic pain 12 months
      after operation.
