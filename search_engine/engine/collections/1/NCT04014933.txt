      blindness. Glaucoma is a global problem, which is becoming even more important as the human
      life expectancy increases. Although the causes of glaucoma are uncertain, mainly intraocular
      pression (IOP), genetics, and ocular blood perfusion pressure in the optic nerve determine
      the cause of the disease. Increasing evidence suggests that in glaucoma patients retinal
      blood flow is decreased leading to progression and to damage of the optic nerve.

      In order to measure the peripapillary blood flow a variety of devices using different
      techniques of flowmetry have been developed. In this study, the reproducibility of the
      retinal flowmetry measured with the LSFG-NAVI device from Nidek will be investigated. A high
      reproducibility is crucial for the clinical value of any measuring device.
