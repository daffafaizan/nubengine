      the informed consent. Women with congenital heart disease, disabling diseases, infectious
      diseases and autoimmune diseases were excluded and those whose clinical follow-up was lost
      were discarded from the final analysis.

      Weight and height were measured using a calibrated using an adult scale (Seca, Hamburg,
      Germany). Blood Pressure (BP; mmHg) was checked by auscultation using a standard
      sphygmomanometer (Riester Big Ben® Square; Jangingen, Germany). All mothers received written
      nutritional guidance depending on the characteristics of each patient.

      The expression levels of IL-10, IL-4, IFN-γ and TNF-α was performed by the ELISA technique.

      Quantitative variables will be represented by measures of central tendency. Once the
      Kolmogorov test is performed for the normality of the variables, either the Student's T test
      or the Mann Whitney U test will be used to compare both groups. With the same criteria for
      normality either Pearson or Spearmen correlation will be used among the cytokines and
      anthropometric variables, considering a significant difference at p ≤ 0.05. The statistical
      analysis will be carried out in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
      program, version 19.
