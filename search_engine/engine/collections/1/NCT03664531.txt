      characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Many IBS patients report
      symptom relief on a gluten-free diet (GFD), but it is uncertain whether gluten is the true
      culprit. The gluten-containing grains wheat, rye, and barley all contain amylase-trypsin
      inhibitors (ATIs), and a GFD is virtually ATI-free.

      This double-blinded crossover randomized controlled trial aims to determine which IBS
      patients are affected by pure gluten and which are affected by gluten combined with ATIs. IBS
      patients who respond to and have been on a GFD for 3+ weeks will be randomized to receive a
      dietary challenge of muesli bars containing either 1) pure gluten, 2) non-purified gluten
      (containing ATIs), 3) or nocebo for a week followed by a 14 day washout. This will be
      repeated until all participants have had each dietary challenge.

      The study will evaluate the effects and potential mechanisms of purified and non-purified
      gluten on intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms in IBS. It is likely that some IBS
      patients respond to gluten, while others respond to gluten combined with ATIs. Thus, this
      project may lead to better diagnosis and individualized dietary treatments for IBS.
