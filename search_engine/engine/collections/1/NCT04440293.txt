      in life.Its prevalence in the general population varies between 30-50% and is more common in
      women over 50 years old.The cervical area is an important body part due to the sensorial
      receptors of the muscles and joints as well as central and reflexes connections with visual,
      vestibular, and postural control systems.Numerous sensorimotor disorders have been detected
      in patients with chronic neck pain.Some patients with neck pain have impaired proprioceptive
      sensation and postural control.Pain can affect presynaptic inhibition of muscle afferents and
      modulation of proprioceptive muscle spindles, causing prolonged delays.These changes may
      result in decreased muscle control and increased postural release.Different updated and
      conventional therapy (CT) methods are used for the treatment of neck pain. Mobilization of
      soft tissue and joint, stabilization techniques, cervical collars, relaxation training,
      strengthening exercises, and posture arrangement by body awareness are common therapeutic
      modalities. Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT) is a method used by physiotherapists to
      increase patient awareness and control posture.The method is increasingly used in the
      treatment of painful conditions related to the chronic musculoskeletal system.However, there
      are not enough studies in the literature examining the effects of proprioceptive senses and
      postural control in patients with chronic neck pain. The aim of this study is to compare the
      effects of BBAT and conventional treatments (CT) on pain, balance and proprioceptive
      sensation of the cervical region in patients with chronic neck pain.
