    
      Study aim is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention designed to
      improve retention in HIV care services and improve anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence
      among adolescents ages 15-19 years living with HIV enrolled in ART services.

      A single group, pre/posttest design including structured questionnaires with adolescents
      living with HIV. Additionally, we will abstract clinical data from the medical record system.
      We will also conduct in-depth interviews with a subset of participants, as well as health
      care staff who are engaged in the intervention, at endline.

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To examine the feasibility of implementing a mobile/electronic health (m/eHealth)
           intervention designed to improve retention in HIV care services and ART adherence among
           ALHIV ages 15-19 years through an online support group (using Facebook).

        2. To assess acceptability of and engagement in the intervention by the target audience to
           inform improvements to the intervention.

        3. To gather preliminary data on the psycho-social and health-related outcomes that the
           intervention is designed to affect to inform an outcome evaluation study that will be
           conducted following the conclusion of the feasibility study.

        4. To collect information on recruitment, informed consent and data collection processes to
           inform the outcome evaluation study of the current intervention that will be conducted
           once findings from this feasibility study are incorporated into the intervention design.
