      pregnancies and mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT), and currently provide no services to
      support safer conception, despite ~40% of HIV+ women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) becoming
      pregnant post HIV diagnosis. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly reduces the transmission
      risks associated with childbearing, but many PLHA are either not on ART or not adequately
      adherent; hence the need for using safer conception methods (SCM) such as manual
      self-insemination and timed unprotected intercourse. This cluster RCT will compare (1) a
      comprehensive FP program that incorporates a structured, multi-component SCC intervention
      (SCC1) versus (2) an SCC training workshop for FP nurses (SCC2; mimics approach used by
      Ugandan MoH to integrate new services), and (3) existing FP services (usual care) at 6 HIV
      clinics operated by TASO Uganda. The 3-arm design, together with the planned
      cost-effectiveness analysis, allows us to examine two models for integrating SCC into FP
      services that differ on level of intensity, thereby informing MoH policy and resource
      allocation. Sixty clients in HIV serodiscordant relationships who express childbearing
      desires at recruitment will be enrolled at each site (n=360) and followed for 12 months or
      completion of pregnancy (if applicable). The primary outcome is use of either SCM (for those
      trying to conceive) or dual contraception (those who decide against pregnancy).
