    
      In a prospective protocol with retrospective information, patients (N=240) undergoing
      bariatric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (n=80), cancer subtotal or total gastrectomy (n=80) and
      right colectomy or rectosigmoidectomy (n=80) with follow-up >3 years free of disease, with or
      without previously impaired fasting blood glucose, will be recruited. Patients will be
      submitted to a questionnaire involving diet, diagnosis of diabetes and glucose-lowering
      drugs, body weight and other clinical items. Preoperative information available in the
      hospital system will be completed and current findings will be updated, including body mass
      index and biochemical measurements. Using the outcomes of the bariatric population as
      benchmark, both concerning diabetics that were ameliorated and nondiabetics that progressed
      to new-onset diabetes,results in the other groups will be compared. The study should answer
      whether gastric and colorectal surgery for cancer 1) Are beneficial for established diabetes;
      2) Attenuate the conversion of normal patients to diabetes, both within a follow-up period of
      3- 12 years;
