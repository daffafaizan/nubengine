    
      The aim of this study is to determine if paclitaxel given together with ramucirumab
      (IMC-1211B) as second line therapy will prolong overall survival (OS) compared to paclitaxel
      alone.

      Approximately 663 participants (at least 18 years) in approximately 200 study centers and in
      approximately 30 countries will be randomized with histologically or cytologically confirmed
      metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Participants must have
      received at least one cycle of first line therapy with any platinum/fluoropyrimidine doublet
      with or without anthracycline (epirubicin or doxorubicin) and must have discontinued this
      therapy prior to study entry due to disease progression.

      Upon registration and completion of screening procedure and reviewing the Inclusion and
      Exclusion Criteria eligible participants will be randomized to receive either paclitaxel plus
      ramucirumab or paclitaxel plus placebo.

      Ramucirumab (IMC-1211B) DP/placebo will be administered IV on Days 1 and 15, paclitaxel will
      be administered IV on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 4 weekly cycle.

      Participants will be continuously treated and monitored until radiographic or symptomatic
      progression of disease, toxicity requiring cessation, protocol noncompliance, or withdrawal
      of consent.
