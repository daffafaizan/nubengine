      and depressive symptoms are common, occurring in one-fifth of these patients. Depressive
      symptoms worsen knee OA disease severity and are a barrier to pain management and engagement
      in physical activity. Guidelines recommend depression treatment in older adults with knee OA
      but provide no direction on how to simultaneously manage the co-occurrence of physical and
      mental morbidity. Treatment recommendations advise exercise to manage pain and disability and
      improve psychosocial health in knee OA patients; however, compliance to exercise programs is
      low in persons with chronic pain and disability and is only made worse by comorbid
      depression. Adherence is critical to the efficacy of depression treatments using exercise
      training, and no such exercise program has ever been designed for and tested in OA patients
      with co-occurring depressive symptoms in a way to enhance compliance. Duloxetine is the only
      antidepressant medication indicated for pain management in knee OA patients that has
      demonstrated efficacy and tolerability when treating depression in older adults and is a
      viable pharmacological complement to exercise. There are no protocols that combine treatments
      using interventions that affect symptoms of both knee OA and depression, and the study goals
      are to evaluate the feasibility of and then pilot test a protocol comprised of aerobic
      exercise training plus duloxetine for the treatment of symptomatic knee OA and comorbid
      depression.
