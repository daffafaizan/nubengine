    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate (comparing the cetuximab/ARQ 197 [tivantinib] combination with cetuximab
      single agent activity).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Continuous tumor shrinkage. II. Progression-free survival (PFS). III. Overall survival
      (OS). IV. Objectives I, II, and III above, as well as response rates, will be assessed and
      compared between treatment arms in the subgroup of patients with high mesenchymal epithelial
      transition factor (c-MET) expression, and/or high c-MET copy number.

      V. Single agent activity for ARQ 197 (tivantinib) in patients who have failed cetuximab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1 and 15 and
      tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients who fail
      cetuximab as a single agent may receive single agent tivantinib PO BID on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
