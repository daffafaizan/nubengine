    
      Purpose:

      Thus the aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors of co-existence of cervical
      elongation in uterine prolapse.

      Patients and Methods:

      Between January 1994 and October 2014, all women underwent vaginal total hysterectomy in a
      medical center were enrolled in this study. Medical records were reviewed. Cervical
      elongation is defined as the presence of cervical length >3.38 cm or cervix to corpus ratio
      >0.79.

      Expected Results:

      The investigators will get the risk factors of co-existence of cervical elongation in uterine
      prolapse, and the result should be helpful for preoperative consultation, especially for
      uterine-preserving pelvic floor reconstruction surgery.
