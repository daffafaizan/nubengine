      results from multiple etiological factors, obstructive cholangitis is usually the main cause.
      In our clinical experience, the investigators have found few cases with obstruction of the
      common bile duct or sphincter of Oddi; to the contrary, almost half of our clinical cases
      showed sphincter of Oddi laxity (SOL). SOL results in reflux of duodenal fluid and
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection, which lead to the formation of stones in the biliary
      tract. Thus, HL tends to recur in SOL patients. For these patients, Roux-en-Y
      choledochojejunostomy(choledochojejunostomy with an anti-reflux ansa intestinalis) may be the
      most promising therapy.
