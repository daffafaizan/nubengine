      important areas in stomachï¼Œespecially in fundus.So far,physicians have no methods to observe
      stomach without no-missing areas by capsule endoscopy.

      Objective:To explore a new method to reduce the areas missed by CE.

      Methods:Subjects were prospectively enrolled.Every subjects will undergo 2 capsule
      endoscopies and 1 gastroscope.First capsule endoscopy,every subject have a better gastric
      preparation before swallowing CE and change position during the procedure.Second capsule
      endoscopy,every subject have a conventional CE. And then, every subject have a gastroscope.

      Measurements:The primary measurements included safety, gastric preparation, visualization of
      gastric mucosa and rate of lesion detection.
