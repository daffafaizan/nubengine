      cause of cancer death in women, and the main cause of death in women ages 45 to 55 years old.
      The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening mammography, with or without
      clinical breast examination, every one to two years among women aged 50 to 69 years old.

      Recent research has shown that health care delivered in industrialized nations often falls
      short of optimal, evidence based care. US adults receive only about half of recommended care.
      To address these deficiencies in care, health-care organizations are increasingly turning to
      clinical decision support systems. A clinical decision-support system is any computer program
      designed to help health-care professionals to make clinical decisions. In a sense, any
      computer system that deals with clinical data or knowledge is intended to provide decision
      support.

      Examples include manual or computer based systems that attach care reminders to the charts of
      patients needing specific preventive care services and computerized physician order entry
      systems that provide patient-specific recommendations as part of the order entry process.
      Such systems have been shown to improve prescribing practices, reduce serious medication
      errors, enhance the delivery of preventive care services, and improve adherence to
      recommended care standards.

      The aim of this study is to show the efficacy of a decision-support system as a strategy for
      improving the performance of the mammography care process and the detection of significantly
      more breast cancer.
