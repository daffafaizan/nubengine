      This new cuff accurately captures blood pressure (BP) by emulating a fitted cuff which is
      used in conjunction with a mercury sphygmomanometer, the accepted gold standard for measuring
      BP values in most clinical facilities. The cuff is driven by a motor and gearhead to
      automatically "wrap" the cuff around a user's arm when they initiate a BP test. A BP
      measurement is then taken by an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) BP module using an
      algorithm developed for use with a fitted cuff; the same module one would expect to find in a
      clinic or doctor's office. For the device to pass the AAMI_ISO 81060-2:2010 standard
      statistical requirements and thus, be considered a valid device for measuring BP it will need
      to meet the standards criteria 1 and 2.
