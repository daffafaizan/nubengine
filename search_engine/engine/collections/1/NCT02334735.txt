    
      This is a Phase II open label, randomized two-arm study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and immunogenicity of Poly-ICLC matured DCs as an adjuvant for NY-ESO-1 and Melan-A/MART-1
      peptides (ARM A; DC Vaccine) compared to MontanideÂ® ISA-51 VG (ARM B; Montanide Vaccine),
      both with systemic administration of Poly-ICLC on days 1 and 2 in study subjects with
      melanoma in complete clinical remission but at high-risk for disease recurrence.
