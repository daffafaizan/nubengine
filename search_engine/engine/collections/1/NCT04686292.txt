      tests, since treatment of acute infections should be initiated within a few hours to avoid
      serious complications such as bacteremia, sepsis, organ failure, septic shock and death.

      The diagnosis of urinary tract infections including acute pyelonephritis (APN) is difficult
      due to often weak and non-specific symptoms and high incidence of asymptomatic bacteruria in
      especially elderly patients. The diagnosis is verified by significant bacteriuria in urine
      culture.

      Unfortunately, the time from urine sample to result from urine cultures is more than 24 hours
      days. Urine test strips are unreliable with low specificity and low predictive values.
      Therefore, a point-of-care (POC) test is desired, which can provide rapid results and quickly
      identify a bacteriuria. One such tool may be urine flow cytometry (UFC), which has shown
      promising diagnostic value for the exclusion of bacteriuria with a high negative predictive
      value. However, better documentation for its use as an ED diagnostic screening method is
      needed.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of POC-UFC on diagnosing and
      excluding bacteriuria? Our hypothesis is that by excluding patients not having bacteriuria,
      it will contribute to a more rapid and accurate diagnosis
