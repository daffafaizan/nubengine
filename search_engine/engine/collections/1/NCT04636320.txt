      myocardial injuries in the acute stage of COVID-19 infection. These findings have raised
      concerns regarding potential long term consequences of the pandemic on cardiovascular
      diseases (heart failure and sudden cardiac deaths due to scar-related arrhythmias). However,
      the prevalence of silent myocardial injuries in the general population who presented a
      COVID-19 infection managed without hospitalization are unknown. In addition, the propensity
      of these scars to generate arrhythmias have not been thoroughly studied. COVID CMR will
      include 120 patients with history of laboratory-proven symptomatic COVID-19 infection managed
      without hospitalization and 120 age- and sex-matched controls. At day 1, all subjects will
      undergo a 12-lead electrocardiogram, a contrast-enhanced CMR study including advanced methods
      to detect silent myocardial scars, and a blood sample to look for markers of inflammation and
      cardiac injury, and to assess the COVID-19 serological status at the time of the CMR study.
      The prevalence of myocardial scars on CMR will be compared between the 2 groups. In a second
      visit at 3 months, patients showing myocardial scar on CMR will be matched to healthy
      volunteers showing no such scars, and these 2 population subsets will undergo exercise
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and 24 hour Holter ECG to characterize the arrhythmogenic role of
      silent myocardial scars.
