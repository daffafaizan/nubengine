      Dehydroepiandrosterone (7-Keto DHEA) on decreasing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms
      (PTSD) in a Veteran population. The study proposes, based on a 2006 report, that the use of
      the drug will show significant reduction in overall PTSD symptoms, a decrease in
      physiological stress response and higher patient-reported quality of life compared to
      placebo. This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a placebo
      control. The sponsor for this study is Humanetics Corporation
