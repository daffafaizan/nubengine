      hours per day and the duration of the 5th study day is approximately 8 hours. On each of the
      first 4 study days the effect a casein protein meal with or without leucine and carbohydrates
      will be examined. On the fifth study day the effect of 4 different levels of casein protein
      and carbohydrate intake by sip feeding (every 20 minutes) is examined.

      Also, subjects will receive a mixture of amino acids (little parts of protein) which are a
      little bit heavier than normal, called stable isotopes. This is the so-called stable isotope
      method to investigate protein behavior in the body (protein kinetics). Altogether about 75 ml
      of blood will be drawn per study day to assess outcome measures.
