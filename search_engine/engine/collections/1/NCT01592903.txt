      between the perimetry and the endometrium.

      The investigators try to identify, locate and characterize the myometrial stem cell
      population in the uterine fibroids by isolation of "Side Population" by flow cytometry. Once
      the investigators achieve the purposes to set out, the investigators would try to maintain
      "in vitro" stem cell population isolated from myometrial fibroids, for further endocrine
      characterization. Finally, the investigators would try to induce the formation of fibroids in
      murine models as a first step to demonstrate that the origin of these formations is due to
      the abnormal proliferation of myometrial adult stem cells. The results of this study will
      allow the identification of the cell population in the fibroids. The investigators also can
      being able to compare with the myometrium in order to establish a relationship that helps us
      to understand more about the pathophysiology of this disease, using these stem cells as
      targets therapy in the treatment of this myometrium condition.
