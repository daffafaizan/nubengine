      importance for the beneficial adaptations imposed by exercise training. Skeletal muscle
      exhibits remarkable plasticity to exercise training, as illustrated by pronounced alterations
      to the proteomic landscape, such as mitochondrial biogenesis. However, despite recent
      advances that have helped describe the proteomic landscape in response to a period of
      exercise training, our understanding of the processes pertaining to post-translation
      modification is scant. In this study, we aim to investigate the human acetylome and proteome
      in response to exercise training.
