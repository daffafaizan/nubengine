      radiotherapy to a total dose of 78Gy using gated IMRT, delivered in single daily fractions
      that can be administered concurrently with Taxol® and carboplatin chemotherapy. Secondary
      objectives include: to evaluate the toxicity of concurrent Taxol® and carboplatin with gated
      IMRT; identify partial organ tolerance doses for lung and esophagus when treating with
      involved field thoracic 3D; estimate complete response rate as defined by PET performed 3
      months after completion of all therapy.
