      PI and his collaborators will give standardized education (BFA training) to the veterans in a
      group session to teach them how to self-administer the BFA. The BFA training will be
      identical to that used by the VA for providers except that the training will focus on
      self-administration. The participants will be given needles in a manner similar to a
      prescription medication (i.e. controlled by the provider). They will self-administer BFA
      every two weeks for a total of 6 months and record their response in a standardized BFA
      template. Providers will call participants at intervals of two to four weeks to retrieve this
      data and assess for any adverse events other than minor bleeding, scratches and dizziness.

      A plastic, custom-molded prosthesis will be developed during the first several months using
      3D-scanning and 3D-printing. This prosthesis will be wearable over the ear and will have
      holes directly over the relevant acupuncture points to facilitate insertion. At the 3-month
      mark, participants will be given these. If this turns out to not be feasible with the
      available resources, work on this will cease for the remainder of the project. At the end of
      the study, participants will be asked whether the prosthesis made a significant difference in
      the ease of administration and open-ended comments regarding their experience will also be
      solicited.
