      mainly based on histological data are insufficient to identify patients with high risk of
      recidive. In addition, current immunotherapies using PD-1 and/or CTLA-4 antibodies have
      long-lasting tumor control in a substantial fraction of patients but identify new markers of
      treatment resistance need further investigations. Clinical data highlight enzymes involved in
      amino acid catabolism as new potential prognostic markers in human melanoma. Among those, the
      IL4I1 phenylalanine oxidase may be a new relevant marker and may represent an easily
      targetable molecule for cancer immunotherapy.

      The current retrospective study is designed to evaluate whether a high proportion of IL4I1
      positive cells within the primary tumor and/or sentinel lymph nodes allows to predict the
      risk of cancer recurrence from the clinical diagnosis. Immunofluorescence and
      immunohistochemistry will be performed.

      The longitudinal study of IL4I1 positive cells in the blood and cutaneous metastasis od
      patients will start before and after (three months and 1 year (or before in case of treatment
      resistance) the treatment with targeted therapy and/or immunotherapy as a first line.
      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or commercial
      cancer directed agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered.

      It is designed to evaluate whether patients that resist to treatments exhibit a high
      proportion of IL4I1 positive cells and how is regulated the enzyme in the course of the
      treatment.
