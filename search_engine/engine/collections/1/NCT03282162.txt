      a randomized-order a total of 40 healthy male subjects will receive oxytocin- and
      placebo-nasalspray (interval between the administration > 2 weeks). 45 minutes after
      treatment subjects will be administered the touch-stimulation to the dorsal forearm by a
      trained experimenter (lengths: 8cm, rate 8cm/s). After each block of stimulation, the
      subjects will be asked to rate their subjective experience of the touch.The neural basis of
      touch processing will be measured via simultaneously acquired fMRI.

      Levels of trait autism will be assessed using the Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ) and related
      scales such as the Empathy Quotient (EQ), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), or the
      Sensory over Responsivity Scale (SOR) and Under Responsively Scale (URS).
