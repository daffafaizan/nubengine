      approved by institutional ethical committee and Spanish Agency of medicines and medical
      devices (AEMPS).

      The aim of the study is to evaluate superiority of Del Nido cardioplegia solution compared to
      cold blood cardioplegia solution in terms of myocardial protection and clinical-related
      outcomes.

      According to results in recent meta-analysis, the author estimated a total sample size of 474
      participants to give 80 % of power at the 5% significant level.

      Participants aged 18 years or older undergoing elective cardiac surgery are randomized 1:1 to
      receive Del Nido cardioplegia solution (study group) and cold blood cardioplegia solution
      (control group).

      Primary outcome will be assessed by biochemical variables of myocardial injury (troponin T
      level at inmediate post-op, 3-12 hours, 12-24 hours, 24-48 hours post-op); and clinical
      variables: "Presence of acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours after surgery",
      "Prolonged low cardiac output", "Prolonged postoperative vasoplegia" within 48 hours after
      surgery and/or "Ventricular tachyarrythmias" within 24 hours after surgery.

      Secondary outcomes include intraoperative variables of myocardial protection (incidence of
      ventricular fibrillation, inotropic and vasopressor support at the end of surgical
      intervention, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic cross-clamp time) and postoperative
      clinical outcomes variables (mechanical ventilation time, incidence of delirium, stroke,
      acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, length of stay in intensive care unit, length of
      stay in hospital and In-hospital mortality).
