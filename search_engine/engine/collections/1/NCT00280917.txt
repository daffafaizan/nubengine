    
      This will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled,
      dose-finding study in which patients with active RA despite receiving methotrexate for at
      least 6 months (at unchanged doses for >=2 months) will be randomized to the addition of
      either CF101 0.1 mg, CF101 1 mg, CF101 4 mg, or placebo given orally q12h for 12 weeks.
      Screening examinations will occur within 1 month prior to dosing. Washout of other
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (with the exception of hydroxychloroquine),
      including biological agents, will occur prior to dosing; if washout is necessary, patients
      must re-qualify for inclusion following the washout. Doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDS) and corticosteroids must be stable for >=1 month prior to dosing and remain so
      during protocol participation. Disease activity will be assessed using swollen and tender
      joint counts, duration of morning stiffness, physician and patient global assessments (by
      visual analog scale, VAS), patient reported pain (by VAS), a Health Assessment Questionnaire
      (HAQ) Disability Index (DI), Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, Screening, Weeks
      0 and12), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Assessments will take place at Screening,
      Baseline (Week 0), and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 14.
