    
      Observational, cross-sectional study on 30 patients with STEMI treated with thrombectomy and
      PCI with stent implantation. Composition and characteristics of the coronary thrombi with
      respect to cell types, genetic expression and presence of specific markers of inflammation,
      platelet activity, endothelial activation, coagulation and fibrinolysis will be investigated
      in relation to the levels of these markers in the general circulation, and specifically
      related to the time axis from symptom to PCI, as well as to the degree of myocardial
      necrosis.

      Intracoronary thrombus will be retrieved by standard aspiration catheter, washed with saline
      and stored on formalin as advised by the Department of pathology, OUS Ullevål. A specific
      protocol for morphological and immunohistochemical methods is prepared and has been shown
      suitable in a pilot study on 5 patients. Assessment of coronary TIMI flow and peripheral
      blush grade after thrombus aspiration and PCI will be done. At the same time, peripheral
      venous blood will be drawn, processed and stored at -80˚C for later analyses. Demographic
      variables will be recorded.
