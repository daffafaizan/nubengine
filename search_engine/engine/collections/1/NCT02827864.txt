      combination with MT in patients with subacute and chronic stroke. Patients with subacute and
      chronic stroke will be recruited and randomized into one of the 3 groups: sequentially apply
      tDCS and MT group (SEQ), apply tDCS concurrently with MT group (CON), and MT with sham tDCS
      group (SHAM). All participants will receive 40 minutes of MT followed by 30 minutes of
      functional task training. For the participants in the SEQ group, 20 minutes of tDCS will be
      applied prior to MT, while tDCS will be applied concurrently with MT for the first 20 minutes
      in the CON group. As for the SHAM group, tDCS electrodes will be placed on the scalp without
      actual current output. The interventions will be carried out 90 minutes per day, 5 days per
      week, for 4 weeks. Behavioral outcomes will be assessed by blinded evaluators before, after,
      and 3 months post intervention. To study the possible interaction of treatment group and time
      of outcome evaluations, group (SEQ vs. CON vs. SHAM groups) × time (pretest vs. posttest vs.
      follow-up) repeated measures ANOVA will be performed. Additionally, the partial eta square
      (η2) will be calculated to determine the effect size of interest.
