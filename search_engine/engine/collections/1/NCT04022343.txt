      I. To assess the objective response rate (complete and partial responses), following the
      administration of cabozantinib for 12 weeks in patients with locally advanced biopsy-proven
      non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) prior to undergoing surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, and tolerability of neoadjuvant cabozantinib.

      II. To determine the clinical outcome (disease-free survival [DFS], overall survival [OS]) of
      patients with non-metastatic ccRCC who treated with neoadjuvant cabozantinib.

      III. To evaluate the surgery related outcomes.

      IV. To evaluate correlative studies, including biomarkers, quality of life, and
      frailty/sarcopenia assessment of patients with non-metastatic ccRCC who treated with
      neoadjuvant cabozantinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
