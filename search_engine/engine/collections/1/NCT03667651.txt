      ceramide dominant emollient reduces the risk of eczema and food allergy, when compared to
      standard skin management. Secondary objectives are to determine if twice daily application of
      a ceramide dominant emollient reduces the risk of infants developing allergic sensitisation
      (as measured by skin prick test); to determine if twice daily application of a ceramide
      dominant emollient improves infant skin barrier function; to determine the level of parental
      compliance with a program to build infant skin barrier function; to confirm that a ceramide
      dominant emollient does not cause adverse effects in infants; to determine the level of
      compliance required to demonstrate an improvement in infant skin barrier function and to
      determine if twice daily application of a ceramide dominant emollient influences infant skin
      microbial colonisation, or skin lipid profile.

      This is a phase III, single blind (outcome assessor is blinded), randomised controlled
      multicentre trial of the effect of EpiCeram emollient for improving and maintaining skin
      barrier function and reducing incidence of eczema and food allergy in high risk infants.

      A total of 760 participants with a first degree family history of allergic disease (asthma,
      eczema, allergic rhinitis or food allergy) will be recruited (380 each group) from maternity
      wards of three hospitals.

      Treatment will be from birth until six months, with a six week, six month and twelve month
      follow-up. An initial assessment will be performed at baseline which incorporates three
      surveys, a skin assessment, diary card (which is to be completed weekly and measures
      compliance), a breast milk sample, guthrie card and tape stripping. The six week and six
      month assessments entail a skin assessment, survey, compliance check, breast milk sample,
      tape stripping and guthrie card. Primary outcomes are assessed at the 12 month follow up
      where in addition to the aforementioned items, a saliva sample will also be taken and skin
      prick testing and food challenges will be performed when children have a positive SPT to one
      or more foods..
