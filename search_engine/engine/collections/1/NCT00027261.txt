      including ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452), have been similar to those observed in healthy adults who have
      received other licensed vaccines of similar types. In a previous trial, even high doses of
      recombinant ALVAC vaccine were well tolerated in a group of participants that were
      significantly immunocompromised. In a recent study done in mice concerning dose escalation
      using the ALVAC-HIV vectors, the data demonstrated more robust immune responses with higher
      doses of ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) in mice. It is certainly possible that the doses of ALVAC-HIV
      given to humans are well below the amount needed for a maximal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
      response. As the predictive value of a CTL response is at present unknown with respect to its
      efficacy in preventing or ameliorating HIV acquisition or infection, the HVTN will utilize
      the highest dose that can be currently manufactured.

      All study products are to be administered intramuscularly. Participants will receive 1 of 3
      injections. Group A will receive a high dose of vaccine, group B will receive a low dose of
      vaccine, and group C will receive a placebo. Participants are inoculated at 4 time points.
      Assessment of product safety includes clinical observation, monitoring of hematological,
      chemical, and immunologic parameters, and a social harms questionnaire. Safety will be
      evaluated by monitoring of participants for local and systemic adverse reactions during the
      course of the trial. Participants will be monitored longitudinally for HIV-specific serologic
      and cellular immune responses.
