      effects of melatonin on cardiac autonomic activity in melatonin non-proficient
      pinealectomized patients. The study consists of a screening period, followed by a 3-month
      melatonin treatment period, and a 6-month washout follow-up period. Adverse events were
      monitored with respect to seriousness, intensity, relationship to treatment, action taken and
      outcome of the event.
