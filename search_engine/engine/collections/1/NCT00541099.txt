      Primary

        -  To determine the proportion of elderly (â‰¥ 75 years of age) patients with stage III or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer surviving for at least 6 months when treated with a
           combination of bevacizumab and weekly docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and docetaxel IV on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment may repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
