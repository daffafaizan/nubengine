      support in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the
      toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival and time to
      tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes and
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily on days 2-12 or
      until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 2 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
