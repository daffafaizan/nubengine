      30 Patients will undergo 2 FMT's from a lean donor and will be randomized into 3 types of
      diet groups:

        1. low fat high fiber diet (20% fat)

        2. no change in fat intake (sham diet)

        3. high fat low fiber diet (40-45% fat)

      The treating physicians and the patients will be blinded for the diet arm. Before and after
      FMT, patients will be assessed after an overnight fast (and before taking medications) for
      weight, anthropometric measures, questionnaires (dietary, general health, antibiotic and
      probiotic exposure, oral diabetes medication quantity, and other drug exposure), blood and
      stool.

      The investigators hypothesize that fecal microbial transplantation from a lean donor to T2DM
      obese patients, with the combination of low fat high fiber diet, will alter the gut
      microbiota composition to decrease insulin resistance through microbiota dependent metabolic
      and immunologic effects.
