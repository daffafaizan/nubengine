      evolved significantly during the last decades. Resection is done by open and laparoscopic
      approach. Laparoscopic approach is not available in many sites worldwide. radical resection
      with restoration of continuity is performed by different approaches. The circular staplers
      have favored the development of colo-rectal anastomoses with reduction in anastomotic
      leakage.

      Aim of the work: To evaluate the outcomes of open side to end (antegrade) colorectal single
      stapling anastomosis versus open end to end (retrograde) Trans-anal colorectal stapling
      anastomosis in non-emergent sigmoid and rectal open cancer surgery in adults including the
      incidence of anastomotic leak, functional outcomes, quality of life, intraoperative and
      postoperative morbidity and mortality.

      Patients and Methods: randomized controlled trial was performed on patients having undergone
      sigmoid and rectal cancers between September 2013 and September 2018. Patients with antegrade
      anastomoses were compared with those patients underwent retrograde stapling anastomosis.
      Complications (surgical and medical) were investigated using logistic regression.
