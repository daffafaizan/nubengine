      thawed umbilical cord blood unit, co-infused following a myeloablative conditioning regimen.

      Activated T cells are T cells that have been activated in the laboratory by exposure to 2
      compounds or molecules called CD3 and CD28; when T cells are exposed to both of these
      compounds at the same time, they become activated or "stimulated" and may be more effective
      in fighting infections, cancer cells, and promoting the recovery of red cells, white cells,
      and platelets after transplantation. At the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,
      activated T cells are prepared at the Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility, also
      known as the CVPF.
