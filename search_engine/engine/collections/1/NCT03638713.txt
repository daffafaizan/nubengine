      commonly performed to evaluate for gastrointestinal conditions, such as active
      gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, positive fecal occult blood tests and
      abdominal pain. EGD-colonoscopy sequence seems to be the reasonable choice for BDE using air
      or CO2. With the use of water exchange method, endoscopists have to remove the dirty fecal
      material and air bubble during insertion. Gas insufflated during EGD may get into the colon
      and make subsequent water exchange colonoscopy more difficult. The aim of this prospective
      randomized controlled trial is to compare evaluate the optimal procedure sequence among
      patients undergoing water exchange colonoscopy.
