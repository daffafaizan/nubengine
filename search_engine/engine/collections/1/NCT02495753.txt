      1.3 million are performed each year. Postoperative infectious morbidity is the most common
      complication of cesarean delivery. Post-cesarean infectious morbidity is often the result of
      indigenous vaginal flora that ascend into the uterus at the time of surgery. Thus, reducing
      vaginal microbial load may reduce post-cesarean infection. However, results from studies
      assessing the role of vaginal cleansing prior to cesarean have been mixed.

      The investigators will perform a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis
      that vaginal cleansing with povidone-iodine solution immediately prior to cesarean delivery
      reduces postcesarean infectious morbidity.
