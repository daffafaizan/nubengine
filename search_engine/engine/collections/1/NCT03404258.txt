    
      Overall Hypothesis: Endothelin-1 (ET1) and associated dysregulation of key metabolic pathways
      decrease pre-operative pulmonary blood vessel development and increase post-operative
      pulmonary blood vessel resistance leading to decreased pulmonary blood flow in patients
      undergoing SCPA.

      For enrolled patients, collected data will include:

        -  3 mL blood sample (x2) at pre-SCPA catheterization.

        -  3 mL blood samples at 2, 24, and 48 hours post-operative.

        -  Urine sample pre-operatively and post-operatively

        -  Collection of otherwise-discarded operative tissue sample from the pulmonary artery.

        -  Collection of clinical data, demographic data, and results of routine, post-operative
           hemodynamic monitoring.
