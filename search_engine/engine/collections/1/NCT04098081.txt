      and effectiveness of galeterone, an investigational drug, in pancreatic cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved galeterone for pancreatic
      cancer. Galeterone is an androgen receptor inhibitor that showed anti-cancer activity in
      pancreatic cancer in research lab. In this study, the investigator is interested in
      evaluating galeterone alone or in combination with chemotherapy in treating pancreatic
      cancer.
