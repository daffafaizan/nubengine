      research about clinical characteristics, treatment, management and prognosis of Chinese
      children with PID is still not perfect and there is no basic and large database. Therefore,
      this study is conducted, in order to set up a complete database and long term follow up of
      Chinese children with PID, and establish foundations for basic research and precise medicine.

      This study is divided into two parts. In part one, pediatric patients with PID in the past 10
      years will be collected retrospectively by review medical records from these centers, and
      investigate the clinical features and prognosis. In part two, all new cases with suspected
      PID will be collected. Clinical symptoms, physical examination, blood tests, and humoral and
      cellular immune functions will be detected. Gene tests would be done when necessary to
      confirm the diagnosis. Then follow up at 6-moth, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year
      respectively. The trial will be completed in 60 months.
