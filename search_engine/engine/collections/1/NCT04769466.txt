      acceptability, and efficacy of LifeBio Memory's effectiveness as a solution for improving
      quality of life and quality of care for older adults in long-term care settings, as well as
      relationships with staff caregivers. This project will implement the the newly developed
      LifeBio Memory platform and train caregivers in X sites across the state of Ohio, with X
      residents and X staff participating in a feasibility trial. The program will be evaluated
      using three waves of data collection from staff during training and throughout
      implementation, as well as pre-post resident data to evaluate the effectiveness of the new
      intervention.

      The LifeBio Memory platform addresses the need for an intuitive, artificial
      intelligence-driven solution to the traditionally labor-intensive process of collecting,
      sharing, and celebrating the life stories of older adults, as well as the development of
      tools for staff caregivers to enhance person-centered care practices and care-planning. It
      has great potential for improving psychosocial outcomes for participants, enhancing
      relationships between care staff and residents, and a cost-effective way to identify ways in
      which life stories can be used to provide a foundation for preference-based, personalized
      care.

      Residents will be interviewed at baseline, then again at follow-up (4 weeks later), staff
      members being trained to utilize the LifeBio Memory application and provide feedback on the
      materials, as well as completed a survey at baseline, again at follow-up
