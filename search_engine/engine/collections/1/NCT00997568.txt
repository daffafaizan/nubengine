      Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems for the visualization of the heart (and other organs) as a
      real-time ultrasound image. It is inserted into the esophagus through the mouth to visualize
      a plane of the heart through the esophageal wall.

      The objective of the study is to demonstrate the safe use of the redesigned Toshibal TEE
      transducer for ease of passage and during transitioning into and down the esophagus to
      complete a normal TEE study.
