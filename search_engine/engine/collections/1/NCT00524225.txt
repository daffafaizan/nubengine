    
      This study is a prospective, single-center Phase II trial of Neumega (rhIL-11) in adults with
      type 1 VWD undergoing elective surgery or major dental procedure. It is anticipated that 10
      subjects who meet eligibility criteria will enroll and complete the study. The specific
      objectives are to determine the efficacy and safety or rhIL-11 during and after elective
      surgery, and to determine the mechanism of the hemostatic response of rhIL-11.
