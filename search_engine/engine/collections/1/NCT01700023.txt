      tape there is no standardized tool to quantify leg-edema. Consequently, in patents with heart
      failure early detection of leg-edema is quite difficult.

      From earlier pacemaker-studies it has been shown that an increase of afterload changes
      ECG-signals. Currently it is unknown how simple diagnostic procedures such as measuring
      blood-pressure affect QRS-morphology in patients with heart failure.
