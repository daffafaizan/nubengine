      infections with rapid onset and brief duration in adults. This is a randomized, open-label,
      parallel group, multicenter study to determine the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin
      (500 mg tablets once daily by mouth for 10 - 14 days) compared with amoxicillin/clavulanate
      (500 mg/125 mg tablets by mouth every 8 hours for 10 - 14 days) in adults with rapid onset of
      severe inflammation/infection of the sinuses. The study consists of 4 visits: one visit for
      screening and enrollment, and three visits to assess the safety and effectiveness of
      treatment (one telephone contact during Days 3 - 6 of the study [if no significant
      improvement in symptoms has occurred by that time, a visit is scheduled]; one visit
      [post-therapy] 2 - 5 days after the last dose of the study drug; and one visit [post-study]
      28 - 32 days after the last dose of the study drug). The total duration of patient
      participation in the study is approximately 6 weeks. The primary measure of effectiveness is
      assessed by the clinical response rate after the completion of treatment (a reduction in the
      signs and symptoms, and by stabilization or improvement in x-ray findings). Safety
      evaluations (incidence of adverse events, physical examination, and laboratory tests) are
      performed throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that treatment with levofloxacin is
      at least as effective and as well tolerated as treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate
      potassium in adults with rapid onset of severe inflammation/infection of the sinuses. 500 mg
      tablets of levofloxacin by mouth once daily, or 500 mg/125 mg amoxicillin/clavulanate tablets
      by mouth every 8 hours. The duration of treatment is 10 - 14 days.
