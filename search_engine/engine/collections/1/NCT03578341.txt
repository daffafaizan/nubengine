      system. Breast milk (colostrum) contains bioactive components that provide antimicrobial,
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory functions. These bioactive components
      are in higher concentrations in mothers' colostrum of premature babies. Because of the
      morbidities presented by premature infants, they remain fasting and lack the potential
      benefit provided by colostrum. When the colostrum is placed in the oropharyngeal mucosa, the
      immunocompetent cells stimulate the immune system, increasing the serum concentrations of
      immunoglobulins.

      Objectives: To determine the efficacy of early administration of colostrum in the
      oropharyngeal mucosa in preterm infants less than 32 weeks of gestation and its effect on the
      immune system by quantifying immunoglobulins in preterm infants born at the National
      Institute of Perinatology. .

      Methods / Design: 1 year, double blind randomized controlled clinical trial. The newborns
      included will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups: Group 1:, newborns receiving
      colostrum 0.3 mL every 4 hours in the oropharyngeal mucosa, for 3 days.

      Newborns from Block B will receive orally sterile water (placebo) 0.3 mL following the same
      protocol. Serum immunoglobulin A, M and G concentrations will be determined before the start
      of the study on day 0 of life and after 7 and 28 days of life. They will continue in time
      until 36 SDG or at discharge, whichever comes first.
