      risk of infection and death from COVID-19. There is a lack of evidence whether SARS-CoV-2
      vaccination is effective in this immunocompromised group.

      Study design: this is a prospective cohort study. Two cohorts will be included: dialysis
      patients and controls (medical staff), both vaccinated with Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V)
      vaccine.

      Blood samples will be collected at 28 days and 22 weeks after after the second SARS-CoV-2
      vaccine dose administration.

      The primary outcome is the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies on day 28 after the second
      vaccination as compared to controls.

      The secondary outcomes are: 1) the level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies on week 22 after the
      second vaccination; 2) T cell subtype immunity measured by SARS-CoV-2 interferon-Î³ release
      assays (IGRA) 28 days and 22 weeks after the second vaccination.
