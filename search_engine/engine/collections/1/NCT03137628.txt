      such as gene sequencing，nuclear magnetic resonance， mass spectrometry and so on. As a newly
      developed subject, metabolomics can detect accurately and quantitatively small molecule
      metabolites such as proteins, carbohydrates and lipids from plasma, tissue and even single
      cell, which aims to analyze systemic dynamic change during physiological and pathological
      processes, and thus reveals certain reactions that whole organism responds to specific
      stimulation.

      Colorectal cancer is one of common gastrointestinal tumors, whose morbidity rate tends to
      increase in recent years for modern diet and life style, and colectomy serves as one standard
      treatment for it. Under total stimulation of surgical operation, general anesthesia and
      mechanical ventilation, a series of stress reactions happen complicatedly to colorectal
      patients during anesthesia-ventilation process. Without timely recognition and management of
      adverse reactions, side effects like hypoxemia, hemorrhage, inflammation, and even death will
      happen intraoperatively or postoperatively.

      With different metabolomics methods applied to collect, detect and analyze blood samples,
      metabolomics provides an innovatory approach to elucidate systemic response during
      anesthesia-colectomy process with multi-factors included. By analyzing and comparing dramatic
      alteration of small molecule metabolites in colorectal cancer patients' or healthy controls'
      plasma in this project, data can reflect the influence of certain disease (colorectal
      cancer), anesthetics and mechanical ventilation on colorectal patients with colectomy, which
      is helpful for prevention and treatment of intraoperative and postoperative complications.
