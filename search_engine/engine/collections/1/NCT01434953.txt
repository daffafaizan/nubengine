      increases in resting blood pressure, and there is preliminary evidence of a cross-sectional
      association between hypertension labeling and the white coat effect. The white coat effect
      may be particularly problematic in prehypertensives, because a small elevation in clinic
      blood pressure could result in crossing the diagnostic cutoff for hypertension, potentially
      leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. This study will examine effects of
      prehypertension labeling on clinic and ambulatory blood pressure, and will examine potential
      psychological mediators of these associations.
