      neuroimaging measures in healthy individuals (N=40, 20 male, 20 female). The objective of
      this research is to develop an understanding of factors that may influence individual
      variability on resting state functional connectivity in response to low-dose opioid
      administration with the longer term aim of understanding addictions vulnerability.
      Specifically, the proposed pilot research will explore the effects of single dose of
      oxycodone (15mg) on resting state functional connectivity and other common neuroimaging
      measures (e.g., diffusion MRI, structural MRI).
