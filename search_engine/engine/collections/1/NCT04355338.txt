      Brazil. The study sample is stratified in nine age groups according decades of life, equally
      distributed in both sexes, with an expected incidence of 10%, at least, during the study
      period of 24 months. For the first age groups, (0-9, 10-19 and 20-29 years), sample was
      calculated with the minimum expected incidence of COVID-19 among infected, regardless
      severity, is 10%. For the latest age groups (30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80+), the
      sample was calculated with the expected minimum incidence of hospitalization due to COVID-19
      according to estimates per age group reported by Verity R et al.

      will have a short interview, a IgG/IgM SARS-CoV-2 rapid test and a blood withdrawal to obtain
      serum for neutralizing antibodies. These procedures will be repeated every four weeks until
      the end of the study. Individuals with symptoms compatible will be followed-up to confirm
      COVID-19 diagnosis as well as to assess severity, need for hospitalization and assisted
      ventilation, sequels, and eventual reinfection. Levels of neutralizing antibodies and other
      immune markers will be prospectively assessed in all infected participants, either
      asymptomatic and symptomatic.
