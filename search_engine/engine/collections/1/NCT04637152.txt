      the presence of resistant hypertension (RH) significantly influences a high cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality compared to those with controlled SAH, thus corroborating the need
      for the development of agents antihypertensive drugs with favorable efficacy and safety
      profiles. It is known that they are currently using the combined therapy recommended for this
      group of patients, among them, a significant portion of individuals with RH are unable to
      achieve the goal of BP control (>140/90 mmHg) even though in regular use, being subject to
      the greatest risk of cardiovascular outcomes and morbidity and mortality. Approved by the FDA
      for use in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with beneficial effects on morbidity
      and mortality, identified in previous studies, the sacubitril/valsartan molecule (LCZ696) or
      EntrestoÂ® is a molecular complex composed of the sacubitril prodrug activated after ingestion
      in sacubitrilate - neprilysin inhibitor - associated with valsartan, an angiotensin II type-1
      (AT1) receptor antagonist, with vasodilating action, capable of reducing BP, sympathetic
      tone, with antifibrotic and anti-hypertrophic effects, in addition to natriuresis and
      diuresis. Considering the knowledge gap to the benefits to LCZ696 in the control of blood
      pressure in resistant hypertension, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the
      efficacy (reduction of ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure) and safety (adverse
      events, hospitalization and cardiovascular death) of the use of sacubitril/valsartan in
      comparison to the antihypertensive therapy recommended and optimized by the current
      guidelines, in patients diagnosed with RH, over12 weeks, through a randomized clinical trial.
