      requiring neuromuscular blockade. The left of right hand of the patients will be randomly
      studied. After the induction of anesthesia but before the administration of muscle relaxant
      train-of-four (TOF) stimulation will be started with 30 mA current intensity, 0.2 msec pulse
      duration at 20 sec intervals. The stimulation will be left to run until extubation. The
      TetraGraph device will be set not to show measurement results on the screen but save them on
      the SD card for later analysis. This way TetraGraph will not influence clinical decisions and
      patient care. During the operations we will record the number of muscle twitches in return to
      stimulation, the time and dose of muscle relaxant and opioid administration, the time of use
      of electrocautery and the skin temperature.
