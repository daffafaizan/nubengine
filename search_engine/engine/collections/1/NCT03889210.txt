      healthy human volunteers have demonstrated that ketone esters lower blood glucose levels in
      both fasting and fed state.

      Participants will visit the COSMOS clinic on two occasions and will be randomly allocated to
      receive either the HVMN ketone drink or placebo, in a cross-over design. Blood samples will
      be collected sequentially every 30 minutes for up to 150 minutes. Blood samples will be
      assayed for glucose and other markers of glucose metabolism.
