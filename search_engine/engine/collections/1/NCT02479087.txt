      severe Haemophilia A. The main negative clinical and cost consequence is the ineffectiveness
      of replacement therapy in patients with high-titer antibodies, who have a shorter life and
      greater morbidity than those who do not develop inhibitors. It is known from immunology that
      a regular and frequent exposure to the antigen of FVIII can induce tolerance of the immune
      system of the patient with inhibitors. This effect, called "immune tolerance induction" (ITI)
      is usually achieved after a prolonged exposure of the patient to FVIII, and is a common way
      of managing the condition of patients with inhibitors as well as the treatment of bleeding
      episodes with large amounts of hemostatic agents. In vitro and retrospective clinical studies
      suggest that FVIII/VWF complex concentrates may have less immunogenicity with respect to
      those plasma-derived concentrates purified with monoclonal antibodies (MABs), and recombinant
      DNA factor VIII concentrates (rFVIII), in both which the von Willebrand factor (VWF) is
      absent. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) showed to be effective in about 70% of Haemophiliacs
      with inhibitors. Poor prognosis factors have been identified by different registries: age â‰¥ 6
      years, ITI started >1 year from inhibitor development, inhibitor peaks >200 BU, inhibitor
      titer >10 BU at the start of ITI and previously failed ITI. The results of clinical studies
      suggest that complex concentrates of VWF/FVIII can be effective in ITI, even in patients at
      high risk of failure. To explain these findings, a role for VWF (i.e. prolonged antigen
      exposure) has been hypothesized.
