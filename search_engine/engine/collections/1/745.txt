metabolism and excretion of c14-labeled bilirubin in childrenwith biliary atresiaand judson g. randolphradioactive bilirubin was injected intravenouslyinto 3 children with biliary atresia.  the isotopeover a period of ten to fourteen days was recoveredprincipally in the urine.  sixty per cent of the labelin the urine was found to be in the form of bili-rubin.  distribution of the radioisotope was observedto be principally extravascular but not, as in otherforms of jaundice, in the same distribution as albumin.daily turnover of bilirubin was several times greaterthan the calculated normal daily production of bili-rubin.  this was assumed to be due to increasedhemoglobin breakdown, confirmed by survival studiesof cr51-tagged red cells.  the serum half-life of intra-venously administered radioactive bilirubin may haveuseful prognostic value in children with biliary atresia.
