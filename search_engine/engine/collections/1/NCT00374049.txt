      immuno-suppression: 25 μg/kg and 50 μg/kg. These doses will be administered I.M. three times
      a week for 2 weeks. Following 2 weeks of treatment with poly-ICLC alone, patients will be
      immunized subcutaneously with the 100-mer MUC-1 peptide + GM-CSF. Subjects will be boosted
      twice at two week intervals, and subsequently 3 months later, if they experience clinical
      benefit or if they have clinically stable disease. Poly-ICLC will be administered continually
      3 times a week I.M. for the first 2 weeks and 2 times a week I.M. thereafter. Subjects will
      continue on study until they have evidence of progressive disease. The primary objective of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Poly-ICLC in boosting the immunologic response of a
      MUC1 vaccine. Secondary objectives are to evaluate a) changes in markers of systemic
      immunosuppression; b) changes in dendritic cell number and function; and c) clinical
      response. Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled in this single-site study.
