      patients who exhibit donor specific antibodies (DSA) and have a positive crossmatch test to
      their available live or deceased donors. The first 3 patients in this study will receive a
      kidney from a deceased donor. The study will primarily examine the efficacy of IdeS in
      creating a negative CXM. The first 3 patients will receive one dose of 0.25 mg/kg BW IdeS on
      study day 0. If it is considered safe and negative crossmatch test is not achieved after the
      first dose, an additional IdeS infusion can be given within 2 days of the first infusion. The
      dose schedule may be increased to 0.5 mg/kg BW given once or twice after the first 3 patients
      have been tested. The decision to escalate the dose will be done after evaluation of safety
      and efficacy.
