        -  To assess the tolerability of high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell
           transplantation in patients with immunoglobulin deposition disease or light-chain
           deposition disease.

        -  To determine the hematologic response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine the predictability of early free light-chain response for heme response in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine organ or clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To determine overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Stem cell mobilization: Patients undergo blood stem cell mobilization comprising
           filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily for 3 days (i.e., through the day before
           the last stem cell collection).

        -  Stem cell collection: Patients undergo collection of G-CSF-mobilized blood stem cells
           until the target number of stem cells (at least 2 x 10^6 cluster of
           differentiation-34-positive cells) is reached.

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV on days -3 to -2.

        -  Autologous stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo blood stem cell infusion on day
           0.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months and then
      annually thereafter.
