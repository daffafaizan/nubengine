      randomized to receive two suturing patterns (simple interrupted pattern and triangular
      pattern) for endoscopic esophageal stent fixation. We will investigate rate of the stent
      migration at 3-4 weeks by endoscopy after the stent placement as part of routine clinical
      care. Data of the duration of endoscopic suturing, adverse events, details of the stent used,
      indication for use will also be collected.
