      20-day, randomized, parallel design protocol. After a 5-day period of smoking their own
      preferred brand of cigarillos, participants will begin a 15-day experimental period when they
      will be randomized to one of two conditions, 2 cigarillos per pack versus 4 cigarillos per
      pack, to examine how quantity per pack affects use patterns, including daily consumption and
      cigar smoking topography. Participants will be asked to attend 2 in-person sessions on Days 5
      and 20. On Days 0, 9, 12 and 16 participants will complete sessions with research staff
      remotely (i.e. by phone or video call). Sessions will occur every 3-5 days, for a total of 6
      sessions across 20 days.
