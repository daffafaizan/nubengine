      to sign consent form to participate in this study.

      Before having the angioplasty, all participants will be examined with ultrasound duplex to
      determent their common femoral artery volume flow. Day after the angioplasty, they will be
      reexamined (this is the usual practice) to detriment the new volume flow in the CFA.

      The participents examinations in the outpatient clinics will be documented and time for
      healing will be recorded.
