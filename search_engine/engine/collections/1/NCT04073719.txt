      stones. The study will compare apple cider vinegar, coconut water, diet citric soda and
      lemonade and determine which is superior at raising citrate levels. Research participants
      will consume two of the four drinks, each for 7 day periods, according to a prescribed
      regimen. Throughout the course of the study, participants will periodically provide blood
      draws for metabolic panels, as well as 24-hour urine samples to measure citrate levels. There
      will be 12 study arms, accounting for the permutations of two drinks for each patients out of
      four possibilities. 3 participants per arm is the goal, for a total of 36, but the
      recruitment aim is 50 participants, to account for dropout and noncompliance.
