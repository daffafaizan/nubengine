    
      Participants: From 2000 to 2005, thirty-three eyes in 33 patients with unilaterally recurrent
      corneal erosions who showed poor response to conservative managements and were treated with
      Nd:YAG laser were studied.

      Intervention: Anterior corneal stromal puncture with Nd:YAG laser was performed in the
      loosened epithelium or epithelial defect area. The causes and frequency of corneal erosions
      and the spot numbers and total energy of the Nd:YAG laser were recorded. Slit-lamp
      biomicroscopic examination, refraction, corneal topography, and times of laser were reviewed.
      A questionnaire regarding the preoperative and postoperative difference in the intensity of
      pain and frequency of corneal erosion was provided.

      Main Outcome Measures: Rate of recurrence and pain assessment by numerical rating scale.
