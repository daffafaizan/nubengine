      most common sites for the disease are the major and minor salivary glands but these tumors
      may also arise in the nasal cavity, lacrimal gland, tracheobronchial tree, breast or vulva.
      The mainstay of treatment for localized ACC is surgical resection often followed by
      post-operative radiotherapy. Although this leads to an initially high rate of local control,
      the 5-year disease-free survival rate is 50-75%. In addition, a significant proportion of the
      patients develop distant metastases, most frequently in the lung. Compared to other
      malignancies, ACC tends to grow more slowly. Thus, patients often do well in the short-term
      but long-term prognosis remains guarded and most succumb to the disease within 10-15 years.
      To date, systemic therapies have proven to be largely ineffective against recurrent and
      metastatic ACC. Dovitinib is a broad-targeted-profiled RTK inhibitor active against these
      three RTKs (VEGF, FGF and PDGF) involved in tumor cell growth. Based on its potency as an
      inhibitor of these RTKs both in vitro and in vivo, and the compound's oral availability,
      several clinical trials of dovitinib are underway. This phase II trial will test the
      hypothesis that dovitinib will be active against this disease. The rationale is based on
      pre-clinical studies that suggest that dovitinib suppresses tumor growth by blocking
      constitutive signaling of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) and animal studies
      in which the drug proved to be active against primary ACC xenografts.
