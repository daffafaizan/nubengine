      following liver resection and resulted in low surgical mortality and morbidity rates in
      high-volume centers.

      Although partial liver resections for primary or secondary hepatic malignancies are
      considered standard interventions, intraoperative blood loss remains a risk factor associated
      with major complications in liver surgery [1-3]. There are several methods for reduction of
      blood loss, including meticulous resection technique along anatomical planes, reduction of
      central venous pressure during transection of the liver parenchyma [4], and vascular
      occlusion techniques (i.e., inflow occlusion and total vascular occlusion) [5-7]. In
      addition, specific instruments were devised for liver transection, such as the ultrasonic
      dissector, water jet, and other, more recent developments (e.g., focal radiofrequency
      ablation) that allow sealing of small vessels during transection [8, 9].

      In order to control diffuse bleeding and to prevent intraperitoneal complications attributed
      to bleeding, various topical products are used when the conventional methods, such as suture,
      ligation, or argon beam coagulation, fail. Currently, there are numerous products on the
      market which are promising a successful outcome for hemostasis. These products include
      gelatin, collagen, oxidized regenerated cellulose, fibrin sealant glues, and synthetic glues.
