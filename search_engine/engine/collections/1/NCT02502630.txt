      from colorectal cancer were selected for CT-guided microwave ablation. Patients were
      scheduled for a 1 and 3 month CT follow-up to evaluate lesion diameter.We retrospectively
      evaluated CT-guided percutaneous microwave (MW) ablation safety and efficacy in pulmonary
      metastases from colorectal cancer.
