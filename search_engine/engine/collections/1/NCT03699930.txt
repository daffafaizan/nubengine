      neurological disorder affecting the ability to use and/or understand language. This
      communication impairment affects up to 40% of stroke patients. Stroke victims usually
      prioritize speaking, writing, and walking as the three most important rehabilitation goals,
      two of these goals therefore involving communication. Conventional speech therapy strategies
      have nevertheless limited effectiveness in post-stroke aphasia. Indeed, approximately half of
      those affected will remain in this state despite intensive speech therapy. Effective novel
      treatment is therefore warranted to improve recovery in these patients. Recent evidence
      suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive, low-cost
      neuromodulation technique, applied in conjunction with speech therapy may be more effective
      in promoting language recovery than behavioral intervention alone.

      A double-blind quasi-randomized controlled study will be carried out in chronic post-stroke
      aphasics. Participants will be assigned to either the tDCS group or to the sham (placebo)
      group and will receive 20 minutes of concurrent speech and language therapy by a trained
      speech therapist over five consecutive days. Behavioral, EEG, and MRI data will be acquired
      within one week before and after intervention. Genetic samples will be collected once.
      Secondary behavioral outcome measures will be performed again 3 months following tDCS/sham
      intervention to assess long-term benefits.
