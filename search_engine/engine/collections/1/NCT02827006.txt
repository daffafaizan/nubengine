      voids in opening wedge osteotomies. CaP bone cement has been considered the possible
      alternative to bone graft.

      Methods: 20 adult patients with distal radius malunions and dorsal deformities were
      randomised intra-operatively to bone graft (10) or CaP bone cement (10). Dorsal titanium
      locking plates were used and the wrist was stabilised in a cast for 8 weeks. Follow-ups for
      24 months included VAS on wrist and iliac crest, grip strength, ROM bilaterally, Quick-DASH
      and Gartland & Werley's functional scoring system. X-rays and CT scans were taken at 8 wks,
      3-6-12-24 mths.
