      voice control. Yet much of what is known about central voice motor control has come from
      research in non-human primates during production of genetically-determined vocalizations that
      do not rely upon auditory feedback. Extrapolation from studies of bat echolocation suggest
      that midbrain networks underlie automatic audiovocal error correction in humans; however,
      bats and humans differ greatly in anatomical and physiology.
