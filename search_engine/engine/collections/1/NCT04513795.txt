      increasing at the rate of 8% to 13% per year. It is possible that sepsis progress to multiple
      organ dysfunction in the early stage, with a fatality of 30% to 60%. Myocardium is one of the
      most vulnerable tissue under the abnormal 'inflammation storm'.Cardiac dysfunction is one of
      the important predictors for mortality of sepsis.Patients with myocardial depression have an
      apparently higher mortality rate (70%) as compared with septic patients without cardiac
      impairment (20%).

      Although several trials had explored the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-induced cardiac
      dysfunction, the effective characteristic depict and effective therapy remain incompletely
      understand.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, observational registry study of sepsis
      patients that undergo multi-modality imaging.
