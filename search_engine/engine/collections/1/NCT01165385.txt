    
      The main objective of the study is to determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and the
      optimal tolerated regimen (OTR) which are both safety criteria evaluated upon the NCI CTC-AE
      system version 4.0.

      Efficacy is not the primary objective; however the anti-tumor activity of the
      pazopanib/cisplatin combination will be carried out by the determination of the objective
      response rate according to RECIST criteria version 1.1.

      The objective response is defined as either a complete response (CR) or partial response
      (PR), assessed either by CT Scan and/or MRI and/or bone Scan, performed at baseline and every
      6 weeks.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation and pharmacokinetic, phase I study
      pazopanib with cisplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors (except tumors
      at risk of bleeding) for whom the selected combined chemotherapy is indicated or is a
      reasonable option (as per tumor characteristics and previous treatments).

      All eligible patients entering the study will receive daily oral pazopanib, supplied as 200
      mg aqueous film-coated tablets and intravenous cisplatin every three weeks. Doses of both
      compounds will be adjusted according to the reached dose level.

      The treatment will continue until the development of unacceptable toxicity or evidence of
      disease progression or until patient's / investigator's decision of withdrawal.

      All patients who received at least on dose of the study drug will be followed for survival
      outcome.
