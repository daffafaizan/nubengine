      increase treatment seeking among Veterans at risk for suicide and resistant to seek mental
      health care following separation from military service. A four-year mixed methods study that
      uses a sequential embedded design will be used to collect data from nationwide samples of
      Veterans at risk for suicide not in mental health treatment who separated from the DoD in the
      past year. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, individual interviews will first be
      conducted to guide the design of effective public messages that will be subsequently tested
      in a two-arm RCT to determine exposure effects among targeted audience vs. control group.
      Messages will be disseminated to study participants during the trial by a smartphone app.
      Research staff will collect assessments by telephone at baseline, 1- and 3-months
      post-randomization. Potential participants (for all study aims) will be identified using data
      available from the VA/DOD Identity Repository (VADIR) and recruited by invitational mailing
      and follow-up telephone calls. If the intervention is found effective, the investigators will
      work with the VA operational partner to include messages in future outreach approaches to
      prevent Veteran suicide and use findings to improve current communication performance
      measures.
