    
      In the 4-year Base Study (V501-015) (NCT00092534), participants were randomized in a 1:1
      order to receive 3 doses of GARDASIL™ or matching placebo at Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6 and
      were assessed for efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety.

      In the Base Study Extension (EXT) [V501-015-10], participants who received placebo or only 1
      dose of GARDASIL™ in the Base Study, were given 3 doses of open-label GARDASIL™ at EXT Day 1,
      EXT Month 2, and EXT Month 6, and were followed to EXT Month 7. Participants who who received
      2 doses of GARDASIL™ in the Base Study were given 1 dose of GARDASIL™ at EXT Day 1 and were
      followed for 15 days (day of vaccination plus 14 days).

      In the 10-year Base Study Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) [V501-015-21] the effectiveness,
      immunogenicity and safety of GARDASIL™ was assessed during a period of 10 years following
      completion of the Base Study (V501-015) [14 years after the first dose of GARDASIL™] and, for
      some measures, the Base Study EXT (V501-015-10) [10 years after the first dose of GARDASIL™].
      Participants from Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden who participated in the Base Study were
      eligible to enroll in the LTFU. Effectiveness and safety was assessed by registry-based
      follow-up, and immunogenicity was assessed by serological testing at approximately Year 5 and
      Year 10 of the V501-015-21 LTFU.

      An 8-year extension was added to the LTFU (V501-015-22] to continue the evaluation of the
      long-term effectiveness and immunogenicity of GARDASIL™. Effectiveness and safety will be
      assessed by registry-based follow-up, and immunogenicity will be assessed by serological
      testing at approximately Year 4 and Year 8 of the extension of the LTFU.
