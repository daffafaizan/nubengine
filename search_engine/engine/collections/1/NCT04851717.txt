    
      This trial is part of the European Paediatric Investigational Plan and the US Pediatric Study
      Plan and has been developed in line with guidance from the EMA Paediatric Committee and the
      US FDA.

      The trial will commence with cohort 1 (aged ≥6 and <18 years) and proceed to lower age
      groups: cohort 2 (≥3 and <6 years); and, in European sites only, cohort 3 (full-term birth to
      <3 years). The Data Monitoring committee (DMC) may convene any time after at least half of
      the subjects in cohort 1 or 2 have completed the study, to review PK,safety and efficacy
      data. If there are no concerns, the DMC may recommend to initiate concurrent dosing in the
      next younger cohort (cohort 2 or 3) in parallel to dosing the remaining subjects in cohort 1
      or 2 Dosing for cohort 3 will be predicted based on PK modelling as well as efficacy and
      safety outcomes of the older age groups. Enrolment of patients aged <2 years will not be
      permitted until supported by adequate juvenile toxicity data.

      The trial will consist of three visits: Screening (Day -21 to day 1),Treatment (Day 1), and
      Follow-up (Day 4 [+3/-1 days]).
