      would increase blood levels of alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor and consequently increase CD4
      cells. HIV-1 patients were specifically selected to receive Zemaira® therapy if they had <500
      HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, <200 CD4 cells/ul, below normal alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor, and were
      on antiretroviral therapy and in general good health.

      Patients received an I.V. infusion of Zemaira® once a week for 8 or 12 weeks and returned one
      week following the final infusion for blood collection. Each session lasted approximately 45
      minutes. Each infusion was less than 30 minutes. At the time of infusion, patients were
      admitted to the hospital and 3 tablespoons of blood was collected. Blood was used to monitor
      viral load, CD4 cell numbers and function, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL, and
      alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor levels.
