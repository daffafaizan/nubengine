      (CardioCell) therapy and sham procedure/placebo administration with 2:1 ratio.

      Additional 5-10 subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive, in a non-blinded
      fashion, labelled CardioCell to determine the early uptake and retention of IMP in the target
      ischemic tissues.

      The primary research question of this project is to check if the administration of CardioCell
      could improve the clinical outcomes in patients with AMI. There are several secondary
      questions, defined by secondary endpoints, e.g.: if the investigated treatment is possible to
      administered, if the investigated treatment is safe and way of CardioCell administration, if
      it is possible to define any selected subgroup in which the treatment results are
      significantly different than in whole group.
