    
      26 - 30 patients, between 3 -6 years old, mild asthmatics, with positive adenosine challenge
      test, will received in a randomized, double blind, cross over assignment Beclometasone
      dipropionate (100Âµg twice a day) or placebo, through an inhaler (autohaler) device, attached
      to a spacer device, during four consecutive weeks. Adenosine Challenge test will be performed
      another time at the end of this four weeks period. After 2 weeks with no medication (wash out
      period) the patients will receive the second intervention (beclometasone dipropionate or
      placebo) in a cross over manner and will be submitted to the last adenosine challenge test.

      Clinical evaluation, resting spirometry and subjective evaluation through an analogical
      symptoms scale will be recorded in each visit.
