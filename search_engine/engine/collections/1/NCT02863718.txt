      prolonging EFS for subjects with treatment-na√Øve CLL stage A and intermediate or (very) high
      risk of disease progression. All subjects with intermediate, (very) high risk randomized to
      the experimental treatment arm will be treated up to active progressive disease with
      treatment indication according to iwCLL-Guidelines with the objective to demonstrate
      prolongation of EFS for the ibrutinib arm. EFS is defined as the time between randomization
      until active progressive disease with treatment indication according to the iwCLL-Guidelines
      with subsequent treatment for CLL or death.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the prolongation of overall survival of ibrutinib versus placebo

        -  To evaluate the safety of ibrutinib versus placebo
