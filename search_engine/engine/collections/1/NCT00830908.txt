    
      This is an open label pilot study to evaluate the effects of the low-level laser light on
      seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. Dandruff assessment scores for scalps with seborrheic
      dermatitis will be assessed at baseline with monthly evaluations during treatment, until
      final assessment at end of treatment at week 12.

      The trial will involve 10 patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of seborrheic
      dermatitis. Patients will use the LaserComb device three times per week on non-consecutive
      days for 12 weeks. No other seborrheic dermatitis products will be used during treatment. The
      investigator will conduct measurements of dandruff at each study visit, as a measure of
      efficacy.

      The trial consists of 4-5 study visits (screening/baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12).
      Dandruff evaluation and adverse event assessments will be performed at each visit.

      Safety analysis will be assessed based on the reports of adverse events during the study.
