      IOL implantation at the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Hangzhou, China.
      bilateral and unilateral CC children were placed in Study group, while age-matched normal
      children were included as controls. Children who were uncooperative to complete the
      preoperative and postoperative examinations were excluded.

      All eyes were divided into 4 groups. Group 1: form deprivation amblyopia of unilateral CC,
      Group 2: unaffected eyes of unilateral CC, Group 3: form deprivation amblyopia of bilateral
      CC, Group 4: normal eyes of normal children. The preoperative and postoperative data
      including sex, age at surgery, 7 position of RNFLT and CMT were collected.

      All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon (Y.E.Z.) under general anesthesia.
      Investigators used OCT biometry to measure participants' the retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFLT) and macular thickness (CMT) before surgery and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6
      months and 1 year after surgery, and compared with age-matched normal children.
