      with daily living that some patients experience 25-35 years after maximum recovery from acute
      paralytic poliomyelitis. The new weakness appears to be due to disintegration of the distal
      nerve terminals of the surviving motor neurons whose soma has been stressed for years to
      maintain large motor units via excessive distal sprouting. The factors responsible for the
      disintegration of axonal sprouts and manifestation of the new weakness and fatigue are
      unknown. Whether an immune response to the poliovirus, immunogenetic, dysimmune or aging
      factors play a role in the pathogenesis of this process is also unknown.

      The purpose of this protocol is to apply specific neuromuscular, electrophysiological,
      histological, virological, and immunological tests to answer pertinent questions regarding
      the pathogenesis of the post-polio syndrome. Studied patients will undergo a series of
      clinical neuromuscular evaluations, quantitative muscle testing, electromyography including
      single fiber EMG, immunogenetic, viral and immunochemical studies in the serum and spinal
      fluid, muscle biopsy and swallowing evaluation. Although this is not a therapeutic study, the
      information obtained would help us understand the pathogenetic mechanisms of the new weakness
      and could help us design possible therapies.
