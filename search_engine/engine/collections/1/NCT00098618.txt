      I. Determine the feasibility and tolerability of sorafenib and interferon alfa in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

      II. Determine the response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients treated
      with this regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free survival and response duration of patients treated with
      this regimen.

      II. Correlate changes in laboratory parameters with response in patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily and interferon alfa subcutaneously three times a
      week for 8 weeks. Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with stable or responding disease are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 2 years, and then annually for 1 year or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.
