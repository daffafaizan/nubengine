      Primary

        -  To assess the antitumor efficacy, in terms of objective response rate, of belotecan
           hydrochloride and cisplatin in patients with previously untreated extensive-stage small
           cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess additional evidence of antitumor activity as measured by overall and
           progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of this drug combination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 1 and belotecan hydrochloride IV on days
      2-4.Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
