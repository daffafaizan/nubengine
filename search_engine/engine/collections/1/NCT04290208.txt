      based approach to peri-operative care, with the goal of accelerating recovery and return to
      normal activity after surgery. Results have shown stable pain control with a decrease in
      narcotic consumption, a quicker return of bowel function, and decreased length of hospital
      stay and cost with no change in level of patient satisfaction, morbidity, or readmission
      rate. An aspect of some alternate management protocols is the administration of
      acetaminophen.

      The concentration of acetaminophen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is directly proportional to
      the analgesic activity of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen relies on a high concentration
      gradient from the plasma to the CSF in order to passively diffuse into the central nervous
      system (CNS), its principal site of action. A 2012 study, comparing plasma and CSF
      pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV), oral (PO), or rectal (PR) acetaminophen, concluded that
      IV administration of acetaminophen results in higher plasma and CSF concentration values.
      Therefore, IV acetaminophen produces better CNS penetration compared to PO or PR methods.
