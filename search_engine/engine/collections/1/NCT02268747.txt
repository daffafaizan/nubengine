      toxicity will be of grade <2, then the patients will start dacomitinib at 45 mg once daily
      and they will be clinically assessed every cycle (i.e. every 28 days).

      If the highest skin toxicity will be grade >2, then the patient will interrupt the treatment
      following the criteria for dose reduction.

      Tumor evaluation will be performed at baseline and every other cycle. Response will be
      assessed according to RECIST 1.1. The patient will continue to assume the study drug until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any medical condition that will suggest to stop
      the treatment for patient's safety
