      ischemic tissue. Shockwaves are created by a special generator and are focused using a
      shockwave applicator device. The treatment is guided by standard echocardiography equipment.
      The shockwaves are delivered in synchronization with Patient R-wave to avoid arrhythmias. The
      treatment is painless.

      At first, the patient undergoes stress-SPECT testing to identify the ischemic areas.
      Following that, the same area is localized by the ultra-sound device and the shockwaves are
      focused to the ischemic area. Several treatment session (9 in total, spread over 9 weeks) are
      required for optimal results.
