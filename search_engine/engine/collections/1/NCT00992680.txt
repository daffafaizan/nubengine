      changes in the lung structure, but also to systemic changes in the body that can influence
      the severity of the disease. The irreversible changes to the lungs can be seen in limitations
      to the pulmonary function. The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the
      performance and efficacy of the ROX percutaneous Anastomotic Coupler System.
