      Texas Southwestern Medical Center University Hospital. Development of post-TAVR AKI defined
      according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) SCr based and urine output
      based criteria will be ascertained. Patients will be followed during primary hospitalization
      and during the 5 years following TAVR for adverse kidney outcomes as well as potentially
      related adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Clinical and procedural data is collected for each
      study patient. All subjects will have paired blood and urine collection done pre-TAVR, 6
      hours after aortic valve prosthesis deployment, and on post-procedure days 1 and 2. Subjects
      who develop AKI will also have paired blood and urine samples collected on days 3, 4 and 5.
      Patients receive follow-up questionnaires by mail or email asking about hospitalizations as
      well as visits to cardiology, nephrology and primary care physicians. Questionnaires will
      also ask about health-related quality of life using validated study questionnaires. Patient
      follow-up will occur at regular intervals until 5 years after TAVR procedure.
