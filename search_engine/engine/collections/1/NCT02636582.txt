    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate for nelipepimut-S-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL; cluster of
      differentiation [CD]8+ T cell) response in patients receiving NeuVax (nelipepimut-S plus
      GM-CSF [sargramostim]) compared to patients receiving GM-CSF alone (control).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity profile and frequency of adverse events in women with ductal carcinoma in situ
      (DCIS) of the breast receiving nelipepimut-S vaccine as compared to women receiving GM-CSF
      alone.

      II. Presence of DCIS at resection. III. Difference in HER2 expression in the biopsy and the
      surgical specimen excised post-vaccination.

      IV. Histologic responses:

      IVa. Degree of lymphocyte infiltration determined on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
      slides and immune infiltration as determined by multiplex immunofluorescence staining for
      markers including but not limited to CD3, CD4 and CD8.

      IVb. Immune infiltrates in normal tissue maximally distant from the tumor (in mastectomy
      samples).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nelipepimut-S plus GM-CSF vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 0 and 14
      and then undergo surgery on day 28.

      ARM II: Patients receive sargramostim ID on days 0 and 14 and then undergo surgery on day 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months.
