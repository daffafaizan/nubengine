      common disorder especially in overweight and obese persons who are at increased risk for
      GERD. Late night supper, an usual eating habit in many parts of the world, may worsen GERD
      and especially so among the obese, and this may be due to increased reflux from acid pocket.

      Acid pocket in the proximal part of stomach after meals has been shown to be an important
      mechanism of GERD. The acid pocket is increasingly recognized as a source from which acid
      reflux events originate. To what extent changes in acidity of the acid pocket contribute to
      the therapeutic effect of alginate antacid formulation is inconsistent. The other findings
      suggested that the main mechanism of action for the alginate-antacid combination is to
      displace the post-prandial acid pocket rather than mechanically containing it.

      Therefore, the outcomes of the study will allow us to determine whether late night supper
      worsen acid pocket, night time reflux and symptoms and whether an alginate antacid
      preparation (Gaviscon AdvanceÂ®) is useful in suppression of acid pocket, night time refluxes
      and symptom (s). A benefit is that this study may inform doctors and advise participants of
      GERD side-effects of late night supper and how Gaviscon Advance may help.
