      demonstrated. Interest has emerged in using NPPV to facilitate earlier removal of an
      endotracheal tube and decrease complications associated with prolonged intubation. Studies
      assessing NPPV in weaning are not enough and generally are performed with face masks as
      device for NPPV. This study assesses the efficacy of helmet as device for NPPV during weaning
      from mechanical ventilation in an ICU and compares this procedure with invasive mechanical
      complication (IMV) by analyzing respiratory parameters, clinical course and complications.
