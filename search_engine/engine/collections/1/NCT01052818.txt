      the most deadly malignant neoplasias. Moreover, there are no markers for monitoring response
      to treatment. The objective of the study is to associate the number of circulating tumor
      cells (CTC) before and after treatment and correlate it with tumor response rate,
      progression-free survival and overall survival.
