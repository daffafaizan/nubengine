      determine if the hypothesis that patients receiving tranexamic acid will have a lower need
      for blood transfusion and there are changes in the levels of the proteins essential for
      healthy oxygen transport throughout the body is correct. Tranexamic acid is a medication
      which may help wounds to stop bleeding more quickly. Participants are not expected to receive
      any direct benefits from participating in this study. Only a small risk of private patient
      medical information being exposed is anticipated. The results of this study will help
      surgeons and the medical community to better understand the uses of this type of drug and its
      possible role in benefiting hip replacement patients during and following surgery.
