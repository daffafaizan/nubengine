      oxygen at 1.5 atmospheres for 60 minutes. They receive this exposure five days per week, and
      receive 60 total sessions. Prior to hyperbaric oxygen, these study subjects have neurologic,
      cognitive, and functional measures. The measures are repeated at the conclusion of 60
      hyperbaric oxygen sessions, and again six months later. The goal of the HYBOBI feasibility
      study is to learn about these patients and determine possible hyperbaric oxygen effects, if
      any, to prepare for a blinded randomized controlled clinical trial.

      This study adds an imaging component to the HYBOBI study, further investigating brain changes
      in participants. Participants will undergo Brain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) using a 3
      tesla magnet, and Brain CT (Computed Tomography) Angiogram. Subjects will undergo imaging
      before receiving hyperbaric oxygen and within 2 weeks of completion of the 60 hyperbaric
      sessions.
