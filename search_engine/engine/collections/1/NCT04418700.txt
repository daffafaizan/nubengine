      technique in patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery on clinical, physiological and
      cardiopulmonary variables. These individuals were randomized to compose the control group
      (CG) and the intervention group (GBS). The routine physical therapy was performed in both
      groups and in the GBS two daily sessions of up to 20 minutes of Breath Stacking technique
      were applied. To verify the effect of this intervention, before and after the protocol,
      patients underwent the following evaluations: algometry, cirtometry in the axillary line ,
      umbilical line and the xiphoid process, ventilometry, spirometry and manovacuometry.
