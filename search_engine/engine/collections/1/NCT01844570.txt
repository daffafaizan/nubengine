    
      It is a multicenter, prospective cohort study with large sample size. It is to evaluate the
      effect on the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular endpoint events and blood
      pressure control in hypertensive patients who use Levamlodipine Maleate (Xuanning) or
      amlodipine besylate(Norvasc).Xuanning group and Norvasc group will recruit 5000 patients
      respectively. Each site will recruit patients in chronological orderï¼›patients who participate
      will finish the two-year follow up(1,2,3,6,12,18,24 months after recruitment) and relevant
      data will be recorded. Baseline data will be analyzed to evaluate the equilibrium between two
      or more groups (such as the number of options). Logistic regression and propensity scores
      (PS) would be used to match major indicators of effectiveness and safety indicators using
      matching method baseline data.
