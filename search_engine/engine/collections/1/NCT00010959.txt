      (red clover) and Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh). Participants will receive a single dose
      of one botanical preparation. The observation period will be one week. Drug toxicity,
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination data will be collected, and dosages to
      be utilized in a Phase II clinical trial will be determined. The Phase II trial will examine
      the efficacies of red clover and black cohosh for the reduction of menopausal symptoms in
      healthy menopausal women. The study will be randomized, double-blinded, and
      placebo-controlled. Study duration will be one year.
