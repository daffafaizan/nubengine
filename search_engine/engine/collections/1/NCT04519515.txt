      (QGSGS)1 will be randomized to receive up to 1cc of Juvéderm Vollure on one side of their
      face and up to 1cc of Saline on the other. On Day 30, this treatment with the same left-right
      assignment can be repeated if optimal correction on the active intervention side has not been
      achieved according to the treating investigator. Subjects will return 24-48 hours after their
      first treatment to fill out questionnaires, take pictures, and to be assessed by blinded
      evaluators regarding short term adverse events. Subjects will fill out a 30 day subject diary
      and also return 30 and 90 days after their last treatment to fill out questionnaires, take
      pictures, complete the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), and to be assessed on the
      QGSGS and for long-term adverse events by blinded evaluators. The subjects will be eligible
      to receive treatment with Juvéderm Vollure 90 days after their last treatment on the
      placebo-controlled side if they choose. In addition, at 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months,
      the subjects will return to fill out questionnaires, take pictures, and to be assessed by
      blinded evaluators for long-term efficacy.
