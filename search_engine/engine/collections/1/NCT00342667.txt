      disabilities, especially mental retardation. Cerebral palsy is frequently associated with
      neurologic abnormalities and mental retardation. Improvements in neonatal intensive care have
      resulted in improved survival of very low birthweight infants but also in an increased
      frequency of cerebral palsy. Prematurity is a leading risk factor for cerebral palsy. Two
      thirds of preterm neonates are born to mothers with preterm labor with intact membranes or
      preterm premature rupture of membranes. A growing body of evidence suggests that these
      conditions are heterogeneous. This is an observational cohort study designed to identify the
      mechanisms of disease in patients with preterm labor/contractions and preterm premature
      rupture of membranes and to describe the relationship between clinical, biochemical,
      histological, biophysical parameters and the development of infant neurological disorders.
