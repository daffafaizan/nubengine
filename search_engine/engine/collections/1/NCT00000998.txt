      to only a few patients. Therefore it is not certain if TMTX is better, the same as, or not as
      effective as conventional drugs against PCP.

      Increasing doses of TMTX are used in combination with LCV as initial treatment for PCP in 50
      AIDS patients. Doses are increased for 21 days on a once daily and then a twice daily basis.
      Dose escalations occur in subsequent groups of patients.
