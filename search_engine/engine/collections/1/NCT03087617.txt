      lung cancer screening exam. This randomized controlled (RCT) trial will clinically validate
      the Report's impact on: (a) Lung screening participants' motivation to make a quit attempt by
      calling a Quitline, and (b) the effectiveness of a 45-minute telephone smoking cessation
      counseling session for motivating an actual quit attempt and abstinence. The RCT will enroll
      approximately 400 randomly selected participants from lung screening programs at
      HealthPartners and University of Michigan. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      four conditions: 1) Usual Care + quitline phone number (created specifically for the trial
      and maintained for the length of the trial); 2) Usual Care + Report (Report will list
      Quitline number) 3) Usual Care + Counseling, or 4) Usual Care + Report + Counseling. Follow
      up assessment calls will be conducted with participants at three weeks, three months, and six
      months following the mailing of the report.
