    
      1. Diagnosis:

        1. Diagnostic chart (Appendix A) will be filled with personal, medical and dental history.
           DMF and def caries index (decayed, missing, and filled teeth).

        2. The intra oral and extra oral examinations will be made using masks, gloves, cap,
           goggles, gauze, medical tray, dental mirror and WHO ( World Health Organization ) probe.
           All materials will be packaged in sterilizations wraps and autoclave, following the
           required bio safety standards

      2. Intervention:

      â€¢ The participants included will be allocated into two groups by drawing of sealed and opaque
      envelopes containing the codes "A" and "B".

      Experimental Group:( intervention ) Green tea with Aloe- Vera

        1. Preparation of green tea with aloe - Vera will occur under aseptic condition by
           pharmacist (Sargolzaie et al, 2015).

        2. Collection of saliva samples (pre-rinse) will be obtained from children who fulfilled
           the inclusion criteria.

        3. Distinguish odors using the Smell identification test (Doty et al. 1984). Breath was
           scored as described by Rosenberg at rest (open mouth without breathing) and when the
           patients counted from 1 to 11 (Rosenberg, 1996). A 0-5 score was given (Green man et al.
           2004).

        4. Subjects will be instructed to wash and retain the respective mouth rinse in the mouth
           for 40 Seconds before expectorating it.

        5. 15 min after a rinse , Breath was scored as described by Rosenberg at rest (open mouth
           without breathing) and when the patients counted from 1 to 11 (Rosenberg, 1996). A 0-5
           score was given (Green man et al. 2004). (masking effect)

        6. Patients will not allow consuming any diet or drinking orally for following 90 min.

        7. Again after 90 min, the saliva samples will be taken and inoculated on blood agar plates
           to determine the colony count (Velmurugan et al, 2013) and

        8. Patients with confirmed oral malodor rinsed mouthwash during 7 days (15 ml, 2x/day for 1
           min.)

        9. After 7 days Breath was scored as described by Rosenberg at rest (open mouth without
           breathing) and when the patients counted from 1 to 11 (Rosenberg, 1996). A 0-5 score was
           given (Green man et al. 2004). (therapeutic effect).

           score was given (Green man et al. 2004). (masking effect)

        5. Patients will not allow consuming any diet or drinking orally for following 90 mins.

        6. Again after 90 min, the saliva samples will be taken and inoculated on blood agar plates
           to determine the colony count (Velmurugan et al, 2013) .

        7. Patients with confirmed oral malodor rinsed mouthwash during 7 days (15 ml, 2x/day for 1
           min.)
