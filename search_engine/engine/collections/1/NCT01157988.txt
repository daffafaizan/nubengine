      have a poor prognosis as like to those with advanced disease. However, there are very limited
      studies to compare the clinical outcome of therapy after chemotherapy only with combined
      modality using radiation. Defining local failure at bulky sites as one component of relapse,
      radioimmuotherapy appears to reduce the failure rates at previous bulky sites. We assessed
      the clinical efficacy and toxicity of 6th R-CHOP chemotherapy and followed by ibritumomab
      tiuxetan (Zevalin) consolidation in patients with limited-stage, bulky DLBCL.
