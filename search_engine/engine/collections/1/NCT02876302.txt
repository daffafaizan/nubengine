      of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

      The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ruxolitinib for Inflammatory
      Breast Cancer (IBC), but is has been approved for other uses.

      Ruxolitinib is a newly discovered drug that has been shown to block a pathway (called the
      IL6/JAK/Stat pathway) that may be important in cancer, including triple negative inflammatory
      breast cancer. Ruxolitinib brings proteins groups together, which can result in gene (DNA)
      changes. These DNA changes may stop cancer cells from growing.

      Paclitaxel (also called Taxol), Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (also called Adriamycin and
      Cytoxan, ("AC")) are drugs FDA approved for breast cancer patients. They have been shown to
      result in death of cancer cells when given as preoperative treatment of women with
      inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Laboratory studies have shown that Ruxolitinib may make
      Paclitaxel more effective.

      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating Ruxolitinib in combination with
      Paclitaxel followed by the standard chemotherapy, AC. Researchers will also evaluate how the
      IL6/JAK/Stat pathway is affected by this combination of drugs by studying biopsies and
      surgical specimens.
