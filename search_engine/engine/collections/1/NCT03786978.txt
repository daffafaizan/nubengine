      structured pharmaceutical care model after basal hospital discharge and measure the effect of
      this intervention in terms of readmission reduction in a short term period of 30 days,
      regardless of the hospitalization reason.

      As secondary outcomes the investigators measured the readmission rates after basal hospital
      discharge and the effect of the intervention in terms of readmission reduction in 60, 90,180
      and 365 days after basal hospital discharge. Also, the readmission costs in terms of
      cost-effectiveness were evaluate.

      The sample consisted of 100 patients with DM associated with other comorbidities,
      hospitalized for any reason in the HCPA, of both sexes, older than 18 years.

      Informed consent, demographic and validated questionnaires data were collected in the basal
      visit. After that, patients were randomized to:

      Group 1: comparator; Group 2: structured pharmaceutical intervention.

      Seven days after basal hospital discharge, drugs adherence was verified.

      The interventional group received pharmaceutical care at basal hospitalization stay, after
      randomization, have their prescription reviewed until 7 days after discharge of basal
      hospitalization and also received structured phone calls and mobile SMS (Short Message
      Service) during one year follow up (30, 60, 180 and 365 days).

      Electronic medical records of the included patients (intervention and comparator groups) were
      reviewed monthly for 12 months, aiming to identify access to emergency services or hospital
      readmissions at the HCPA and, consequently, the reasons for readmissions and outcomes.
