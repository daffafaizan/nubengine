      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) testing at final follow-up. The cold intolerance of the
      injured finger is measured using the self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score
      questionnaire that was rated into mild, moderate, severe, and extreme (0-25, 26-50, 51-75 and
      76-100). Patients report their satisfaction with functional recovery of the injured finger
      according to the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire that was based on a 5-point response
      scale.
