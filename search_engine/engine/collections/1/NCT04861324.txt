      lead to delivery complications because of a large baby and increases risks of type 2 diabetes
      and heart disease in the mother and baby in later life. Thus, pregnancy is a critical time
      during the human lifespan to make effective dietary changes that are safe for both mother and
      the fetus and reduce risks of developing diabetes and pregnancy complications. Women
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks gestation will be randomly
      assigned to the standard care or the nutrition education group. Blood draws and other
      biomedical measures will be collected at baseline and at end of the study before dleivery.
