      technique that was developed with the goal of offering a technically simple, safe, and
      effective alternative to surgical prolapse repair procedures. When compared to previously
      reported SSLF methods, this technique has undergone novel modifications with the intent of
      maximizing efficacy and minimizing invasiveness. First, each sacrospinous ligament is
      approached trans-vaginally using a small diameter, low profile needle as the delivery
      platform for the anchoring unit. Secondly, the suspension is bilateral, thus maintaining
      vaginal length and width without deviation or narrowing of the vagina as might occur with a
      traditional (unilateral) sacrospinous repair. And third, using bio-degradable sutures and a
      securing element that stabilizes the fixation as opposed to performing an incision in the
      vaginal wall for suturing enables an incision-free procedure leaving the vagina free of any
      device after a period of several weeks.
