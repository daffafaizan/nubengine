      anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The adipose
      tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of AD-SVF. In addition, patient's
      peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of platelet rich plasma (PRP), which are
      then combined with the AD-SVF for intra-articular administration of affected joint.
