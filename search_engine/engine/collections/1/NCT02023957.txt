      touch-screen iPad device in their waiting time before seeing their clinician (family
      physician or nurse practitioner). The computer program generates tailored risk-report for the
      clinician and a simple recommendation sheet for the patient, with community resources and
      health information, at the point of care. The iCAS tool currently includes validated
      screening scales for depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder and
      alcohol abuse. There are some questions on the social determinants of mental health as well.
      The current versions of the tool are in English and Spanish; a Chinese language version will
      also be developed.
