      control trial of community-based NCORP sites to study the effectiveness of a multi-faceted
      intervention to improve smoking cessation among lung cancer screening patients, as well as
      dissemination and implementation (D&I) science to optimize and accelerate translation of
      findings into clinical practice. We will: (1) Evaluate a multi-faceted training program to
      improve short-term smoking cessation rates (1-week post-visit) and sustained abstinence (6
      months) among 1,114 enrolled smokers (557 in each trial arm) who present for LDCT lung cancer
      screening in community-based lung cancer screening practices; (2) Characterize the adoption
      and adaptation of the evidence-based tobacco cessation strategies in 26 community-based LDCT
      lung cancer screening programs; and (3) Develop and evaluate an implementation toolkit for
      integrating evidence-based tobacco cessation strategies in community-based LDCT lung cancer
      screening programs. Qualitative data will be collected from key informants at participating
      screening programs during and after intervention implementation. Quantitative survey data
      (baseline, <14 days, 3 months, and 6 months) and saliva specimens (6 months only) will be
      collected from smoking patients receiving screening within these programs.
