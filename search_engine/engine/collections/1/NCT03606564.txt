      solids, 6 hours for formula milk, 4 hours for breast milk and 2 hours of clear liquids, for
      preoperative patients undergoing elective surgery. Parents of Children undergoing surgery are
      instructed to adhere to these guidelines. Parents might not be compliant with these
      instructions. They may fast their children less than or more than the recommended time.

      Main aim of this study is to find out the incidence of non compliance with the fasting
      instructions and try to find the reasons for such non compliance.
