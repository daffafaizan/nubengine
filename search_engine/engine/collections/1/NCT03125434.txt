      and kyphosis) are major public health issues.

      Postural imbalance due to spinal deformity is usually measured on static radiographs, using
      standard X-rays. However, bipedal walk is characteristic from human being and the trunk is
      the main stabilizer.

      Pathogenesis of spinal deformities remains undefined. To understand the different mechanisms
      involved in the pathological field, normal musculoskeletal performances of the spine, in
      static and dynamic conditions must be identified.

      Ultra-low doses stereoradiography using the EOS system allows the acquisition of full-spine
      images in standing position. Furthermore, 3D reconstruction can also be create from both
      anteroom-posterior and lateral side view. Stereoradiography is used in clinical routine
      especially in children spinal deformities.

      High resolution muscular MRI is the only device that can provide a detailed muscular
      analysis, with detection of abnormalities at an early stage. No mapping of normal paraspinal
      muscles has been yet realized, particularly regarding to rotatores muscles.

      Motion analysis is the reference exam to analyse dynamic stability during gait. Several
      parameters reflecting stability during gait can be collected in different conditions.
      Recently, the "Dynamic Stability Margin" has been developed but no standard values especially
      in healthy children has been published.
