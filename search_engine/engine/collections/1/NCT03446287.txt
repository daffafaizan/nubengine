      center, data collection study. Choice of the prosthetic graft and configuration will be based
      on surgeon's preference and extent of the disease. OR will be performed by vascular surgeons
      at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, assuming no difference in surgical techniques.

      Demographics, clinical presentation, preoperative clinical and imaging assessment,
      intraoperative information, length of ICU stay and hospitalization, early and late mortality,
      major adverse events (MAEs), reintervention, rupture and QoL at different postoperative time
      points (4 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years) will be recorded according to well-designed
      case report forms (CRFs) and SF-36 form. Follow-up information will be obtained from office
      visits or mailing questionnaires (SF-36 form and CAA-specific questionnaire).

      Patients will be asked to fill out the SF-36 forms preoperatively, and along with the
      CAA-specific questionnaire at 4 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years post-operatively.
      Physician assistants or study coordinators will interview all patients prior to treatment
      (during office evaluation). The follow-up assessments will be conducted by questionnaires
      (SF-36 and CAA-specific questionnaire) and office visits as well. If no response in 6 weeks
      after sending out questionnaires at each time point, telephone interview will be followed.
