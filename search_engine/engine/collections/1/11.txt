electron-microscopic observatations on transference of fat through thehuman placenta .from the results of our previous and present studied on thetransportation of fat through the human placenta by means of electronmicroscopy, we obtained the following conclusions .1) neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta withoutdissociation .2) almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to thebiological activity . pinocytosis is most representative, but theauthors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in thebasement membrane and transport via the stroma cell . the authorsbelieve that these results will bring a clue to explain the mechanism ofbiological transportation of materials through the placenta .
