      Those subjects were randomised between standard radiotherapy using 2D wedge compensation and
      breast IMRT. Subjects were treated in Toronto, Ontario, or in Victoria, British Columbia.
      Subjects and assessors were carefully blinded to the treatment arm. The clinical trial was
      funded by the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) and one of the four objectives of
      the application was to "To record late skin toxicity occurrence, fibrosis and telangiectasia,
      in women receiving breast IMRT and conventional irradiation technique".

      The investigators are proposing to invite women who participated in the trial to return to
      their treatment centre during 2011-2013 for a follow-up assessment at eight years after
      randomisation to record relevant long-term outcomes including the effect of improved
      homogeneity with IMRT on the occurrence of late radiation therapy side-effects cosmetic
      outcome and Quality of Life.
