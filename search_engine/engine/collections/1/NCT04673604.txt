      the success of long-term medical therapy, impacting millions of patients worldwide. Chronic
      medical therapy for glaucoma may be immensely benefitted by limiting disabling GTR-OSD, which
      would aid in the prevention of blindness. In 2015 a novel cationic formulation of
      cyclosporine A 0.1% was approved with once in the evening dosing in Europe. It is an
      effective, targeted immunomodulatory compound reducing inflammatory mediators and providing
      healing of the ocular epithelium. There remains however a paucity of published controlled
      evidence for GTR-OSD patients treated with this formulation. In addition, there is a lack of
      evidence on the impact of switching from a combined preserved anti-glaucoma regimen, to a
      preservative-free one, while employing sufficiently robust OSD metrics. The investigators
      have therefore carried out a single center prospective, crossover investigation to compare
      the 6-month effect of switching well controlled open-angle glaucoma patients with at least
      moderate GTR-OSD, from preserved to triple PF therapy with and without PF cyclosporine 0.1%
      dosed in the evening.
