      study includes patients treated with Ventavis for PAH. A total of 270 patients (valid for
      safety analysis) is planned to be enrolled in 5 years. Target population is patients with PAH
      diagnosis. This study is performed as an all-patient investigation, therefore all patients
      who receive Ventavis treatment for PAH need to be registered. The treatment should be
      performed based on the product label in Japan. The standard observation period will last for
      12 months from starting Ventavis treatment. In addition, the extension observation will be
      carried out as long as Ventavis treatment continues or at most for more 4 years. The standard
      observation points are 3 month and

      1 to 5 years.
