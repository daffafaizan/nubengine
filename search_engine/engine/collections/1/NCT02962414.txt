    
      This is a multi-center, open label study to evaluate the long term safety of everolimus in
      patients with TSC and refractory seizures currently being treated in the Novartis-sponsored
      study EXIST-3 study and are judged by their parent study investigator as benefiting from the
      current study treatment. The study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years (or
      until 31-Dec-2022 in the UK) from First Patient First Visit (FPFV).

      Patients will continue to be treated in this study until they are no longer benefiting from
      their everolimus treatment as judged by the Investigator or until one of the protocol defined
      discontinuation criteria is met or everolimus becomes commercially available according to
      local regulations.
