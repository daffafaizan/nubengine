      supplies to traditional birth attendants in a rural setting in Zambia. 120 TBAs are
      randomized into intervention/control. Intervention TBAs receive NRP training, supplies for
      neonatal resuscitation, receiving blankets for thermoregulation, and amoxicillin tablets.
      Control TBAs continue according to prior standard of care. Primary outcome is mortality at 28
      days life as a proportion of births attended by TBAs in each study arm.
