      without risk. Patients with underlying bradyarrhythmias or those receiving Î²-adrenergic
      antagonists may be more susceptible to neostigmine-induced bradycardia. Similarly,
      neostigmine increases airway secretions and bronchial reactivity, which may exacerbate active
      bronchospasm. Recently, a new class of drugs-peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor
      antagonists-may help enhance multimodal management of POI. Although, the cost benefit of the
      new class of drugs is debated. It has been suggested that the individual components of
      multimodal protocols-for example, laparoscopy-may reduce certain post surgical morbidities
      (including POI) But do not by them prevent POI. Therefore, combinations of strategies with
      demonstrated effectiveness-early feeding , epidural analgesia, laparoscopic surgery, and use
      of peripherally acting mu-opioid-receptor antagonists-may help transform the reactive
      approach to POI into a proactive multimodal paradigm that effectively targets the diverse
      etiologic factors leading to this common clinical problem.
