      of myocardial infarction (MI), Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), Coronary Artery
      Bypass Grafting (CABG), stroke, carotid endarterectomy, peripheral revascularization, and
      peripheral amputation) are lower in patients who participate in managed diabetes care by ADEC
      in comparison to provincial and national rates. Comparison statistics will be provided by the
      Institute of Evaluative Sciences (ICES) Atlas 2003 and other Diabetes studies such as the
      2005 DICE study. Complications such as nephropathy and retinopathy will be documented, along
      with hospitalization rates and all cause mortality. Clinical outcomes relevant to diabetes
      management such as blood pressure and lipids will also be compared.
