      OLP-1002 following single subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers using a capsaicin pain
      model, and to monitor the effects of a single subcutaneous doses of OLP-1002 on cardiac QT
      interval. Where possible, single and/or multiple subcutaneous dose pharmacokinetics of
      OLP-1002 in healthy subjects will be determined.
