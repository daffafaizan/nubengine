      undergo a 15-minute measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) measured non-invasively on
      the forearm by means of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Once a baseline stable StO2 value
      is obtained, a provocative test, consisting of a transient vascular occlusion, will be
      performed. The test will allow the obtention of a local metabolic rate, and a StO2 recovery
      rate after the ischemic stimulus. This StO2 recovery rate will be considered as a reflection
      of the endothelial health of the patient.

      Patients will be studied as soon as possible after admission to the ICU, and followed-up
      until ICU discharge or death.
