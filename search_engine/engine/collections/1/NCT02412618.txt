      randomized to 200-mg mifepristone or identical placebo with 400-mcg misoprostol vaginally 4-6
      hours prior to D&E. Primary outcome was cervical dilation assessed by the largest Hegar
      dilator accepted without resistance. Secondary outcomes included total procedure time, and
      patient and provider perceptions. The study was powered to detect a 2-mm difference in
      cervical dilatation with 48 participants in each arm.
