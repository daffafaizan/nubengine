      is the increase in the number of patients available for long-term follow-up in randomized
      controlled clinical trials. This long follow-up allows an additional long-term evaluation of
      the efficacy, as well as of the sequelae related to the treatments that may occur beyond the
      time of the primary analysis.

      The target population of the study are all patients who were included in neoadjuvant and
      adjuvant clinical trials of GEICAM performed by the goup since 1998 in the medical oncology
      units of the participating sites, ensuring a follow-up of patients of approximately 30 years.
      This will allow to describe the long-term evolution of the patients with invasive breast
      cancer in early stages.

      The information obtained will be very useful to professionals involved in the diagnosis,
      treatment and monitoring of breast cancer, hospital managers, patients with this condition
      and society in general. This study provides data of great interest for the estimation of
      long-term disease requirements.
