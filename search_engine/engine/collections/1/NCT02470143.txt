      cardiac disease that was developed by the Expertise Centre for Digital Media of Hasselt
      University in collaboration with the Faculty of Medicine & Life Sciences of Hasselt
      University. During the pilot study, the use of the cycling application and its impact on fear
      and motivation of patients with a cardiac disease during the rehabilitation is studied. The
      cycling application will be used on a smartphone, in combination with a wrist-worn heart rate
      monitor.

      During the study, the patients will use the cycling application for one month, in which they
      can make use of the cycling application each time they are cycling outdoor in their home
      environment. Through questionnaires and interviews, the patients' experiences with respect to
      fear and motivation will be collected. Furthermore, the usability of the cycling application
      is evaluated through these questionnaires and interviews.
