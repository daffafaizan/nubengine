    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of
      quetiapine SR monotherapy compared to divalproex sodium ER monotherapy in outpatient subjects
      with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or not otherwsise specified (NOS) disorder, a lifetime panic
      or generalized anxiety disorder, and current diagnosis at least moderately severe anxiety
      symptoms. Approximately 180 subjects will be randomized to obtain 90 subjects who complete
      the 8-week trial (30 completers per treatment group). This calculation is based on drop out
      rates in a similar patient population carried out by this group of collaborators. Subjects
      will be randomized to quetiapine SR or divalproex sodium ER or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. No
      concomitant psychotropic medication will be allowed throughout the study except for prn
      lorazepam during the first two weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms,
      prn zolpidem and zaleplon for the management of insomnia and benztropine for the management
      of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Throughout the study, psychiatric scales will be used
      to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be
      monitored and recorded.
