    
      AIM:Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard technique for patients with early stage
      breast cancer. The investigators conduct the precise sentinel lymph node biopsy using
      preoperative computed tomographic lymphography in breast cancer. And The investigators
      identify the true sentinel lymph nodes(SLNs) followed by lymphatic ducts during operation.
      The investigators aimed to identify the non-sentinel lymph node, and to investigate the
      relationship between upper extremity lymphatic drainage. The SLNB procedure could avoid
      unnecessary lymph node resection and reduce treatment-related sequela.
