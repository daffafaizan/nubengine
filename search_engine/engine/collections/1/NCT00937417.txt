      Primary

        -  To investigate the differential biological effects in tumor tissues through
           pharmacodynamic endpoints (percent inhibition of pERK, pKDR, and pEGFR) and their
           correlation with pharmacokinetics of vandetanib in combination with docetaxel in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  To correlate the pharmacodynamic endpoints with the pharmacokinetics of this combination
           regimen in these patients.

        -  To recommend an optimal biological dose of this combination regimen for further testing.

      Secondary

        -  To correlate the pharmacokinetics with safety profiles of two dose levels of vandetanib
           when given in combination with docetaxel.

        -  To investigate scientific correlates, including serum proteomics and microvessel density
           (CD31) and cell death (TUNEL) using tumor tissue biopsy samples taken at baseline and
           during treatment.

        -  To determine the objective response in patients with measurable disease at baseline.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 and oral vandetanib once daily on days
      1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. After 6 weeks of treatment, patients who experience clinical benefit but poor
      tolerance to docetaxel may continue treatment with vandetanib alone.

      Plasma samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic analysis, measurement of
      vandetanib trough levels, serum biomarker analysis, and serum proteomics. Tumor tissue
      samples are collected at baseline and once between days 36-38 for pharmacodynamic analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 28 days.
