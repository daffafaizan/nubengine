      Text Message for Emergency Department Patients with Diabetes) is a locally designed,
      successful mobile health (mHealth) intervention for low income Latinos with diabetes. Social
      support interventions have likewise been successful at improving patient self-efficacy and
      disease management but are limited in scale due to two key obstacles: 1) requirements of
      in-person training of family and friends to be supporters and 2) the need to coordinate
      schedules and physical location between the patient and their supporter. mHealth can overcome
      these obstacles by allowing supporters to be trained remotely via a mobile platform and by
      allowing communication between a patient and supporter to occur at any time or place. The
      proposed intervention leverages the success of TExT-MED by augmenting the program with a
      social supporter that each patient can select from his or her own social support system
      (Family And friend Network Supporters (FANS)), creating TExT-MED+FANS. This is a 12 month,
      randomized study of this intervention. At the completion of the trial, we will evaluate the
      user experience with TExT-MED+FANS, and the impact of TExT-MED+FANS on patient motivation,
      self-efficacy and behaviors through a qualitative analysis of semi-structured individual
      interviews.
