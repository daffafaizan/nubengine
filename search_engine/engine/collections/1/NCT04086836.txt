      implantations in Sweden in 2008 all procedures have been added to a national database, which
      now contains 5000+ procedures. At the same time, all admissions to the hospital is also
      recorded with diagnosis in a separate database. We intend to make a nation-wide complete
      follow up of all TAVR/TAVI patients in swede that has received the diagnosis of stroke after
      the implantation. In addition data will also be collected from the national stroke database
      for detailed information of the cases
