      Staphylococcus Aureus) activity. Ceftobiprole medocaril is not yet approved for the treatment
      of community-acquired pneumonia. This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of
      ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo versus a comparator to assess the effectiveness and
      safety of ceftobiprole medocaril in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The patients
      will be randomized to ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo or a comparator. Patients who meet
      specified criteria may be switched to an alternative oral treatment. The primary endpoint is
      that the clinical cure rate among patients treated with ceftobiprole at the test of cure
      visit. The patients will receive either ceftobiprole medocaril plus placebo or a comparator.
