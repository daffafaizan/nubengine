      and has become increasingly important to oncologists, patients, and researchers because of
      its implications in adverse social outcomes for patients. Financial toxicity in the context
      of cancer care is the monetary cost, and subsequent social implications of the cost, on
      patients undergoing cancer treatment. Although financial toxicity for patients undergoing
      cancer treatment has some research attention, financial toxicity associated with radiation
      therapy for cancer patients has not. There is preliminary data that has shown that there are
      two forms of financial toxicity: the direct cost of cancer therapy (medical services) and the
      indirect costs (gas for travel, lost wages for sick days, etc.). However, the degree of cost
      and sources have not been fully investigated. Specifically, financial toxicity in the context
      of cancer patients from rural populations (such as those at NCCC) has not been fully
      explored. This project will attempt to understand the salient factors, costs, and magnitudes
      of financial toxicity in radiation therapy that will allow for more targeted studies to
      investigate vulnerable patient populations who experience greater financial toxicity.
