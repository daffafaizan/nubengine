      intention to reduce patient leak while a patient is receiving therapy. This accessory is a
      double-sided adhesive; with one side applied directly to the patient's skin and the other
      side connected to the mask cushion. Each adhesive is only to be applied to a patient once.
      The AF531/Performatrak mask can be removed from the adhesive and then re-applied, as
      necessary. For example, if the patient needs to remove the mask to eat or take medicine, the
      mask is removed from the patient and the adhesive will stay on the patient's face
