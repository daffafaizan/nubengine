      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of R115777 (tipifarnib) in patients with
      relapsed, refractory, or high risk myeloid leukemias treated according to this regimen.

      II. To assess the toxicity and preliminary assessment of efficacy of R115777 in patients with
      relapsed, refractory, or high risk myeloid leukemias.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients achieving a
      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR. Patients experiencing relapse
      after previously achieving CR may receive additional tipifarnib at the current dose level for
      newly registered patients.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the MTD is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
