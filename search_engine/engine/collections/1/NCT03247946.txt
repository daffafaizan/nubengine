      in an upright position and evaluated the infant ear and respiratory morbidity during a
      one-year follow-up. Mothers of 88 infants born during 2011 were instructed by trained nurses
      at Maternal-Child-Health clinics to feed their infants with their head in upright position
      (intervention group). The control group consisted of 75 mothers of infants of similar
      socioeconomic background who fed their infant regularly without any instructions and were
      followed at another Maternal-Child-Health clinic. Feeding position was evaluated at the
      beginning and the end of the study, and morbidity data of both groups were evaluated at every
      3-month follow-up meeting. The study was part of the PhD thesis of Efrat Danino, Head Nurse
      of Pediatric Department at Hadassah Medical Organization.
