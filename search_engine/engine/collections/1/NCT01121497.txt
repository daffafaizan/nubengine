      inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and
      elevates brain ACh levels. Physostigmine has been shown to improve attention, and performance
      in working memory. It has also been shown to produce analgesia following systemic or central
      administration.

      Patients undergoing colonoscopy under sedation of propofol and fentanyl show cognitive
      decline in the immediate period following the procedure. In this study, half the patients
      will receive physostigmine in combination with the sedation, and their cognitive functioning
      at the time of hospital discharge will be assessed by standard neuropsychological tests, and
      compared to that of patients without physostigmine.
