    
      This is a prospective, single-center, single-blinded, randomized, case-control study. The
      study is conducted by a single investigator at an orthopedic surgery institute, with a
      minimum 6 week post operative follow-up period. Subjects scheduled for a planned total knee
      arthroplasty procedure will be consented and those meeting study criteria will be randomized
      to receive intra-operative injections at the surgical site of liposomal bupivicaine plus a
      multi-drug cocktail, or a multi-drug cocktail alone.

      This study will recruit subjects on an ongoing basis with a minimum of 130 study participants
      and a maximum of 156. Efficacy data on surgical pain control and safety data will be
      collected at frequent intervals during the hospitalization. Each study participant will be
      followed for a minimum 6 week follow-up period.
