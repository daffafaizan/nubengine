      tumors or lymphoma who have liver or renal dysfunction or have had prior pelvic radiation.
      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients are stratified according to prior pelvic
      radiation therapy (yes vs no). Patients with no prior pelvic radiation are further stratified
      according to AST, bilirubin, and creatinine levels. Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90
      minutes every 3 weeks for a total of 2 courses. After patients are reevaluated, treatment may
      continue in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 to 6
      patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan. Dose escalation proceeds within each stratum
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose below
      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study at a rate of 2-3
      patients per month.
