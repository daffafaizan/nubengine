      effects of fluid loss and haemoconcentration within the first 24h after admission（or onset of
      abdominal pain）, early goal-directed fluid resuscitation has the potential of improving
      outcome also in SAP. But the goal of fluid resuscitation remained controversial.Several
      criteria of fluid resuscitation had been described. Ours had been described in previous
      study, and had shown a ideal result with less incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome and
      higher survival rate. This study aims to determine a better goal of fluid resuscitation in
      severe acute pancreatitis.
