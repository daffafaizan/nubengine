      death in the western world. In addition, these diseases, along with their various treatments,
      are associated with significant illness, as well as a host of debilitating symptoms. Two very
      common problems are cancer fatigue, as well as metabolic changes which can cause much
      suffering in and of themselves. Patients with advanced cancers, as well as many patients
      undergoing surgery, radiation therapy as well as chemotherapy all complain of fatigue, to a
      greater or lesser extent. Many gain or lose weight, and develop associated metabolic changes
      in uninvolved body systems, which can cause a significant health burden on the patients, as
      well as the healthcare system as a whole.

      Little is known about the mechanisms which underlie these symptoms. Various biologic
      processes have been implicated including inflammation and other changes in body metabolism.
      There is urgent need to better understand these processes, which cause so much suffering in
      cancer patients, so as to potentially develop more effective solutions.
