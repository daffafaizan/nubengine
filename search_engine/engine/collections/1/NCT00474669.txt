    
      This is a phase I study of intraperitoneal hyperthermic docetaxel given at the time of second
      look surgery following front-line normothermic intraperitoneal and intravenous
      cisplatin/paclitaxel for patients with stage II and III ovarian carcinoma. The primary
      objectives are to assess the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel administered
      intraperitoneally with heat at this time and assess the toxicity and morbidity associated
      with this treatment. Eligible patients will have had a complete clinical response to
      front-line therapy.
