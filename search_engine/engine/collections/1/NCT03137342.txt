      PrEP treatment. Once prescribed PrEP through the Miriam Hospital, the study participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions. In the intervention condition,
      participants will receive a two-stepped intervention which could include up to 10 free BA and
      risk reduction (RR) counseling sessions. Participants assigned to the comparison condition
      will receive the standard of care for PrEP treatment at the Miriam Hospital, which includes
      information about PrEP and how to obtain it, assistance from medical staff in obtaining
      health insurance for study participants, and information regarding local community resources.
