      species. Abundant evidence has documented that a majority of gram positive surgical site
      infections share bacterial phenotypes identical with nasal phage types. Conflicting
      literature exists regarding the efficacy of mupirocin in reducing the incidence of surgical
      site infections. A randomized prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial is needed to
      help settle this question in the setting of coronary artery bypass grafting surgery where
      surgical site infections carry significant morbidity, cost, and mortality.
