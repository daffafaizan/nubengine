    
      This study is modular in design allowing assessment of the safety, tolerability, PK and
      preliminary anti-tumour activity of T-DXd in combination with other therapies.
      Combination-treatment modules will have 2 parts: a dose-finding phase (Part 1), and a dose
      expansion phase (Part 2); the Part 2 dose-expansion phase will use the RP2D determined in
      Part 1.

      The target population of interest in this study is patients with HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC
      2+/ISH -) (as per ASCO/CAP 2018 guidelines) advanced/MBC. Part 1 of each module will enroll
      patients with locally confirmed HER2-low advanced/MBC in second-line or later (â‰¥ 2L) settings

      Part 2 of each module will enroll patients with HER2-low MBC who have either not received
      prior treatment, or received only 1 prior treatment (depending on the module-specific
      exclusion criteria) for advanced/metastatic disease
