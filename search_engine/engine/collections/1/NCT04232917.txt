    
      The study duration will be 24 months with 12 months of inclusion and 12 months of follow-up.
      Patients aged between 25 and 45 years who present cervical abnormalities during the routine
      screening visit for cervical cancer prevention.

      The total number of patients to include will be 284 with 142 patients per group.

      Primary objective:

      Comparison of the efficacy of 2LPAPI® versus placebo on the clearance of genital HR-HPV
      infections after 12 months of follow-up.

      Secondary objectives:

      Comparison of 2LPAPI® versus placebo on:

        -  HR-HPV infection clearance rate at 6-month visits,

        -  HR-HPV infection clearance rate by HPV type at 6-month and 12-month visits,

        -  Normal cytology,

        -  Safety.

      Treatment phase:

      Group n°1 = 2LPAPI® (6 months of treatment) Group n°2 = Placebo (6 months of treatment)
      Post-treatment follow-up phase: 6 months. Treatment will be considered successful if the
      clearance of HR-HPV is done and the cytology is normal.
