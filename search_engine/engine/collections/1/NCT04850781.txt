      Clearwater, Florida and Visiting Nurse Association of Texas in Dallas, Texas) will be
      randomized to one of the following modes of delivery: 1) meals that are delivered daily, five
      days per week, by a MOW program volunteer or paid driver and includes socialization and a
      wellness check or 2) frozen meals that are mailed to participants' homes. Persons with ADRD
      receiving meals and their caregivers will be recruited to pilot interview guides.

      The primary aim is to test and validate procedures to recruit participants with ADRD and
      evaluate their outcomes in partnership with MOW programs. The study also aims to characterize
      differences in the processes and potential mechanisms contributing to outcomes between the
      two modes of meal delivery among older adults with ADRD. The qualitative interviews with
      participants and their caregivers will provide important process and mechanistic information
      about the experiences receiving meals and participants' outcomes.
