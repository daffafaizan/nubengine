    
      Diabetes is one of the most common chronic illnesses among adults in the United States. Merck
      & Co., Inc. has produced an innovative website to engage adult patients in chronic illness
      self-management and medication adherence. Internet-based interventions and health promotion
      websites for patients are typically low-cost, easily accessible, and attractive. However,
      there is a growing need for improved measurement, implementation and evaluation of online
      health interventions to ensure patient engagement and produce more significant behavior
      change that can impact patients' health over the long term.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether utilization of the health and
      wellness website increases participants' self-reported self-efficacy toward managing their
      Type 2 Diabetes through behavior change and self-reported medication adherence.

      This study comprises a randomized controlled trial utilizing the website as the
      self-management support intervention. There is no interventional medical treatment, and no
      change in patients' medical care. In collaboration with University of Pennsylvania, potential
      participants will be identified and recruited from the Penn Medicine outpatient population
      based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants will remain in the study for 6
      months.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition (no
      exposure). Those in the intervention arm will have access to health & wellness website for
      nine months post enrollment. Online surveys will be delivered during this nine month period.
      Primary outcomes will be baseline-to-two month and baseline-to-4 month changes in diabetes
      management self-efficacy scores as measured by the Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale.
