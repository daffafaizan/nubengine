    
      Inhibition of angiogenesis is considered a promising approach to the treatment of cancer.
      Members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and the VEGF receptor-2
      (VEGFR-2) are important mediators of angiogenesis and are likely important therapeutic
      targets in advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC).

      Angiogenesis appears integral to HCC development and pathogenesis. Angiogenesis inhibition
      has been efficacious in both in vitro and in vivo HCC models and results of clinical studies
      also suggest potential to inhibit disease growth.

      Ramucirumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (MAb) that specifically binds to the
      extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 with high affinity. Phase 1 studies currently nearing
      completion have demonstrated safety and tolerability at clinically relevant doses, with
      preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy in a variety of human cancers.
