    
      The AcQMap Imaging and Mapping SystemÂ® is intended for use in patients for whom
      electrophysiology procedures have been prescribed.

      When used with the AcQMap Catheters, the AcQMap System is intended to be used to reconstruct
      the selected chamber from ultrasound data for purposes of visualizing the chamber anatomy and
      displaying electrical impulses as either charge density-based or voltage-based maps of
      complex arrhythmias that may be difficult to identify using conventional mapping systems
      alone.

      AND

      When used with specified Patient Electrodes, the AcQMap System is intended to display the
      position of the AcQMap Catheters and conventional electrophysiology (EP) catheters in the
      heart.

      OR

      When used with conventional electrophysiology catheters, the AcQMap System provides
      information about the electrical activity of the heart and about catheter location during the
      procedure.
