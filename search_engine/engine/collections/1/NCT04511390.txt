      airborne transmissible infections. There are many varieties of respirators including
      quarter-mask, half mask, and full facepiece respirators that filter 95, 99, or 100% of
      airborne particles. The elastomeric half mask respirators (EHMRs), in particular, have
      several advantages over commonly used N95 FFRs. Firstly, EHMRs may be cleaned, disinfected,
      and reused unlike FFRs that are normally discarded after a single use. EHMRs may be
      transparent as a result of material choice and will allow for visualization of the mouth.
      Lastly, they have been shown to properly fit faces after multiple rounds of decontamination.

      Some disadvantages of EHMRs include the requirement to disinfect and reinspect the quality of
      components on the respirator by a qualified individual for proper function, as well as manual
      exchange of filter components. Notwithstanding, it has been found that fit testing and
      training to use EHMRs for healthcare personnel is not significantly different than N95
      respirators and that EHMR may serve as a suitable alternative to disposable N95 respirators
      during public health emergencies. Furthermore, a 2018 consensus report from the National
      Academies of Engineering, Science, and Medicine recommended that the durability and
      reusability of elastomeric respirators made them desirable for stockpiling for emergencies.

      A new transparent elastomeric respirator has been developed that can maintain respirator
      integrity after decontamination and fits many people with different face sizes and shapes.
      Fit testing of the respirator will be performed using an OSHA-approved testing method.
