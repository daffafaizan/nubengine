    
      A multicenter phase I/II Clinical trial,randomized, controlled with placebo, triple blind to
      evaluate the safety of the intravenous administration of 3 doses of autologous mesenchymal
      stem cells cells from adipose tissue in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

      40 patients will be enrolled and will be randomized into one of the following 4 arms:

        -  10 patients in the control group (placebo)

        -  10 patients received a dose of 1 million MSC / kg

        -  10 patients received a dose of 2 million MSC / kg.

        -  10 patients received a dose of 4 million MSC / kg

      The follow-up phase of each patient from the cell infusion/placebo will be 6 months.

      At the time that each patient completed the follow-up period (i.e., 6 months after the
      infusion of the cellular product or placebo), the blind will be open, and patients who have
      been assigned to the control group, will receive the cell product as secondary treatment.
      These patients will be randomized to receive each of the doses used in the first phase. From
      this point, they begin a second period of follow up of 6 months.

      In addition, after 6 months of MSC infusion, every patient will continue in an open extension
      study for 36 months to assess the safety of MSC.
