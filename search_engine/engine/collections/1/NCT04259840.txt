      the University of Michigan Graduate Periodontics clinic will be examined and analyzed.
      Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be contacted and invited to
      participate in the study to measure the following in a single visit: bleeding on probing,
      edema, redness of the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implant probing pocket depth.
      Additionally, patients will be asked to complete a survey during their study visit regarding
      their implant(s) and previous peri-implantitis.
