      cognitive-behavioral therapeutic intervention for adolescents reporting mild or moderate drug
      abuse (MMDA). This school-based initiative employs a collaborative effort between the
      University of Minnesota researchers and the St. Paul Public Schools. This intervention aims
      to reduce post-treatment drug use behaviors and enhance drug-use resistant cognitions and
      problem-solving skills.

      Specifically, we propose a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a
      cognitive-behavioral therapy on key process and outcome dimensions among school-based youth
      with mild-to-moderate drug abuse (MMDA). The experimental treatment is designated Brief
      Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (BCBI) given its theoretical foundation in stage of change
      theory used to coordinate modules on Rational-Emotive Therapy and Problem Solving Therapy.
      BCBI will be compared against a second experimental treatment that consists of BCBI and a
      single parent session (BCBI+P) and an assessment only condition (control). The importance of
      clarifying mechanisms in drug treatment research will be explored with respect to a limited
      number of treatment and individual factors that have emerged as promising mediating and
      moderating factors, such as cognitive and problem solving factors, parenting practices, and
      peer group influences.
