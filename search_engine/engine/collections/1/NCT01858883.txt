      includes identifying the MTD of itacitinib (INCB039110) (within a defined pharmacologic
      range) in combination with doses of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel that have established
      safety and tolerability in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Study Part 2 and Part 2A: This phase will explore the safety and tolerability of the MTD or
      PAD of itacitinib (INCB039110) when administered in combination with gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel in subjects with untreated advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
