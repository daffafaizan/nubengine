      two study groups and study the relationship between endemic infections, IA, the FRCn, and CD4
      and CD8 T cell subsets and the magnitude and durability of neutralizing antibody response to
      YFV in a cohort shown to have elevated IA, a damaged FRCn, and pan T cell depletion and a
      cohort that does not. This is a single arm, open-label, two cohort study of healthy adults in
      Kampala, Uganda and in Minnesota, USA. The cohort in Uganda will be 30 adults (15 men and 15
      women) and the cohort in Minnesota will be 16 adults (8 men and 8 women). Everyone will be
      screened to ensure there are no contraindications to receiving YFV (e.g., immunosuppression)
      or the planned procedures. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are discussed in detail in
      the protocol that is included in the appendix. Participants will have an inguinal LN biopsy
      and leukapheresis prior to YFV and again 3 weeks after the vaccine administration. The
      vaccine will be given in the contralateral thigh from the first LN biopsy so that the second
      biopsy will be from a draining LN. PBMC and plasma will be collected at regular intervals
      over the 18-month follow-up period and leukapheresis will be done again at the month 18
      visit.
