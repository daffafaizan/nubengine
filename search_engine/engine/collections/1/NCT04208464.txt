      participate in the trial. Once eligibility is confirmed the participant will be randomised to
      receive 24 weeks of baracitinib from the baseline visit with 12 weeks of follow up or receive
      24 weeks of baracitinib after a delayed-start of 12 weeks from the baseline visit.

      Participants will attend study visits every 4 weeks starting at the baseline visit at week 0.
      At each visit data will be collected about the following:

        1. Muscle function

        2. Signs of disease activity

        3. Vital signs

        4. Physical examination

        5. A blood test to check blood count, liver and kidney function and markers of inflammation
           for safety purposes.

        6. Participant reported assessment of how disease disease is progressing and how it affects
           their day-to-day life.

      In addition the following data will be collected at week 0, week 12, week 24 and week 36:

        1. Signs of disease damage

        2. Blood and urine sample collection for biomarker analysis
