      pharmacological 'boosting' with the cytochrome p450 inhibitor ritonavir. Ritonavir slows the
      hepatic clearance of PIs, increasing plasma concentration and allowing the us eof lower, and
      less frequent doses. Atazanavir, boosted with ritonavir, is approved for once-daily use, is
      an internationally preferred first-line agent (in combination with a backbone of two
      nucleosides [NRTI]) and the most commonly prescribed PI in the UK. Once-daily
      atazanavir/ritonavir with two NRTI is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for
      people living with HIV infection. The most common adverse event associated with atazanavir
      use is unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. This is observed in over 40% of patients and up to
      5% of patients discontinue the drug due jaundice and/or scleral icterus.

      Truvada is a fixed dose combination of two NRTI, tenofovir (245mg) and emtricitabine (200mg),
      administered as one tablet once daily. Truvada is a preferred NRTI backbone in national and
      international guidelines and the first line, therefore most commonly used, NRTI backbone in
      our unit.

      Benefits of atazanavir/ritonavir compared with alternative agents include once daily dosing,
      low pill burden, low rates of gastro-intestinal toxicity and, importantly in a patient
      population already at an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, a favourable lipid profile.
      If a simple intervention could reduce the incidence of hyperbilirubinaemia this could reduce
      the risk of treatment discontinuation/switch. The aim of this study is to explore the
      benefit, and safety, of adding zinc sulphate in patients on a stable regimen of Truvada,
      atazanavir and ritonavir.
