    
      The proposed research is a longitudinal human lab study to involving 6 lab visits and 3
      follow-up surveys at 1, 3, and 6 months after participants' last lab visit. Investigators
      will enroll 30 smokers (â‰¥10 cig/day) who have not used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days and
      have never used e-cigarettes "fairly regularly." After a telephone screening to confirm
      eligibility, participants will attend Virginia Commonwealth University's (VCU) Clinical
      Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory for all lab visits. The specific aims are to:

      Aim 1. Examine how measures of abuse liability and product appeal vary by ECIG device type
      (Markten vs. e-Go).

      Aim 2. Compare differences in abuse liability and product appeal between participants' usual
      brand of tobacco cigarette, Markten, and e-Go.

      Aim 3. As an exploratory aim, examine the extent to which measures of abuse liability and
      product appeal as measured in the lab (including TPPT) predict participants' real-world ECIG
      use at the 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up surveys.

      Aim 4. To monitor safety and tolerability the MarkTen and e-Go among smokers.
