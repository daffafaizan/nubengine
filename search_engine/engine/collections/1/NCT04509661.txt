      studies showed that FEV1<50% is one of the major risk factors for poor prognosis and high
      incidence of acute exacerbation in patients with bronchiectasis. However, there are few
      evidence on the treatment of bronchodilator in bronchiectasis with airflow limitation, and
      there is no recommendation in bronchiectasis guidelines. Moreover, because of the high risk
      of infection and bacterial colonization in bronchiectasis, there is still unclear whether
      inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators affect the parameters of bronchiectasis. Thus,
      there is urgent need to optimize the treatment of bronchiectasis with airflow limitation.
