      will be recruited for the study. Once each subject has satisfied the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria and provided informed consent, the subject will be randomized to either the IVIG or
      placebo treatment groups, using a pre-determined randomization list generated by the research
      office at the University of Calgary. Complete responders will begin a monitoring phase,
      partial and non-responders will return for a second cycle in one month. Complete responders,
      with prolonged relief, will cross-over to the alternative treatment when their pain returns
      if this occurs within 6 months of the infusion.
