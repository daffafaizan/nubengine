      cholecystectomy. The patients are randomly allocated to either group MR (midazolam 0.05mg/kg
      with ramosetron 0.3mg) or group MP (midazolam 0.05mg/kg with palonosetron 0.075mg). The
      incidence of PONV, severity of nausea, use of rescue antiemetics, and pain severity was
      evaluated at 2 hours, 24hours, and 48 hours after surgery.
