      with transthoracic esophagectomy due to esophageal cancer. A radiographic contrast study will
      be performed prior to endoscopy at the 5th to 7th postoperative day. The investigators will
      not be aware of the results of the corresponding examination. Sensitivity, specificity and
      feasibility of the radiologic and endoscopic evaluation of the esophageal substitute will be
      compared.
