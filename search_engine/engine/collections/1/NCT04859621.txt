      infections in infectious diseases and is one of the most common infectious diseases among
      adults. After the first urinary tract infection, the probability of recurrence within half a
      year and within one year was as high as 24% and 70%, respectively. Urinary tract infection
      itself has the characteristics of easy recurrence, which is closely related to the abuse of
      antibiotics, the generation of bacterial resistance, and the decline of local immune function
      of mucosa.

      In the urinary tract, the antibacterial peptide Cathelicidin is mainly located in the
      proximal tubules of the kidney and the epithelial cells of the renal pelvis and ureter. LL37
      is the only antibacterial peptide present in the human body of the Cathelicidin family, which
      can be regarded as a natural antibiotic produced by the body. Antibacterial peptides have a
      broad-spectrum antibacterial effect and can exert antibacterial effects against both
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Vitamin D intake increases the activity of
      endogenous antimicrobial peptides. Preclinical cell test of Zensun Sci. & Tech. Co., Ltd.
      confirmed the induction of LL37 in urethral epithelial cells by vitamin D and its
      broad-spectrum antibacterial effect. Animal experiments also showed the therapeutic effect of
      LL37 on UTI.
