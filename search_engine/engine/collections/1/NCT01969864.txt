      students. Students will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms: a 5-minute video by the U.S. Department
      of Health and Human Services, a 5-minute video by the study principal investigator, or a
      health-related website by the Centers for Disease Control. After viewing the intervention,
      participants will be asked questions including whether they would like to consent to organ
      donation on their state electronic registry.
