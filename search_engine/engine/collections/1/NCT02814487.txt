    
      Patients are selected during a consultation at the Neurology department of the
      Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (France). Each patient is given access to DAM on their own or a
      provided iPhone. During the enrolment visit, patients have to complete a MSFC and DAM
      evaluation (V0). Through a push-notification on their phone, patients are reminded to perform
      two DAM evaluations at home at days 30 (V1) and 60 (V2). At day 90 (V3), they have to come
      back to hospital for a second MSFC and DAM evaluation
