      current infection to be enrolled in the study and have had two other infections within the
      past 12 months. After initial screening to make sure that the vaginal symptoms are due to
      bacterial vaginosis and not the results of a different infection, all of the women will
      receive tinidazole (a drug that is similar to metronidazole) by mouth for 10 days. At the end
      of the 10 days, patients will be re-examined. Those women who are free of bacterial vaginosis
      will enter the second phase of the study, where half of the patients will continue to take
      tinidazole twice a week for twelve weeks and the other half will take no medication. During
      this time participants will be examined by the study doctor every 4 weeks to see how
      effective the treatment has been at preventing the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis. At the
      end of the 12 weeks, women who are still free of bacterial vaginosis will be seen for 3 more
      visits over 3 months.
