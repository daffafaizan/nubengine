    
      Approximately 55 NSCLC subjects with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥ 1% are expected to
      be enrolled in this study. Subjects' TPS will be determined by PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay
      performed according to local laboratory regulations prior to study enrollment.

      Subjects who received adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy are permitted onto the study if the
      therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to the development of metastatic disease.

      Eligible subjects will receive:

      • Vactosertib 300 mg orally (PO) BID for 5 days with 2 days off period (5 days on/2days off)
      and pembrolizumab 200 mg IV on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle (Q3W).
