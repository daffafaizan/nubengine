      vaporization rather than combustion, the generation and inhalation of smoke and carbon
      monoxide (CO) may be reduced or avoided. JUUL has developed several nicotine based liquid
      blends for use in e-cigarettes. This study will provide an understanding of the levels of
      nicotine obtained with use of the company's 1.7% and 5% ENDS products.
