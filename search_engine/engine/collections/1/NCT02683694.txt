      example whether I-OCT assisted membrane peeling is possible without use of dyes for enabling
      better localistion of the ERM during surgery and to compare that scheme with different "gold
      standard" dyes for peeling such as membrane blue dual and triamcinolone. Rationale for that
      study is to work out which setting enables best visualisation of ERM and ILM (ILM) in i-OCT.
      A limitation of that method seems to be visualisation of the inner limiting membrane, so that
      dying of the ILM will probably be still necessary in all cases where ILM-peeling is sheduled.
