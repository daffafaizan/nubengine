    
      Fourty-four patients with hip fracture (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status
      1-3) are being randomized to receive the femoral block with an out-of-plane (needle inserted
      at a 45°-60° angle 1 cm caudal to the midpoint of the ultrasound probe just above the femoral
      nerve) or an in-plane technique (needle inserted 0.5 cm from the side of the probe lateral to
      the femoral nerve). The data collected includes the depth of needle insertion at the endpoint
      before injection, response to nerve stimulation, distribution of the injected volume in
      relation to the nerve (anterior vs posterior, the latter indicating impalement), block
      efficacy at 20 minutes and 24 hours, and any signs of nerve injury).
