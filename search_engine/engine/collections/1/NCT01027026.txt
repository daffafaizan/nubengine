      transferred to their refering hospital same day that they arrived intervention hospital.

      This is to see if one can reduce the hospital stay and costs for the intervention center, and
      the total hospitalization time.

      and this rapid transport not give more medical complications

      Our 1 hypothesis is that patients with ACS, who are transported back to the refering hospital
      the same day, will reduce the length of stay in intervention center without an increase for
      the stay at the refering hospital.

      Our 2 hypothesis is that patients with ACS, who are transported back to the refering hospital
      the same day as the treatment is performed, have no more complications than those who stay
      overnight in the intervention hospital.
