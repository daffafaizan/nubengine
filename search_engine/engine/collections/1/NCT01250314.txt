      micro-architectural parameters (peripheral scan), biological parameters, genetic markers and
      the occurrence of fracture will be analyzed initially by univariate analysis (screening
      process). This will help to reduce the number of variables analyzed at the second stage of
      analysis (i.e. multivariate analysis).

      Expected results: This study will help to evaluate radiological, biochemical and genetic
      determinants of bone quality in men with decreased bone density. It will help to establish a
      prospective study to evaluate predictive factors of fractures in men.
