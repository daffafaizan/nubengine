      kg/m2, have a regular menstrual cycle length 28-30 day and cycle bleed from 3 to 7 days, were
      randomly assigned into three equal groups; two interventions groups (supervised and
      non-supervised active stretching exercise program) and one control group. The intervention
      group A practiced a 30 to 45-minute supervised active stretching program three times a week
      for four weeks, while the other intervention group B practiced non-supervised active
      stretching home program and the control group C . Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to
      measure pain intensity, and Verbal Multidimensional System (VMS) for measuring menstruation
      characteristics and the effect of pain on quality of life, before (pre) as well as after
      (post) 4 weeks at the end of the study .
