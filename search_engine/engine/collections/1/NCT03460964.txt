      developed a flexible, ultra-thin sensor adherent to the skin, similar to a temporary tattoo.
      Sweat glucose correlates with blood glucose. This proposed study would be the first to
      examine this needle-free glucose sensor to measure glucose in endogenous sweat in individuals
      with DM, and would serve as the basis for future development of a continuous, non-invasive
      sensor. The investigators hypothesize that compared with a glucometer, a tattoo sensor can
      accurately measure sweat glucose in patients with DM.
