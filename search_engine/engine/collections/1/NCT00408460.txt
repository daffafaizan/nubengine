      I. To estimate the clinical efficacy of the combination of weekly paclitaxel and intermittent
      imatinib in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of the combination of weekly paclitaxel and intermittent
      imatinib in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

      II. To collect paraffin tissue blocks for a companion project evaluating the expression of
      platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) by original tumor specimens, and its relationship to
      response rate and survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) on days 3, 10, and 17 and imatinib mesylate
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
