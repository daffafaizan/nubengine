      act as an important signal to stimulate muscle protein synthesis after resistance exercise.
      This may explain why consuming rapidly-absorbed whey protein may have an anabolic edge over
      slowly-absorbed proteins such as casein. Previous investigations into importance of the rate
      of absorption to muscle protein synthesis that have used 'fast' and 'slow' proteins have been
      confounded by differences in amino acid composition. The present study addresses this issue
      by administering the same protein source, whey, as either a bolus or in small divided 'pulse'
      doses to achieve divergent amino acid profiles after a bout of resistance exercise.

      This study is being conducted in young (18-35) men.

      Our outcome measures include: blood amino acid concentrations, rates of myofibrillar protein
      synthesis, anabolic intracellular signalling markers
