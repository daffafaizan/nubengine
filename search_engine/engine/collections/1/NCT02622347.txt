      chemiluminescence assay completely and consistently recover added known quantities of FSH on
      top of a known basal serum FSH concentration?

      Spiking-recovery experiment The investigators propose a spiking-recovery experiment in which
      30 serum samples of different women with basal FSH concentration varying between 0-14 IU/L
      will be divided into two equal volume parts and spiked with a specific concentration of rFSH
      (Gonal-F, follitropin alpha; Merck Serono) which will provide a calculated rise in FSH
      concentration similar to in vivo serum levels.

      To perform more reliable testing, the samples will be tested over multiple days.

      Basal FSH spiking experiment In the table below an example is given of different basal FSH
      levels spiked with rFSH diluted 2000 times and the theoretical rise in serum that should be
      established.

      Gonal F concentration is 600 U/L but this concentration unit cannot directly be compared to
      the units used for the for the routine serum FSH measurement (IU/L). From a pilot experiment
      the investigators know that on average 60% of rFSH is picked up by the Beckman-Coulter assay.

      Buffer spiking In order to determine whether recovery is also influenced by properties of
      blood serum, the investigators will conduct another spiking experiment in which different
      concentrations of rFSH will be added to an amount of buffer, with no basal [FSH]; 0,1 M
      phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 with 1-2% of bovine serum albumin (BSA). A calibration line will be
      constructed with 6 concentrations of recF: range 0-40 U/L.
