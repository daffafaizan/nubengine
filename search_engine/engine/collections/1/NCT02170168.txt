      consists of three parts: a standardised care pathway, an educational programme and
      information to general public, patients and their carers. Data from patients, carers and
      health care providers (physicians, nurses and nurse assistants) will be collected before the
      model is implemented (pre-intervention part) and after final implementation
      (post-intervention part). In addition, a comparison with a similar patient population, carers
      and health care providers will be conducted. A local hospital in the county of Romsdal and
      community care in the same region will be used as control.

      Added January 2020: The study was in 2018 extended to also evaluate the effect of
      implementing "advance care planning" in the county of Møre and Romsdal. Møre and Romsdal
      started implementation of "advance care planning" in January 2018. The evaluation of "advance
      care planning in Møre and Romsdal" has the same endpoints as the evaluation of the Orkdal
      model trial. Inclusion of participants (patients, carers and healthcare professionals) is
      from Sept 2018 to sept Sept 2020. Follow-up ends in Sept. 2021.
