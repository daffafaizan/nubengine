      6 (CDK4/6), which activate a family of E2F transcription factors by phosphorylating and
      deactivating the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). LEE011 is an orally, highly selective small
      molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 that potently induces G1 arrest with sub-micromolar IC50's in a
      variety of pRb-positive cancer cells. A recent study showed that an inhibitor of the
      CDK4-CCND1 complex showed promising results in SCCHN pre-clinical models. There is a strong
      rationale to investigate CDK inhibitors in this disease. In phase Ib/II study as a single
      agent, the major toxicities observed were Grade 3 and 4 fatigue (53.8%), nausea (50.8%),
      neutropenia (47.7%), anemia (37.1%), leukopenia (46.2%), thrombocytopenia (34.1%), diarrhea
      (32.6%), vomiting (34.8%), lymphocytes count decreased (30.3%), anorexia (21.2%),
      hyperglycemia (21.2%), constipation (19.7%), hypoalbuminemia (18.9%), dyspnea (18.2%) and
      cough (16.7%).
