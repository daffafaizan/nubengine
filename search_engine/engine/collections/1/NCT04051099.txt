      thyroid and parathyroid operations under bilateral superficial cervical plexus block combined
      with intravenous sedation without general anesthesia. General anesthesia is commonly used for
      neck operations because it is easy to perform. However in high cardiovascular or pulmonary
      risk patients such as end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, regional anesthesia such as
      superficial cervical plexus block combined with intravenous sedation have become an
      alternative technique for neck operations.

      This study evaluate whether regional anesthesia (RA) technique can be the alternative
      technique for thyroid/parathyroid surgery compare to conventional technique (GA).
