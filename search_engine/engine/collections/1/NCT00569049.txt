      expression profiling, proteomic analyses, isolation and analyses of normal and cancer stem
      cells, isolation and analyses of circulating tumor cells, possible analyses of immune cells,
      and possible analyses of serum factors. The tissue may also be used to develop
      patient-specific cell culture models or mouse xenograft models of breast cancer for biologic
      study of tumor progression and metastases and for therapeutic testing. In general, the tissue
      will be used in studies that will molecularly classify tumors, identify prognostic markers,
      identify potential therapeutic markers, identify potential treatment targets, and help us
      better understand the biology and specific role played by different tumor cells in the
      metastatic process.

      The ultimate goal is to use molecular analyses to improve the diagnosis and treatment of
      breast cancer.
