    
      PAD patients (n=200) with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) who are scheduled to undergo
      lower extremity revascularization procedures will be recruited. Patients will be screened
      using a standard medical history questionnaire and a physical activity questionnaire. Once
      their questionnaires are reviewed, individuals who meet inclusion criteria will proceed with
      standard PAD screening, which will include Ankle-Brachial Indices (ABIs) and Toe-Brachial
      Indices (TBIs) of both lower extremities. Patients will undergo SPECT/CT or PET/CT perfusion
      imaging prior to their revascularization procedure and 1-14 days following revascularization.
      Subjects will receive an intravenous injection of a standard clinical dose of radiotracer for
      both imaging sessions. A low-dose CT scan will be performed immediately after each SPECT and
      PET image acquisition for the purposes of attenuation correction and regional analysis of
      radiotracer uptake. Clinical outcomes will be evaluated for up to 12 months after the imaging
      study to assess the prognostic value of perfusion imaging for predicting subsequent outcomes.
