      surgery is critical to delivering safe, value-based care. Measurement after TKA has
      traditionally been accomplished through clinician in-office assessments, validated surveys,
      or both; subjectivity, cost-effectiveness, and inconsistent reporting limit these
      assessments. Leveraging now ubiquitous smartphone technology and smart wearable technology
      with machine learning software offers the opportunity to remotely monitor patients before and
      after surgery. This provides surgeons, hospitals, and stakeholders the opportunity to
      objectively quantify (1) patient compliance, (2) value of a given surgical procedure with
      unprecedented benchmarking, and, more importantly, (3) the better triage of those needing
      increased perioperative attention. Regardless of the orthopaedic procedure, a motion-based
      machine learning software application to commercial mobile and wearable technology readily
      and inexpensively unlocks the potential of delivering value-based care through the low
      maintenance acquisition of both precision, small data that may then be extrapolated to
      population-level revelations from big data regardless of the joint or extremity. With the
      rise of telemedicine, clinical validation of the technology is of mutual interest to
      orthopaedic patients, surgeons, administrators, payers, and policymakers.
