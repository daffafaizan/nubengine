    
      Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Women at
      high-risk of preterm birth are those with a previous spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) or
      preterm premature rupture of membranes before 35 weeks of gestation, uterine malformation,
      surgery on uterine cervix or a short cervical length; these women have a global risk of PTB
      about 30% but still 75%-85% of these women will deliver at term without any intervention.

      The availability of a specialized Preterm Birth Prevention Clinic (PBPC) is relevant for the
      management of these high-risk pregnant women and it results in a reduction in the risk of
      recurrent sPTB, pregnancy prolongation and a reduction in the rate of major neonatal
      morbidity. However, it implies higher outpatient care costs as well as trained personnel and
      intensive follow-up management even for those women not destined to deliver preterm QUIPP is
      a free smartphone application that integrates the obstetrical history of high-risk women, the
      cervical length and the value of quantitative fetal fibronectin to predict the risk of
      preterm birth. QUIPP will determinate the risk of preterm birth in these high-risk women.

      Patients will be randomized in two groups: Intervention group (QUIPP tool arm): QUIPP tool is
      applied and patients with a high-risk result will be follow-up in a high-risk unit (PBPC) and
      patients with a low-risk value will be managed in a low-risk unit. Control group (no QUIPP
      tool arm): current management in a PBPC will be applied.

      The use of QUIPP will allow determining which asymptomatic pregnancies with risk factors for
      sPTB will deliver preterm. Furthermore, we expect to provide the non-specialized clinician
      with an objective, useful, accurate and efficient tool to manage these women with same
      pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and using less resource.
