      consists of 2 stable layers that when placed together release Nitric Oxide. In preclinical
      studies NOx delivery has caused significant vasodilation, angiogenesis and demonstrated
      potent anti-microbial activity.

      In part 1 of the study, the dressing will be applied to up to 20 DFUs for a set period and
      the blood flow in and around the wound will be measured before and after application of the
      dressing. Any adverse events will be recorded.

      If an increase in blood flow is seen and the dressing is well tolerated, part 2 will begin,
      which is a multi-centre, 120 patient, randomised, controlled study. 60 patients with chronic
      DFUs will be treated with the NOx generating dressing and 60 patients will continue to
      receive standard of care. The efficacy and the tolerability of the dressing will be measured.

      The NOx dressing will be changed at least every 2 days and the standard of care changed as in
      normal clinical practice.

      At weekly clinical visits the diameter, area and volume of the wound will be measured. The
      infective status of the wound will be assessed and the inflammatory profile of the wound will
      be measured.
