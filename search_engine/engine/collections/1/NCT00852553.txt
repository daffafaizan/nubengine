      resections for non-obstructive neoplasms at the UC Davis Medical Center will be used. Samples
      will be taken from tissue normally removed and sent to Pathology or discarded. Full thickness
      segments of intestine (10 mm x 1 mm) will be prepared for recording either intracellular
      electrical activity or mechanical contraction. The effects of putative non-adrenergic,
      non-cholinergic neurotransmitters (e.g., nitric oxide) will be studied. The source of the
      tissue will not be identified either directly or indirectly through identifiers associated
      with the measured responses.
