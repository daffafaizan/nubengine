      containing resveratrol (trademark Genante) on gamete quality in order to improve the
      reproductive protocols during Assisted reproductive technology (ART) protocols.

      The study is a randomized, single blind, parallel, comparative, experimental study during the
      pre-treatment before in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). A total number of 100
      patients will be enrolled: 50 patients with a pretreatment control group (control group) and
      50 patients with experimental pretreatment study group (resveratrol group). Patients will be
      assigned to groups during the recruitment phase in a randomized manner. In the control group,
      the treatment will consist of taking 400 microg once a day of folic acid commonly suggested
      as part of clinical practice, while in the Resveratrol Group, patients will receive one
      tablet twice a day (two tablets/day) of Genante. It is specified that the pretreatment with
      Genante includes folic acid in accordance with the clinical practice, 400 total microg per
      day. Both treatments will last for 3 months before the IVF procedure.
