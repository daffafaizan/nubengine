    
      Objective: In this study, a new bowel preparation regime of the colon capsule is used.This
      regime combines free-residue nutrients and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to achieve a better
      preparation quality.

      Methods: Participants who underwent a diagnostic colonoscopy examination that demonstrated a
      colorectal polyps that required endoscopic treatment will be recruited to patients in the
      study. The first 32 participants receive a traditional low fiber diet two days before the
      test.Then the patients will take 2L polyethylene glycol (PEG) at 21:00-23:00 before the test
      day and 2L PEG at 05:00-07:00 on the test day for bowel preparation. The subsequent 30
      participants receive two-days free-residue nutrients without other diet before the test.Then
      the patients will take 2L PEG at 05:00-07:00 on the examination day for bowel preparation.
      Then they will take 5mg mosapride citrate at 8:00 and ingest the colon capsule at 8:30.0.75L
      and 0.50L PEG are administered as boosters.And the therapeutic endoscopy will be given on the
      following day.Before the therapeutic colonoscopy, the participants will take 2L PEG. The
      colon capsule results will be reviewed by two experienced endoscopists who are blinded to
      first endoscopy results.
