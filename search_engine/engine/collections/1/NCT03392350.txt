      workers (n= 173), active military personnel (n= 57) and community college staff (n= 37).
      Subjects were randomized either to an intervention group or to usual care. The intervention
      group received The RENEWâ„¢ Program (www.therenewprogram.net) of lifestyle intervention as
      described below. A whole body CT scan was performed using a multidetector CT scan on all
      participants at baseline with the results discussed by a physician only in the intervention
      group, and after 2 years of follow-up a repeat scan was performed with a detailed evaluation
      of the results discussed by a physician with all participants (in part as a motivation to
      complete thestudy). This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the
      Western Institutional Review Board with written informed consent from all subjects. All
      subjects gavewritten informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The
      protocol wasapproved by the Western Institutional Review Board.
