      be beneficial and useful for children. The study protocol specifies 4 study visits over the
      course of a year at the following intervals: baseline, 3 month, 6 month, 12 months. In
      following the protocol, each study visit will use the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric
      Control (ACMC) functional testing. The study participants will also complete several
      parent-child reported health related quality of life and musculoskeletal questionnaires.
      Specifically, the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI), the Pediatric
      Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and the Children's Hand-Use Experience Questionnaire
      (CHEQ) will be used to measure efficacy of the myoelectric devices..
