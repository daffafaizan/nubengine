      suboptimal CD4 recovery despite viral suppression. The investigators have also shown that
      immune activation and exhaustion are significantly higher among patients that do not exhibit
      satisfactory rise in CD4 counts despite viral suppression (suboptimal responders); when
      compared with their counterparts with viral suppression and satifactory CD4 count recovery
      (optimal responders). Given that atorvastatin changes immune activation in this pilot study,
      then larger studies can be done to understand its effect on CD4 count increase among
      suboptimal responders.
