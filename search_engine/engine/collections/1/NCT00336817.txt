    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, single center, safety and efficacy study
      comparing Myfortic with CellCept used after liver transplantation. Patients with
      biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection, renal insufficiency (i.e. acute or chronic renal
      failure requiring hemodialysis or patients with creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min), or
      calcineurin inhibitor-induced neurotoxicity (defined as the presence of neurologic symptoms
      such as tremors, altered mental status, seizures, etc) will be randomized to start on either
      Myfortic (720 mg po bid) or CellCept (1 gm po bid). In those patients with
      calcineurin-induced neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, tacrolimus or cyclosporine doses will
      also be reduced to maintain serum trough levels of 4-8 mg/dl or 100-200 mg/dl, respectively.

      Comparison: Thirty patients will be enrolled and randomized in this two-armed, double-blinded
      study- half of the patients will receive Myfortic and the other half, CellCept.
