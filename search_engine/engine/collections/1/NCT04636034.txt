      study. The patients will be randomised into three groups; bilateral SPG-block withto receive
      local anesthetic (lidocaine + ropivacaine), bilateral SPG-block with placebo (isotone NaCl)
      or bilateral "sham"-block with placebo (isotone NaCl).

      Primary outcome is hyperactivity in the sphenopalatine ganglion assessed by pain intensity
      (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) of the headache in standing position 30 minutes
      after block in the group Ropicavain-Lidocain and "sham".
