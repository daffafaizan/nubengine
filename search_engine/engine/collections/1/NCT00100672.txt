    
      This Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study is designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of LErafAON-ETU in patients who have advanced cancer considered unresponsive
      to available, conventional modalities or treatments. LErafAON-ETU will be administered as an
      IV infusion once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (a Treatment Cycle). A complete
      pharmacokinetic profile of raf-1 antisense oligonucleotide will be assessed in week 1 only;
      limited pharmacokinetic sampling will be done prior to and at the end of infusion in weeks 2
      and 3 only. Tumor/disease evaluation will be performed upon completion of 6 infusions (2
      Cycles). Dose escalation will not occur until the safety and tolerability at a given dose
      level has been confirmed for 1 Cycle.
