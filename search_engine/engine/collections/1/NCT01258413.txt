    
      Background: Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is one of the FIGO
      (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) recommended treatments for early
      cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to compare radical hysterectomy by
      laparoscopic approach and open radical hysterectomy in a single center randomized clinical
      trial. Nevertheless, there are no finished randomized controlled trials comparing
      laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and abdominal radical hysterectomy although there is an
      ongoing trial.

      Methods: Were enrolled 30 IA2 with lymph vascular space invasion and IB cervical cancer
      patients. Postoperative pain intensity was defined as primary endpoint and pain intensity was
      measured by a 10-point numeric rating scale. Secondary outcomes were: intraoperative and
      other postoperative outcomes, histopathological outcomes and 5-year follow-up. Data analysis
      is being done at this moment
