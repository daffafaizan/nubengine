      patients innovatively .If patients'conditions met our defined criterions, the investigators
      randomly allocate two groups. One group adopts traditional weaning strategy, the other adopts
      Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation. If patients' condition deteriorated in group two,
      the investigators turned them to invasive positive pressure ventilation, until patients
      adapted in a satisfactory condition, the investigators shift them into Noninvasive Positive
      Pressure Ventilation. The investigators will extubate the tracheotomy tube, if patients are
      received Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation more than 24 to 48 hours. After
      extubation, the investigators try to wean Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation.
      Successful wean is defined weaning mechanical ventilation more than 48 hours.
