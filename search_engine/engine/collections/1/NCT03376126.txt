      patients with in-transit metastases of melanoma and locally advanced extremity sarcomas.
      There are several advantages for each method, but if the well-established effects of ILP
      could be combined to the minimally invasive approach of ILI, the results could be maximized
      and adverse events, related to open approach, minimized.

      A new method for vascular approach (MI-ILP) will be evaluated in a phase I feasibility study.
      Percutaneous vascular access of the ipsilateral side will be performed by ultrasound guided
      technique and connected to an extracorporeal oxygenation system. Perfusion will be conducted
      in the same way as for open ILP. Outcomes, technical details and complications will be
      recorded prospectively.
