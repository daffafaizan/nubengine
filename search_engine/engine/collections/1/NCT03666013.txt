      -function. If a causal link exists between the loss of mitochondrial function and muscle
      health is unknown, however, both appear with advancing age and are associated with the loss
      of functional capacity, which increases comorbidities and annual healthcare costs. The aim is
      to test the hypothesis that a compromised muscle function in sedentary elderly is related to
      an impaired mitochondrial health. A detailed characterization of mitochondrial metabolism and
      muscle function is performed in well-defined, (physically compromised) elderly humans, in a
      cross-sectional design. To obtain insight in the relation between mitochondrial health and
      muscle function, not only elderly subjects that differ in mitochondrial function (based on
      physical activity) will be compared but also elderly subjects with high versus low muscle
      physical function will be selected. Healthy, young (20-30 years,) individuals with normal
      physical activity levels will be included as absolute controls.
