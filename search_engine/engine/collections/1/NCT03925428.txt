    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK525762C and entinostat in combination
      in patients with advanced and refractory solid tumors and lymphomas based on dose limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) of the combination of GSK525762C and entinostat.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the safety profile of GSK525762C and entinostat in advanced and refractory
      solid tumors and lymphomas.

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of GSK525762C and entinostat in advanced and
      refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.

      III. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and
      overall survival (OS) of GSK525762C and entinostat in this patient population.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on apoptosis, as measured by an
      apoptosis multiplex immunoassay.

      II. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on c-MYC and YAP1 as measured
      by ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein expression.

      III. To assess the effect of GSK525762C and entinostat therapy on tumor burden and gene
      expression patterns as measured by whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq)
      on circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) specimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and molibresib PO once
      daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
