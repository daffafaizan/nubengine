      good outcomes in distance acuity. However, some patients, particularly those developing
      parafoveal scotoma, still had difficulty in reading. Inability to read or reading very slowly
      leads to the potential loss of job, as well as the enjoyment of reading for leisure.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading
      rehabilitation using perceptual learning paradigms in enhancing reading performance in
      patients with reading difficulties due to DMO. Also, the fundamental mechanisms explaining
      the reading problems in patients with DMO reading Chinese will be examined.

      The investigators hypothesize that the perceptual training would show an improvement in
      reading. The investigators' primary hypothesis is that temporal visual processing speed and
      spatial visual span will be improved after perceptual training. The investigators' secondary
      hypothesis is that the reading speed and fixation stability will be improved after training.
