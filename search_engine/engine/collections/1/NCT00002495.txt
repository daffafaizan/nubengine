      IA/IIA Hodgkin's disease who have not undergone laparotomy and who are randomized to
      treatment with subtotal nodal irradiation with vs. without 3 courses of
      doxorubicin/vinblastine. II. Compare the long-term toxicities associated with these
      treatments, including cardiopulmonary toxicity, secondary malignancies, and infertility. III.
      Identify subgroups of patients (based on age, gender, tumor histology, number of disease
      sites, and presence of high neck presentation) that are particularly responsive to these
      treatments.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Subtotal nodal irradiation using megavoltage
      equipment (4-10 MeV). Arm II: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by Radiotherapy.
      Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Vinblastine, VBL, NSC-49842; followed by subtotal nodal
      irradiation as in Arm I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 210 patients/arm will be enrolled over about 7 years.
