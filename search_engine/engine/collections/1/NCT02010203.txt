    
      This study is a two part study: Phase I and Phase II. The Phase 1 portion is an open-label,
      safety study. Patients will have previously received 3-6 instillations of weekly intravesical
      Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) induction therapy (as standard of care) followed by low dose
      intradermal (1*10^6 cells) HS-410 monotherapy. In Phase 2, patients will be assigned to
      treatment groups based on whether they will receive induction BCG in the typical post-TURBT
      window. If the investigator plans to administer BCG, patients will be randomized to one of
      three blinded (physician-patient), placebo-controlled groups and receive either intradermal
      placebo or low dose (1*10^6 cells) or high dose (1*10^7 cells) vesigenurtacel-L in
      combination with induction and maintenance intravesical BCG. If patients will not receive
      BCG, they will be enrolled into an open-label, non-randomized group and receive high dose
      (1*10^7 cells) intradermal HS-410 monotherapy.
