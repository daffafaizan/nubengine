      obesity who will undergo RYGB (intervention arm) or receive BMT (control arm).

      Thirty (30) obese patients with DKD will undergo gastric bypass. Patients will also receive
      standard of care medical therapy for DKD (ACEI or ARB + SGLT2i) and T2DM (metformin,
      glitazones, incretin therapy - DPP4 inhibitor and GLP-1 analogs - and insulin, if necessary).
      Other comorbidities, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, will be treated according to the
      latest recommendations of the ADA. The surgical procedure will consist of a laparoscopic
      surgery performed by an experienced surgeon (approximately 6000 bariatric surgeries), who is
      accredited as surgeon of excellence by the Brazilian Society of Bariatric and Metabolic
      Surgery and Surgical Review and Surgical Review Corporation program since 2009.

      Thirty (30) obese patients with DKD will undergo best medical treatment for DKD (ACEI or ARB
      + SGLT2i) and T2DM (metformin, glitazones, incretin therapy - DPP4 inhibitor and GLP-1
      analogs - and insulin, if necessary). Other comorbidities, such as hypertension and
      dyslipidemia, will be treated according to the latest recommendations of the ADA.

      Regarding medication therapy: Metformin will be maintained in the postoperative period while
      fasting glycemia is above 100 mg/dL unless contraindicated. Anti-antihypertensive drugs and
      medications for dyslipidemia will be maintained in the postoperative period, unless
      contraindicated. Micronutrient supplementation (vitamins and mineral salts) will be
      prescribed to all patients undergoing metabolic surgery. Patients allocated to the control
      group will receive the same supplementation if necessary.
