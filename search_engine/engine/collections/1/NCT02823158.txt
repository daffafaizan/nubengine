      proven in advanced PD, and the contraindications for this treatment are rather well
      established. Also, the observation that patients fulfilling the "STN-profile" but who had
      been operated for pallidal DBS and lost part of the treatment's benefit over time, improved
      when stimulated later in the STN (instead of the GPi) shows that patients qualifying for
      STN-DBS do not have as good a result with GPi-DBS.

      GPi stimulation may be used in patients who do not qualify for STN stimulation. Especially
      postural instability, age over 70 years, and mild to moderate cognitive deficits are commonly
      considered to be exclusion criteria for STN stimulation but not for GPi stimulation.
      Therefore, the investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial of GPi
      stimulation in patients with PD and motor complications who have relative or absolute
      contraindications for STN stimulation.
