      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)) who live in tropical
      regions experience vitamin D deficiency, especially in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The presence
      of vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphism genes, TaqI and FokI, is one of the predisposing
      factors, as is high levels of inflammatory markers, also indicating disease progression and
      malnutrition. This study aims to assess the effect of 50 g of soy-catfish-anchovy-rice (SCAR)
      porridge per day for 14 days on 25(OH)D, calcium, and biomolecular serum levels in patients
      with VDR gene polymorphisms (TaqI or FokI). The study was a parallel, open, clinical trial. A
      total of 43 subjects with the VDR gene polymorphisms were selected. The subjects were divided
      into two groups using block randomization. There were 22 subjects in the intervention group
      (I) who received 50 g of SCAR porridge once per day, along with dietary counseling, and 21
      subjects in the control group (C) who only received dietary counseling. All subjects in both
      groups completed the study.
