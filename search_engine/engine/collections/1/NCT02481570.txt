      effects based on a computer simulation. The data will be provided as a suggestion and will be
      used together with all the other information normally used to keep the study subjects safely
      asleep during surgery. In addition, data will be collected from the medical history and on
      postoperative pain control and medication side effects for the first 24 hours. Specifically,
      study subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a 10-point scale after they wake up from
      surgery and once they arrive in the pediatric intensive care unit. Measures of the time from
      the end of surgery until the study subjects are awake and out of the operating room will also
      be collected.
