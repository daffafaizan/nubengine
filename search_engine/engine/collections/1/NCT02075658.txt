      improvement.

      The benefits of laparoscopic surgery to patient comfort and recovery have been made with
      procedures such as the cholecystectomy and gastric bypass. The AirSeal® System consists of an
      insufflation, filtration, and recirculation system (AirSeal® IFS), a triple lumen filtered
      tube set, and a valve free trocar (AirSeal® Access Port). The device enables peritoneal
      access with a novel mechanism to maintain pneumoperitoneum without a mechanical seal.
      Specifically, the AirSeal® System creates a pressure barrier within the proximal housing of
      the cannula which acts as an invisible seal to maintain pneumoperitoneum during the course of
      surgery. It utilizes a re-circulation and filtration control unit (AirSeal® IFS) designed
      specifically for the AirSeal® Access Port to create and maintain the pressure barrier. The
      AirSeal® System has applications in abdominal minimally invasive surgical procedures to
      establish a path of entry for laparoscopic instruments. The insufflation and recirculation
      system (AirSeal® IFS) is reusable and the AirSeal® Access Port and triple lumen filtered tube
      set are designed as single patient use devices. The 1st generation AirSeal® System received
      FDA 510(k) clearance in 2007 and the current system received FDA 510(k) Clearance in May
      2011. Since that time, the AirSeal™ system has been used routinely in centers throughout the
      United States and has been observed by surgeons and anesthesia teams to provide a more
      gentle, stable, and consistent pneumoperitoneum. Initial evidence of this has reported in the
      literature1. Kavoussi and colleagues state; "We have found that patients had blunted
      end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and CO2 elimination rates compared with the CO2
      elimination rates observed in studies evaluating transperitoneal laparoscopy using the
      conventional trocar. To determine if a difference truly exists, CO2 elimination rates must be
      prospectively analyzed in a head to head comparison between valve-less and conventional
      trocars." This study is designed to compare the physiological impact and pulmonary compliance
      of patients undergoing laparoscopic/robotic renal or peri-renal surgery with and without the
      AirSeal® System.
