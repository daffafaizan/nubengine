    
      A phase 2 open-label, randomized, multi-center trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      neoadjuvant trastuzumab, pertuzumab and weekly paclitaxel (THP) as compared to neoadjuvant
      trastuzumab, pertuzumab, pembrolizumab and weekly paclitaxel (THP-K), or neoadjuvant
      trastuzumab, pembrolizumab and weekly paclitaxel (TH-K) in chemo naive patients with invasive
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer whose primary tumors
      are > 2 cm and/or clinically lymph node positive.

      Patients will be randomized to either Arm A: THP (trastuzumab, pertuzumab and weekly
      paclitaxel), Arm B: THP-K (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, pembrolizumab and weekly paclitaxel) or
      Arm C: TH-K (trastuzumab, pembrolizumab and weekly paclitaxel). Patients will be stratified
      according to hormone receptor status and lymph node status. All patients will be treated
      weekly every three weeks for four cycles (only paclitaxel will be administered weekly) and
      then undergo breast surgery. Arm A patients will be regarded as the reference group.
