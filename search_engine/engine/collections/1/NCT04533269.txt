    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter study that
      will be used to evaluate the difference in bruise reduction efficacy between active remedy
      and placebo when a mechanical bruise is induced. The trial will be conducted at 5-8 sites
      with up to 150 subjects. Each subject will be injured two times using the same
      bruise-inducing mechanism, and the resulting bruises will be treated with active remedy or
      placebo-infused pads that will be identical in appearance. Subjects and study investigators
      will be blinded to the order of treatment assignment. Subjects will be asked to come to the
      clinic for photographic assessments of the bruise. Each subject will be randomly assigned to
      have a placebo or active remedy pad applied over each mechanically induced bruise on Day 1.
      The pad will be applied by study staff immediately after bruise induction (within 5 minutes).
      The pad will cover the bruised area completely, and then sealed with Tegaderm. All
      procedures, including bruise induction, treatment, and photography, will be administered by
      study staff who are blinded to treatment type. All photographs will be rated according to
      standardized criteria by blinded, trained study investigators after the completion of all
      subject data collection.
