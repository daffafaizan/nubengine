      participants are eligible after the online screen, they will be invited in for an in person
      assessment, including cognitive testing and a diagnostic interview, to determine eligibility.
      After the assessment, they will be informed of their eligibility status and, if applicable,
      randomized to Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) or treatment as usual (TAU).
      Participants in the MBCT group will complete 8 weekly, 2 hr group therapy sessions during
      pregnancy, as well as receive TAU. The TAU group will engage in regular care during pregnancy
      and be offered the option to attend one mindfulness psychoeducation session postpartum.
      Participants in the MBCT group will complete questionnaires prior to the 1st group session,
      after the 4th session, and after the 8th/final session. Participants in the TAU group will
      complete the same questionnaires at equivalent time points. All participants will come in for
      an in-person session at 34 weeks GA, during which they will complete questionnaires and a
      brief clinical interview. Participants will come in for an MRI scan session at 6 weeks
      postpartum. In addition to structural and functional MRI scanning, they will also complete
      questionnaires, a cognitive task, and brief psychiatric interview. At 6 months postpartum,
      participants will return for a visit, during which they will complete questionnaires,
      cognitive measures, and a clinical interview. This will be the final visit for women in the
      MBCT group. Women in the TAU group will complete a singe mindfulness psychoeducation session
      between 6 and 9 months postpartum; this must occur after their 6 month visit.
