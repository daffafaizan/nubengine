      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity, by confirmed response rate, of concurrent irinotecan
           hydrochloride and cetuximab in patients with metastatic breast cancer with prior
           anthracycline and/or taxane-containing therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Estimate 6-month, progression-free survival of patients.

        -  Evaluate the adverse event profile of irinotecan hydrochloride in combination with
           cetuximab in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Estimate progression-free survival of patients.

        -  Estimate overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 1Â½ hours on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38 patients will be accrued for this study.
