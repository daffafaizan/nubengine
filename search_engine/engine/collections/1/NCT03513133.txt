      will be included if they suffer from a deficit in working memory. They will receive a
      specific hierarchical training of working memory (3 sessions per week during three months),
      according to a previously described methodology.

      A multimodal MRI will be performed at neuroSpin center (CEA, Orsay, France) before and after
      cognitive training, including: structural imaging (T1, FLAIR and diffusion tensor imaging,
      DTI); functional connectivity at rest; and functional activation during a working memory task
      (n-back).

      Behavioral and imaging changes after training will be analysed individually and compared to a
      group of healthy controls matched for age, gender and education.
