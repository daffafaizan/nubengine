      cycle prior to embryo transfer cycle is effective or not in increasing pregnancy rates.
      Previous studies about this issue have not shown clear conclusions about the effectiveness of
      this method.

      The endometrial scratch is a simple technique that consists in performing a mild injury to
      all the internal walls of the uterus with a Pipelle Cournier.

      To achieve the trial objective, all participating patients are randomly divided into two
      groups. Once patients decide to participate in the trial, they are assigned to each group
      according to the randomization list:

      Group A: Patients with transfer of fresh embryos after taking an endometrium biopsy during
      the previous cycle and then following the conventional preparation protocol.

      Group B: Patients with transfer of fresh embryos with the conventional preparation protocol.
