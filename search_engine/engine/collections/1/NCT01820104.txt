      inhibitors (PPIs) as adjunctive therapy might improve diabetes control and could enhance the
      hypoglycemic activity of DPP4, but there is little clinical data on efficacy of this
      therapeutic strategy. We sought to examine the effect of PPI (lansoprazole), DPP4
      (sitagliptin), and their combination therapy on insulin and glucose regulation in healthy
      subjects in oral glucose tolerance (OGTT).
