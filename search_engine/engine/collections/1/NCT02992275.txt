      mass and strength contribute to balance and mobility limitations. Our more recent work also
      suggests that in addition to the traditional targets of muscle mass of the thigh and leg
      muscles, dysfunction of the hip abductors may contribute to balance and mobility limitations
      resulting in increased fall risk. Older adults with impaired hip abductor muscles demonstrate
      increased amounts of intramuscular fat (IMAT) in and around the muscles, decreased hip
      abductor strength, lower balance scores, increased gait variability (a predictor of future
      falls), and poor stepping mechanics when recovering from a balance perturbation. Increased
      IMAT and muscle dysfunction of the hip abductors may contribute to poor hip abductor muscle
      recruitment and make changing these muscle during a traditional intervention difficult.
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is one method to improve muscle mass, strength
      and quality in older adults, but has not traditionally been used on the hip abductors. We
      propose that a targeted multimodality balance intervention (MMBI) focused on the lateral and
      diagonal stepping and hip abductor strengthening when combined with NMES will result in
      improvements in mobility and balance.
