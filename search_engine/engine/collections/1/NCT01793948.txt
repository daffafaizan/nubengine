      I. To determine the changes in the signal pathway profiling of breast tissue using reverse
      phase proteomics in tissue biopsy of overweight or obese women at elevated risk for breast
      cancer treated with metformin (metformin hydrochloride) (850mg orally twice a day) for 12
      cycles.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of metformin on breast tissue density of overweight or obese women
      at elevated risk for breast cancer using qualitative mammographic fat density criteria.

      II. To determine the effect of metformin on the insulin axis in serum of overweight or obese
      women at elevated risk for breast cancer treated with metformin (850mg orally twice a day)
      for 12 cycles.

      III. To determine the toxicities associated with metformin.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride by mouth once daily on days 1-30 in course 1
      and twice daily on days 1-30 thereafter. Treatment repeats every 30 days for 12 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo by mouth once daily on days 1-30 in course 1 and twice daily
      on days 1-30 thereafter. Treatment repeats every 30 days for 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
