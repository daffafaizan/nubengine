      study will use a variety of clinical scales, including a flushing scale derived from a
      validated questionnaire [Norquist 2007], to better understand the safety and tolerability of
      several doses and dosing regimens of BG00012 up to a total daily dose of 720 mg. The etiology
      of BG00012-induced flushing will be assessed by collecting relevant biomarker data and the
      impact of ASA on flushing will be evaluated. Assessments relating to GI symptoms will also be
      performed.
