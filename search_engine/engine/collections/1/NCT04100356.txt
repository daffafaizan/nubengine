      composition and improve many different health related blood parameters such as cholesterol
      and glucose tolerance.

      Exercise has superior effect on skeletal muscle in the context of glucose tolerance, but
      adherence to exercise program can be a huge challenge for overweight individuals. While
      exercise has profound effect on metabolic health, diet has been superior when it comes to
      weight reduction. Previous studies have shown that 5-7% weight loss can improve glucose
      tolerance, measured as reduced fasting glucose and reduced 2-hour post prandial glucose.

      We wish to see if the combination exercise and diet is superior to diet only when it comes to
      over all health.
