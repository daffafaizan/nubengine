      expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene. The gene encodes for a 210aa mitochondrial
      protein called frataxin, whose mRNA and protein levels are severely reduced in FA. It has
      been suggested that frataxin is involved in iron-sulphur cluster and heme biogenesis, iron
      binding/storage, and chaperone activity. Clinically, the age of onset is generally around
      puberty and, as the disease progresses, there is increasing ataxia of the limbs, and
      eventually most patients are wheelchair bound by the twenties. Cardiomyopathy with myocardial
      hypertrophy occurs very often and is the predominant cause of death. Type II diabetes,
      scoliosis, foot deformities, optic atrophy, and deafness are other relatively frequent
      symptoms.

      Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein that acts as a main regulator for erythropoiesis.
      Evidence suggests that both EPO and its receptor are expressed in the nervous tissue, and
      neuroprotective effects have been shown in animal models of cerebral ischemic damage. EPO
      increases frataxin levels in cultured human lymphocytes from FRDA patients. However, frataxin
      protein increase is not preceded by mRNA increase, suggesting that a post-transcriptional
      mechanism is involved. To date, four phase II clinical trials have been published regarding
      the use of EPO in FRDA patients.
