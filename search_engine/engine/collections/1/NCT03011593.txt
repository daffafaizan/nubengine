      product on quality of life in adults with compromised gut function and malabsorption. Adults
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or celiac disease were
      enrolled in the study and asked to take the study product for 6 weeks. The primary measure of
      the study was a validated quality of life questionnaire, the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life
      Index (GIQLI). Secondary measures included the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire
      (IBDQ), the Celiac Disease Questionnaire (CDQ), and the Digestive Symptom Frequency
      Questionnaire (DSFQ).
