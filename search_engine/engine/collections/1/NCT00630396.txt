      (FDA) for treatment of infections and acne. However, doctors do not know whether minocycline
      will work in stroke patients. Its use in stroke patients is experimental. There is a lot of
      information from experimental stroke studies in animals that minocycline lessens the damage
      from a stroke and the animals recover better. Since minocycline is generally a very safe drug
      in humans and does not have a lot of side effects, investigators at Georgia Health Sciences
      University (formerly the Medical College of Georgia) believe that it might be a safe and
      effective drug to improve the outcome in patients with stroke.
