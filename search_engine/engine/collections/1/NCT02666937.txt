        1. Prospective part: Patients in the ICU, the emergency room and the pulmonary function
           department of the VU university medical centre will be included. Arterial blood gas
           analysis is a tool often used to determine PaO2 in regular care. When an arterial blood
           gas analysis is performed for regular patient care, the corresponding SpO2 is measured.
           Information such as blood pressure, heart rate, amount of administered fluids and
           shock-related-parameters are obtained from the patient files. For the ICU patients
           capillary refill, acra temperature and the mottling scores are examined. The peripheral
           flow index and temperature index is measured. When more arterial blood gas samples are
           drawn over time in one patient, multiple datasets can be included per patient, as long
           as the samples are drawn two hours apart.

        2. Retrospective part: Patients with a (suspected) pulmonary disease who underwent
           pulmonary function tests with arterial bloodgas sampling in the VU medical center and
           Medical Centre Alkmaar in the last 25 years. The PaO2 and corresponding SpO2 will be
           obtained from the test and parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate and
           administered oxygen will be retrieved from the databases with these test results.
