      progressive supranuclear palsy can be very difficult in early disease. PD, MSA and PSP are
      neurodegenerative disorders. PD and MSA belong to the alpha-synucleinopathies, which are
      characterized by the abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Alpha-synuclein accumulates in
      intraneuronal Lewy bodies in PD patients and as intracytoplasmic glial inclusions in MSA. In
      PSP, tau protein accumulates in neurons and glia cells while alpha-synuclein deposits are
      only found to a small extend.

      The development of biological markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of PD, MSA and PSP
      remains an unmet need. Beyond guiding clinical decision-making, such biological markers are
      crucial for future disease-modification and neuroprotection trials.

      Alpha-synuclein has a high potential for biomarker development since it constitutes the
      pathological hallmark feature of PD and MSA. The oligomeric alpha-synuclein fraction whose
      CSF levels are increased in PD seems to be particularly involved in abnormal protein
      aggregation in alpha-synucleinopathies.

      The main objective of the study is to compare oligomeric alpha-synuclein CSF levels between
      PD, MSA and PSP patients. Secondary objectives are (i) to compare total alpha-synuclein
      levels and the index total/oligomeric alpha-synuclein between PD, MSA and PSP, (ii) to study
      the correlation and concordance between CSF and plasma levels of total and oligomeric
      alpha-synuclein, (iii) to assess potential associations between the biomarker and clinical
      measures of disease severity and progression and (iv) to assess the variation of the
      biomarker over time and its correlation to disease severity and progression.
