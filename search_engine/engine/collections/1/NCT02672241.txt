      to the extracellular domain of EGFR, which blocks the binding of EGF and transforming growth
      factor-Î± to EGFR. High expression of EGFR protein in glioma has been associated with tumor
      progression and enhanced tumorigenicity. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the
      anti-tumor effects of nimotuzumab, such as head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer15. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination of
      radio-chemotherapy for the treatment of brainstem tumors in children.
