      range of motion exercises in well supported sitting position or trunk exercises on unstable
      surfaces in supine and sitting, 30 min per session, 2 sessions per week for 6 weeks, in
      addition to their daily conventional stroke rehabilitation. Sensorimotor functions, including
      hand grip strength, plantar sensitivity, stroke rehabilitation assessment of movement and
      Fugl-Meyer lower extremity motor scale, and clinical outcome assessments, including Trunk
      Impairment Scale and 6-meter walk test, were conducted by a blinded assessor. Biomechanical
      outcome measures included center of pressure area while maintaining static posture and peak
      displacement while leaning forward, and the average speed of the unaffected arm raising (to
      represent the ability to provide a stable foundation for focal movement). These measures were
      taken in sitting without foot support, sitting with foot support and standing to reflect
      trunk control, sitting balance and standing balance, respectively.
