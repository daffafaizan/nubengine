      relaxation (PIR) technique, Isolytic Stretching Group (ISG) participants will perform a PSSE
      with isolytic stretching technique and Static Stretching Group Group (SSG) participants will
      perform a PSSE with static stretching technique. All exercises will be performed in the
      modified cross-body position. Subacromial space and posterior capsule thickness will be
      measured using a 7-12 MHz linear transducer with USG (LOGIQ e Ultrasound, GE Healthcare,
      USA). Athletes' GIRD results and rotational ROM measurements will be measured and recorded
      using a bubble inclinometer (Fabrication End Inc, New York, USA). The upper extremity
      functional performance of the athletes will be evaluated with the Functional Throwing
      Performance Index (FTPI). Evaluations will be repeated tree times before, after the
      stretching exercise and 30 minutes later and the effects of different muscle energy
      techniques (MET) will be compared. Investigators hypothesized PSSE made with different MET
      techniques have different effects on Acromio-Humeral Distance, posterior capsule thickness,
      rotational ROM measurements and performance on overhead athletes with GIRD and the effects of
      MET would be superior to static stretching.
