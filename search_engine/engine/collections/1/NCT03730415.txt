      on the visible VE results. Subjects will be randomized to receive either the standard
      practice transfusion or VE guided transfusion. Blood samples, standard demographic
      information, and routine laboratory data will be collected on all subjects in the Burn ICU
      (BICU) enrolled in the study. VE analysis will be performed on ALL subjects immediately prior
      to the burn excision, and approximately every 40 minutes while the patient is in the
      operating room (OR) as well as on arrival to the BICU and every 8 hours depending on their
      need for ongoing transfusion for a maximum of 24 hours. As our intervention, only the VE
      based transfusion group will have access to the VE analysis at time of transfusion. The VE
      results will be used at the discretion of the treating physician based on the VE guided
      transfusion algorithm. Outcomes include the number and timing of blood products transfused
      from the time of randomization to 24 hours post randomization and the presence of any 30 day
      post-transfusion infections.
