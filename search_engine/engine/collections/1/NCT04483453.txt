    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, 2-arm parallel group trial in
      infants aged 6 months (26 weeks) at enrollment, who are no longer breastfed, and who are
      ready but have not yet started complementary feeding. They will be fed one of two different
      isocaloric feeding regimens (Experimental [EXPL] or Control [CTRL]) consisting of different
      follow-up formulas (FUFs) and infant cereals (ICs). The main purpose of this study is to
      determine the glucose response of these two different complementary feeding regimens. All
      enrolled infants will participate in the trial for approximately 6 months.
