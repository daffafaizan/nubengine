    
      Background and purpose:

      Peak oxygen uptake (pVO2) is used extensively in HF to predict prognosis and time for heart
      transplantation. Many centers are increasingly measuring pVO2 in LVAD supported HF patients,
      though this has mostly been for research or rehabilitation purposes. It is unknown if pVO2
      predicts outcome in LVAD treated HF patients.

      The investigators will pool data from all willing centers of the World to investigate the
      prognostic value of pVO2 (e.g. outcome in LVAD supported patients) and, secondly the
      investigators will investigate wether the predictive power of pVO2 in LVAD recipients depends
      on the treatment indication (BTT and DT).

      Methods:

      Data is collected in anonymized form from all centers willing to contribute data.

      Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis is that lower pVO2 is associated with higher rates of death or urgent
      transplantation (primary endpoint).
