      identified. Antiviral combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. The
      clinical spectrum of the infection is wide, ranging from mild signs of upper respiratory
      tract infection to severe pneumonia and death.

      In the patients who progress, the time period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea
      is reported to be between 5 to 10 days, and that one to severe respiratory distress syndrome
      from 10 to 14 days. Globally, 15 to 18% of patients deteriorates to the need of mechanical
      ventilation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilatory support in the earliest phases of
      the disease. Probability of progress to end stage disease is unpredictable, with the majority
      of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing progression in spontaneously
      breathing patients with mild to moderate disease would translate in improved morbility and
      mortality and in a lower use of limited healthcare resources.

      In 2004, during the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, a pilot study showed that low dose
      ( max 30 ppm) inhaled NO for 3 days was able to shorten the time of ventilatory support. At
      the same time, NO donor compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine increased survival rate in
      an in-vitro model of SARS-CoV infected eukaryotic cells.Based on the genetic similarities
      between the two viruses, similar effects of NO on COVID-19 can be hypothesized. While further
      in-vitro testing is recommended, we proposed a randomized clinical trial to test the
      effectiveness of inhaled NO in preventing the progression of COVID-19 related disease, when
      administered at an early stage.
