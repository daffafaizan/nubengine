      I. To determine the toxicity profile and MTD of low-dose SC IL-2 administered in conjunction
      with BIW regimen of IV rhIL-12.

      II. To determine the antitumor effects of combination therapy with IV rhIL-12 and SC IL-2.

      III. To determine the impact low-dose SC IL-2 has on the magnitude and duration of in vivo
      immune activation induced by a BIW schedule of IV rhIL-12.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive interleukin-12 (IL-12) IV on days 1 and 4 for 6 weeks. Beginning on day 4 of
      the third week, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously 1 hour before and 20
      hours after each dose of IL-12. On subsequent courses, IL-2 and IL-12 are administered on
      days 1 and 4 of each week. Treatment continues for 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease response may continue treatment
      until complete response or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-12 and IL-2 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.
