      cancer in our country.One is to give a pringle manoeuvre to control the operative blood
      loss,the other is using a combination of CUSA and Tissue-link to control the bleeding while
      without liver ischemia.According to the recent experimental studies in rats,we know that the
      ischemia and reperfusion injury may contribute to the metastasis of the tumor.In order to
      test the actual contribution of ischemia on human,we conduct this prospective clinical trial
      to compare the two popular procedures' effect on the prognosis of liver cancer patients
      undergoing radical excision.
