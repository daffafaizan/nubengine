      Risk Smouldering Multiple Myeloma SMM or "Ultra High Risk" SMM) or SLiM CRAB positive
      multiple myeloma to a symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) can be reduced or delayed by the
      administration of denosumab.

      With the exception of clinical studies, there are currently no standardized treatment options
      for SMM. Ultra-high risk SMM is already part of early active myeloma and is therefore in some
      cases treated according to a standard myeloma protocol (Revlimid-Dexamethasone, Velcade
      melphalan prednisone, melphalan prednisone thalidomide, or others). However, most
      practitioners recommend a wait-and-see strategy, since depending on the initial situation
      within two years only 58-95% of patients develop an 'active' MM and 5-42% of the patients had
      a stable disease and therefore do not necessarily have to be treated immediately.

      Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2) which binds to RANKL with high affinity and
      specificity. RANKL (receptor activator of NF-ÎºB Ligand) is a protein that is responsible for
      the formation, function and survival of osteoclasts (cell type responsible for bone
      resorption) Increased osteoclast activity, stimulated by RANKL, is a key mediator of the bone
      resorption in bone metastases and MM. Thus the activity of denosumab is resulting in a
      reduced number and function of osteoclasts and thus decreases the bone resorption and
      tumor-induced bone destruction.

      After an initial phase of about 14 days (screening), the patients will be randomized 1:1 in
      one of the two study groups (arm A: denosumab or arm B: placebo). The study is
      double-blinded. The planned duration of therapy is 3 years. Patients receive denosumab or
      placebo every 4 weeks for 6 months, then every 3 months until a total of 3 years or
      progression.

      After completion of the therapy, an observation and follow-up phase is carried out with
      patient visits every 3 months until the end of the treatment.
