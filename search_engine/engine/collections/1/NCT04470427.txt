    
      This is a 2-part Phase 3 study, with Part A (Blinded Phase) and Part B (Open-label
      Observational Phase). Participants in Part A are blinded to their treatment assignment, with
      participants receiving either 2 active mRNA-1273 vaccine doses or placebo. Part B of the
      study is designed to offer participants to be unblinded so that participants who received
      placebo in Part A can request 2 doses of open-label mRNA-1273 vaccine. Additionally,
      participants who choose to be unblinded and was only able to receive 1 dose of mRNA-1273 due
      to administrative reasons, can choose to receive the second dose of mRNA-1273 during Part B.
