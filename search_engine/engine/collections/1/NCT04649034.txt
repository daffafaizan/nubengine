      inside the heart is the main risk factor for developing intracardiac thrombosis. We have
      recently developed and patented a quantitative image-based method to map blood stasis within
      the cardiac chambers. The method is suitable for any medical imaging modality that provides
      time-resolved flow maps inside the heart (magnetic resonance, echocardiography, or
      computational-fluid-dynamic processing from anatomical CT images). The objective of the
      present project is to validate this certified technology in a multicentric cross-sectional
      clinical trial of 258 patients with different forms of cardiomyopathy with high-risk of
      stroke.

      We will include patients with ischemic, non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy in sinus rhythm and an echocardiogram, cardiac and cerebral MRI will be
      performed. Our objective is to quantify the ventricular stasis by post-processing of 2D color
      Doppler echocardiography and phase contrast-magnetic resonance images in order to establish
      the relationship between quantifiable intraventricular stasis variables and the prevalence of
      silent brain infarctions (SBIs) and intracavitary thrombosis determined by magnetic resonance
      (MRI).
