      cases are preliminarily expected to be included. The study started in October 2020 and ended
      in October 2023. It is expected that the trial will end in October 2023.

      In the absence of such situations as withdrawal of informed consent, intolerance of drug
      toxicity and side effects, or inappropriateness for further trials, each participant's
      expected time for research and treatment will continue until radiographically confirmed tumor
      progression occurs.
