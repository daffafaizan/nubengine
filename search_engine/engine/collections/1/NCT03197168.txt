      illness, negatively impacting their service use and continuity of treatment. Additionally,
      given its impact on self-esteem, personal empowerment, and social inclusion, stigma greatly
      affects the quality of life of this population.

      Consequently, a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two arms (intervention group vs.
      control group) was designed and implemented. Participants were identified and recruited from
      two community mental health centers located in Central Chile. The intervention group, in
      addition to usual care, received a psychosocial intervention based on narrative therapy,
      recovery and psychoeducation which was specially tailored for this population by the authors.

      The sample corresponds to 76 individuals with a severe mental illness (ICD-10), currently
      treated in the two participating Community Mental Health Centers (COSAM). The category
      "severe mental illness" includes patients with diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder, bipolar disorder and severe depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms. Finally,
      those two clinics were chosen by convenience in order to facilitate the implementation of
      this study.

      Before and after the intervention, the participants' self-stigma (Internalized Stigma of
      Mental Illness, ISMI), treatment adherence (weeks in treatment), and quality of life (Sevilla
      Quality of Life Scale) were measured. In addition, the following control variables were also
      evaluated, due to their influence on the principal outcomes: 1) sociodemographic information,
      2) symptom presence and severity (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, PANSS), and 3)
      alcohol consumption (The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, AUDIT).
