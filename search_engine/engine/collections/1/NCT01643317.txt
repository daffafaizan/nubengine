    
      1. Offering PAD and CAD patients a non-invasive abdominal ultrasound after a careful
           process of shared-decision making

        2. Recording data on aneurysm detection on all PAD and CAD patients screened:

             1. General information (age, gender)

             2. Medical history on CardioVascular risk factors (such as smoking history,
                hypertension, and other cardiovascular medical conditions - only information that
                is already recorded in the patient's medical history chart)

             3. AAA - Yes/ No (Yes if ≥3 cm AAA)

             4. If ≥3 cm aneurysm, record exact size and outcome in time (surveillance, treatment,
                no treatment)

             5. If treated, record treatment type (EVAR or Open) and outcome
