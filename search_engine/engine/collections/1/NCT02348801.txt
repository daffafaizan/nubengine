      older adults with diabetes, with resultant significant improvement in glycemic metabolic
      control mediated by improved insulin action/secretion, accompanied by significant
      improvements in physical function, cognitive function, and quality-of-life (QOL).

      Rationale: Countering the prevailing notion that it is difficult to change lifelong habits,
      the PI has ample preliminary data showing successful lifestyle change in older adults. A
      similar lifestyle intervention augmented by motivational interviewing might also be
      successful in older adults with diabetes with eventual translation to the community- and
      home-settings.

      Aims: In older adults with diabetes and comorbidities, the aims are to: determine the effect
      of lifestyle intervention on glycemic metabolic control, determine the mechanisms underlying
      lifestyle-induced changes in glucose homeostasis, and determine the effect of lifestyle
      intervention on age-relevant health outcomes: physical function, cognitive function, QOL.

      Design: Older adults with diabetes and comorbidities will be randomized to center-based
      lifestyle intervention continued into the community and home vs. healthy-lifestyle control
      for 1 year.

      Relevance to diabetes prevention and treatment: Data from a randomized-controlled trial will
      provide high-level evidence to convince practitioners to implement lifestyle intervention as
      the primary therapy for diabetes in older patients.
