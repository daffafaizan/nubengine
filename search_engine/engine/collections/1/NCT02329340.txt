      childhood injury prevention skills to parents of children 6 through 11 years of age. This is
      one of a four-part series of funded programs to address injury prevention issues for three
      age groups of children (birth through 24 months, 2-5 years of age and 6-11 years of age). The
      program will be created in three formats: Internet/intranet, CD-ROM, and linear video (DVD)
      suitable for use in homes, worksites, medical settings, service agencies, and health
      information Web sites. On-screen narrators will guide the user through program material
      comprised of short video presentations, modeling vignettes demonstrating desired behaviors,
      supportive testimonials, and suggestions for modifications to home and recreational
      environments.
