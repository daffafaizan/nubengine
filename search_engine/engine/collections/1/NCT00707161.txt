      cisplatin delivered concurrent with radiation therapy in locally advanced or metastatic
      melanoma.

      Radiation therapy will be delivered concurrent with cisplatin chemotherapy as outlined in
      table 2. Radiation therapy dose will be 50 Gy (2.5 Gy per day, 5 days per week, for 20
      treatments). Cisplatin dose will be 100 mg/m2 given i.v. every 3 weeks for a total of 2 doses
      (days 1 and 22) during radiation.

      Surgical resection of residual (or recurrent) melanoma for cure or for palliation may be
      performed following chemoradiation if deemed appropriate by the treating physicians (surgical
      resection may be planned following pre-operative chemoradiation or may be performed for
      salvage due to inadequate response to chemoradiation or for relapse following
      chemoradiation). Surgical resection will not be performed until at least 4 weeks following
      chemoradiation (unless deemed emergent by the treating physicians).

      If the patient's tumor has inadequate response to chemoradiation then salvage therapies can
      be used as deemed appropriate by the treating physicians. In order to allow adequate response
      to radiation therapy, salvage therapies will not be utilized until at least 4 weeks following
      chemoradiation unless deemed emergent by the treating physicians.
