      in pregnancy from Peking University People's Hospital and other well-known hospitals in
      China. ITP patients in pregnancy who failed to respond to prednisone, IVIG and developed
      refractoriness to platelet transfusion will be given dexamethasone intravenously at a dose of
      40mg every day for four days. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms will be evaluated
      before and after treatment. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study.
