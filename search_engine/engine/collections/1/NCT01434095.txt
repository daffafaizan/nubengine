      evaluated at the baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the half-dose photodynamic
      therapy. The macular sensitivity and fixation stability were determined by MP-1
      microperimetry (Nidek, Vigonza, Italy). The researchers analysed whether the BCVA and retinal
      sensitivity significantly improved or not. And if yes, the researchers were interested at
      which period after treatment the significant improvement was found. Also, the researchers
      investigated which improved first, BCVA or retinal sensitivity.
