      cytarabine, and daunorubicin. This combination of chemotherapy is highly myelosuppressive and
      can lead to oral aversions, dietary intolerance, and gastrointestinal infections
      necessitating holding of oral drugs. Because of the toxicity of the best currently available
      therapy, new drugs that are considered for incorporation into existing treatment regimens
      will ideally have a tolerable side effect profile. This study will evaluate the tolerability
      of incorporating the orally bioavailable drug atovaquone in combination with standard
      cytotoxic induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed pediatric AML patients. Therefore,
      quantifying the frequency with which atovaquone is held due to a side effect of therapy is
      crucial information to gather in this population.
