      arteries, e.g. temporal and maxillary arteries, the resolution of modern PET systems may have
      improved, making a case for FDG PET/CT. FDG PET/CT is increasingly used in giant cell
      arteritis (GCA) diagnosis due to its excellent diagnostic accuracy considering large-vessel
      involvement. In case of uncommon distribution of vessel involvement or marginally increased
      large-vessel FDG uptake, FDG PET/CT-specificity may be compromised. Hence, recognising FDG
      uptake in cranial arteries potentially adds to FDG PET/CTs diagnostic accuracy.

      Objectives To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of conventional FDG PET/CT of the cranial
      arteries in the diagnosis of GCA.

      Methods In a cohort of consecutively included glucocorticoid-naïve patients suspected of
      new-onset GCA, patients with a clinical GCA diagnosis will be identified. Conventional FDG
      PET/CT and vascular ultrasound(US) was performed before treatment. Patients were referred for
      a temporal artery biopsy (TAB).

      Controls are age-(+/- 3 years) and sex-matched malignant melanoma (MM) patients who had a
      follow-up metastatic-disease-free FDG PET/CT ≥6 months after MM resection.

      Images will be assessed by 5 nuclear medicine physicians blinded to clinical symptoms and
      findings. Temporal (TA), maxillary (MA) and vertebral (VA) arteries will be visually
      assessed. Arterial FDG uptake more than FDG uptake in surrounding tissue is considered
      positive. Sensitivity, specificity and interreader agreement will be evaluated.
