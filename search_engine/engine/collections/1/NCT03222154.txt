      points in the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle.

      A randomized, blinded clinical trial of 60 women (mean age 22.8 years and mean body mass
      index of 22.8 kg / cm2) with presence of trigger points in the upper fibers of the trapezius
      muscle. These were submitted to an initial evaluation (AV1), composed of the visual
      analogical pain scale, followed by an evaluation of the pain threshold, using algometry.

      Then, the evaluation of the electromyographic activity of the upper trapezius muscle was
      performed, as well as of its muscular strength by manual dynamometry. Then allocated randomly
      in 3 groups: Control (n = 20), without intervention; Placebo (n = 20), simulation of the
      application of shock wave therapy; And shock wave therapy (n = 20).

      Shock wave therapy was performed with the Master Plus 200Â® Storz Medical equipment, radial
      emission 2000 pulses, 15 Hz frequency and pressure of 1 Bar. All volunteers were evaluated
      immediately after the protocol (post evaluation) and 48 hours After the intervention protocol
      (evaluation 48 hours). A mixed ANOVA of repeated measurements was used for intra and
      intergroup comparisons, followed by tukey post hoc. Significance was set at 5% (p <0.05).
