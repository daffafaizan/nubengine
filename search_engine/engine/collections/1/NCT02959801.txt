      recommended in the international guidelines. Anticoagulation prevents recurrent venous
      thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death. Early thrombus removal is now considered as the
      standard of medical care for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Early thrombus removal can offer the
      potential for early restoration of venous patency and preservation of valve function.
      Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) uses a number of catheter-based mechanical devices
      to deliver the thrombolytic agent as well as to produce some combination of thrombus
      fragmentation, distribution of thrombolytic drugs throughout the thrombus, and/or thrombus
      aspiration. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of Percutaneous mechanical
      thrombectomy (PMT) followed by standard anticoagulant therapy, with anticoagulation therapy
      alone, for the treatment of acute proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.
