      I. Determine objective response rate in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or
      locally recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer treated with sorafenib (BAY 43-9006).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. II. Correlate thyroglobulin levels
      with tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

      III. Correlate fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography results with tumor response
      in patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Correlate tumor permeability and vascularity, as determined by dynamic contrast-enhanced
      MRI, with tumor response in patients treated with this drug.

      V. Determine the pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients. VI. Correlate the presence
      and type of B-raf, N-ras, or RET/PTC gene mutations with clinical response in patients
      treated with this drug.

      VII. Correlate the degree of Ras-MAPK signaling inhibition and vascular endothelial growth
      factor expression with clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to diagnosis
      (papillary thyroid cancer that is chemo-na√Øve vs all others).

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily for up to 6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission (CR)
      receive 8 additional weeks of therapy beyond CR.

      Patients are followed within 2-4 weeks after completion of study treatment.
