      insulin-dependent diabetes due to islet cell destruction. Therefore, islet cell
      autotransplantation is the optimal therapeutic approach for many of these patients. Islet
      cell autotransplantation is typically done by excision of the pancreas, followed by isolation
      of the islet cells and then infusion of these cells into the sinusoids of the liver.
      Isolation of the islet cells occurs in an ischemic and hypoxic environment, resulting in
      ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury and destruction of islet cells following infusion into the
      sinusoids. Hence, strategies to prevent IR injury and subsequent islet cell destruction, such
      as the administration of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) or sodium nitrite (NaNO2) could enhance
      islet cell survival following reperfusion, also decreasing long-term insulin requirement. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if NO administered by infusion in patients undergoing
      islet cell auto transplantation, will inhibit islet cell destruction, increase diabetes cure
      rate (decrease the amount of and/or the need for long-term insulin requirement), decrease the
      ischemic injury (reduces the injury to the islet cells from a decrease in oxygen levels
      during procurement of the islet cells) during islet cell procurement, and decrease IR injury
      following islet cell infusion. The primary endpoints of the study are exogenous insulin use,
      HgbA1c levels post-operatively, and blood glucose levels.
