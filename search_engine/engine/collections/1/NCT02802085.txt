    
      This non-interventional clinical study (NIS) is conducted to clinically confirm the safety
      and performance of the Aesculap® VEGA System® PS components under routine conditions. The
      VEGA System® PS is an established TKA design, and there is a long-lasting experience in the
      use of PS components in particular; thus a NIS is thought to be sufficient to give the
      required confirmation. For this NIS only CE-marked medical devices have been used and will be
      used within their intended purpose and no additional invasive or other stressful examinations
      have been and are to be carried out (acc. to MPG §23b). This voluntary NIS is part of the
      post-marketing surveillance for the product under investigation.
