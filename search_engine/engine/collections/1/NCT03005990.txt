      In the first year,investigators will explore the correlation of sleep parameters, dietary
      behavior and body composition in community-dwelling elders. Two hundred elders will be
      recruited to receive the actigraph accelerometer recording, sleep quality questionnaire,
      bio-electrical impedance analysis, heart rate variability analysis, cognitive and depression
      evaluation.

      Secondly, the study will evaluate the efficacy and possible mechanisms of a 24-week exercise
      training for sleep disturbances patients. Sixty patients with sleep disturbances elders will
      be randomized to exercise group or control group. Participants in the exercise group will
      receive aerobic and resistance exercise 3 times per week for 24 weeks. The controls will
      receive sleep hygiene education and consultation. All measurements will be performed as
      described before.

      Finally, all the 260 elders participating in this study will receive 12-month follow-up
      assessments to explore the longitudinal impact of sleep disturbances on cardiorespiratory
      function, body composition and metabolic function, and long-term effect of exercise training
      on sleep disturbances patients. Investigators expect elders with poor sleep quality have
      lower level of health-related fitness and metabolic function; exercise training is effective
      to improve sleep quality, metabolic function and general health in the elders with sleep
      disturbances, and the effect can be sustained for a long period.
