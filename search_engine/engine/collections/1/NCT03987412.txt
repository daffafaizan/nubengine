      women will be screened for risks of GDM at their first visit for prenatal care during their
      first trimester (less than 12 gestational weeks). Obstetricians will introduce the study to
      women who have one or more risk factors.

      Women who meet the eligibility criteria and who are willing to provide informed consent will
      be enrolled and randomized to behavioral intervention group and control group. Women in the
      behavioral intervention group will be educated about the risks of GDM, and then applied with
      a mobile APP that provides nutrition, exercise and phycological support starting from their
      first trimester. This behavioral support will be modified individually and continuously
      according to the pregnant women's feedback of their daily performance through the APP. Both
      groups will have regular prenatal care.

      During 24-28 gestational weeks, GDM will be diagnosed by a 75g oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT) according to the new World Health Organization criteria as fasting glucose level in
      fasting whole blood ≥5.1mmol/L, or 1-hour value ≥10.0mmol/l, or 2-hour value ≥8.5mmol/L.
      Investigators will compare the GDM risk in the two groups to evaluate whether behavioral
      intervention with mobile APP can reduce the risk of GDM in Chinese pregnant women who are at
      high risk of GDM. Participants' adherence with the behavioral intervention will be evaluated
      by analyzing the data collected by the APP, and participants' satisfaction of the prenatal
      care will be evaluated with questionnaires during 24-28 gestational weeks. Intervention with
      the APP will be stopped in the third trimester. All the participates will receive standard
      medical management until they give birth.
