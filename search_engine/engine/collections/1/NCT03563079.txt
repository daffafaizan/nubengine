           disability and ROM in individuals with non-specific chronic neck pain.

        -  Characterization of individuals with chronic nonspecific neck pain. To describe and
           compare, at the pre-intervention, post-intervention moments in a 3-week follow-up
           period, the intensity of neck pain using the numerical pain scale (NPS); the self -
           perception of disability using the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and range of motion (ROM)
           of the neck - flexion, extension, rotations and right and left slopes through a pendulum
           flexometer.

        -  Randomized unicentric clinical trial of longitudinal cut according to the

           statement

        -  The sample will be composed of 46 volunteers with chronic nonspecific neck pain.

        -  The subjects will be recruited through digital ads in the main social networks, as well
           as coming from the Physiotherapy service in a clinic in the city of Viam√£o / RS. An
           online form will be completed by the interested parties, which will include the
           eligibility criteria for participation in the study. Only the subjects that follow the
