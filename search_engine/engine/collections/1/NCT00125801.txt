      controlled pain. Breakthrough pain is common in patients with advanced cancer. Current
      medications to treat breakthrough pain include oral immediate release opioid formulations and
      more recently oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate.

      The pain pen study is a randomized controlled double blind cross-over study comparing the
      efficacy of oral immediate release morphine with that of subcutaneous hydromorphone, injected
      through a so called pain pen, on breakthrough pain in cancer patients. Preliminary experience
      with the pain pen suggests that it has a more rapid time of onset of pain relief than oral
      formulations.
