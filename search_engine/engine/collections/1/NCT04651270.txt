      needs for an excellent intracavitary visualization along with a surgeon skill set capable of
      performing these, often more technically challenging procedures. Image quality has improved,
      but there are still various restrictions to images captured by the lens at the tip of a long
      tubular laparoscope.

      270Surgical developed a 270 degree angle scope to overcome these unmet needs and improve the
      image quantity and extent during laparoscopy. The study will evaluate standard laparoscopic
      surgery using the 270Surgical system; "The SurroundScope".
