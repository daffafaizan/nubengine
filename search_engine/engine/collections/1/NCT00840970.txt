      groups as described below. Two groups (Pilot 15 mm and Efficacy 25 mm) used a randomized,
      double-blind, intra-patient control study design to assess performance of the drug-coated
      Splint (received in one ethmoid sinus) compared to the control Splint (received in the
      contralateral ethmoid). The other group of patients (Safety/PK 25 mm) received bilateral
      drug-coated Splints, and served as a pharmacokinetics (PK) study group.
