      benefit from chemotherapy. Since Chemotherapy-Induced Menopause (CIM) may be one of its
      consequences, it seems important to study its impact on the quality of life of these young
      patients. It is within this framework that the Jean Perrin Center promoted the MENOCOR study,
      whose main objective is to assess the impact of the CIM on the quality of life through the
      QLQ-C30 functional score over a two-year period. The CIM incidence, its impact on quality of
      life (body image, anxiety, depression, physical activity and sleep quality) and the onset of
      climacteric signs, the onset of amenorrhea according to chemotherapy protocols and patient
      age and hormonal variations are among the secondary objectives of the study.
