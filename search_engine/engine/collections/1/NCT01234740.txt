      I. To determine the neuropharmacokinetics (nPK) and systemic levels of bafetinib in patients
      with recurrent malignant brain tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the intrapatient variability of nPK parameters as assessed by intracerebral
      microdialysis.

      II. To document the toxicity of bafetinib in this cohort of patients. III. To describe the
      response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival in patients with malignant
      brain tumors treated with bafetinib.

      IV. To assess for the expression of Lyn and Fyn kinases and phosphorylation status in
      pre-treatment tumor samples.

      OUTLINE:Patients undergo intracerebral microdialysis during debulking craniotomy or
      stereotactic biopsy. Beginning 24 hours later, patients receive oral bafetinib twice daily
      for 1 day. Beginning at least 2 weeks after craniotomy or 1 week after biopsy, patients
      continue to receive oral bafetinib twice daily in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 8
      weeks thereafter.
