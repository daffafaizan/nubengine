      respiratory dysregulation in a sample of 60 non-psychotic, not currently alcohol or drug
      abusing veteran outpatients from our MHC (Mental Hygiene Clinic) who experience episodic
      anxiety but who do not qualify and have never qualified for the diagnosis of PD (panic
      disorder). These patients will be compared to 30 patients who are not clinically anxious. Of
      these 60 anxious patients, 30 will be randomly assigned to a 4-week course of breathing
      training assisted by feedback of end-tidal pCO2 levels as an augmentation of their current
      treatment. They will be compared to 30 who simply will continue with their current treatment
      (TAU). The breathing training group will receive clinical and physiological assessments
      immediately before the treatment period, four weeks after the end of the treatment period,
      and at a 4-month follow-up. The TAU group will be assessed three times at equivalent
      intervals, and if they wish, may undergo breathing training after the third assessment.
      Treatment will take place mainly in the first two years, giving us adequate time for
      follow-up and data analysis. We expect that this therapy will be especially effective for
      treating anxiety in the patients with substantial respiratory dysregulation.
