      children and adolescents. The investigators want to see if amitriptyline and/or topiramate
      are better than placebo (sugar pill) in reducing headache frequency in children and
      adolescents ages 8 to 17 with migraines. At this time, there are no FDA approved medicines
      approved in the US for the prevention treatment of migraine headaches in children and
      adolescents.
