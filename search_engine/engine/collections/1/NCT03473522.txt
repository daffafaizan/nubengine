      used. The 30 participants will be randomized into two groups: (1) TDCs(anodal) + therapeutic
      exercises and (2) TDCs (sham) + therapeutic exercises. The treatment will be performed for 8
      weeks, with three sessions per week, totaling 24 sessions of electrostimulation and
      therapeutic exercises. The primary variable (balance), secondary outcomes and other outcomes
      will be assessed before and after treatment. Follow-up of patients will be conducted at 8, 12
      and 24 weeks after randomization. All evaluations will be performed by a single researcher
      who, like the patients, will not know which stimulation group will be participating. Patients
      diagnosed with Parkinson's who seek treatment at the Clinical School of Physiotherapy of the
      Federal University of Piau√≠ will receive detailed instructions on the present study. The
      physiotherapist responsible for evaluations will explain the objectives of the study,
      possible treatments, eligibility criteria and potential risks arising from the application of
      brain stimulation and therapeutic exercises. Patients who agree to the conditions and sign
      the consent form may participate in the study. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria
      will be included in the study.
