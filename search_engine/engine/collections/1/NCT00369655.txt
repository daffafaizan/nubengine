      I. Assess the antitumor activity of VEGF Trap, in terms of tumor response rate, in patients
      with metastatic breast cancer who have received =< 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for
      metastatic disease, including a taxane and/or anthracycline.

      II. Assess the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients treated with VEGF Trap.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the adverse event profile (grade using the NCI CTCAE version 3.0) of VEGF Trap in
      these patients.

      II. Describe the progression-free survival times in patients treated with VEGF Trap.

      III. Describe the overall survival of patients treated with VEGF Trap. IV. Describe the
      duration of response in patients treated with VEGF Trap.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.
