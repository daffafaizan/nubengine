      an operation for gastroesophageal reflux disease. This is intended to be a definitive study.
      All patients will receive the standard operation for reflux: laparoscopic fundoplication. The
      dissection will be performed by either separating the phrenoesophageal membrane, or by
      leaving the phrenoesophageal membrane intact.

      Sample size calculated on a power of 80% with an alpha level of 0.05 using the recurrence
      rates demonstrated by our retrospective data produce a number of 159 patients in each arm of
      the study. Given that we will need to follow these patients for 1 year after enrollment,
      there may be some attrition due to lost follow-up. Therefore 180 patients per arm would
      account for just over 10% attrition.

      One group will undergo laparoscopic fundoplication with complete mobilization of the lower
      esophagus by circumferentially dividing the phrenoesophageal membrane. The other group will
      undergo laparoscopic fundoplication without dividing this membrane. The operation,
      post-operative care, and follow-up plan will otherwise not differ between groups.

      If 4 consecutive recurrences are found in one group, an interim analysis will be conducted.
      If a recurrence difference between groups of statistical significance is detected, the study
      will be concluded at this point. Without this occurrence, an interim analysis will be
      conducted at 180 patients enrolled.
