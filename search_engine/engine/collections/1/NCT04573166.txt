      fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) . Though the
      safety of balloon atrial septostomy (BAS) is satisfactory, the incidence of spontaneous
      closure is higher, which limits the clinical utilization of this procedure. The
      device-implantation improves the long-term patency. However, the created fenestration is
      limited with fixed size and it is further complicated with the potential device-related
      complications.

      Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) has the potential to cause irreversible damage around
      the rim of fenestration created with BAS, which might prevent the re-adhesion of the septal
      remnants. In addition, RFA on fossae ovalis might reduce the elastic recoil of local tissue
      and contribute to create larger inter-atrial fenestration with same BAS procedure. Therefore,
      the combined use of radiofrequency-ablation and balloon-dilation (CURB) might become a novel
      procedure to create a stable inter-atrial fenestration.

      In this study, the adult patients who have HFrEF and HFpEF refractory to medical therapy may
      be eligible for this study.
