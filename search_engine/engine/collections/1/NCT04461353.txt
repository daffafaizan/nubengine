      This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 1 single-dose dose-escalation
      study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of oral inhalation of AHCQ in healthy
      participants.

      Escalating single doses of AHCQ will be studied in healthy participants. The study drug will
      be administered by inhalation through the mouth, and participants will be encouraged to
      exhale through the nose. The study drug, AHCQ, will be administered starting at an initial
      dose of 20 mg (Cohort A1, 1 mL of 20 mg/mL AHCQ solution) with a proposed subsequent doses of
      50 mg (Cohort A2, 1 mL of 50 mg/mL AHCQ).

      Number of Participants (Planned):

      Two dose levels are planned to be evaluated. Each cohort will comprise 8 participants (6
      active, 2 placebo). Therefore, 16 participants will initially be planned to be enrolled in
      the study. Additional participants may be enrolled if one or more enrolled participants do
      not complete the study.
