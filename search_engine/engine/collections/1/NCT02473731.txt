      (SCCHN) scheduled for surgery. Two cohorts of SCCHN patients, HPV negative and HPV positive,
      will be treated with KTN3379 to evaluate effects on ErbB3 phosphorylation and other
      biomarkers in tumor tissue. The KTN3379 treatment duration is within the expected window of
      time that elapses from initial patient evaluation by a surgeon to performance of surgery.
      Paired preoperative and postoperative tumor specimen analyses allow evaluation of
      proliferation, ErbB3 related biomarkers, pErbB3 modulation and pharmacodynamic changes in
      downstream molecular pathways.
