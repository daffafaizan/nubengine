    
      A randomized, multi-center, 4-group study of health status measures and biomarkers in
      subjects who smoke and are switched to either a tobacco-heating cigarette, snus, or a
      tobacco-burning cigarette, with a non-treatment group of never-smokers.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Evaluate select biomarkers of tobacco exposure and biomarkers of harm from subjects who
           smoke and who are switched to a tobacco-heating cigarette, snus, or a tobacco-burning
           cigarette.

        -  Evaluate ability of a tobacco-heating cigarette and snus to modify patient-reported
           Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-related health status in subjects who smoke
           and are switched to either a tobacco-heating cigarette or snus relative to a control
           group (a tobacco-burning ultra-low machine yield [ULMY]) cigarette.

        -  Assess subject compliance.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Measure amount and repeatability of smoke components yielded from the cigarettes (yield
           in use) and determine relative uptake of selected smoke components.

        -  Evaluate the ability of a tobacco-heating cigarette and snus to modify general health
           status as measured by self-administered health questionnaires in subjects who smoke and
           are switched to either a tobacco-heating cigarette or snus relative to a control group
           (a tobacco-burning ULMY cigarette).

        -  Compare health status measures in smokers who are switched to a tobacco-heating
           cigarette to smokers who are switched to snus.

        -  Compare baseline data from all tobacco-using groups to baseline data from the
           never-smoking (non-treatment) group.
