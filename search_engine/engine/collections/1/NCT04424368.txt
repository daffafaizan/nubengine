      of potential adherence to treatment, which will be determined by the usage of Russian generic
      questionnaire for evaluation of compliance to drug therapy. At the end of a 12 month
      observation with the registration of unfavorable cardiovascular occasions (death from
      cardiovascular reasons, nonfatal myocardial infraction, cerebral stroke, necessity for
      repeated revascularization of the coronary arteries) based on the analysis of non-genetic and
      genetic factors (polymorphism of genes Thr174Met and Met235Thr in gene angiotensinogen,
      Arg389Gly and Ser49Gly in gene adrenoceptor beta 1, Ser447Ter in gene lipoprotein lipase and
      Leu28Pro in gene apolipoprotein E, Trp212Ter and G681A in gene cytochrome P450 family 2
      subfamily C member 19) factors of unfavorable prognosis will be identified and considering
      which group of patients requires the use of remote monitoring system will be formed. From one
      group of patients we will form two comparable groups, one group will use this remote
      monitoring system and another will not. The effectiveness of the remote monitoring system
      will be evaluated after 6-month's observation based on the registration of the unfavorable
      cardiovascular occasions (death from cardiovascular reasons, nonfatal myocardial infraction,
      cerebral stroke, necessity for repeated revascularization of the coronary arteries, frequency
      of hospitalizations).
