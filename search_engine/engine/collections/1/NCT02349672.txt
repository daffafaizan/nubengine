      will be derived from two groups: (1) "Healthy Controls" will be healthy neonates with Apgar
      scores ≥ 7 at 1 minute and ≥ 8 at 5 minutes and no other medical problems associated with
      neurologic injury such as hyperbilirubinemia or hypoglycemia. This group will establish a
      negative control and will have 500-800µL of blood collected at the time of standard blood
      metabolic screens (at 24 and 48 hours of life). (2) "Clinical Controls" will be healthy
      neonates evaluated for jaundice, with multiple blood samples drawn between birth and 48 hours
      of life to monitor serum bilirubin concentrations. They will have an additional 0.8-1 mL of
      blood drawn at the time of any clinical sample (venous or heel stick) is performed. In
      addition, neonates will be excluded if they show signs of sepsis or hypoglycemia (< 40). The
      neonates' bilirubin will be plotted using the American Academy of Pediatrics risk-based
      stratification method, the Bhutani monogram (which is a based on the serum bilirubin
      concentration and the hours of life). Clinical control neonates must have low-risk or
      low-intermediate bilirubin concentrations, with virtually no risk of brain injury.
