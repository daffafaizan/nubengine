      characteristics of each individual patient. However, plasma concentration of efavirenz may
      widely vary between different subjects that receive the same dose of the drug
      (interindividual variability).

      Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) signifies individualised pharmacological dosing, based on
      the plasma levels that each patient presents. This strategy has been broadly used in the
      field of the treatment of other medical conditions and is acquiring growing interest in the
      field of antiretroviral treatment. Thus, the use of TDM for the treatment of na√Øve patients
      with nelfinavir or with indinavir has translated into an increase in the proportion of
      individuals with suppressed viral load and also into a reduction in HAART-induced adverse
      events . However, data on the utility of the therapeutic monitoring of the levels of
      efavirenz in HIV-infected patients are very scant.

      On the basis of the above, it might be thought that the modification of the doses of
      efavirenz, guided by its plasma concentration, in patients receiving this drug and whose
      plasma levels of efavirenz are outside the therapeutic range, might improve the tolerability
      of the treatment without compromising virological efficacy.
