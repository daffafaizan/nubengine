      salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy were randomized into a 24-week, multicenter,
      multinational, double-blind (DB), parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Patients were
      stratified based on their use of oral or transdermal ET and randomized to receive placebo or
      testosterone transdermal system. Patients had to maintain a stable dose of estrogen
      throughout the study. Patients who completed the first 24 weeks of the study were given the
      opportunity to participate in a 3.5 year open-label (active treatment) study extension which
      was added to the protocol by amendment. Safety was assessed by adverse events, lipids, serum
      chemistry with hepatic, renal and carbohydrate metabolism evaluation, and hematology.
      Physical exam including clinical assessments of facial hair and acne were monitored.
