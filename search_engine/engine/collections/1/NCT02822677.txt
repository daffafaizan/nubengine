    
      It is a cross-sectional study to discovery the distribution of IBS subtypes who would like to
      seek CM treatment and their CM patterns.Serum, urine and stool samples of the participants
      will be collected from 400-600 IBS participants to explore the host-gut microbiota metabolic
      interactions associated with IBS subtypes. The primary outcome will be the distribution of
      IBS subtype and their CM pattern in Hong Kong population. Secondary outcomes will be the
      host-gut microbiota metabolic interactions associated with IBS subtypes, the relationship
      between CM pattern and their microbiota and metabolic profiling. The relationship between IBS
      subtype distribution and other predetermined factors will be assessed, including gender, age,
      weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), dietary habit, education, economical status, the overall and
      individual IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), syndrome of Chinese medicine, QoL assessment
      and Bristol Stool Scale.For those who had fulfillment of the Structured Clinical Interview
      for DSM-5 Disorders-(SCID-5), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Clinical Global
      Impression-severity (CGI-S), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) will also be assessed.
      After the collection of serum, urine and stool samples, bacterial total DNA will be
      extracted, purified,concentrated,dried and stored for further fecal 16s rRNA sequencing
      analysis. A number of parameters, including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphate (ALP) et al., will be measured in serum. Total BA
      and BA profiles in serum and feces will be tested as well.
