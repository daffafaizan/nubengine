      non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). High definition (HD) endoscopy with i-scan could enhance
      visualization of mucosal and vascular pattern and might identify changes that were invisible
      at standard endoscopy. This study aimed to evaluate the endoscopic findings that may have
      diagnostic value for the prediction of NERD by using HD endoscopy with i-scan.

      Methods Patients with typical GERD symptoms and healthy control without GERD symptoms were
      included and 2 validated GERD questionnaires were completed. The endoscopist was blinded to
      the presence of reflux symptoms and distal esophagus was examined using standard white light
      endoscopy followed by i-scan. Mucosal morphology at squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) observed by
      i-scan were compared between GERD patients and controls.
