    
      This is a randomized 3-arm study comprised of 2 active psychological treatments (ER & CBT)
      and a health education (HE) arm that controls for time and attention. Study goals are to
      provide scientific evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of ER, and also provide a comparison
      of said efficacy against the current gold standard group treatment for PC -- manualized
      8-session pain-CBT.
