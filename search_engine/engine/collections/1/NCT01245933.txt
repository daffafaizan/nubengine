      care use, as exemplified in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Currently,
      independent, comprehensive databases allowing for an integrated view are lacking. The study
      will for the first time establish a large, comprehensive longitudinal database covering a
      broad panel of comorbidities an markers of systemic alterations. These data will be of unique
      value in revealing specific phenotypes of COPD via patterns and risk profiles of
      comorbidities, enabling a more precise diagnosis and targeting of therapy, and an efficient
      allocation of resources.
