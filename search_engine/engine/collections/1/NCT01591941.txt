      Female athletes are at high risk of knee injuries from soccer than males. We will conduct a
      research project to assess the effect of a warm-up on changing some of the movement patterns
      thought to contribute to these serious knee injuries.

      A core position and control movement strategy (Core-PAC) may be one method of modifying
      high-risk movements such as side-cutting. The Core-PAC is a simple method of getting the
      centre of mass (COM) closer to the plant foot or base of support (BOS). Moving the COM closer
      to the BOS may bias joint loading to the sagittal rather than the frontal and transverse
      planes, which often occurs in female athletes and poses a risk for ACL injury.

      In this study, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare a Core-PAC trained
      group to a control group for peak flexion angles and peak abduction moments at the knee
      during a side-cut and an unanticipated side-cut prior to kicking a soccer ball and a side-hop
      task after a six-week training program.

      It is hypothesized that a Core-PAC group would have greater peak flexion angles and lower
      peak abduction moments at the knee compared to a control after the training program.
