    
      Adhesive capsulitis is a common cause of shoulder pain, and the efficacy of most
      interventions is limited. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of hydrodilatation
      with hyaluronic acid under ultrasonographic guidance plus physical therapy (PT) with that of
      PT alone for treating adhesive capsulitis.

      Design: a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, clinical trial

      Patient and methods:

      Patients with adhesive capsulitis for at least 3 months were enrolled and randomly allocated
      into group 1 (hydrodilatation with hyaluronic acid under ultrasonographic guidance plus PT)
      and group 2 (PT alone). The patients were evaluated before treatment and were reevaluated 0,
      6, and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Outcomes measures included a pain scale
      (visual analog scale), range of motion, Constant shoulder score, Shoulder Pain And Disability
      Index, and the Short Form-36
