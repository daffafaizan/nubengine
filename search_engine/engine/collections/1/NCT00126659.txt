      I. Efficacy of BAY 43-9006 (sorafenib tosylate) by evaluating response rate. II. Toxicities
      of BAY 43-9006 in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). III. Intraoperative and
      peri/postoperative safety of BAY 43-9006.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to progression. II. Duration of response. II. Overall Survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Tissue expression of VEGFR-2/phospho-VEGFR-2, PDGFR/phospho-PDGFR, FGFR/phospho-FGFR,
      ERK/phospho-ERK, RAF-1/phospho-RAF-1, p38/phospho-p38, Akt/phospho-Akt, P27, Ki67, TGF-alpha,
      and TUNEL pre- and post- therapy (optional studies).

      II. Oligonucleotide analysis of tissue pre- and post-therapy (optional studies).

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study. Patients are sequentially assigned to 1 of 3
      treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo cytoreductive nephrectomy on day 1. Patients then receive oral
      sorafenib twice daily on days 15-84.

      GROUP II: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-7. Patients undergo
      cytoreductive nephrectomy on day 8. Patients then receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days
      22-84.

      GROUP III: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Patients undergo
      cytoreductive nephrectomy on day 29. Patients then receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days
      43-84.

      In all groups, patients with stable or regressing disease continue to receive oral sorafenib
      twice daily for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Some patients may continue treatment for longer than 1 year at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients (15 per treatment group) will be accrued for this
      study within 1 year.
