    
      In the first phase of the study, infants will be treated for a total of 6 weeks, treated
      twice weekly. Infants will be admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for the
      first week of treatment. Procedures during the first week of the study will include blood
      draws for genetic testing, clinical and research blood draws, urine collection, abdominal
      ultrasound, peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) placement, hearing screening, and the
      first two IV VTS-270 infusions through the PICC line. Weeks 2-6 will occur on an outpatient
      basis. During week 2-6, the infant will receive 2 doses per week of VTS-270 with blood draws
      and urine collection during weeks 2, 4, and 6. PICC line will be removed after final
      infusion.

      Subjects who demonstrate significant reduction either in the glycine-conjugated
      trihydroxycholanic acid biomarker or serum bilirubin (direct bilirubin or direct bilirubin:
      total bilirubin ratio) will be allowed to crossover into the second phase of the study, an
      open label phase of six months duration in which IV VTS-270 will be administered monthly for
      a total of six doses. Month 1-6 procedures will occur on an outpatient basis. Procedures
      during the second phase include a monthly intravenous line placement. After each monthly
      visit, the intravenous line will be removed.
