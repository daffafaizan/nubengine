      for the prevention of post herpetic neuralgia incidence as compared to placebo group. For
      this purpose, all eligible Herpes Zoster patients will be randomized into two groups (41
      patients in each group i.e.82 total patients). Group 1 will be the treatment group receiving
      Pregabalin 75 mg twice daily for 4 weeks in addition to other routine treatment. Whereas,
      group 2 will be the control group receiving all routine treatment similar to group 1 except
      Pregabalin. Instead of pregabalin, control group will receive Placebo. The pain will be
      evaluated in all patients in each follow visits (weekly follow up for 4 weeks then monthly
      follow up for next three months). If it is difficult for the patient to present physically,
      telephonic follow up will be done to find the pain score in the required time. Also, DLQI
      (Dermatological life quality index) will be assessed at the first and last visit of the
      patient.

      At the end, pain score will be compared between the two groups.
