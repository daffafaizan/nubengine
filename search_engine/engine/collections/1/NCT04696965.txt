           demonstrated in clinical trials in adult patients with symptomatic asthma.

        2. Certain patients of daily care, like patients with smoking asthma, late onset asthma or
           asthma with chronic airway obstruction are often excluded from clinical trials.

        3. Studies have shown the cognitive function of patients with COPD is impaired. When mixed
           types of inhaler devices are prescribed, the multiple steps of different devices may
           ensure complexity and confusion for patients, which may compromise the efficacy of
           add-on therapy. The inhaler error of add-on tiotropium treatment in real-world asthma
           treatment is unknown.

        4. The improvement of step errors after varieties of teaching intervention is around
           30~50%. Strategy of recheck inhaler technique recommended by the treatment guideline may
           optimized inhaler use. (https://ginasthma.org/gina-reports/).

        5. Factors like responseness of short-acting bronchodilators and cholinergic tone have been
           reported as predictors of a positive clinical response of add-on tiotropium. However,
           more specific physiological or inflammatory factors. e.g. exhaled nitric oxide test
           (FeNo), and para symptomatic function and cardiac-pulmonary interaction have not been
           evaluated prospectively.

        6. This pragmatic, two-arm, randomized controlled trial study aim to survey the inhaler
           errors of add-on tiotropium therapy with ICS+LABA in real-world practice of asthma
           patients and the efficacy of recheck stratage of inhaler skills. Patient characteristics
           and inflammatory features will be evaluated prospectively for association of asthma
           control by add-on tiotropium.
