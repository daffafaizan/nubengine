      ipilimumab and nivolumab on 3-year Event Free Survival (EFS), in women with triple negative
      breast cancer after taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our strategy combines two
      interventions: induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T
      cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens via local destruction of tumor tissue by
      cryoablation. Second, we administer ipilimumab, a CTLA4 blocking antibody that enhances the
      magnitude and potency of the tumor specific T cell response, with nivolumab, a PD-1 blocking
      antibody that interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. Women with residual
      triple negative resectable breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be treated with
      tumor cryoablation and pre-operative nivolumab and ipilimumab followed post-operative
      nivolumab. Women undergoing either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery are eligible.
