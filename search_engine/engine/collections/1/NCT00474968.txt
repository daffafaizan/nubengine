      whereas spatulas, brushes and broom-style collection devices collect cells by scraping or
      abrading the cervix. THis trial is to determine whether the purely exfoliated sample
      collected using the e2TM Collector is equivalent to samples obtained by scraping or abrading
      the cervix for purposes of cervical cancer screening and HPV detection.
