      determine which patients will most benefit from interventional therapies to help reverse the
      condition. Similarly, quantitative assessment of liver fat content using MRI can assist
      physicians in identifying patients at risk for hepatic steatohepatitis.

      Due to the widespread dissemination of US machines and their relative lower cost compared to
      other imaging modalities, e.g. MRI, the ability of US to assess these parameters widens
      diagnostic availability.

      Patients who have undergone an MRI exam to assess liver stiffness (cirrhosis) and/or liver
      fat content (steatosis) will be asked to undergo an US exam to assess the same parameters.
      The cirrhosis and steatosis measurements obtained from both exams will be compared. If
      US-based measurements of liver stiffness and/or liver fat content are shown to be
      reproducible and accurate when compared to MRI values (will be used as the gold standard), US
      may become the first-line diagnostic test for these liver conditions.
