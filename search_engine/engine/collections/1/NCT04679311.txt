      contains high levels of ACE activity will increase serum ACE activity and thereby cause the
      degradation of mediators of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, such as bradykinin and
      substance P, resulting in a shortening of the course of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema.

      30 patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with
      either 2 units of fresh frozen plasma that has been preselected for high ACE activity content
      (â‰¥50 U/L) or an equal volume of normal saline. A baseline assessment of the severity of the
      angioedema will be performed and baseline serum levels of ACE activity, bradykinin, and
      substance P will be determined. The severity of angioedema will be assessed and serum levels
      of ACE activity, bradykinin and substance P will be determined at specific intervals after
      each subject is treated.
