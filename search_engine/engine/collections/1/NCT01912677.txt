      regimens for women with severe hypertension in pregnancy. Women presenting with severe
      hypertension in pregnancy in two hospitals in Nagpur, India will be randomised to one of
      three oral regimens: nifedipine, labetalol or methyldopa. This trial will compare the
      efficacy, safety and side effects of these three oral regimens for management of hypertension
      in pregnant women. The investigators hypothesize that nifedipine treatment of severe
      hypertensive parturient women is more effective than treatment with labetalol or methyldopa
      in controlling high blood pressure within six hours.
