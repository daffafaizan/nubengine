      falciparum sensitivity to ACTs in Western Kenya. By having subjects in one of the study arms
      receive artesunate and then the partner drug after completion of the artemisinin phase will
      enable the accurate evaluation of the artemisinin derivative without the confounding
      influence of the partner drug. Sequential administration of the components of an ACT drug is
      recognized by the WHO as one of the ways in which ACTs can be administered. There will be
      close follow-up of the subjects throughout the duration of the study, and as such, subjects
      who fail to respond adequately will receive prompt rescue treatment. Since it is largely
      expected that most subjects in Western Kenya will have satisfactory responses to ACTs, data
      from this study will provide baseline information regarding parasite characteristics when
      compared to data from Thailand, an area that has reported resistance to ACTs. This, in turn,
      will potentially enable the identification of key markers, both in the host and the parasite,
      that may assist in the early detection of resistance, and also to better understand the
      development of resistance to ACTs. As such, the data generated from this study, both on its
      own and when compared to and pooled with data from similar studies that will be conducted in
      Peru and Thailand, will potentially inform both local and international policy regarding ACT
      use for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
