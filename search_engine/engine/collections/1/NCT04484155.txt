    
      Eligible patients will have ECG and blood test up to 30 days prior to the MIMS procedure.

      Description of MIMS procedure:

      on surgery day, intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured. Then a sub-conjunctival

      one month.

      Patients will be followed up to 24 weeks post operation.

      The following measurements will be included:

        -  Intra Ocular Pressure (IOP)

        -  Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)

        -  Slit Lamp Biomicroscopic evaluation

        -  Anterior Segment Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

        -  Fundus Examination
