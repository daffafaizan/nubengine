      joint pathology prior to strength training, have elicited greater improvements in muscle
      function and self-reported disability compared to traditional therapies. Preliminary evidence
      suggests applying cryotherapy to a joint prior to exercise can increase quadriceps
      activation. It is unknown if applying cryotherapy and intermittent pneumatic compression can
      also increase quadriceps force output and voluntary activation. The purpose of this study is
      to determine changes in quadriceps force output and voluntary activation following the
      application of cryotherapy and compression. The investigators hypothesize there will be an
      increase in quadriceps force output and voluntary activation following the application of
      cryotherapy and compression.
