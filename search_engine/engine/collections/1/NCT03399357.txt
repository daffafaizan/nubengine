      highest rate of influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Vaccine efficacy in the elderly is
      reduced due to immunosenescence and/or, inflamm-aging. This phase IV clinical trial in 240
      participants aims to evaluate metabolic predictors of influenza-vaccine specific immune
      response in a multi-ethnic elderly community cohort in Singapore. Specifically, our novel
      approach is to evaluate the immunomodulatory roles of vitamin D, diabetes and other metabolic
      predictors. This study has translational implications (e.g. using vitamin D as an 'adjuvant',
      evaluating biomarkers of vaccine efficacy) to enhance influenza vaccine immunogenicity in the
      vulnerable elderly.

      Potential benefit: there is a possibility the vaccine may prevent influenza illness or
      influenza related complication that might have otherwise occurred. This study will contribute
      to body of knowledge of impact of metabolic factors (vitamin D, DM status) on influenza
      vaccine immune response, and will be the first study of its kind to be done in an Asian
      elderly population. Potential risks related to the blood draw and local/systemic side effects
      from influenza vaccine are anticipated to be minimal.
