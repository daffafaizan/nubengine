        -  Establish a central lymphoma tissue repository of fresh snap-frozen tissue from patients
           with previously untreated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

        -  Determine a standard set of procedures for routine acquisition, banking, and study of
           these tissue samples.

        -  Correlate presently activated phenotyping studies and future projected molecular studies
           of the DNA and RNA status of these tissue samples with clinical results.

        -  Correlate pretreatment phenotype or genotype of tissue samples from patients with
           intermediate- or high-grade NHL with patient outcome, in terms of complete response
           rate, time to progression, and survival.

        -  Correlate the lymphoma lineage (T-cell vs B-cell), loss of class II human
           histocompatibility antigen status (HLA-DR-positive vs HLA-DR-negative), proliferative
           index (as measured by Ki-67), and B- or T-cell antigen aberrancy (e.g., lack of Pan B or
           T antigen expression) with outcome in patients with intermediate- or high-grade NHL.

      OUTLINE: Patients are treated on the SWOG study on which they are enrolled.

      Tissue samples obtained before treatment began are banked in a tissue repository.

      Samples from patients with intermediate- or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are analyzed by
      three-stage immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to B-cell antigens, T-cell
      antigens, immunoglobulins, CALLA, HLA-DR, anti-interleukin-2 receptor, and Ki-67 (for the
      proliferative index). Phenotype (immune marker status, proliferation status, and activation
      status) is correlated with response to treatment, relapse, and overall survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 495 patients will be accrued for this study.
