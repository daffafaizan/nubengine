      The study population consists of all children less than 18-years-old hospitalized due to
      acute gastroenteritis (AGE) to seven Estonian hospitals participating in this study. Expected
      sample size is about 2000 patients.

      Hospitals that participate in this study are Tartu University Hospital, West-Tallinn Central
      Hospital, Tallinn's Children Hospital, PÃ¤rnu Central Hospital, South-Estonian Hospital,
      Kuressaare Hospital and Ida-Viru Central Hospital.

      Before enrollment all patients are asked to give an informed consent. After enrollment the
      study doctor completes electronic questionnaire regarding the patients demographic data,
      medical history and vaccinations. Specific database for our study has been created by company
      Vision 5D. After completing electronic questionnaire the doctor collects 2 stool samples each
      2 ml of volume into Eppendorf tubes produced by our study laboratory. The samples are
      transported to our study laboratory where they are tested for rotavirus, norovirus G1, G2,
      astrovirus, adenovirus and sapovirus with Fast-Track Diagnostics real-time assay kit FTD
      Viral Gastroenteritis. The samples positive for rotavirus are refrigerated at -70 degrees for
      further genotyping and sequencing.
