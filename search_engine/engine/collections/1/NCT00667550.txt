      frequency, fecal incontinence, as well as sexual dysfunction, are directly affected by
      surgery for colorectal disorders. Increased risk of injury to the urinary tract is a
      recognized complication of pelvic surgery. These risks are related to the radical nature of
      pelvic surgery used to treat certain colorectal disorders, including colorectal malignancies
      and inflammatory bowel disease.

      Few studies have looked at the incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual
      dysfunction in patients with colorectal conditions before and after surgery.

      The primary goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms
      in women undergoing surgery for colorectal ocnditions. We also want to describe the
      prevalence of these symptoms in different colorectal disorders, and how pelvic surgery
      impacts these symptoms.
