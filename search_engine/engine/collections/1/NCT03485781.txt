    
      PROPEA3 is a prospective observational study investigating the recovery of propofol-induced
      EEG slow-wave activity and its association with neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.
      Comatose adult patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) after cardiac arrest are
      included. Patients with previous neurological disease expected to affect substantially EEG
      are excluded. The patients' relatives are asked for an informed written consent to
      participate. In the intensive care, the patients are sedated using continuous infusion of
      propofol while receiving temperature management/hypothermia treatment following the ICUs'
      common practice. EEG is recorded continuously from the admission to the ICU until 48 hours
      from the cardiac arrest. EEG slow-wave activity is determined offline by calculating the
      low-frequency (<1 Hz) power from the signal. The neurological recovery of the patients is
      defined 6 months after cardiac arrest from patient documents and/or by phone call to the
      patient/relative using Cerebral Performance Category. After the follow-up period patient or
      the relative is also asked to fill a survey (SF-36) to estimate the health and quality of
      life.
