      include:

        -  A clinical examination with pubertal stage assessment.

        -  A GnRH test

        -  A Pelvic ultrasound

        -  An MRI will be performed later after the results of GnRH test confirming precocious
           central puberty.

      These reviews are conducted as part of usual care and are required to validate the inclusion
      criteria of patients.

      The CBCL questionnaire will be completed by patient's parents and the first semi-structured
      interview will be conducted by a sociologist assisted by the psychologist, dedicated to the
      study.

      Patient's follow-up will be planned 6 months after inclusion, including similar
      investigations (except MRI).
