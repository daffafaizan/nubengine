      The success rate of Helicobacter pylori eradication in Korea is not sufficient in recent
      days. The main cause of eradication failure is known as antimicrobial resistance and previous
      studies showed that resistant rates were different according to the regions in Korea.
      However, until now, there are not enough studies about the nationwide results for
      antimicrobial resistance and previous reports used various methods for the resistant test.

      Theories and Plans:

      The nationwide resistant registry of Helicobacter pylori using standardized single method,
      agar dilution test, can be useful for the development of new eradication methods to make
      eradication rate higher. Moreover, the higher rate of Helicobacter pylori eradication can
      reduce the chance of gastric cancer and also can reduce the medical expenses.
