      growth factors in reproductive aged women,African-American women compared to Caucasian
      controls, and Fragile X premutation carriers.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Aromatase activity is up-regulated in preovulatory follicles with aging, accounting for
           the increased estradiol levels in the face of decreased inhibin secretion in
           reproductive aging.

        -  Increased estradiol in the face of normal inhibin A and inhibin B suggests up-regulation
           of aromatase in African-American women.

        -  Aromatase activity is down-regulated in preovulatory follicles in fragile X premutation
           carriers compared to age-matched controls and the activity is associated with FMR1 mRNA
           levels.
