    
      Variables affecting the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB in different cases and
      tumor scenarios will be studied in detail such as the influence of medical equipment used
      (i.e the different types and sizes of puncture needles), the experience of the
      endosonographers, cytopathologists and pathologists and the use of rapid on-site evaluation
      of cytology samples.

      Each study case is reviewed post-EUS (according to the schedule precised below) regarding
      further diagnostic work-up, neoadjuvant treatment, surgery result, clinical follow-up,
      (neo)adjuvant treatment, and survival. Non-parametrical tests will be applied as the main
      statistical method.
