    
      Study Aim 1: To transcreate the existing English-language 10 "Stop Smoking for Good" booklets
      and accompanying 9 supportive "My Story" pamphlets into a series of culturally relevant and
      acceptable materials for Spanish-speaking smokers who prefer to receive health information in
      Spanish. The adaptation of the intervention materials will be based upon the findings from a
      systematic formative evaluation employing a heterogeneous group of Hispanic/Latino smokers
      representing diverse subcultural groups.

      Study Aim 2: To test the efficacy of the self-help intervention developed in Study I among
      Spanish-speaking smokers in a randomized controlled trial. Participants (500) will be
      randomized to receive the Spanish-language version of the Stop Smoking for Good (SS-SP)
      intervention or usual care (UC) comprising an existing booklet from NCI. Investigators
      hypothesize SS-SP will produce higher abstinence rates than UC through 24 months.

      Secondary Aim: Test moderator variables to improve targeting the intervention. Moderator
      analyses will be exploratory, without strong a priori hypotheses.
