      AVM's or Angiodysplasia may be acquired or inherited as in a hereditary hemorrhagic
      telangiectasia (HHT). Repeated episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), especially in the
      elderly have been attributed to angiodysplasia. Clinically significant GIB may be also seen
      in up to 40% of HHT patients, usually in the fourth and fifth decades of life. GIB may
      manifest both as acute major hemorrhage, slow intermittent blood loss or a combination of
      these findings and patients may be symptomless, present with acute bleeding or iron
      deficiency anemia. Recurrent hemorrhage and persistent iron-deficiency anemia is common
      despite supplemental iron therapy and patients require repeated transfusions. Amongst
      patients with preexisting co-morbidities, repeated bleeding may lead to significant morbidity
      and mortality. Furthermore, re-bleeding among these patients consumes a disproportionate
      share of healthcare resources devoted to multiple admissions, repeated endoscopies and blood
      transfusions. There are no effective treatment options available currently. The purpose of
      this study is to determine whether Thalidomide is effective in the treatment of arteriovenous
      malformations in the gastrointestinal tract.
