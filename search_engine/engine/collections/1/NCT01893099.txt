      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of sorafenib in combination with SIR-SpheresÂ®
      radioembolization in uveal melanoma patients metastatic to the liver.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Translational research on biomarkers (blood and liver biopsies) as well as on
           radiological exam by using microbubble contrast enhanced ultrasound. Angiogenic markers
           such as VEGF, IGF-2, TFG Angiopoietin-2 and IL-8 will be monitored. Correlations will be
           investigated between the angiogenic markers (blood & tumor tissue), angiogenic
           radiological exam and the response to the treatment.

        -  To evaluate the response, clinical benefit, PFS and survival of the patients.
