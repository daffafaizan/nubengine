      AKI is established, treatment is largely supportive and no intervention has been found to
      restore kidney function or improve overall survival. Renal replacement therapy (RRT), usually
      in the form of hemodialysis, is frequently needed to manage patients with severe AKI. Such
      patients have an in-hospital mortality that consistently exceeds 50% with delays in RRT
      initiation implicated as a possible contributor. A recent meta-analysis suggested that
      earlier initiation of RRT may improve survival, but this is based on data derived
      overwhelmingly from observational studies. The investigators recently completed a
      multi-centre randomized controlled pilot trial that confirmed the feasibility of allocating
      patients to two different strategies of RRT initiation. Patient recruitment and follow-up, as
      well as patient safety, were successfully demonstrated during the pilot phase of this
      research program. The optimal timing of RRT initiation is an existing knowledge gap and a
      clear priority for investigation.
