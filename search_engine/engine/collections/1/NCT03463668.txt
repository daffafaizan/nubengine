      duodenal tumoral stenosis. The technical success is greater than 90%, however the endoscopic
      revisions that are duodenal or biliary are frequent. The IPC as a center of interventional
      endoscopy is very often in charge of these stenoses. We wanted to evaluate the efficiency and
      the duration of this effectiveness in current situation. Is there still room for
      gastrojejunal gastrojejunal surgery or for the development of endoscopic gastrojejunal
      anastomoses?
