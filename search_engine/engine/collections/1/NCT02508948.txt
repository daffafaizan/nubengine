    
      Aim 1: To derive and validate a prediction model for difficult airway (three or more attempts
      at laryngoscopy to place an endotracheal tube and/or the need for another operator among the
      critically ill) [37].

      Aim 2: To derive and validate a prediction model for hemodynamic compromise, i.e.,
      post-intubation hypotension [defined as a decrease at any point in mean arterial pressure
      less than 65 mmHg; systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg and/or a reduction in systolic
      blood pressure of 40% from baseline; or the initiation of, or increase in infusion dosage of,
      any vasopressor medication (bolus or infusion) during the 30 minute period following
      intubation] [38-39].

      Aim3: To derive and validate a predication model for hypoxemia (decrease in pulse oximetry to
      oxygen saturation less than 88% during the procedure).
