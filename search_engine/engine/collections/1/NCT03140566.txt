      acute decompensated heart failure. Therefore, no specific guideline recommendations are made
      in this regard. It is unknown whether an objective congestion marker can be used to guide
      decongestion or such marker is only of prognostic value by identifying high-risk patients
      with an advanced disease state.

      CAVA-ADHF is designed as prospective, randomized, controlled, patient-blinded, multicenter,
      parallel-group trial and aims to demonstrate effectiveness of inferior vena cava (IVC)-guided
      decongestion, its feasibility, and to estimate effect size and variability of clinical
      endpoints following the intention-to-treat principle.

      After inclusion and exclusion criteria have been checked patients will be randomized:

      Experimental intervention: Decongesting treatment guided by clinical assessment and
      ultrasound evaluation of the IVC diameter. Decongestion should lead to a maximal IVC diameter
      ≤2.1 cm and IVC collapsibility index >50% in addition to relief of symptoms and signs of
      congestion before discharge.

      Control intervention: Decongesting treatment guided by clinical assessment alone. The IVC
      ultrasound evaluation is performed, but results are not reported to treating physicians.

      Trial intervention will end with discharge from the index hospitalization. Patients will be
      followed-up for 180 to 210 days after randomization.

      The CAVA-ADHF trial is supported by the Deutsches Zentrum für Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung
      (DZHK).
