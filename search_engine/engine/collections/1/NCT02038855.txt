      referral; as well as testing the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of integrated
      behavioral health services in primary care clinics for migrant Latinos with co-occurring
      substance use and mental health problems, and increased risk of HIV.

      A key activity for the first phase, the screening project, is administering a screener to at
      least 450 Latino migrant patients across the 3 sites (n=150 each in Boston, Madrid, and
      Barcelona) from primary care and behavioral health (substance abuse and mental health)
      services. We intend to test the referral process for screened participants in need of
      treatment to identify barriers and streamline the process. We will analyze data to optimize
      the screening battery and protocol to use in Phase 2, the IIDEA intervention.

      In Phase 2, we intend to enroll, randomize and collect data on 360 total patients across the
      3 sites - 180 in the intervention condition and 180 in the control condition (120 in each
      site, 60 in the intervention condition and 60 in the control condition). The 10 session IIDEA
      intervention will be offered to Latino patients by trained clinicians with at least a Masters
      level of training. The intervention is designed to help patients to address and prevent
      mental health and substance use problems and will be culturally adapted to Latino populations
      in Boston, Madrid and Barcelona. Usual care - the control group - receives treatment as
      usual, for patients in primary care identified with a mental health or substance use problem.
      5 Research interviews will be conducted to assess outcomes, for patients in both the
      intervention and usual care arms.
