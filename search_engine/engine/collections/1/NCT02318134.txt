      enema with fresh bacteria,thus stabilizing intestinal barrier dysfunction,minimizing
      bacterial translocation and preventing infectious complications.The investigators will
      further examine the effect of FMT on inflammatory markersï¼Œthe predictors of Intestinal
      barrier injury and the incidence of infectious complications.
