      ephaptic cross-transmission takes place between the nude facial nerve fibers and the
      sympathetic nerve fibers on the arterial surface. Thus action potentials could spread
      indirectly from one facial nerve fiber to several other facial nerve fibers (via the "bridge"
      of sympathetic fibers), or directly from the sympathetic fibers to facial nerve fibers. The
      investigators assume this is the electrophysiological basis of hemifacial spasm and its
      characteristic sign abnormal muscle response (AMR). If an abnormal potential from the
      offending artery to the facial muscles similar to AMR can be recorded, the hypothesis will be
      verified.
