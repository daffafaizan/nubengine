      relaxation, increased rate of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Experimental increased
      colonic fermentation (FOS in diet) increase the occurrence of reflux events in patients with
      GERD. The aim of this study is to compare the low-FODMAP diet and classical GERD dietary
      recommendations (avoid fatty meals, head of bed elevation etc..) in patients with refractory
      GERD symptoms.
