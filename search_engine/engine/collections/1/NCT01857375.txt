      adults newly begun on insulin therapy during their hospital stay. Patients will have no prior
      experience using insulin or other self-administered injectable medicine. The study will
      examine which method of administering insulin reduces dosing errors, causes a lower incidence
      of low blood sugars, increases adherence to therapy and with which method patients are more
      satisfied.
