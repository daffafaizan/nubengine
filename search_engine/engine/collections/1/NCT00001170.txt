      assessed from early childhood to young adulthood. Parents with a diagnosis of major
      depression or bipolar illness and well parents and their children are studied (SADS-L, RDC,
      and SCID, DSM-III). A sibling pair is studied in each family. Parent-child interaction is
      investigated through direct observation of behavior in naturalistic and controlled settings.
      Family history information is obtained through parent interviews. Behavioral observations,
      standard tests, physical examinations, and psychiatric interviews, and MRI procedures provide
      multiple assessments of the offspring. The study has been completed through preadolescence,
      adolescence, and late adolescence. Follow-up in young adulthood continues.
