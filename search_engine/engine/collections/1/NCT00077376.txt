      I. To determine the response rate (as determined by RECIST criteria) to combination therapy
      with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550), trastuzumab, and carboplatin in patients with metastatic
      breast cancer known to overexpress HER2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine time to disease progression (TTP) and time to treatment failure (TTF) after
      treatment with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550), trastuzumab and carboplatin in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer known to overexpress HER2.

      II. To determine the toxicity of combination therapy with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550),
      trastuzumab and carboplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer known to overexpress
      HER2.

      III. To evaluate overall survival (OS) of combination therapy with Ixabepilone (BMS-247550),
      trastuzumab, and carboplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer known to overexpress
      HER2.

      IV. To correlate levels of phospho-STAT3 with levels of HER2, Survivin and EGFR expression as
      measured in tissue by immunohistochemistry.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Induction therapy: Patients receive trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) IV over 30 minutes* on days 1,
      8, 15, and 22 and ixabepilone IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      NOTE: *Trastuzumab is given over 90 minutes on day 1 of course 1 (induction therapy) only.

      Maintenance therapy: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years from
      study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-6
      months.
