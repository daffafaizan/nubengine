      engineering strategy to assemble an anti-BCMA CAR(chimeric antigen receptor) in T cells will
      help these CART cells to recognize and kill BCMA-expressing MM tumor cells. BCMA-UCART is a
      kind of allogeneic CART, originating from T cells of health donors. This open-label,
      dose-escalation study aims to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of BCMA-UCART in
      treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
