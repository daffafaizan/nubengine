      from heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) to improve
      functional status and quality of life. Yet it is unknown which pts of the whole HFrEF
      population are most likely to benefit from this new promising therapy. As this invasive
      technique should definitely not be proposed for all HFrEF pts with left ventricular ejection
      fraction of 35 % or less the aim of this single center prospective clinical trial is to
      evaluate to which extent possible factors (e.g. cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT),
      atrial fibrillation) may influence the response to BAT. To analyze any possible differences
      concerning the modulation of the autonomic nervous system caused by BAT in the presence of
      atrial fibrillation or cardiac resynchronization therapy, heart rate variability (HRV)
      analyses will be performed additionally. As autonomic nervous activity plays a pivotal role
      in the genesis and termination of atrial fibrillation any possible impact of baroreflex
      activation therapy on atrial fibrillation will be examined.
