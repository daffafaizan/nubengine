      transplantation has been demonstrated to improve the outcome of ocular surface
      reconstruction. However, the conventional management of allograft limbal transplantation
      generally has unsatisfactory outcome because of high risk of rejection and requires long-life
      immunosuppressive medications. Ocular surface reconstruction with cultivated autologous
      mucosal epithelial transplantation is served to improve the surgical results of ocular
      surface reconstruction and decrease the use of immunosuppressive medications
