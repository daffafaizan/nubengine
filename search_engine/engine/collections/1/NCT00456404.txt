      or more week gestation, were assigned randomly to 2 groups, with one of 2 regimens
      (peppermint water, an old household remedy, and no treatment only using breast milk) to right
      and left sides. Each group was followed for a maximum of 3 visits within 14 days and until
      the 6 weeks postpartum by telephone call. The aerial parts of Mentha piperita were purchased
      from Hakim Momen Tabrizi Company, and the identity was confirmed by morphological
      characterization in comparison with the herbarium specimen retained in the School of
      Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Also, a voucher specimen has been generated
      in that herbarium.
