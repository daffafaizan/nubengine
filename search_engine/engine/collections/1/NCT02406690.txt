      the biochemical process of methylation, and estrogen receptor binding (this is a group of
      proteins in the cell that are activated by the hormone estrogen) in patients that have failed
      to produce adequate endometrium (uterine lining) in synthetic embryo transfer cycles when
      compared to patients whose endometrium thickness is within normal limits.

      Appropriate embryo development and luteal phase (when fertilization and implantation occur)
      transformation of the endometrium create a small window of opportunity where successful
      implantation can occur. The interaction between the embryo and the endometrium is complex and
      poorly understood.

      The endometrium, which consists of two layers called the functionalis and basalis, goes
      through changes during the menstrual cycle. The changes that occur are needed for successful
      implantation of an embryo. The proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle is primarily
      governed by estrogen and is responsible for the thickening of the endometrium. Progesterone
      primarily controls the last half of the menstrual cycle and causes changes which allows for
      embryo implantation.

      Through in vitro fertilization (IVF), the investigators have seen that the correct thickness
      of endometrium is a marker of successful implantation and ongoing pregnancy, although the
      reason for this is not entirely clear. In order to better understand the processes that may
      occur in the endometrium, the investigators are conducting a study which evaluates
      biochemical markers of those patients who have shown a failure to proliferate during previous
      synthetic IVF frozen cycles and biochemical markers of control patients who have no known
      endometrial pathology.
