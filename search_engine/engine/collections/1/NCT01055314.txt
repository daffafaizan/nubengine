    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of administering IMC-A12 (cixutumumab) in combination with a
      multi-agent intensive chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma
      (RMS).

      II. To determine the feasibility of adding temozolomide to vincristine (vincristine
      sulfate)/irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) cycles in patients with high-risk RMS.

      III. To assess immediate and short-term side effects of delivery of concurrent
      temozolomide-vincristine-irinotecan with irradiation in patients with high-risk RMS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To gain a preliminary estimate of the response rate to IMC-A12 or temozolomide plus
      vincristine/irinotecan in previously untreated high-risk RMS.

      II. To obtain preliminary efficacy data for IMC-A12 or temozolomide in combination with a
      multi-agent interval compressed chemotherapy regimen in previously untreated high-risk RMS.

      III. To determine the effectiveness of detecting metastatic disease with fludeoxyglucose F 18
      positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and to compare assessment of response using standard
      imaging techniques with response assessed by FDG PET.

      IV. To assess changes in serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, IGF-BP3
      as biomarkers of IGF-IR inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of cixutumumab. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups according to the timing of their enrollment onto the study.

      GROUP 1: Patients receive vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) over 1 minute on day 1 of
      weeks 1-5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 20-24, 28, 29, 32, 33, 35, 38, 41-44, 47, 48, 50, and 51;
      irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 1, 4, 20, 23, 47, and 50;
      ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 of weeks 9, 13, 17, 26,
      and 30; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1 and 2 of weeks 7, 11, 15,
      28, and 32; cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of weeks 7, 11, 15, 28, 32, 35,
      38, 41, and 44; dactinomycin IV over 1-5 minutes on day 1 of weeks 35, 38, 41, and 44; and
      cixutumumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 1-51. Patients also undergo radiation therapy*
      on days 1-5 of weeks 20-24.

      GROUP 2: Patients receive vincristine sulfate, irinotecan hydrochloride, ifosfamide,
      etoposide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin and undergo
      radiation therapy* as in group 1. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5
      of weeks 1, 4, 20, 23, 47, and 50.

      GROUP 3: Patients receive vincristine sulfate, irinotecan hydrochloride, ifosfamide,
      etoposide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin, and cixutumumab and
      undergo radiation therapy* as in group 1. Patients also receive temozolomide as in group 2.
      (Discontinued as of January 2013)

      NOTE: *Patients with parameningeal tumors and evidence of intracranial extension or those
      requiring emergency radiotherapy may receive radiation therapy starting in week 1;
      cixutumumab should be withheld during radiation therapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then periodically
      for up to 5 years.
