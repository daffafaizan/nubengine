    
      OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility of a randomized trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs.
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation for patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or
      gastroesophageal junction.

      RESEARCH PLAN Phase III randomized 2-arm parallel group pilot study

      1:1 randomization to A) or B)

      TREATMENT REGIMEN A) PERIOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY (OPTION of CHEMO REGIMEN 1 or 2) 1) FLOT -
      Four x 14 day cycles FLOT preoperatively and 4 cycles postoperatively: 5-Fluorouracil 2600
      mg/m², day 1 IV every 14 days Leucovorin 200 mg/m², day 1, IV., every 14 days Oxaliplatin 85
      mg/m², day 1, IV, every 14 days Docetaxel 50mg/m2, day 1, IV, every 14 days

      OR

      2) ECF / ECX - Three x 21-day cycles ECF preoperatively and 3 cycles postoperatively (within
      4-10 weeks after surgery): Epirubicin (50 mg/m²,) day 1 IV Cisplatin: 60 mg/m², day 1 IV
      5-Fluorouracil: 200 mg/m², daily for 21 days by continuous IV infusion 5-FU may be
      substituted with Capecitabine (Xeloda) 625mg/m2, BID (ECX)

      OR

      B) NEOADJUVANT CHEMORADIATION

      1) -carboplatin and paclitaxel given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29

        -  paclitaxel: 50 mg / m2 IV

        -  carboplatin: dosed to an area under the curve of 2, by Calvert formula Radiation Therapy
           45-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions of 1.8 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/wk 45-50.4 Gy in 25-28
           fractions of 1.8 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/wk Upon completion of neoadjuvant therapy, all
           patients will be considered for surgery.

      Patients will be deemed acceptable for surgery provided:

        -  repeat imaging performed after neoadjuvant therapy does not demonstrate distant
           metastases or local invasion of the primary tumor into vital structures (heart, great
           vessels, trachea)

        -  maintenance of adequate performance status and ability to tolerate esophagectomy

      Surgery will be performed preferably within 8 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant therapy.
