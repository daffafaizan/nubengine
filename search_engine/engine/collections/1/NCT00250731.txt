      family and partners helps diabetes patients manage their illness better. However, diabetes
      programs rarely involve the partner. This is a pilot proposal to develop and test an
      intervention that aims to both enlist the support of partners of diabetes patients, and
      enhance and improve the quality of that support. We believe that the intervention will help
      the relationship and also will have a positive impact on medical (e.g.,blood sugar control),
      behavioral (e.g., increased exercise, better diet) and emotional (e.g., depression) outcomes.
      The intervention will be implemented by telephone, in order to enhance the project's ability
      to reach a broader sample of patients.Forty-five couples will be recruited in which one
      partner has type 2 diabetes. After initial testing and basic diabetes education, they will be
      assigned to one of three comparison groups. For those in the intervention groups they will
      participate in 11 telephone contacts with a diabetes educator and a counselor and will
      receive education about diabetes, behavior change, emotional issues/couples communication,
      and problem solving techniques. A manual will include readings, structured homework
      assignments, and self-monitoring logs. They will be re-tested 2 weeks and 3 months after the
      intervention.
