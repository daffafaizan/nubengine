    
      This study compares clinically-relevant therapeutic options in two high-volume hospitals (one
      public, one university) to address the core research question of whether non-pharmacologic
      approaches improve symptom management among diverse inpatients. Study investigators will
      assess the effectiveness of acupuncture and of pain counseling independently and in
      combination.

      Participants will be randomized to two factors each with two levels, yielding four
      experimental conditions: (1) standard pharmacologic pain management, (2) pharmacologic pain
      management + acupuncture, (3) pharmacologic pain management + pain counseling, (4)
      pharmacologic pain management + acupuncture + pain counseling. Patient outcomes will be
      assessed using a mixed-methods approach, with validated scales for quantitative measures and
      qualitative interviews to elicit stakeholder perspectives (patients, caregivers, providers).

      The study will be conducted as a pragmatic clinical trial at two hospitals to address these
      aims:

        1. Determine the effectiveness of adjunctive acupuncture and of pain counseling for
           improving pain management.

        2. Determine the extent that adjunctive acupuncture and pain counseling reduce use of
           opioid analgesics and side effects.

        3. Examine stakeholder perspectives on non-pharmacologic approaches to pain management.
