    
      The study was conducted in 2 parts.

      Part 1 of the study had 5 arms using weight based ribavirin 800-1400 mg/day and compared:

        -  PegIntron and ribavirin for 48 weeks (Arm 1 - Control)

        -  PegIntron, ribavirin, and boceprevir for 28 weeks (Arm 2)

        -  Lead-in with PegIntron and ribavirin for 4 weeks followed by PegIntron, ribavirin and
           boceprevir for 24 weeks (Arm 3)

        -  PegIntron, ribavirin and boceprevir for 48 weeks (Arm 4)

        -  Lead-in with PegIntron and ribavirin for 4 weeks, followed by PegIntron, ribavirin and
           boceprevir for 44 weeks (Arm 5)

      Participants from Arm 1 receiving PegIntron and ribavirin that were HCV positive after 24
      weeks of treatment had the option to receive boceprevir in combination with PegIntron and
      ribavirin for an additional 24 weeks. All participants from Arm 1 that started boceprevir
      after Week 24 formed the crossover arm (Arm 8).

      Part 2 of the study assessed the safety and efficacy of low dose ribavirin (400-1000 mg/day)
      and compared:

        -  PegIntron, ribavirin (800-1400 mg/day) and boceprevir for 48 weeks (Arm 6)

        -  PegIntron, low-dose ribavirin (400-1000 mg/day) and boceprevir for 48 weeks (Arm 7)

      Follow-up for all participants was up to 72 weeks after randomization.
