      Primary

        -  Assess the clinical efficacy of bortezomib based on the evaluation of objective tumor
           response rate.

      Secondary

        -  Assess additional clinical efficacy of bortezomib based on the evaluation of time to
           early disease progression and median overall 2-year survival rate.

        -  Assess safety and toxicity in these patients.

        -  Assess quality of life using the Lung Cancer Symptom Score.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to current treatment
      (first-line vs second-line)

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 5 weeks for
      up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      exhibiting objective response or stable disease by week 20, may continue treatment at the
      discretion of the investigator until evidence of disease progression.

      Quality of life is assessed periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 57 first-line setting and 54 second-line setting patients will be accrued
      for this study.
