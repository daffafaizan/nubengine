      with an established diagnosis of benign essential blepharospasm from February 2013 to
      December 2015. Patients received a full injection pattern of 5 sites on one eye and a medial
      lower eyelid waived injection pattern of 4 sites on the other eye randomly. They were
      surveyed on ocular surface disease index (OSDI), Jankovic rating scale (JRS), blepharospasm
      disability index (BSDI) prior to injection and 1week, 1month and 3 months after injection. At
      these time points, closure of the eyelid, tear break up time (BUT), Schirmer test ï¼©, and
      lower lid tear meniscus height (TMH) were also measured.
