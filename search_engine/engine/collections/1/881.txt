serum chorionic 'growth hormone-prolactin' and serum pituitarygrowth hormone in mother and fetus at term.chorionic 'growth hormone-prolactin' (cgp) andpituitary hgh were measured inmaternal and fetal blood obtained simultaneouslyat term from 29 pregnant womenand their fetuses utilizing sensitive radioimmunoassayprocedures.  the mean concentrationof serum cgp in maternal venous bloodwas 5.6  g/ml (sem0.39) whereasin umbilical venous serum the mean concentrationwas 0.019  g/ml (sem 0.003),a 300-fold difference.  contrariwise, the meanconcentration of serum hgh in maternalserum was 5.9 m g/ml (sem 0.52) andin umbilical venous serum the levelwas 33.5 m g/ml (sem 4.6).  the ratio of serumcgp/hgh in maternal venous serumwas 1076 in contrast to 0.57 in umbilical venousserum.  the findings strongly suggestthat cgp is secreted by the syncytiotrophoblastalmost exclusively in a unidirectionalmanner into the maternal circulation.further, it is unlikely that an appreciableexchange of hgh occurs between thematernal and fetal circulations.  thedata support the view that the growth hormone-likemetabolic changes observed inpregnancy are attributable to the effects of cgpand are consistent with the hypothesisthat cgp is an important metabolic hormoneof pregnancy exerting its actionson the mother and possibly the placenta, but onlyindirectly on the fetus.
