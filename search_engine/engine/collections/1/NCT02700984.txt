    
      The COMPASS Trial (TMI-09-01) was a prospective, randomized, comparative multicenter study to
      assess the safety and effectiveness of the CyPass Micro-Stent in subjects with primary open
      angle glaucoma who were undergoing cataract surgery. In the study, 505 subjects were
      randomized to either the CyPass group, who underwent cataract surgery and received the CyPass
      Micro-Stent, or the Control group, who underwent cataract surgery alone. All subjects
      randomized were to be followed for 2 years postoperatively. Four hundred eighty (480)
      subjects completed this study.

      The COMPASS-XT (TMI-09-01-E) Trial is designed to collect safety data beyond 24 months
      postoperatively for subjects who completed the COMPASS Trial. In COMPASS-XT, clinical data
      will be collected at 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months postoperatively for a total of 5
      year follow-up across the 2 studies.
