      following five surgical procedures for congenital heart defects: 1) unrestrictive ventricular
      septal defect (VSD) repair; 2) atrioventricular septal (AVSD) repair; 3) arterial switch
      procedure for transposition of the great arteries (TGA); 4) bidirectional Glenn shunt
      procedure; and 5) Fontan procedure for single ventricle lesions. PVT is partially controlled
      by NO. Arginine, the precursor to NO, is a product of the urea cycle. Preliminary data have
      been presented regarding 169 infants and children who have undergone one of six previous
      surgical procedures. It was found that urea cycle function and plasma arginine levels were
      significantly decreased in all participants. Furthermore, participants with increased PVT had
      significantly lower arginine levels compared to participants with normal PVT. Finally, a
      genetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the rate limiting urea cycle enzyme (carbamyl
      phosphate synthetase I [CPSl T1405N]) appeared to affect postoperative plasma arginine levels
      and PVT. The hypothesis is that genetic polymorphisms in the rate limiting urea cycle enzyme
      CPSl, and other important enzymes in the urea cycle, influence the availability of NO
      precursors. It is further hypothesized that perioperative enhancement of urea cycle function
      with the key urea cycle intermediate (citrulline) will increase plasma arginine and NO
      metabolites and prevent elevations in PVT.
