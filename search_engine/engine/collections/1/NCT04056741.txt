      surfactant insufficiency, also known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). All commercially
      available surfactants for clinical use are approved for administration through an
      endotracheal tube. Placement of an endotracheal tube, a procedure called intubation, is
      stressful for the infant and associated with significant adverse effects. The proposed
      supraglottic instillation device allows infants to benefit from surfactant therapy while
      avoiding the negative effects of intubation.
