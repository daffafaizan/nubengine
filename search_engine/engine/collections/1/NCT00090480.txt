      will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,600 will die of the disease this year despite all
      current therapy. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to breast cancer gene therapy
      using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans in attempt to vaccinate
      patients against their breast cancer. The expression of the murine alpha (1,3)
      galactosyltransferase [alpha (1,3) GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of alpha
      (1,3) galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with relapsed or
      refractory breast cancer will undergo a series of four intradermal injections with a vaccine
      composed of irradiated allogeneic breast cancer cell lines (HAB-1 and HAB-2) that have been
      transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector
      expressing the murine alpha (1,3) GT gene. Endpoints of the study include determination of
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and immunological
      responses.
