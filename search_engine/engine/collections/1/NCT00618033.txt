    
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded cross-over non-inferiority trial of intra-
      and early post-dialytic glucose homeostasis comparing 100 mg/dL against 200 mg/dL dialysate
      glucose concentration in 30 hemodialysis patients. The primary outcome is the frequency and
      magnitude of hypoglycemia during and early after the hemodialysis treatment. Secondary
      outcomes include intradialytic blood pressure, interdialytic weight gain, serum potassium and
      phosphorus concentrations, arrhythmias during dialysis and in the early postdialytic period,
      and postdialytic fatigue.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Age â‰¥ 18 years

      Maintenance hemodialysis with hemodialysis vintage of at least 30 days

      Ability to read and understand the English language and give informed consent

      Exclusion criteria:

      Dialysis treatment frequencies other than three times per week

      Hospitalizations or antibiotics-dependent infection during the 8 weeks preceding enrollment

      Central venous catheter as hemodialysis access
