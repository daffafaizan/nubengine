      scan or no screening. It is scheduled to enroll 4000 smokers and former smokers, and the
      study is scheduled to last 5 years, i.e. an initial (prevalence) screening is followed by 4
      annual (incidence) screenings.

      In addition the following investigations are done: A prospective, longitudinal questionnaire
      assessment of enrolled participants who have received a false positive diagnosis. The
      questionnaire will focus on the consequences of receiving a false positive diagnosis. Answers
      from enrolled subjects who have received a false positive diagnosis will be compared to their
      own "baseline" responses, and responses from subjects who have received a negative result of
      their own low-dose CT scans All participants will annually be questioned regarding smoking
      habits, their motivation for cessation of smoking and will be advised to refrain from smoking
      to assess the effect of participation in a screening protocol for lung cancer on cessation of
      smoking.

      Socioeconomic consequences of screening for lung cancer will be assessed by longitudinal
      registration of costs and benefits (e.g. morbidity, hospitalization, GP consultations etc.

      Assess the value of PET scanning when screening for lung cancer.
