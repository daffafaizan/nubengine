      follow-up, and long-term follow-up.

      Approximately 550 men with mCSPC will be randomized. Eligible participants will be randomly
      assigned to either of 2 treatment groups as follows:

        -  Talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide.

        -  Placebo capsules identical in appearance to talazoparib capsules in combination with
           enzalutamide.

      Talazoparib or identical placebo treatment will be blinded. Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) will be
      open label. The dose of talazoparib/placebo to be given in combination with enzalutamide is
      0.5 mg once daily. Participants with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 by
      the MDRD equation) at screening may be enrolled and the talazoparib/placebo dose will be 0.35
      mg once daily.
