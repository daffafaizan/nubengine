      obstruction reversibility tests with forced expiratory manoeuvres, such as forced expiratory
      volume in one second (FEV1), are scarce. Such studies, however, seem to show favourable
      effects on clinical parameters.

      This may explain the subjective improvements and changes in quality of life with long-acting
      b2-agonists in patients with COPD. The lack of effect on forced expiration tests may be due
      to early airway collapse and subsequent airflow decline causing underestimation of the
      existing bronchodilatory effects located more peripherally in the respiratory tract, where
      the major site of resistance is located in obstructive lung disease.

      We therefore design a study aimed to assess the short term effects of one short-acting
      beta2-agonist vs placebo, and the effects of an additional and sequential administration of a
      different bronchodilator, like tiotropium bromide (anticholinergic agent) on the work of
      breathing, and its components (i.e., lung resistances and compliance) of COPD patients with
      poor reversibility assessed using the classical Pulmonary Function Tests.
