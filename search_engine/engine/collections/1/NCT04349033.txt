      helpful for some people with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Also, helping patients understand
      the role of the brain in pain has been helpful. We have developed a virtual human interviewer
      to help patients talk about their pain and their lives. We will conduct an experimental study
      to compare the effects of several different types of VH interviews. Patients with chronic
      pain will be randomized to receive one of three VH interviews: emotional disclosure and brain
      education; emotional disclosure alone; or a control basic pain interview. Patients will be
      assessed at baseline and 1-month follow-up on a range of attitudinal and clinical measures to
      determine how these different interviews affect outcomes.
