      correlate with the invasive arterial blood pressure curve to calculate the index of
      cerebrovascular autoregulation Mx (Mx>0.3 indicates impaired AR). The index of
      cerebrovascular autoregulation Mx was measured during baseline positive end-expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) levels and after lung recruitment with higher level of PEEP. The equality
      between this two PEEP levels was estimated and calculated with one side Wilcoxon test.
