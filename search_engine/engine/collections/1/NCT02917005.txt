      4/6 and ER signaling is a highly effective therapeutic strategy in HR+ MBC. With the
      unprecedented success of palbociclib in PALOMA-1 trial, several phase 2 and 3 trials are
      underway to evaluate this agent (and other CDK4/6 inhibitors as well) in the different
      clinical scenarios of HR+ breast cancer [28].The vast majority of these trials -if not all-
      are testing these novel agents in postmenopausal patients, which would render the clinical
      experience of these agents restricted to postmenopausal women (median age was 62 years in
      PALOMA-1 trial) The scarcity of clinical trials addressing endocrinal therapy in
      premenopausal women with MBC is, at least in part, related to the fact that the majority of
      women in western countries are diagnosed with breast cancer during their postmenopausal life.
      However the situation is rather different in many countries, including those in the Middle
      East region, where the median age of women diagnosed with breast cancer is below 50 years,
      and where approximately 50% of these patients are still menstruating.

      This study will be the first to explore the therapeutic effects of palbociclib when combined
      with exemestane and ovarian function suppression (OFS) in premenopausal with hormone receptor
      positive and HER2 negative MBC, and how it will compare to the classic approach of using OFS
      plus an aromatase inhibitor.
