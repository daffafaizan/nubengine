      cells. Glucose is the main source of energy for many cells in the body, and clinicians
      routinely use a scan which looks at glucose metabolism to assess if cancer treatment is
      working. However, some cancer cells can create energy to survive and grow in a different way,
      using fatty acids. In this study, the investigators are using a PET/CT scan to look at a
      variety of cancer types to see which cancers use fatty acids for energy and if this can be
      measured. The PET/CT scan will be carried out twice on 2 separate visits so that the
      investigators can check that both scans give the same result.

      The investigators will also carry out special tests on the tumour tissue taken during routine
      cancer surgery. These tests will look for specific substances in the cancer cells that are
      related to cancer biology and growth. The investigators will then compare the results from
      the surgical tissue to the results of the scan to see if there is a relationship between
      them.

      The study will look at 21 patients with solid tumours conducted in 4 NCITA accredited
      centres, which have different strengths in recruiting specific patient/tumour-type cohorts.
      Each patient will have two scan visits (between 2-15 days apart) prior to any new treatment
      starting to check that the scan measurements are repeatable.
