      defecation or fecal incontinence. This study is to compare Delorme operation alone or with
      post anal repair and levatorplasty for treating complete rectal prolapse. Consecutive
      patients who were treated for complete rectal prolapse at our Colorectal Surgery Unit were
      eligible for the study. Exclusion criteria include pregnant female, any patients with
      previous anal surgery, pudendal nerve neuropathy, anal fistula and sepsis or coagulopathy.
      All patients underwent clinical evaluation, proctoscopic examination, and sigmoidoscopy.
      Anorectal physiology studies consisted of anal manometry and measurement of pudendal nerve
      terminal motor latency (PNTML) to exclude pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome. Patients
      enrolled in the study were randomized into three groups using the closed envelope method. The
      envelopes were drawn and opened by a nurse not otherwise engaged in the study in the
      operating room. The patients were randomized into two groups: Group I: consisted of patients
      were subjected to delorme operation only. Group II: consisted of patients were subjected to
      delorme operation with post anal repair and levatorplasty.
