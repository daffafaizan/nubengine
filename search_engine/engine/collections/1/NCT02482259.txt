      advanced hepatocellular cancer. It is also evaluating whether there may be any correlation
      between these assessments and toxicity of treatment and outcome.

      The assessments include: Frailty score, nutritional assessment, comorbidity score and quality
      of life. In addition sarcopenia will be assessed measuring muscle mass from imaging performed
      as part of routine clinical care.

      The assessments will be performed at baseline on entry into the study, at week 9 and week 18.

      There is the option for patients to also donate a blood samples for research purposes.
