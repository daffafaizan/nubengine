      transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), affects brain function in people with major
      depression.

      tES delivers low electrical current to the head using electrodes applied to the skin, and is
      described as a "neuromodulation" or "neurostimulation" technique. This study uses a specific
      kind of tES called "transcranial direct current stimulation", or tDCS, where a constant
      (unchanging) electrical current is passed between two electrodes on the head.

      Neuromodulation methods like tES have shown promise in changing brain function, as well as
      treating some brain disorders like major depression. Yet, how tES brain function remains
      unclear. To better understand how tES works, the investigators will use MRI (a type of brain
      scan) to measure brain function during tES in people with major depression.
