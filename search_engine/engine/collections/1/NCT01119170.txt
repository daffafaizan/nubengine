      lactate, in its two stereoisomer forms, known as the D (dextrorotary) or L (levorotary) is
      also produced in the colon through the normal fermentative process of lactic acid producing
      bacteria. Both D-lactate and L-lactate produced by these microbes are metabolized by enzymes
      within human cells and do not typically pose an acid-base risk by reducing pH to a
      threatening degree in healthy individuals.

      However, the specific dehydrogenase that converts D-lactate to pyruvate is far less active
      than that for L-lactate, and it has been suggested that very young infants may be a
      vulnerable group for D-lactic acidosis. Previous data have shown that urinary D-/L- lactate
      excretion were not significantly different between 2 groups of 4 month old infants taking a
      control formula or a formula containing D-lactate producing probiotics for 4 weeks. However,
      measures were not collected in babies during the first month after birth.

      In this study we want to test the safety of D-lactate producing bacteria in babies from birth
      to 1 month of age. This safety study is a randomized, controlled, single center, clinical
      trial of 2 groups of infants.

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is:

      to evaluate the effect of a starter formula containing D-lactate producing probiotics versus
      a starter formula without probiotics, on D-lactic acid urine levels in healthy formula-fed
      infants, from birth to 28 days of age. Urinary D-lactate concentration (mmol/mol creatinine),
      will be measured at (baseline, 7 days, 14 days and 28 days).

      Secondary objectives include evaluation of effects on gut microbiota, gastrointestinal
      tolerance, duration of sleep and crying, morbidity and growth, with a follow up to 6 months
      of age.
