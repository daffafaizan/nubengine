      function at adolescence in very low birthweight (VLBW) children, to identify perinatal risk
      factors for persistent symptoms or impaired lung function tests at adolescence, to assess the
      exercise tolerance in VLBW children and to search for genetic susceptibility markers
      associated to impaired lung function.

      The main criteria for analysis will be the forced expiratory volume in one seconde (FEV1) The
      study duration will be 36 months the number of centers will be 4 centers in France
      (Paris-Necker, Nantes, Lille, Rouen) The number of patients to be included will be 400,
