      I. To assess treatment related gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity for
      patients who undergo SBRT for localized prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Follow quality of life after SBRT using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)
      and American Urological Association (AUA) scores.

      II. Assess biochemical control after high-dose SBRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 5 fractions of prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy over 10-12 days
      with at least 40 hours between each fraction in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1.5, 4, 8, and 12 months,
      every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.
