      determine shift and volume changed from the initial treatment-planning CT to the time of the
      radiation boost (approximately 4 weeks). These ultrasounds are done prior to their weekly
      doctor's appointment with Radiation Oncology.

      When it is time to perform the radiation boost (when the radiation is more targeted to the
      lumpectomy cavity), the ultrasound will be done daily with the participant in treatment
      position. The SonArray system used for the ultrasound-driven targeting for prostate cancer
      will be utilized. If the lumpectomy cavity is observed, the ultrasound suggested shifts will
      be noted and compared to the shifts needed for standard clinical set up.

      Once the subject has completed radiation therapy, the study participation is complete.
