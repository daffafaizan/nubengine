    
      Intervention Group The Intervention Group will enter daily tasks into the Mymee app. After
      the first intake session, the subject will participate in weekly 20-30-minute coaching
      sessions with the Health Coach. At the second session, the Health Coach will review the
      symptoms and the free text entered by the subject to determine which dietary and
      environmental factors will be monitored in the Mymee app.

      Each subsequent week, the Health Coach will review and discuss with the subject the food
      diary and the data entered into the Mymee app during the previous week. Based on this
      discussion and the subject's medical records, the Health Coach will determine or revise which
      symptoms will continue to be monitored using the Mymee App.

      Control Group The Control Group subjects will receive no training, coaching, or other
      intervention services from Mymee. The Control Group subjects will complete the same battery
      of assessments at the same intervals as the Intervention Group subjects.
