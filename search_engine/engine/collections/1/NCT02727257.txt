      controls and the effect of motor-cognitive rehabilitation program on attention.

      Methods: 103 Parkinsonians (stage 2,5-3 H&Y) hospitalized for a 4-week Multidisciplinary
      Intensive Rehabilitation Treatment and 34 healthy controls were enrolled. All subjects
      underwent three different attentive tasks: visual reaction times, auditory reaction times and
      multiple choices reaction times tasks. To evaluate the effect of rehabilitation on attention,
      patients performed the same battery at discharge. To investigate the effects of MIRT on motor
      functions and quality of life we also assessed UPDRS III, Timed Up and Go test and
      Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire.
