      To compare the effects of partnered YOCAS, non-partnered YOCAS interventions, and standard
      care on changes in insomnia measured via Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) among cancer survivors
      and caregivers

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To compare the effects of partnered YOCAS, non-partnered YOCAS interventions, and standard
      care on changes in sleep quality measured via Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) among
      cancer survivors and caregivers

      OUTLINE: Cancer survivor-caregiver dyads are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Standard Care: Cancer survivor-caregiver dyads receive their standard care

      ARM II: Partnered YOCAS: Cancer survivor-caregiver dyads participate in 8 virtual Zoom YOCAS
      sessions (75 minutes/session, 2 times a week for 4 weeks) together

      ARM III: Non-partnered YOCAS: Cancer survivors participate in 8 virtual Zoom YOCAS sessions
      (75 minutes/session, 2 times a week for 4 weeks) alone; caregivers do not receive Zoom YOCAS
      sessions
