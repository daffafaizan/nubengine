      Treatment (iEAT) manual and address the unmet needs of many children with chronic food
      refusal by providing a technology-based treatment that makes it easy for parents to
      understand how to duplicate the models of institutional care. The study seeks to expand upon
      this treatment by introducing the manual and procedures in an electronic form to be
      implemented by caregivers in a home environment.

      The study team aims to enroll 20 participants with chronic food refusal and formula or
      feeding tube dependence. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the iEAT manual
      intervention with the technology supported manual or a control group (10 participants per
      group). The intervention with the iEAT manual will involve 10 biweekly outpatient
      appointments of about 45 minutes in length. Target behaviors will be assessed during each
      treatment meal. Participants will be assessed pre-treatment and at a one month follow-up to
      assess long term effects. Parents in the control group will provide a food diary once a
      month, for 5 months. Those assigned to the control group will be able to cross-over to
      receive the iEAT treatment manual following completion of post-study measures. Screening,
      collecting data for outcomes measures, and the intervention will be conducted at the each
      participant's home. Data will be collected on parent compliance with the treatment manual and
      child food acceptance, nutritional intake, and refusal behaviors.
