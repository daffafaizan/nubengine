      word learning success in healthy subjects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind clinical trial, we probe whether a mixed d1/d2 dopamine agonist (pergolid) or
      cholinergic neuromodulation (rivastigmine) or a general centrally arousing substance
      (modafinil) will yield a learning enhancement comparable to using levodopa in healthy
      subjects.

      Our results show that the dopamine agonist pergolide impaired learning in healthy subjects
      compared to placebo, whereas cholinergic neuromodulation had no effect.
