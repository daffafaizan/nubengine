    
      Median nerve excursion will be assessed by ultrasonography during three positions: standard
      MNT1, neck flexion with MNT1, and ipsilateral rotation combined with MNT1. Both arms will be
      tested.

      Arm will be held in abduction to 90° - 110° and external rotation to 90°, forearm supination,
      elbow extension and wrist and fingers extension using a custom made splint.

      The standard MNT1 includes neck contralateral side flexion. Then, the researcher will move
      the neck passively into rotation and flexion. Passive range limit will be determined prior to
      testing using a goniometer and passive end feel. Movement order will be randomized using an
      excel random function.

      Every position will be tested three times. A single researcher will do all movements
      passively. Nerve excursion will be measured in real time by the same ultrasonographer who is
      blinded to patients grouping.
