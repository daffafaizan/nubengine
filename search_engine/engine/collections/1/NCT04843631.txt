      study of BFI-751 compared with EU-Stelara ® and US-Stelara ® in healthy adult volunteers.

      Within 28 days of screening, eligible participants will commence a confinement period on Day
      -1. The participants will receive a 45mg dose of either BFI-751, Stelara-US ® or Stelara-EU®
      in a blinded manner on Day 1 and will remain in the clinic until Day 2.

      Participants will then return to the clinic as outpatients on Days 3, 5, 8, 11, 15, 22, 29,
      36, 43,57, 71 and 85 for safety assessments.

      A total of up to 228 eligible participants will be enrolled and randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio
      (BFI-751: EU-Stelara ® : US-Stelara ® ).
