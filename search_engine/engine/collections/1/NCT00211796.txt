      to extend this research to autistic adults with high levels of aggression, irritability,
      affective instability, or agitation. We aim to have 10 adult autistic patients enrolled in
      our study of the treatment of aggression/irritability with divalproex sodium ER. This will be
      an open treatment for adult patients to determine if the tolerability of divalproex sodium is
      better with the extended release. We propose this open label design because previous
      double-blinded studies of divalproex sodium were only done in children, not adults. These
      results will serve as pilot data for a future blinded study for autistic adults with the
      extended release formulation. This naturalistic design will allow for prior stable (3 months)
      use of concomitant medications. Our objective is to determine how well these patients can
      tolerate the prescribed doses and what added benefits can be attributed to divalproex sodium
      ER.
