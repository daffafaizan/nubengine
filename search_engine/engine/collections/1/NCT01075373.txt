      subjects. The specific aims are:

        1. To test the hypothesis that the patient group with good antipsychotic treatment response
           mainly carries the risk polymorphism of DRD2 and COMT genes (the dopamine transmission
           genes) while the group with poor antipsychotic treatment response mainly carries the
           risk polymorphism of DISC1 and NRG1 genes (the neurodevelopmental genes). This
           association is controlled by the polymorphism of genes of drug metabolizing enzymes.

        2. The good vs. poor treatment response group will have different manifestation patterns in
           biomarkers directly or indirectly related to neurodevelopmental or dopamine
           neurotransmission genes. These potential biomarkers included biochemical parameters,
           electrophysiological and neurocognitive indicators.

        3. The good vs. poor responder group has differential changes of the response-related
           biomarkers comparing pre-treatment and post-treatment status in special sub-sample of
           the drug-naïve early schizophrenia patients.
