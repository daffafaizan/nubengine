        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with stage I-IV (including stage IVA and
           IVB) head and neck cancer treated with fruit and vegetable extracts vs placebo.

        -  Compare the effect of these extracts on biomarkers (p27 expression, cell proliferation
           of Ki-67, DNA damage, and T-cell function) in these patients.

        -  Correlate changes in biomarkers with other factors (e.g., site and stage of the original
           tumors, tobacco/alcohol use, or depression) in patients treated with these extracts.

        -  Compare serum carotenoids and antioxidant levels (vitamins A, C, and E) at baseline and
           posttreatment in patients treated with these extracts.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients are
      stratified according to tobacco use (yes vs no), alcohol consumption (yes vs no), and tumor
      stage at diagnosis (I vs II vs III vs IVA vs IVB). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral fruit and vegetable extracts twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment in both arms continues for
           12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 18 months.
