      for any province in China. About 800 HIV inpatients are admitted to our hospital every year,
      amongst them about 10% co-infected with HBV. HIV and HBV co-infection patients must receive
      two drugs active against both HIV and HBV, for example Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)+
      lamivudine (3TC) or TDF+FTC. TDF and 3TC are nucleotide analogues that can inhibit both HIV
      and HBV DNA polymerases (Dore, Cooper et al. 2004). Combination therapy could decrease drug
      resistance. In China, TDF is a second-line drug of the national free ART program; however FTC
      is not in the list of free drugs. There is likely higher risk of causing drug resistance in
      treating HBV or HIV infection with 3TC or TDF monotherapy than combination therapy.

      Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of HIV-1 integrase, and does not significantly
      inhibit human phosphoryl transferases including DNA polymerases α, β, and γ, and may have
      less adverse effects. In chronic HBV infection, HBV-DNA does integrate into human DNA which
      results in difficulty eradicating HBV from the patient's body.

      In this pilot study, the investigators would examine the safety and efficacy of integrase
      inhibitor-Raltegravir in the control of HIV/HBV co-infection.
