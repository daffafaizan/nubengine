      independently associated with prolonged hospital stay, higher cost, a 3-fold increased risk
      of dying by six months and ongoing neuropsychological dysfunction. Hypothesis: Based on our
      preliminary work, we hypothesize that standard use of GABA agonist sedatives such as
      lorazepam and propofol may contribute to ICU delirium and its attendant untoward clinical
      outcomes. An alternative sedation strategy targeting alpha2 receptors and sparing GABA
      receptors (dexmedetomidine) might reduce delirium, provide adequate sedation, reduce
      analgesic requirement, and concurrently improve cognitive performance.

      Long-term objective: To standardize and compare different strategies of sedation and
      analgesia for ventilated ICU patients in order to optimize their clinical outcomes focusing
      on delirium and the long-term neuropsychological dysfunction of ICU survivors.

      Specific Aims:

        -  to study prevalence and duration of delirium in critically ill patients using
           differential exposure to alpha2 vs. GABA receptor agonists while evaluating efficacy of
           sedation and analgesia;

        -  to compare clinical outcomes including duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of
           stay and severity of neuropsychological dysfunction at hospital discharge; and

        -  to develop pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models for dexmedetomidine and lorazepam
           when used for up to 5 days in ICU patients.

      Relationship to anesthesiology: We will study whether the adverse clinical outcomes
      associated with ICU delirium including long-term neuropsychological dysfunction can be
      modified by the choice of psychoactive agents frequently used by anesthesiologists and
      intensivists.

      Design: A blinded, randomized controlled trial of adult mechanically ventilated patients
      using a sedation strategy of dexmedetomidine ± fentanyl versus lorazepam ± fentanyl, with
      relevant outcomes and safety monitoring.
