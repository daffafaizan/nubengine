      improved clearances across a wide molecular weight range compared to post-dilution HDF
      (post-HDF).

      Plan of Investigation: Prevalent patients on thrice weekly HD or HDF who have a single pool
      Kt/v>1.2 will be randomized in to either study arm A (pre-HDF, post-HDF) or B (post-HDF,
      pre-HDF) after a conditioning period on post-HDF. Dialysis prescription will be kept constant
      during study periods including blood flow, dialysate flow, dialysate content, filter type and
      size. Pre-dialysis and post-dialysis bloods will be drawn at baseline and at the end of each
      treatment with either modality. Reduction ratios of small and middle molecular weight toxins
      and protein bound toxins as well as markers of inflammation and nutrition will be compared
      between two modalities. Assessment of blood pressure (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring)
      and patient wellbeing (questionnaire) will be performed at the end of each period.

      Children will be recruited from paediatric dialysis units in London, Istanbul Heidelberg and
      Lyon with extension to other centres to be confirmed.

      Outcomes: If the results of this study demonstrate better clearance with pre-dilution HDF
      compared to post-dilution HDF, this will inform a future long-term outcome study comparing
      different HDF modalities and will contribute to define optimum dialysis modality for
      children.
