      sleep, is the most prevalent sleep complaint in primary care. Insomnia is associated with
      decreased quality of life, work limitations and increased healthcare utilization. Currently
      there is no treatment for chronic insomnia that is readily available, affordable, without
      significant side-effects and demonstrated to be safe for long term use. Consequently,
      treatments that would fill this gap are needed.

      Chamomile (Matricaria recutita) has been used as a gentle sleep agent by herbalists for
      several hundred years. It has been studied in animals for its sedative potential and shows
      promise for treating insomnia. Currently, chamomile's sedative mechanisms of action are
      unknown, but are thought to be through the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central
      nervous system, γ - aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, no study has examined chamomile's
      efficacy and safety for treating insomnia.

      The investigators propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of chamomile
      in primary care patients with chronic insomnia. Thirty-four patients will be randomized to
      either Chamomile High Grade Extract, three 5 mg tablets standardized to 0.4% (-)-α-bisabolol
      twice daily or placebo and will be followed for 28 days for changes in a sleep diary (sleep
      efficiency, total sleep time, sleep-onset latency and sleep quality), insomnia severity and
      sleep disturbances. Secondary endpoints include assessing changes in day time functioning
      (measures of global quality of life, depression and anxiety) and monitoring for any signs of
      toxicity. The investigators will also determine the feasibility of conducting a larger trial
      with this agent.
