      client proteins helping them to fold correctly as they take up their rightful positions in
      the cell. Hsp90 has a special fondness for oncoproteins whose structures shift according to
      functional state. Among Hsp90's clients, a surprising number are well recognized targets in
      oncology, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). SNX-5422 is a pro-drug
      of SNX-2112, a potent, highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of the molecular chaperone
      heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Treatment of HER2-positive cell lines such as BT-474 with the
      Hsp90 inhibitor SNX-2112 results in cellular degradation, decreased levels of
      phospho-AKT/cyclin D1, and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with SNX-5542 caused
      tumor regression, including remission in a HER2-overexpressing breast cancer xenograft model.
      SNX-5422 has demonstrated significant antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of various
      human malignancies, including breast (BT474, MX-1), lung (H1975, H1650, EBC-1), colon (HT29),
      prostate (PC3), and melanoma (A375) with multiple oral dosing regimens.
