    
      Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a protein that regulates
      multiple transcription factors involved in cancer cell signaling and APX3330 is a highly
      selective inhibitor of APE1/Ref-1 redox function.

      The anti-tumor effect of APX330 has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models and
      the human safety profile of APX3330 was established in prior clinical studies. Apexian
      Pharmaceuticals is developing APX3330 as an orally administered anti-cancer agent targeting
      the APE1/Ref-1 protein.

      APX_CLN_0011 is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation oncology study in
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The study primary objective is to determine the
      recommended Phase 2 study dose of APX3330. Secondary objectives include assessment of APX3330
      safety, anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.
