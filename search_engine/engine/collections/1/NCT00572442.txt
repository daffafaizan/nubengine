      as a tool to measure the heart's magnetic field.However, it is not yet approved for the
      specific diagnosis of coronary artery disease.

      The MCG scan is entirely non-invasive, rapid and no risk, since it does not require stress
      provocation, radiation, or use of medication or contrast.

      In this study, the MCG will be used to compare the scans of normal, healthy volunteers to
      those which have been previously or are currently being collected in subjects with known
      heart disease.
