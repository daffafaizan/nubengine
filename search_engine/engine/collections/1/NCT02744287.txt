    
      The goal of this study is to characterize the feasibility, safety, and clinical activity of
      PSCA-specific CAR-T cells, BPX-601, administered with rimiducid to subjects with previously
      treated, PSCA-positive advanced solid tumors (pancreatic or prostate). BPX-601 CAR-T cells
      are genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to target the PSCA
      antigen and a rimiducid-inducible signaling domain which functions as a molecular "go-switch"
      to enhance activation and proliferation.

      Phase 1: Cell dose escalation to identify the maximum dose of BPX-601 administered with
      single or repeat doses of rimiducid (fixed dose of 0.4 mg/kg per infusion).

      Phase 2: Indication-specific dose expansion to assess the safety, pharmacodynamics (including
      BPX-601 persistence), and clinical activity at the recommended dose identified in Phase 1 in
      various PSCA-expressing solid tumors.
