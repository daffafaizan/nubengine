      infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately.

      Thiazide-type diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and some of
      angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB) were reported to reduce renal excretion of urate and
      increased serum uric acid levels, Beta-blockers also elevate serum uric acid levels.

      Hyperuricemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Hyperuricemia was found to
      correlate with hypertension excluding the influence of other factors such as age and renal
      function. Furthermore, many studies found that hyperuricemia was independently associated
      with cardiovascular events in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs.

      It is important to control serum uric acid levels in hypertensive patients treated with
      antihypertensive drugs in order to reduce the risk of gout and cardiovascular events. There
      is a gap in knowledge in studies showing the effect of antihypertensive drugs on serum uric
      acid in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.
