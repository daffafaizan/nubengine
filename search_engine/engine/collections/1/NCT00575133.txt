      of alternative clinical condition associated with NAFLD (see exclusion criteria). Of all
      patients fulfilling inclusion criteria, relevant baseline characteristics (incl.
      epidemiological, physiological and biochemical data) will be obtained. In addition,
      radiological examination will be performed using sonography and fibroscan to assess
      non-invasively the individual extent of hepatic fat deposition, liver stiffness (fibrosis)
      and amount of visceral fat mass. In case of high clinical, laboratory and radiological
      suspicion for NAFLD, a diagnostic liver biopsy will be performed. A part of the liver tissue
      is used for histological confirmation of NAFLD and subsequent grading and staging according
      established criteria. Parts of the remaining liver tissue will be stored for later molecular
      and histological analysis. In addition, several serum samples are collected of patients and
      stored for future analysis. All patients will be followed up annually (incl. physical
      examination, metabolic characterisation, clinical chemistry and liver sonography) and
      additional serum samples will be collected for future analysis. Liver biopsy is not repeated
      after defined time period, but in case of clinical evidence for disease progression.
