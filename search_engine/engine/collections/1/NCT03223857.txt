      intraocular lenses (IOL). This prospective study is performed at the department of
      Ophthalmology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.

      Patients who received bilateral implantation of a multifocal intraocular lens pre-enrollment
      were included consecutively. Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgeries excluding
      cataract surgery and refractive lens exchange, regular corneal astigmatism of >1.5 diopter,
      and ocular pathologies or corneal abnormalities. At 3 months postoperative examination
      included manifest refraction; monocular and binocular uncorrected (UCVA) and
      distance-corrected (DCVA) visual acuity in at far, intermediate at near distance (logMAR);
      slit-lamp examination. 3 months postoperatively defocus testing, binocular contrast
      sensitivity (CS) under photopic and mesopic conditions, and a questionnaire on subjective
      quality of vision, optical phenomena, and spectacle independence were performed.
