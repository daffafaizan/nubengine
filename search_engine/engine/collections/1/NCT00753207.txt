      Primary

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of fixed-dose lapatinib ditosylate in combination
           with epirubicin hydrochloride in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  To determine the optimally-tolerated regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the clinical efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To analyze pharmacokinetic data of this regimen.

        -  To determine biomarkers that correlate with clinical benefit or response to lapatinib
           ditosylate in these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  To identify tumor-derived or blood-derived biomarkers that correlate with or are
           predictive of clinical response or benefit to lapatinib ditosylate in these patients.

        -  To determine the levels of IGF-IR and phosphorylated IGF-IR in tumor tissue.

        -  To determine the expression pattern of the proteins associated with drug resistance that
           may be clinically active in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of epirubicin hydrochloride.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate followed by epirubicin hydrochloride IV over 15-30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 7 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic analysis via liquid
      chromatography-mass spectometry (LC-MS).

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 28 days and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
