      new home-use sensor with extended battery life in detecting continuous EHG in a range of
      uterine contraction intensities, frequencies, and durations compared to gold-standard
      FDA-cleared tocodynamometer (GE Corometrics 250cx) in non-stress testing for antepartum
      surveillance.

      An "at-home" study will validate the developed modifications to the wearable sensors system
      that provides a continuous electrohysterography (EHG) along with other additional
      physiological parameters (e.g. heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep quality, physical
      activity, and continuous blood pressure) for longitudinal monitoring in the home setting.
