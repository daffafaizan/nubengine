      distension medium. At the end of the surgery, in the control group C, CO2 was removed by
      passive exsufflation through the port site. In the intervention group A, at the end of the
      surgery, the upper part of the abdominal cavity was evenly and bilaterally filled with the
      0.9% normal saline in the amount of 500 cc. We will leave the fluid in the abdominal cavity.
      Then, patients will be placed in the Trendelenburg position (30 degrees), and a pulmonary
      recruitment maneuver consisting of five manual pulmonary inflations was performed with a
      maximum pressure of 60 cm H2O. The anesthesiologists held the fifth positive pressure
      inflation for approximately 5 seconds. During these maneuvers, the surgeon was instructed to
      ensure that the trocar sleeve valve was fully open to allow the CO2 gas to escape.

      In the intervention group B, at the end of the surgery, the upper part of the abdominal
      cavity was evenly and bilaterally filled with the 0.9% normal saline in the amount of 500 cc.
      We will leave the fluid in the abdominal cavity.

      Patients will be asked to fill out questionnaires up to 48 hours to determine the frequency
      and severity of their shoulder and upper abdominal pain. The scores will be assessed 12, 24,
      48 hours after surgery using a visual analogue scale( VAS) from 0 ( no pain) to 10 ( worst
      possible pain).
