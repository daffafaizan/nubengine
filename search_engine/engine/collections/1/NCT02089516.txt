      Netherlands. All subjects will be asked to fill in the Groningen Frailty Index. We aim to
      select patients with varying GFI scores to ensure that we include patients with different
      degrees of frailty. The participating subjects will be asked to wear the DynaPort MicroMod
      during six hours. Two research employees will observe all activities of the participating
      subjects in their home environment. The participant will be instructed to act like it is a
      normal/usual day. Every 5 minutes the type of activity at that moment and movement intensity
      of the last 5 minutes (METs scale) is manually entered onto a case report form (CRF) by the
      two employees. The timing has to be exact in order to compare the data to the data of the
      DynaPort MicroMod. Type of activity is described as well as categorised into lying, sitting,
      standing or walking. Movement intensity is categorised according to a MET-value (Metabolic
      Equivalent of Task).

      Sensitivity, specificity, and percentage of overall agreement will be calculated for each
      type of activity (standing, sitting, lying, walking) and for intensity. The primary analysis
      will be the comparison between walking and not walking (lying, sitting or standing). An
      overall agreement/sensitivity/specificity of 90% or higher is considered as sufficient
      agreement. The Bland and Altman method will also be used as multiple observations are
      recorded per patient, the limits of agreement will also be calculated with the Bland and
      Altman method for repeated measures.
