      (ASD) and the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, resulting in significant
      functional impairments. Despite documentation that symptoms emerge in the first year of
      life), the average age of diagnosis is 3 years of age for males with FXS. Females with FXS
      are often diagnosed even later as they typically have a less severe phenotype. The delay of
      diagnosis can reduce timely access to interventions that could have significant consequences
      for the developmental trajectories of these children. Furthermore, the delay in diagnosis has
      significantly limited the ability of researchers to understand the natural progression of
      symptomology and thereby better address treatment options.

      The primary goal of the proposed project is to develop and test, through an iterative
      process, an intervention to address and support the development of infants with a confirmed
      diagnosis of FXS who are identified at birth. PiXI aims to utilize the foundational knowledge
      available around the development of and early intervention for at-risk infants to both
      understand the needs of and provide intervention services for families of infants diagnosed
      pre-symptomatically with FXS.

      The investigators aim to 1) develop PiXI with a pilot sample of families, 2) test the
      preliminary effects of PiXI on infant and parent outcomes. Specific infant outcomes include
      communication, motor, cognitive skills and autism spectrum disorder symptoms. Parental
      outcomes include parenting efficacy.
