      BurstDR stimulation parameters alternated with periods during which no stimulation is being
      delivered.

      In this study the investigators propose to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of BurstDR
      microdosing, and determine optimal microdosing programming parameters in chronic pain
      patients, who are eligible for SCS therapy.
