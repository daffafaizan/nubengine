      Routine anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed
      by warfarin is recommended in this setting, but limited data is available to support this
      recommendation and more than 20% of these patients do not receive antithrombotic treatment
      due the fear for bleeding complications. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      characteristics of rivaroxaban make this drug an ideal alternative therapeutic strategy for
      the treatment of patients with SVT. Thanks to the oral route of administration, the short
      half-life, the high bioavailability, the predictable dose-response and the lack of effects on
      platelet activity, rivaroxaban could result as an important alternative to both LMWH and
      warfarin in the acute and long-term treatment of SVT patients. Furthermore, the analysis of
      phase III studies conducted in patients with DVT or PE have shown a better safety profile of
      rivaroxaban as compared to standard of treatment. This observed benefit in the safety profile
      of rivaroxaban would be extremely relevant in the treatment of patients with SVT. In this
      prospective cohort study, patients presenting with acute SVT will receive rivaroxaban 15 mg
      bid for 3 weeks followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg od for a total of 3 months. The primary safety
      and efficacy outcomes will be measured at 3 months.
