    
      The current study is designed to complement and expand the previous PK studies, API-E004-CL-B
      and API-E004-CL-B2, with emphasis on lower E004 dose strengths (at 90 and 100 mcg per
      inhalation), for a more thorough evaluation of the E004 PK profiles. Safety of E004 will also
      be evaluated, under augmented dose conditions.
