           virtually impossible on histopathological grounds alone. Inactivation of p16 gene by CpG
           methylation is an early frequent event during oral carcinogenesis. To investigate the
           predictive value of p16 methylation on malignant potential in OED, we carried out the
           prospective cohort study.

        -  Methods: 101 patients with histologically confirmed mild or moderate OED were included
           in the present study. Baseline information of p16 methylation status of the OED lesions
           from 93 cases was obtained by methylation-specific PCR. Progression of the OEDs lesions
           was examined in 78 cases histologically during the 45.8 months double-blind followup
           survey (78/93). The association between p16 methylation and progression of OED was
           analyzed with SPSS13.0 software. All P-values were two-sided.
