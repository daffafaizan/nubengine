      of cancer-related deaths in the world. Because HCC is insidious and early diagnosis is
      difficult, most patients have locally advanced or distant metastasis at the time of
      diagnosis. So they are not suitable candidates for curative treatments by resection or
      transplantation. Currently, Sorafenib is the only choice approved by FDA for advanced HCC,
      although it prolongs the survival for less than 3 months. Transarterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) is an important method of minimally invasive therapy in the comprehensive treatment of
      liver cancer. As a kind of combined treatment, it can obviously prolong the survival time of
      the patients. Recently, metabolomics studies of HCC have shown that typical Warburg effect
      was observed in hepatoma carcinoma cells. Arginine hydrochloride is a new anticancer drug in
      the treatment of liver cancer, which is mainly aimed at the pathway of energy metabolism.
      Trimetazidine hydrochloride may play an anti-tumor role by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation.
      The investigators have been proceeding this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with arginine hydrochloride and trimetazidine
      hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
