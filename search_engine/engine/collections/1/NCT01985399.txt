      neurocognitive dysfunction will likely become an increasingly common problem. Older
      individuals could be at increased risk for efavirenz-associated adverse effects due to
      impaired metabolism, increased drug-drug interactions, and lower physiologic reserve, but
      there are few data on the long-term safety of efavirenz (and other antiretrovirals) in older
      individuals with HIV.

      The Stanford HIV Aging Cohort (SHAC) is an ideal setting to study potential neurologic
      effects of antiretrovirals in aging patients. SHAC is an ongoing longitudinal study initiated
      in 2008 to evaluate aging in virologically-suppressed HIV-infected individuals. The cohort is
      supported through multiple grants including a grant from the State of California's HIV
      Research Program as well as a NIH supplemental grant. As of September 2013, approximately 150
      virologically-suppressed HIV-infected adults have been enrolled. In addition to enrolling
      patients with good adherence to ART, the cohort purposefully excludes subjects with active
      substance abuse, unstable medical conditions, and psychiatric illnesses to limit potential
      confounding the study end points. Recently, an NIH supplemental grant (AI069556) was received
      which will expand the SHAC to 300 HIV-infected subjects. The median age of the subjects in
      the cohort is in the mid-50's allowing an ample number of older subjects for our planned
      studies.
