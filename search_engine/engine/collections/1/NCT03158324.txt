    
      This is a phase IIa open-label, non-randomized dose-expansion study of OPB-111077 in patients
      with advanced, treatment refractory cancers who have biopsy-amenable lesions at study entry.
      Patients on the proposed study will be treated with the RPII dose of OPB-111077 (600mg on a 4
      days-on, 3 days-off per week schedule). They will be enrolled in two parallel cohorts: i.
      patients with tumors predicted to be dependent on oxidative phosphorylation metabolism or
      oncogene addicted tumors which have developed resistance to primary TKI therapy, or ii.
      patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma

      Each cohort will contain 11-26 patients, over a period of 12-36 months. Subjects will receive
      OPB-111077 in 28-day cycles till disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Mandatory
      tumour biopsies will be performed at baseline and on cycle 1 day 15 (where feasible and
      accessible). Circulating biomarker blood sampling will be performed on days 1, 11 and 15 of
      cycle 1, and upon completion of OPB-111077 dosing. Pharmacokinetics blood sampling will be
      performed on days 11 and 15 of cycle 1. Safety assessments will be performed on cycle 1 day
      1, cycle 1 day 8, cycle 1 day 15, bi-weekly till week 8, then monthly thereafter and response
      assessments will be performed every 8 weeks. Metabolic response assessment by PET/CT will be
      performed after 2 cycles of treatment, while radiologic response assessment will be performed
      after every 2 cycles of OPB-111077 from cycle 4 onwards.
