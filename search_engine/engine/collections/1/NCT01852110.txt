      will be discontinued. After the first 2 weeks, if the dose is not tolerated, the regimen may
      be modified according to a defined algorithm. Specifically, the participant will begin
      administration of a reduced dose for up to 2 weeks, followed by a re-challenge at the
      original dose only if tolerability issues diminish or resolve at the reduced dose.
