      observed in subjects with impaired renal function are not appreciably different from subjects
      with normal renal function. Reoccurrence of neuromuscular blockade was not observed, and
      sugammadex was safe and generally well tolerated in subjects with severe renal impairment. In
      a previous trial, subjects (n=15) with severe renal impairment received a dose of 2.0 mg.kg-1
      of sugammadex. The effects of the other proposed recommended dose for routine reversal, 4.0
      mg.kg-1, on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics had not been studied thus far in subjects
      with severe renal impairment. The objectives of this trial were to assess equivalence with
      respect to the efficacy of sugammadex in subjects with normal renal function or severe renal
      impairment, to evaluate the safety of sugammadex in these subject groups and to compare the
      pharmacokinetic profiles.
