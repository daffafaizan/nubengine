      The design of the study is a prospective non-blinded, non-randomized control study.
      Enrollment will occur at the time of initial clinic visit. All patients presenting with CMC
      arthritis and deemed appropriate for surgery will be considered for screened for inclusion.
      As a part of routine workup for CMC arthritis patients receive a hand xray. Specific
      attendings will perform their preferred technique for CMC arthritis: two perform denervation
      of the CMC joint, and two perform trapeziectomy with ligament reconstruction
      tendon-interposition (LRTI) only per their normal clinical practice.

      Pre-operative and peri-operative care will be unchanged from standard patient care. Both
      procedures are outpatient procedures, usually performed under regional anesthesia and
      patients go home the same day. Patients are discharged with a standard thumb spica splint
      which is removed on their first clinic appointment which is generally post-operative day 7.

      Patients enrolled in the study will have additional follow up at the 3, 6, 12 and 24 month
      time points. At the 3, 6, 12 and 24 month time points patients will be asked to come to
      clinic for evaluation with 1) a standard hand questionnaire the Michigan Hand Questionnaire,
      2) lateral pinch strength, grip strength and range of motion testing, 3) Kapandji score, 4)
      visual analog pain scale. Each visit will take approximately 15 minutes. Patients who are
      unable to follow up in clinic will be given a phone questionnaire with the Michigan Hand
      Questionnaire, visual analog pain scale and opiate usage. There is no monetary compensation
      for participation in the study.
