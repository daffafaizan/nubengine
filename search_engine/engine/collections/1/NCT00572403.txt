      development of microalbuminuria. The secondary objective is to determine whether uric acid
      levels at the final visit are correlated with the onset of microalbuminuria. Of participants
      returning for a 4-5 year follow up visit as part of a continuing project, we will examine the
      proportion that have developed microalbuminuria. Subjects found to have microalbuminuria will
      be offered therapy with the ARB losartan and will be followed at three months to determine if
      there has been a reduction in levels.
