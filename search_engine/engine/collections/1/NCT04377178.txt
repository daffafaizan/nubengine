      processing it in the automated milling system (AMS). The material will be moistened and then
      placed in toto into the extraction sockets to generate particles at settings 1 (500 RPM for
      30s) or 2 (900 RPM for 30s) to generate MS and SS respectively ((SS group; 0.5-0.8 mm) and
      medium size (MS group; 1.0-1.2 mm)).
