      cancer. An innovative recovery treatment is in demand for stroke motor recovery. Paired
      associative stimulation (PAS) is a new technique where one pairs a peripheral stimulation
      with centrally applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and produces plasticity, as
      measured by TMS motor-evoked potentials (MEP's). The investigators will also compare
      post-stroke patients to healthy controls on the modulation effect of PAS and motor behavior
      measures.

      Aim1. To investigate whether PAS (PAS25 or PAS10) can modulate motor excitability and
      plasticity;

      Aim2. To investigate whether PAS can modify motor behaviors measures in both post-stroke
      patients and healthy controls;

      Aim3. To investigate whether post-stroke patients show different modulation of PAS on both
      cortical plasticity and motor behavior measure compared to healthy controls.

      For this study the investigators will enroll a total of 10 chronic stroke patients and 10
      neurologically healthy controls matched for age and gender. Participants will have 4 visits.
      The first visit is for screening. They will receive either sham PAS or real PAS25 or real
      PAS10 at each following treatment visit.

      Experimental Methods: Clinical Behavioral Measures: Handgrip; Nine-hole Peg Test; Wolf Motor
      Function Test; Imaging protocol: T1 weighted anatomical image, fluid attenuation inversion
      recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Stimulation locations: Left primary
      motor (M1); right median nerve; PAS methods: TMS stimulation will be delivered at 25 ms or 10
      ms or 100 ms after median nerve stimulation.
