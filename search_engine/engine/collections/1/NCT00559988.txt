      with an increased incidence of stroke in patients with additional risk factors. Oral
      Anticoagulation (OAC) reduces stroke risk, but because these arrhythmias are frequently
      intermittent and asymptomatic, start of OAC therapy is often delayed until
      electrocardiographic documentation is obtained.

      Technological advances in implanted dual-chamber cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac
      resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) devices allow early detection and real time
      verification of AF/AFL with intracardiac electrograms (IEGM) automatically transmitted to the
      clinicians. Such remote diagnostic capability might be particularly relevant in patients with
      asymptomatic AF by allowing timely treatment. Compared to conventional periodic, (e.g.,
      quarterly) office device evaluation, daily remote monitoring may prove superior for diagnosis
      of AF and prophylactic treatment of thromboembolism.

      The start, stop and restart of OAC based on a predefined atrial rhythm-guided strategy in
      conjunction with a standard risk-stratification scheme could lead to better clinical outcomes
      compared with conventional clinical care. The study is designed to demonstrate a risk
      reduction of both thromboembolism proximate to episodes of documented AF/AFL and bleeding
      potentiated by chronic OAC in the absence of AF. Verification of this premise would impact
      the clinical practice, providing evidence to physicians for the use of HM to guide OAC in
      patients with AF/AFL. The results of this study should demonstrate the clinical value of
      wireless remote surveillance of the cardiac rhythm and may define the critical threshold of
      AF/AFL burden warranting OAC or antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients at risk of stroke
