    
      Randomized controlled trial with a pragmatic emphasis undertaken in real world primary care.

      The brief intervention has been designed and piloted by the mental health team at the Chilean
      ministry of health, as also the written support material. This intervention is the same that
      is being implemented national wide.

      The implementation will include training of the paramedics, and then an accreditation session
      with a simulated participant in a double sided mirror.

      Randomization will take place on site using a opaque envelope. The sequence will be keep on
      site in a secured box.

      Data will be registered by the same person delivering the intervention and kept safe at the
      clinical sites. Once a month the data will be physically transferred to the operational
      center at the San Joaquin site of the Catholic University of Chile.

      Bimonthly visits will be performed to the centers by a member of the team to assure that the
      protocol is being followed and data audit.

      The participants will receive an economical incentive for the follow up visit. Participants
      will be reached throw telephone at least twice to schedule that visit. If not possible, a
      telephonic outcome assessment or a domiciliary visit will be performed to minimize the lost
      in follow up.
