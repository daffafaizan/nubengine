    
      Clinical features and outcomes of the patients included in the study will be assessed as
      better detailed in the following lines:

        1. To define the diffusion of the practice of treating pelvic lymph-nodes in patients
           affected by intermediate/high/very high risk non-metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) among
           Italian Radiation Oncology Centers, submitted to radical or post-operative radiotherapy;

        2. To define the diffusion of the different radiotherapy techniques used to treat pelvic
           nodes and the other features of the radiation treatment;

        3. To register prospectively biochemical and clinical failure, prostate cancer deaths and
           deaths for any cause in the population studied;

        4. To register prospectively the toxicity due to radiotherapy and androgen deprivation
           therapy in patients treated with pelvic nodes radiotherapy;

        5. To compare clinical outcomes and toxicities observed in the different clinical and
           therapeutic subgroups with the corresponding historical data relative to PCa patients
           treated with radiotherapy with or without elective pelvic nodal irradiation, already
           available in the existing Italian Society of Radiation Oncology databases;

        6. To exploit the collected data to define the need and the features of a prospective
           randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of elective pelvic nodal irradiation in
           patients with intermediate/high/very high risk non-metastatic prostate cancer.
