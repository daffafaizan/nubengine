      maxillofacial surgery setting. The risk of excessive bleeding prompts physicians to stop
      multiple antiplatelet agents before minor surgery, which puts coronary stenting patients at
      risk for adverse thrombotic events. Adequate hemostasis must be achieved in order to make
      oral surgeries possible for these patients without discontinuation of the antiplatelet
      regimen. The HemCon Dental Dressing (HemCon Medical Technologies, Inc, Beaverton, OR) is a
      novel chitosan-based hemostatic agent which may greatly improve upon the efficacy of wound
      healing and hemostasis both in extent and time for minor oral surgeries. Dental extractions
      will be performed in patients under dual antiplatelet therapy without altering their
      medication regimen. All patients will require to have two or more surgical sites so they will
      have internal surgical control sites. Cutaneous bleeding time and platelet aggregation tests
      will be obtained prior to extractions. The primary hemostasis will be evaluated by measuring
      the intraoral bleeding time after each extraction and further bleeding and healing outcomes
      will be ascertain by phone questionaires and clinical evaluations. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of HemCon Dental Dressing in controlling post extraction
      bleeding and to ascertain its role in healing of extraction wounds compared to a standard
      haemostasis method.
