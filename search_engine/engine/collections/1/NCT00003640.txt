      bladder who are disease free or who have minimal disease 3 months after thorough
      transurethral resection (TURB) and escalated dose
      methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the
      combination of thorough TURB and escalated dose M-VAC followed by radiotherapy with respect
      to bladder preservation for patients who respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. III. Evaluate
      the proportion of patients remaining disease free and not requiring cystectomy at 1 year. IV.
      Evaluate the feasibility and morbidity of this treatment schedule in multiple institutions
      applied by urologists of possibly varying endoscopic ability.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients undergo a local transurethral resection.
      Patients then receive methotrexate IV on day 1, followed by vinblastine IV, doxorubicin IV,
      and cisplatin IV on day 2. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered on days 4-10. Chemotherapy is
      repeated every 14 days for 3 courses. After the end of chemotherapy, patients undergo another
      local transurethral resection in order to define response to treatment. Patients with minimal
      or no disease are treated with radiotherapy. Patients who still have disease undergo a
      cystectomy. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, and then every 6
      months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29-73 patients will be accrued for this study.
