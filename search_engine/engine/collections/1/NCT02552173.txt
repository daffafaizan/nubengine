      three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction of the femur, using both the distal
      femoral epicondyles and the posterior femoral condyles to determine the femoral diaphyseal
      plane. And investigators compare the surgeon's estimate of intraoperative stem version and
      stem version of CT scan.
