      I. To estimate the proportion of patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer,
      who survive progression-free without going on a subsequent therapy against the disease for at
      least 6 months and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or
      partial), treated with BIBF 1120 (nintedanib).

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of BIBF 1120 in this cohort of patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with
      persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer treated with BIBF 1120.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
