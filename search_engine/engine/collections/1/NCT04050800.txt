      will be sent to the clinical laboratory for safety assessments before a single dose,
      intravenous (IV) administration of 555 MBq of Carbon-11 butanol. VSs will be re-measured,
      ECGs will be acquired again, and more blood will be sent to the clinical laboratory for
      repeat safety assessments after 2 hours of whole body (WB) scanning. WB scanning will consist
      of imaging acquisition sweeps of 200 cm from head-to-toe over 180 secs (3 min). Up to 40
      sweeps per imaging session will be performed. The subjects will then be given a rest period
      ("coffee break") for about two hours, after which the entire sequence of events will be
      repeated. The primary outcome measure will be related to radiation safety derived from the
      areas under the time-activity curves (AUCs) for internal organs. Co-primary clinical safety
      measures will include changes in VSs, ECG parameters such as the PR and corrected QT
      intervals, and clinical laboratory tests, such as proteins that reflect renal and hepatic
      function. Secondary endpoints will include the time-activity curves (TACs) and total volumes
      of distribution (VT) in several brain regions. The results should allow calculation of the
      repeatability coefficients (RCs) under zero-biological-change conditions. RC values will be
      essential for understanding whether future measurements of effect sizes in response to
      therapeutic maneuvers or the differences between groups are meaningful.
