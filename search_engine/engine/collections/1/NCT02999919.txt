      underwent elective caesarean section under spinal anesthesia. The patients with a BMI less
      than 30 were accepted as normal weight (Group I) and those with a BMI above 30 were accepted
      as obese (Group II). Dural puncture performed with a 27G Quincke spinal needle at the L3-4 or
      L4-5 intervertebral space and given 12.5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally. The
      patients were questioned regarding headache and low back pain 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after
      the procedure, and by phone calls on days 3 and 7.
