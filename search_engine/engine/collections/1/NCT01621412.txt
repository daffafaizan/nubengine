    
      Pharmacists administer a questionnaire to each consecutive subject taking part in the
      adherence-enhancing program at the pharmacy of the Department of Ambulatory Care And
      Community Medicine in Lausanne. This questionnaire assesses disclosure, response to
      disclosure, and living situation.

      Adherence is measured by electronic monitoring and pill count.
