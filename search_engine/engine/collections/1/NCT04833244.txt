      pain. Rotator cuff syndrome almost invariably gives significant pain, especially with
      abduction and flexion of the arms. A simple maneuver that alleviates that pain 90% of the
      time, by activating the subscapularis to perform the function of the damaged supraspinatus
      muscle. This study strives to correlate facial and truncal characteristics with the ten-point
      pain scale by correlating the filmed changes in facial and truncal characteristics with the
      variations in patient-rated pain before and after the pain-controlling maneuver.

      Once effective, the maneuver may be repeated for a number of days, after which time patients
      generally remain pain-free permanently.
