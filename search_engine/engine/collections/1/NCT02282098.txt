    
      Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia (with a global burden of 33.5
      million affected patients in 2010), is responsible for about 20% of ischemic stroke, a major
      cause of morbidity and mortality. Anticoagulants are very effective in reducing the risk of
      stroke in AF but on average 10-15% of treated patients still experience a stroke over a
      10-year period and in selected elderly populations the risk is even higher. We hypothesize
      that thrombosis mediated by inflammation might be responsible for the residual risk of
      stroke, despite anticoagulant therapy and that targeting inflammation has the potential to
      reduce thrombosis and the risk of stroke in anticoagulated patients with AF.
