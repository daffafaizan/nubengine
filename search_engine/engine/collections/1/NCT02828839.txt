      access needle (single use disposable) in a clinical setting with and a disposable, single
      use, custom-made, polymer needle guide used in conjunction with a rectal ultrasound probe.
      The disposable stainless steel access needle may be used with or without the disposable
      needle guide, but will always be used with ultrasound image guidance and a biopsy gun. The
      primary purpose of the single-use disposable access needle is to guide the use of a biopsy
      gun to obtain a tissue sample from the patient's prostate gland through a percutaneous
      puncture of the perineum. The primary purpose of the disposable needle guide is to stabilize
      the needle biopsy and better approximate the most direct path to the prostate. For some
      subjects, the study will assess the fit and functionality of the stainless steel access
      needle when used in conjunction with the disposable needle guide as well as multiple handling
      aspects of the access needle and disposable needle guide when utilized in a prostate biopsy
      procedure. The study will also assess the ability of trans-rectal ultrasound to appropriately
      image the stainless steel access needle and biopsy gun needle at, near, and within the
      prostate tissue.
