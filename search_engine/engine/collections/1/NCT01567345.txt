      pain treatment, incidence of cancerous chronic pain did not decrease. Indeed, 15 to 20% of
      patients are still suffering from intractable pain despite an optimal symptom management.

      Treatment of cancer pain is generally based on the WHO analgesic ladder according to 3 steps.
      Patients with advanced cancer are often treated at WHO step 3 analgesics, i.e. morphine and
      its derivatives, at high dosages. But increasing the dosage of opioids also leads to
      accentuation of their adverse events and the corresponding risks.

      At this stage of the disease, in patients with failure of conventional analgesic therapy,
      intrathecal injection of analgesics can be decided in order to relieve pain. 2 types of pumps
      allow intrathecal morphine administration : continuous or programmable flow. In this study,
      we want to compare the quality of analgesia obtained through these 2 flows.
