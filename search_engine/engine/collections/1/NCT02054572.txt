    
      Six adult male or female patients with end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis will be
      enrolled to receive 750 nCi of [¹⁴C]-labeled etelcalcetide formulated in 10 mg etelcalcetide
      administered as a single 2 mL intravenous dose at the end of hemodialysis.

      Participants will spend the first approximately 12 days in confinement at the clinic (day -1
      until completion of day 11 study procedures). Blood samples, and complete collections of
      dialysate, dialysis membrane (as necessary), urine (as available), and feces will be analyzed
      for radioactivity content by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Following the confinement
      period, participants will return to the site on an outpatient basis in accordance to their
      routine dialysis sessions up to day 39. Blood and dialysate samples and dialysis membranes
      will be collected at specified times during the outpatient visit period.

      Participants may be asked to return so the site for the Extended Pharmacokinetic Collection
      Period. During the Extended Pharmacokinetic Collection Period, participants will return to
      the site for 3 consecutive hemodialysis sessions (Collection Period 1) and then again
      approximately one month later, for an additional 3 consecutive hemodialysis sessions
      (Collection Period 2).
