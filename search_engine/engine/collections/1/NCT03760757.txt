      untrained male subjects will participate in this study. Subjects will be classified as
      'untrained' if they exercise less than three times per week for less than 30 min during each
      session. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either a green-lipped mussel oil blend
      (PCSO-524® supplementation group, n = 25) or a 75/25% PCSO-24®/Krill oil blend group
      (ESPO-572® supplementation group, n = 25). Supplementation will begin 26 days before an
      eccentric exercise bout (downhill running, designed to induce muscle damage and continue for
      3 days following the muscle damaging exercise bout).
