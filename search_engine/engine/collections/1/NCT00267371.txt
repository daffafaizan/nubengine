    
      Migraine headache is a neurological disorder characterized by chronic and disabling headache.
      Approximately 10-12% of humans, comprising some 28 million Americans, suffer from this
      disorder. Despite continual advances in medical management of migraine, many sufferers
      continue to experience frequent and disabling attacks despite appropriate medical therapy.
      Preventative medications, such as anti-epileptic drugs, anti-depressants, and beta-blockers,
      while effective for many patients, have side-effect profiles that preclude use in many
      patients. In the past decade, there has been growing evidence that patients with migraine,
      particularly those with aura, are more likely to have a patent foramen ovale.

      A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a persistent, flap-like opening in the wall of the heart,
      between the right and left atrium. Typically, this opening closes shortly after birth,
      however, in some people, it remains open.

      While there is currently no proof for cause-effect relationship, several recent studies have
      confirmed a strong association between the presence of PFO and migraine with aura.

      Comparison: This clinical study will compare PFO closure with medical therapy alone for the
      treatment of migraine headaches.
