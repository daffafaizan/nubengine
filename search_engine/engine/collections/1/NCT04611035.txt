      identify drug combinations which may have clinical efficacy against metastatic
      gastrointestinal cancer.

      Specific aim 1: To grow patients' gastrointestinal tumour-derived organoids.

      Specific aim 2: To perform ex-vivo drug sensitivity testing on patient derived tumour
      organoids using QPOP for metastatic gastrointestinal cancers.

      Specific aim 3: Asses the efficacy of phenotype directed therapy using QPOP to assign
      treatment after progression of standard of chemo for gastric cancer.
