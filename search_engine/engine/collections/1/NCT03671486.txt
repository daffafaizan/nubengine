    
      Healthy pregnant women reporting to the clinic in their first trimester of pregnancy (week 11
      ± 2 weeks of pregnancy) will be asked to participate in this study. Participation will be
      voluntary and written informed consent will be obtained from each participant. The study
      visits will take place in the hospital.

      At Visit 1, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified. After signing the informed
      consent, a physical examination will be performed in addition to a vaginal-rectal swab to
      detect if they are GBS-negative. Information on the demographic profile and medical history
      will be collected. The investigator will explain to the participant that she cannot use any
      probiotic during the course of the study.

      At Visit 2, within 21-23 weeks ± 4 days of gestation, the inclusion and exclusion criteria
      will be reviewed. If the result of the microbiological analysis of the vaginal-rectal exudate
      is negative, the pregnant women shall continue in the study. A physical examination will be
      performed. Adverse Events occurring from the time of study inclusion will be recorded.

      At the third visit (Visit 3, 35 weeks ± 4 days of gestation), all participants continuing in
      the study will undergo a general physical examination. A sample of vagino-rectal exudate will
      be collected. Adverse Events occurring during the period between Visit 2 and Visit 3 will be
      recorded.

      During Visit 4 (1 month after delivery), all participants will have a general physical
      examination. Adverse Events occurring since Visit 3 will be recorded. Data will be collected
      on the delivery and occurrence of early- or late-onset GBS sepsis in the newborn during the
      first month of life.
