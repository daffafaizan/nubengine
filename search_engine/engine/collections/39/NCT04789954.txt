    
      Randomized, double-blind, single dose, 5 ways crossover, clinical trial evaluating four
      different doses (10 µg/kg, 30 µg/kg, 90 µg/kg, and 270 µg/kg) of AryoSeven (recombinant human
      FVII activated or eptacog alfa, activated) and one dose of NovoSeven (30 µg/kg) on selected
      pharmacodynamic parameters (PD) [Primary: Thrombin Generation Assay (TGA)] in male adult and
      adolescent (>12 years) patients with hemophilia A or B, with an inhibitors titer >5 Bethesda
      Units [BU] and not in bleeding status. This will be an exploratory study to evaluate
      dose-response relationship of PD markers as surrogate efficacy endpoints.
