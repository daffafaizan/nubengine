      that there could be no bias in the selection of participants for enrollment into the
      fixed-sequence arms. Once three chemotherapy-treated participants demonstrated decreases in
      FDG-PET SUV in the target lesion (i.e., >20% decrease in SUVmax in the defined target lesion)
      in the PET/computed tomography (CT) scan performed following Cycle 1 Period 1 treatment, it
      was concluded that this positive validation arm had accomplished its purpose, and all
      subsequent participants enrolled in the study were assigned treatment with robatumumab for
      Period 1. There was no intention to compare the data in either period across participants who
      received chemotherapy with those who received robatumumab.
