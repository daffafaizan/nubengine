      neurosurgery especially in spine surgery is not widely spread. The tissue selectivity of
      ultrasonic osteotomy may enhance operative time and reduce tissue trauma. Moreover, bony
      fusion rate may be increased because of low thermal injury to the bone. In the present study,
      we are going to compare bony fusion rate after cervical laminotomy either with ultrasonic
      osteotome or conventional drill.
