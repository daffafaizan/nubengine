      resection includes total or subtotal gastrectomy, D2 lymphadenectomy, and prophylactic or
      therapeutic resection of the surrounding organs or tissues (e.g., omentum, peritoneum, etc).
      However, the oncologic importance of omentectomy during gastrectomy remains unclear. The
      European guidelines do not give any advice regarding omentectomy, whereas the most recent
      American guidelines advise to resect both the greater and lesser omentum. Alternatively, the
      Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines recommends preservation of the greater omentum
      at >3 cm from the gastroepiploic arcade for patients with T1-T2 tumors and total omentectomy
      for patients with T3-T4 tumors. In order to evaluate the impact of omentectomy for advanced
      gastric cancer on patient survival, we designed this trial. Patients who received curative
      gastrectomy were divided into two groups based on whether they underwent omentectomy. The
      primary endpoint is the 3-year relapse-free survival rate and the secondary endpoints are
      5-year overall survival, and postoperative morbidity.
