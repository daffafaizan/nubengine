    
      This is a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group, controlled trial to compare
      the safety and efficacy of fondaparinux and enoxaparin in subjects with UA/NSTEMI (unstable
      angina/non ST segment myocardial infarction). Study drug (s.c.) was started immediately
      following randomization; subjects received fondaparinux 2.5mg once daily s.c for 8 days or
      until hospital discharge, if earlier, or enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice daily s.c for 2 to 8 days or
      until clinically stable. In subjects with creatinine clearance between 20mL/min and 30mL/min,
      enoxaparin was administered as 1mg/kg once daily. In addition to study drug, subjects were to
      receive standard medical care, including interventions (PCI [percutaneous coronary
      intervention] or coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG]).
