      Alzheimer's Disease or Related Dementia with Multiple Chronic Conditions (ADRD-MCC) so that
      these patients are on 'just right' medication regimens.

      There are two components to the intervention: Patient/ care partner education and clinician
      education. Patient/care partner educational materials about medication optimization will be
      mailed to eligible members who have upcoming appointments with primary care physicians (PCPs)
      within 2 weeks of scheduled visits. The initial intervention period will run for 12 months
      and the delayed intervention period will run for 12 months. Primary care clinicians at the
      intervention clinics who care for adults (Internal Medicine [IM] and Family Medicine [FM])
      will receive education on medication optimization and options for deprescribing through an
      initial presentation at a monthly team meeting at the beginning of the intervention period,
      as well as periodic Tip Sheet updates on managing deprescribing in specific situations.
      Primary care clinicians will receive notification via staff message when materials have been
      sent to patients with an upcoming appointment.

      The intervention has two aims:

      Aim 1: In a cluster randomized pragmatic trial, test the effectiveness of a primary care
      based, clinic level deprescribing intervention on two primary outcomes: number of chronic
      medications and number of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) among older adults
      with ADRD-MCC.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes of adverse drug events
      (falls, bleeding episodes, hypoglycemic episodes), reductions in dosage for selected PIMs
      (benzodiazepines, opioids, anti-psychotics), hospital, emergency department and skilled
      nursing facility utilization, and activities of daily living.
