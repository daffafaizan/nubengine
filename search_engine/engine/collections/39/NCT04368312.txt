      situations, therefore this group is considered to be at risk for impaired psychological
      health. A pandemic such as the Covid-19 endemic is suggested to severely impair the
      psychological state of this profession, amongst others Quality of life, anxiety, depression
      and other parameters. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the impact of impairment due to this
      global threat on the psychological health of health care providers. We therefore designed
      this study to evaluate baseline psychological characteristics and to re-assess those values
      in an interval of 60 days.
