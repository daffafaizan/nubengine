      PCD in step up approach of Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN).

      The investigators also intend to evaluate the role of PCD in obviating the surgical
      intervention in the management of IPN and evaluate the risks & benefits of extended treatment
      policy of PCD in step up approach of IPN in comparison to early surgery after PCD.
