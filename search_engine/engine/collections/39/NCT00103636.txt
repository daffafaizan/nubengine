      associated with a phlebitis rate of between 1.1% and 63% and a central venous catheter
      related bacteremia rate of approximately 3.0%. Catheter related blood-stream infections have
      an attributable mortality rate of 12% to 25%. Factors thought to be associated with these
      complications include insertion techniques, catheter securement, type of catheter used, type
      of infusate and additives, post-insertion catheter care and length of time the catheter
      remains in place.

      Current Centers of Disease Control Guidelines provide direction for intravenous therapy
      management including a recommendation that peripheral intravenous catheters should be
      re-sited every 72-96 hours. Data underpinning the recommendation was collected in 1992, over
      a decade ago. Since that time, there have been improvements in catheter design and
      composition, and prospective surveillance studies have demonstrated the safety of longer
      dwell times. To date, these observations have not been validated in adults, using randomized
      controlled trial methodology.

      Re-siting intravenous cannulas causes discomfort to patients and has a high recurrent cost.
      The primary aim of the present study is to compare the rates of peripheral catheter-related
      blood stream infection, catheter-related local infection, phlebitis and obstruction between
      two groups of patients - those having routine catheter changes every 72 hours and those
      having catheter changes only when clinically indicated.

      Specific hypotheses:

      That changing intravenous peripheral catheters when indicated by clinical signs compared to
      changing intravenous catheters every 3 days reduces the incidence of intravenous catheter
      related morbidity.
