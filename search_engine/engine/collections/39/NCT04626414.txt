    
      Open-label, Phase 1, four way crossover study to compare the PK of the new ferric maltol
      suspension, in healthy volunteers, with the existing ferric maltol capsules under fed and
      fasted conditions.

      32 subjects will be randomised to 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the treatment sequences.

      Based on the randomised sequence, subjects will receive a single dose of 30mg ferric maltol
      capsule in a fed/ fasted condition and 30 mg (5ml) ferric maltol suspension in a fed/ fasted
      condition.

      Subject participation in the study will consist of 3 periods:

        1. Screening: up to 14 days

        2. Randomised treatment: 8 days

        3. Post-treatment follow up: 3-7 days following drug discontinuation
