      Nonadherence can lead to reduced drug levels and inadequate viral suppression, which
      accelerates drug resistance. Thus nonadherence in the first few months of primary HIV
      infection can limit therapeutic options for an individual years later. Barriers to optimal
      treatment adherence in patients with early HIV infection include complex treatment regimens
      which disrupt daily routines, drug intolerance, and concomitant illness including depression.
      Directly observed therapy has been successful in improving overall effectiveness of
      antituberculosis therapy and may be a useful strategy in HIV-infected patients.

      All patients receive combination antiretroviral therapy with didanosine (ddI), stavudine
      (d4T), efavirenz (EFV), and nelfinavir (NFV). Patients are randomized to self-administered
      (SAT) versus observed (MAT) therapy for 24 weeks. Patients randomized to MAT receive one
      directly observed dose (ddI, d4T, EFV, and NFV) of their antiretroviral regimen by a field
      worker or nurse at the clinic 5 days per week. As a reminder for the second NFV and d4T dose,
      MAT patients are provided with an alarm watch programmed to sound at dosing times. The alarm
      watch also serves as a reminder for weekend doses that will not be directly observed.
      Patients randomized to SAT receive standard care. All patients are monitored with monthly
      plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4 and CD8 cell counts. At Week 24, all patients are crossed over
      to SAT for an additional 48 weeks of follow-up.
