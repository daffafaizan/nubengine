      Spectranetics) within the Superior Vena Cava in lead extraction patients. This will be
      performed in a non-emergent setting to allow for evaluation of how best to integrate this new
      technology into the investigators clinical practice. The study will focus on the effect of
      the Bridge balloon on the patient preparation clinical workflow, ease of
      insertion/positioning/deployment, and the ability to recognize proper inflation and vein
      sealing under fluoroscopy. Understanding these factors will help build a more robust clinical
      workflow with the goal of better patient outcomes in the case of an Superior Vena Cava
      injury. The images and data generated during this study can help in dissemination of the
      practical use knowledge to fellow lead extractors.

      At the time of the protocol registration, the timeframe 12 months was entered, this was
      actually the anticipated length of the study at registration. The timeframe was corrected to
      33 minutes (average time) at the time of results entry.
