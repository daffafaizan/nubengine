    
      This is a single-center, open-label study of ARC-520 in combination with entecavir or
      tenofovir administered to patients with immune active chronic HBV infection. An iterative
      trial design is anticipated with potential inclusion of additional cohorts with anticipated
      enrollment of up to 60 patients. Patients who have signed a Human Research Ethics Committee
      approved informed consent, and have met all of the protocol eligibility criteria will
      continue receiving daily oral entecavir (0.5-1.0 mg/day) or daily oral tenofovir (300 mg/day)
      and a single IV injection of ARC-520. If a serious adverse event (SAE) deemed possibly or
      probably related to study drug should occur at any point during the study, any further dosing
      will be put on hold pending a complete review of safety data by the sponsor and the Principal
      Investigator. Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the
      study: medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart
      rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), weight, AEs, 12-lead ECGs, concomitant medication,
      blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation, chemistry, PK and exploratory PD
      measures, HBV virology. Patients will be monitored for a total of 12 weeks. Clinically
      significant changes including AEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition
      stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the patient is lost to
      follow-up.
