      health impact causing or contributing to 7.1 million deaths yearly at an estimated annual
      incremental direct cost of $54 billion per year. Common treatments include antihypertensive
      medications and lifestyle modifications. While these treatments have been shown to be
      effective, only about 30% of hypertensive patients achieve blood pressure goals. Based on a
      recently published study (Bakris et al, 2007), one unique non-pharmaceutical approach may be
      a non-rotary type of upper cervical spinal manipulation to align the first cervical vertebra
      (atlas) performed by a doctor of chiropractic. We propose to conduct a similar study with a
      more commonly known chiropractic technique called Toggle Recoil. We propose a prospective
      randomized 2 arm parallel observer-blinded phase II clinical study comparing a distinct
      method of upper cervical chiropractic manipulation to a sham technique in 50 (25 in each
      group) individuals with Stage I hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP); 140-159 mm Hg or
      diastolic blood pressure (DBP):90-99 mm Hg). Patients will be seen by doctors of chiropractic
      twice each week for 6 weeks and outcomes will be collected at baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks
      after enrollment. The primary outcome measure will be change in SBP and the primary endpoint
      will be at the week 6 assessment.
