      are common and pose significant burdens to patients. Although regular medications have
      substantial benefits for disease remission, many patients do not follow the recommendations
      of standard medication regimens given by physicians at the time of the visit, so how to
      improve patient compliance becomes even more important. Many factors can affect drug
      compliance. Forgetting seems to be one of the important reasons for poor compliance. In order
      to solve this problem, many studies such as drug charts/calendars, mini kits, etc. have been
      conducted in previous studies. At present, with the popularization of mobile phones,
      SMS-based interventions are gradually being applied to various medical environments. Compared
      with the phone, SMS consumes less time and can be easily integrated into the patient's daily
      life. Therefore, short messages may be more suitable for follow-up of patients outside
      hospital.
