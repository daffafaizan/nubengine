      research project aimed at developing and testing the efficacy of a web & cell phone based
      weight loss program. The purpose of the intervention was to promote weight loss and
      management and improve physical activity, diet and sedentary behaviors among preadolescent
      and adolescent youth (7-18) who are survivors of childhood ALL (defined as being off therapy
      for at least 2 years without disease relapse). Fit4Life was based on and adapted from notable
      prior successful adolescent weight control interventions, and physical activity and diet
      behavioral promotion interventions in the preadolescent and adolescent age group. Particular
      sensitivity to issues experienced by cancer survivors and their families were incorporated
      into this newly developed intervention based on systematic cancer survivor input and feedback
      as well as mentor/collaborator input regarding cancer survivor research.
