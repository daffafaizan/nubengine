      progression of heart failure (HF). The Celacade™ system may reduce chronic inflammation by
      stimulating the immune system's physiological anti-inflammatory response. The ACCLAIM study
      is an international, approximately 2,000-patient, Phase III clinical research study designed
      to test the safety and efficacy of the Celacade™ system in reducing the risk of mortality and
      cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with chronic systolic HF.
