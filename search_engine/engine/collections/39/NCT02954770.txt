      deprivation, clinical responsibilities, and academics leaves little time for residents and
      fellows to consider their own health maintenance, particularly with regards to physical
      activity. This is problematic for both the physician and the physician's patients. Numerous
      studies have shown that physicians who exercise regularly and maintain normal body mass are
      more likely to counsel their patients on these issues. Additionally, they are more
      experienced in the benefits of exercise and can counsel their patients on how to incorporate
      exercise into a busy schedule. This is a one year follow up survey study after a Fitbit速
      challenge study among TriHealth residents. The purpose of the initial Fitbit速 challenge study
      was to to determine if wearing a Fitbit速 motivates residents to increase their physical
      activity. This study seeks to determine the long-term usage of the Fitbit速.
