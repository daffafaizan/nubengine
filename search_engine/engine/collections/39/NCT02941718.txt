      of a sleep advancement counseling (SAC) protocol in response to standard nicotine dependence
      treatment (behavioral counseling + varenicline) in a sample of 90 treatment seeking smokers
      from the greater Newark city/Newcastle county area. Following eligibility assessment, which
      include an overnight polysomnography (sleep study), 90 eligible and consenting
      treatment-seeking smokers will be randomized to either the experimental smoking cessation +
      SAC (N=60), or the control, smoking cessation + general health education (GHE) alone (N=30)
      condition. Participants will complete six in-person counseling sessions over a 15-week
      treatment period (wks 1, 3, 4,7,11,15) As part of the smoking cessation treatment protocol,
      eligible participants will receive 12 weeks of FDA-approved smoking cessation medication,
      Varenicline, during week 3-15. An end of treatment (week 15) and a 12-week follow-up (week
      27) assessment will be conducted in-person to allow for the objective assessment of smoking
      status and cardiovascular markers.
