      parenchymal transection. In this phase severe bleeding may occur due to laceration of the
      inferior vena cava (IVC) wall, rupture or ligation falling off the hepatic short vein (HSV)
      or bleeding from the right liver attachments. Besides, the twisting of the portal pedicle
      during mobilization can render the left hepatic lobe ischemic for transient interruption of
      the hepatopetal flow. These events are more frequent in case of large hepatic lesions (mainly
      HCC) that involves surrounding structures (such as diaphragm). Two of the most important
      factors that affect the postoperative course of patients undergoing liver resections are
      indeed intraoperative bleeding and postoperative liver dysfunction. For these reasons Lai et
      al proposed anterior approach as alternative to classic right hepatectomy. In this case liver
      mobilization is performed only at the end of parenchymal transection, when all vascular
      connections are already interrupted. Liu et al published the results of a retrospective study
      in which 54 patients with, right sided HCC greater than 5 cm underwent right hepatectomy
      using the anterior approach technique. The anterior approach group had significantly less
      intraoperative blood loss, less need of blood transfusion and a lower hospital mortality
      rate. The same group reported results of a prospective randomized controlled study analyzing
      120 patients with large (>5 cm) right liver HCC. The overall operative blood loss, morbidity,
      and duration of hospital stay were comparable in both groups. However, a higher number of
      patients in classic approach group experienced mayor operative blood loss (> 2000 cc) and
      required blood transfusions (8.3% vs. 28.3%).
