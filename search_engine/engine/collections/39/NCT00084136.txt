    
      In developed countries, standard effective antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for treatment-naive
      HIV infected people includes three-drug combinations of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors (NRTIs) with either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). However, direct comparisons of ARV efficacy in persons that
      more closely reflect the worldwide demographics of HIV-1 infection are needed.> > Trial
      participants were recruited in Africa (Malawi, South Africa, Zimbabwe), Asia (India,
      Thailand), South America (Brazil, Peru), Haiti, and the United States.>

      > All participants were randomly assigned to one of three arms, and random allocation was
      stratified by 2 factors: country, and screening plasma HIV-1 RNA level (< 100,000 copies/mL
      versus >= 100,000 copies/mL). Participants assigned to the ZDV/3TC+EFV arm received
      lamivudine/zidovudine twice daily and efavirenz once daily. Participants assigned to the
      ddI+FTC+ATV arm received emtricitabine, atazanavir, and enteric-coated didanosine once daily.
      Participants assigned to the TDF/FTC+EFV arm received emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate, and efavirenz once daily. >

      >

      > Physical exam and blood collection occurred at entry and at most study visits. Participants
      experiencing virologic failure were offered a switch to another regimen. >

      > On May 23, 2008, the ddI+FTC+ATV was closed following a planned interim review by the
      study's independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB recommendation was
      based upon compelling evidence that this arm had significantly more virologic failure (and
      therefore was inferior when) compared to the ZDV/3TC+EFV arm . Participants still receiving
      ddI+FTC+ATV were offered alternative medications, and all participants continued to be
      followed. >

      > On November 3, 2009, the DSMB recommended that the study close to all follow-up on May 31,
      2010, before the designed termination (based on 30% of participants meeting the primary
      outcome) was met. The board observed that the recent accumulation of primary efficacy events
      (i.e. regimen failures) was very slow. Therefore, if the study were to continue another 1-2
      years, the precision gained for treatment comparisons would likely be small.
