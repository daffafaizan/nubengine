      underlying pathophysiology in OAB-wet vs. OAB-dry.

      Methods: Between September 2007 and September 2013, the medical records of women with OAB who
      completed a 3-day bladder diary and underwent urodynamic studies in a tertiary referral
      center will be reviewed. OAB-wet will be diagnosed in patients who complained of at least one
      episode of urgency incontinence in the previous month; otherwise, OAB-dry is diagnosed.
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to predict the presence of OAB-wet.
