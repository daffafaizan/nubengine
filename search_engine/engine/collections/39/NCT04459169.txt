      using a systematic screening of even moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, taking into
      account the presence of Red Flag signals. Red Flag Signals will include history or symptoms
      of carpal tunnel syndrome, hearing loss, chronic gastrointestinal disorders, heart failure,
      cervical or lumbar stenosis, or echographic abnormalities such as apical sparring, increased
      left ventricular filling pressure, atrio-ventricular block.
