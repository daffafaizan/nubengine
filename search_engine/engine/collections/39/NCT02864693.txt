      additional functionality for the lower limb amputee, but research into the effectiveness of
      microprocessor controlled ankle-foot systems has been limited.

      In this research study, differences in perceived mobility, functional capabilities and gait
      parameters between energy storing and returning and microprocessor controlled ankle-foot
      mechanisms will be identified where they exist. Also a comparison of the initial function
      with a new system compared to the function after a four week accommodation period will
      provide insight into the time it takes for the prosthesis user to experience a benefit from a
      microprocessor ankle-foot.
