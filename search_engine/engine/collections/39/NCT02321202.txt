      hyperinflammatory situations in patients followed major surgery. However, the role of ω-3
      fatty acid-based parenteral nutrition for postoperative patients with cirrhosis-related liver
      cancer is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ω-3 fatty
      acid-based parenteral nutrition for cirrhotic patients with liver cancer followed
      hepatectomy.

      A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted for cirrhotic patients with
      liver cancer underwent hepatectomy between March 2010 and September 2013 in the investigators

      applied to the trial group, while only Structolipid to the control group for 5 consecutive
