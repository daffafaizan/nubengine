      triple UltherapyÂ® treatment and standard Thermage treatment will be provided to all subjects
      to the full half face, neck, and submental areas. Changes in face and neck skin laxity and
      wrinkles, from baseline and between study treatments, will be assessed at study follow-up
      visits. Patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained.
