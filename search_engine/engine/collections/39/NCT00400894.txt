      sensitivities of early detection of prostate cancer with a new protein biomarker, annexin A3,
      using urine after digital rectal examination/massage (exprimate urine) in direct comparison
      to the corresponding measurements of the gold standard, total PSA. The material obtained by
      this non-invasive procedure was moreover used to determine appropriate cut-off values and
      optimal fractions (e.g. after centrifugation) and calibrations for quantitative measurements
      of this novel marker.

      Patients (500-750) were (and are) continuously recruited from four clinical centres in
      Germany (Berlin, Tübingen, Ludwigshafen) and Austria (Innsbruck). The major aspect was:

      • Can annexin A3 provide a better specificity than tPSA, in particular in the grey zone of
      PSA (2-10 ng/ml) and can annexin A3 thus contribute to a significant reduction of invasive
      transrectal biopsies?
