    
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether efficacy of the MagicTouch Sirolimus
      Coated PTA Balloon Catheter (SRL-DCB) is superior and whether safety is noninferior to Plain
      Old Balloon Angioplasty (POBA) regarding treatment of occlusions in the infrapopliteal
      arteries (located below the P3 segment of the popliteal artery to the tibiotalar joint) in
      patients pre-senting with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) (Rutherford 4-6).
