      undertake two study visits, within a 14-day period. One of the visits will involve MR
      assessments that will take up to three hours in total. The second visit will involve a
      postprandial study day using stable isotopes. Baseline samples will be taken from
      participants, and after they have been fed a standardised test meal to assess whole-body and
      liver specific postprandial metabolism - this visit will last up to eight hours.

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) and stable isotope labelling are two
      methodologies to investigate in vivo metabolism and function non-invasively. MRI gives
      information about liver structure and tissue composition, and heart function. MRS can also
      evaluate tissue energetics and composition using spectroscopy. Stable isotope-labelling
      studies allow for the measurement of whole-body fatty acid oxidation and de-novo lipogenesis
      in the pre- and post-prandial state. These two methodologies will be used in our study to
      evaluate participants with different severity of NAFLD and could help elucidate how the
      disease progresses.

      STUDY 2: MRI evaluation of L-carnitine In parallel to study 1, the physiological response to
      L-carnitine (50 mg/kg i.v.) will be investigated only in healthy participants with 1H MRS.

      These participants will only take part in one visit, during which they will undergo a
      baseline MRI scan, followed by the injection of L-carnitine. The MRI/MRS will be repeated two
      hours after the injection. AC has previously been measured in skeletal muscle using 1H MRS.
      In this study it will be measured in the septum of the heart and in the liver pre and 2 hours
      post-injection of 50 mg/kg i.v. of L-carnitine.
