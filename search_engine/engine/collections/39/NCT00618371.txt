    
      This is a non-randomized, non-comparative, single center trial of antiretroviral therapy
      intensification using the investigational integrase inhibitor MK-0518 and an investigational
      viral load assay to measure response to additional antiviral therapy. Eighteen patients will
      receive open-label MK-0518 400 mg P.O. every 12 hours for 28 days in addition to their
      prescribed antiretroviral therapy. Patients will take their doses of MK-0518 without regard
      to food. The study will enroll patients on antiretroviral therapy regimens with Cluster of
      Differentiation 4 (CD4) counts greater than 200 cells/ul, HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies RNA/ml
      plasma using a commercial assay(conventional Amplicor) and with detectable plasma virus
      (viral loads â‰¥ 1 copies RNA/ml plasma, Single copy assay, "SCA"). Acceptable antiretroviral
      regimens will include those on Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ("NRTIs") +
      protease inhibitor (PI)I, NRTIs + non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), +
      PI, or NRTIs + NNRTI-containing regimens. Patients cannot have prior evidence of resistance
      to antiretroviral drugs. Patients will be screened for intensification by history, physical
      exam, and laboratory evaluations (see below). Patients who are eligible and who agree to
      participate will intensify their antiretroviral therapy for 28 days with MK-0518 400 mg by
      mouth twice a day. During the 28- day drug addition, patients will have samples drawn for SCA
      assay at entry and on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 (+/- 1 d), with the last day of intensification
      as day 28. Patients will have additional phlebotomy after intensification on days 29, 30, 35,
      42, 49 and 58 (+/- 1 day). The intensification period is followed by a post- intensification
      period to determine whether removal of the drug resulted in viral RNA changes.
