    
      This is a Phase I trial that is designed to evaluate the safety of escalating dose levels of
      conjugated panitumumab-IRDye800 used in subjects with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC) that undergo surgery with curative intent. Safety data from this trial will be
      studied to assist in the selection of dose levels of panitumumab-IRDye800 for future
      research. It is hoped that this study will also help in finding better methods for
      identifying cancer intraoperatively for a more complete surgical resection.
