      or irritation) than people without sickle cell disease. This inflammation can be measured in
      the blood by checking the level of a protein called CRP as well as other changes we see in
      blood due to inflammation (such as changes in platelets and other cells). There is even more
      inflammation during sickle-related complications (like pain or acute chest syndrome). We want
      to test if inflammation in people with sickle cell disease can be reduced by the use of
      antioxidant compounds.

      Antioxidants are nutrients (certain vitamins, minerals and enzymes) that can counteract the
      effects of oxidative stress arising from free radicals in our cells. The formation of free
      radicals is a normal cell process, but uncontrolled oxidative stress can cause problems for
      us. One such harmful problem is inflammation.

      We know from other research studies that antioxidants help with some conditions related to
      inflammation. In this study the antioxidant being tested is a combination of alpha-lipoic
      acid and acetyl-L-carnitine, both of which are natural parts of many of the foods we eat and
      are needed by our cells to make energy from food.
