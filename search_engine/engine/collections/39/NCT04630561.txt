      physical and mental health benefits. Specifically, Great Posture, Great Health will address
      two of the top five priorities of general health concerns: 1) obesity and 2) mental health.
      First, obesity is on the rise although more individuals are meeting or exceeding the current
      federal physical activity guidelines based on the data provided by the US Department of
      Health and Human Services (2020). Obesity is a common problem in adults with all
      socioeconomic status and all races, except Asians. In fact, Asians have low rates of heart
      disease, asthma, cancer, and a longer life expectancy than other races, potentially due to
      health behaviors, environment, and stress coping strategies (Acciai et al., 2015). Therefore,
      we should not overlook the importance of stress coping strategies practiced in Asian
      countries on obesity. It is becoming more evident that chronic stress (such as elevated
      cortisol levels) and steroid-based medications are strongly associated with obesity and
      chronic diseases. It is critical to develop and validate community health strategies to
      address both priorities. Great Posture, Great Health will introduce one of the most common
      mind-body postural exercises practiced in Asian countries to a large and diverse population.
