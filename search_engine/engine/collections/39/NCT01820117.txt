    
      This is an observational study to collect health data from long-term survivors of Hodgkin
      lymphoma (HL). Data will be collected once at participant enrollment. The long-term effects
      of thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) given earlier as part of the treatment for HL will be
      examined in long-term survivors and compared to health data collected from normal volunteers.

      HL survivors who were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) with TRT will
      be recruited to complete a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation, brain MRI/MRA, a clinical
      neurological exam, peripheral pulse contour analysis, non-invasive central blood pressure
      monitoring, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and serum biomarkers related to cardiac
      disease. As part of their standard St. Jude LIFE protocol evaluation, they also complete an
      echocardiogram, pulmonary function tests and questionnaires designed to evaluate broad
      health, psychological, socioeconomic and environmental factors that impact everyday life.

      A comparison sample of healthy individuals, frequency-matched on age, sex and race will also
      be recruited. The comparison group will complete the comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation,
      brain MRI/MRA, clinical neurological exam, pulse contour analysis, non-invasive central blood
      pressure monitoring, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Through the St. Jude LIFE
      protocol, the comparison sample will also complete an echocardiogram, pulmonary function
      tests and questionnaires designed to evaluate broad health, psychological, socioeconomic and
      environmental factors that impact everyday life.
