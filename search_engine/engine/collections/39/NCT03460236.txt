      outcomes of PRP treatment for knee OA, the investigators propose a prospective "pre-post"
      study that will permit us to identify areas where more rigorous clinical outcomes and
      mechanistic research may be warranted. The proposed work includes special elements of: (1)
      quantitative metrics to assess clinical outcomes, (2) correlation of candidate beneficial
      proteins with clinical outcomes, and (3) proteomic evaluation of the injected PRP. This work
      will use an innovative multi-disciplinary, personalized approach to evaluate the effects of
      PRP composition on both function, as assessed by patient-reported outcomes and gait analysis,
      and cartilage matrix structure as assessed by quantitative MRI
