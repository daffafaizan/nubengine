    
      A dietary intervention study designed as a randomized, controlled, parallel intervention of
      6-weeks duration. A total of 75 participants will be included in the study and randomly
      allocated to one of three interventions (refined wheat, whoelgrain wheat or wholegrain rye).
      The randomization will be stratified according to sex and sex-specific median habitual cereal
      dietary fibre intake (16g/d for men and 13g/d for women). The randomization will be done by
      means of a randomization generator of the webpage (http://www.randomization.com). Recruitment
      and randomization will take place continuously during the study period, and therefore
      randomization will be done as mixed block randomization.

      During the intervention study, participants are instructed to substitute all cereal products
      (e.g. bread, breakfast cereals, pasta) of their diet with the provided study products. The
      amount of provided study products will match the average intake of carbohydrate-rich products
      of the Danish population, which corresponds to ~200g of bread and cereal products per day.
      The participants will eat the study products in an ad libitum manner and b instructed to
      avoid other cereals in their diet including cake, biscuits, ready made meals and fast foods
      with the exception of White rice whis is allowed 1-2 times per week.

      Clinincal examinations including anthropometric assessment, fecal, urine and fastign blood
      sampling, dietary assessment and a meal challenge will be done before (week 0) and after
      (week 6) the intervention. At timepoints week 0, 2, 4 and 6 questionnaires will be filled in
      concerning satisfaction with diet and gastrointestinal symptoms.
