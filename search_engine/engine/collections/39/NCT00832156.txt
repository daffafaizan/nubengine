      graft. Disadvantages of this treatment are that healing of large full thickness burn wounds
      is still accompanied by scar formation. Even standard treatment, transplantation with a
      (meshed) split skin autograft, does not result in satisfactory functional and cosmetic
      appearance of the healed wound. Due to limited available donor sites meshes needs to be
      enlarged. Bigger enlargements of meshes give more scarring and mesh pattern are still visible
      in scars, probably because wound closure still needs several weeks. Application of cultured
      autologous keratinocytes may enhance wound closure and improve outcome of healing.

      Primary objective: Does the application of cultured autologous keratinocytes on deep burn
      wounds accelerate wound closure Secondary objectives: Does the application of cultured
      autologous keratinocytes on deep burn wounds improve scar quality with respect to scar
      elasticity, colour/pigmentation and/or smoothness after 3 and 12 months.
