      social and structural-level HIV intervention for YMSM and YTW of color ages16-24 aimed at
      increasing economic stability (i.e., employment) through youth empowerment and asset
      development, and decreasing HIV risk behaviors (i.e., sex work) associated with social and
      economic marginalization.
