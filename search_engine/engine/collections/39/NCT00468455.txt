      quality of life in postoperative patients following abdominal colorectal surgery in the early
      postoperative period (from surgery to 6 months) that is practical for routine application.
      The study will also compare this tool to the current available tools, namely the Short Form
      (SF-36), the short form inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ), the Cleveland Clinic
      Global Quality of Life (CGQOL). Patients will be invited to participate if they are
      undergoing abdominal colorectal surgery at University Hospitals of Cleveland.
