      from AAA are at high risk of perioperative cardiovascular and pulmonary complications. It has
      been previously suggested that a bad perioperative pain control could increase the incidence
      of such complications.

      Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine is widely considered as the gold
      standard treatment of the postoperative pain in open repair of AAA. High dose of morphine are
      often required and could delay the postoperative recovery and discharge. Side effects of
      morphine, such as respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting or pruritus, are responsible for
      patient discomfort and dissatisfaction when high doses are used.

      The efficacy of the ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been
      described for pain management following abdominal surgery, such as gastrectomy or kidney
      transplantation. The efficacy of the association of TAP block and PCA with morphine was
      higher than multimodal intravenous analgesia including PCA with morphine and than the
      combination of PCA with morphine and epidural analgesia. To our knowledge, the efficacy of
      the ultrasound-guided TAP block has never been studied for the postoperative pain control in
      AAA surgery.
