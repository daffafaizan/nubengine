      Investigators will randomize 204 consented participants to either an intensive
      counselor-initiated weight loss intervention or a self-paced weight loss intervention.
      Neither of the aforementioned conditions are controls and both treatments are expected to
      result in weight reduction.

      Procedures: This is a two-arm individually randomized trial. The Counselor-initiated group
      will follow a more intense counselor-initiated approach, where the counselor schedules weekly
      telephone sessions and contacts them directly. The Self-paced group uses a less intense
      approach, where the participants can receive the same telephone counseling sessions as the
      counselor-initiated group, only if they call the counselor.

      Potential participants will be recruited through the use of advertisements, electronic
      bulletins, emails, newspapers, and word-of-mouth. Prior to randomization, interested
      individuals will complete a phone screening, informed consent, two in-person data collection
      visits and obtain medical clearance, as well as participate in 1 week of dietary and physical
      activity self-monitoring.

      The randomized participants will spend the next year involved in study interventions (either
      the Counselor-Initiated intervention or the Self-Paced intervention), diet and exercise
      self-monitoring, daily weighing, and may also include telephone counseling sessions.

      The follow-up data collection visits will occur at 4 and 12 months after randomization. At
      these visits, physical measurements will be collected (i.e. height, weight, abdominal
      circumference, blood pressure and heart rate) and participants will complete various
      questionnaires. A Quality of Life questionnaire will also be administered by study personnel.
