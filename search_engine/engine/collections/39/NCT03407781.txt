      of tumor behaviors and of challenge to distinguish the margins in white-light microscope
      during the surgery. An integrated dual-modality approach combining preoperative positron
      emission tomography imaging with intraoperative optical guidance that target the same tumor
      biomarker would be of grade help to solve this problem. BBN, with the amino acid sequence of
      Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu-Met-NH2, has been extensively used for the development of
      molecular probes for the imaging of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), a member of
      the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors that over-expressed in various
      types of cancer cells including glioma. For interests in clinical translation of GRPR
      targeting dual modality probe, an open label dual modality imaging PET/ NIFR study was
      designed to investigate the imaging guiding performance in lower grade glioma patients.
