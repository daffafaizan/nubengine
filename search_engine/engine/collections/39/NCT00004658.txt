      improve continue therapy. If improvement then reaches a plateau, uridine (UR) and thymidine
      (TDR) are added to the regimen.

      Patients who receive no benefit after 8 weeks of ribose are treated with UR/TDR. Patients who
      improve after 8 weeks of this combination continue therapy.

      Ribose is added to the treatment regimen for patients on UR/TDR at entry. At maximal
      improvement, TDR and UR are sequentially tapered.
