      health problems in children affected by HIV/AIDS that can be initiated as caregivers come
      into contact with health systems via routine HIV testing and care. Specifically, we propose
      to develop and pilot test a prevention-oriented family-strengthening intervention to mitigate
      the mental health risks facing HIV/AIDS-affected children (i.e., those who are HIV+
      themselves or who have an HIV+ family member, including those who have died). The
      intervention design, which is based upon the Family-Based Preventive Intervention (FBPI), is
      centrally focused on galvanizing mechanisms of resilience in children and families and
      building on local sources of strength. Our unique adaptation and pilot study will employ a
      family focus to attend to the reality that HIV/AIDS is a family disease, and to show that
      individual, familial, and community resources may help families to succeed despite chronic
      illness. The pilot intervention will use a randomized design, drawing study participants
      (N=80 families) from social work referrals. Protective factors characterizing the family and
      mental health problems in children and caregivers will be assessed pre- and
      post-intervention. In addition, we will survey both participants and interventionists to
      provide qualitative and quantitative data on the program's cultural acceptability and
      feasibility, and on their own satisfaction.
