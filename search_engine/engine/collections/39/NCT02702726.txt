      randomisation software (www.randomizer.org). Participants will be screened (1 screening
      visit) and attend five test visits conducted in a whole room calorimeter (WRC). During each
      test visit, participants will arrive at the laboratory after an overnight fast, enter the WRC
      and rest for 15 minutes in a supine position,have their resting energy expenditure (REE)
      measured for 30 minutes and consume congee and juice alone(control), or with one of the 4
      dietary fats: sunflower oil (SO) or gel (SG) and coconut oil (CO) or gel (CG) (total 5 test
      visits). Post-meal energy expenditure, fat oxidation, glycemia and appetite (visual analog
      scales) will be measured continuously for 3 hours in WRC, followed by a meal challenge where
      participants will eat until sated. Participants will return and repeat the protocol until all
      fat types and forms are completed.
