    
      To investigate efficacy and safety of a supplementation with a fixed combination of
      magnesium, vitamin B2, feverfew, andrographis paniculata and coenzyme Q10 (Vivinor®) in
      episodic migraine prevention.

      An observational, prospective real-world study. After a one-month baseline period, Vivinor®
      was introduced in 113 Greek patients with episodic migraine that were prospectively
      followed-up for three months. The primary endpoint was the change in monthly migraine days
      between baseline period (BL)and the third month of treatment (T3). Secondary endpoints
      included changes in mean intensity of migraine and in days with use of acute migraine
      medications. Changes in scores of Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire (MIDAS),
      Headache Impact Test-6 (HIT-6), Migraine Therapy Assessment questionnaire (MTAQ), MSQ-QOL
      (Migraine-Specific Quality of life questionnaire), HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale) were also evaluated. Those with ≥50% reduction in monthly migraine days during T3
      compared to BL were considered Vivinor®-responders.
