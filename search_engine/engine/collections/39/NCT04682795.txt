      needle-free injector compared to conventional insulin pen given for 2 weeks as the insulin
      carrier in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary endpoint in this study is the
      change from baseline in TIR (after 2 weeks of treatment) in all patients with baseline and at
      least one post baseline measurement. Patients with type 2 diabetes who meet the entry
      criteria are planned for inclusion in this trial. Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled
      in the study. Patients who qualify will be randomized to needle-free injector group or
      conventional insulin pen group. Duration of treatment includes 1-week screening period,
      2-week treatment observation period and 2-week follow-up.
