    
      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To determine the safety, tolerability, and Phase II recommended dose of the
           combination of extended schedule TMZ and DAC.

        -  Phase II: To determine the efficacy, as measured by overall response rate, of the
           combination of extended schedule TMZ and DAC given at the Phase II recommended dose to
           patients with metastatic melanoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine pharmacokinetics of the combination of TMZ and DAC in patients with
           metastatic melanoma.

        -  To determine, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumor tissue, the
           pharmacodynamic effects of the combination of TMZ and DAC on promoter methylation and
           expression of selected genes and correlate these with response.

        -  To determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with the combination of
           TMZ and DAC.
