        1. To use glue (instead of sutures) for mesh fixation during open hernioplasty causes a
           lower immediate postoperative pain.

        2. The use of Histoacryl is associated to a lower postoperative complications rate.

        3. The use of Histoacryl is not associated to a higher hernia recurrence rate.

      Methods:

      350 patients with inguinal hernia undergone Lichtenstein operation in day-case surgery
      setting. Mesh fixation is performed using 2 methods: cyanoacrylate glue: Histoacrylâ„¢ (n=175:
      Group H), and non-absorbable sutures: polypropylene 2/0 (n=175: Group S). Operative time and
      pain scores, immediate postoperative outcome are followed 1, 7, 30 days and 1 and 5 years
      postoperatively.

      Surgeon doesn't know previously which fixation method will be used in each patient. This
      method (glue or sutures) is decided intraoperatively, when mesh is placed, using a blind
      randomization code (www.randomizer.org) Patients are discharged (day-case surgery) if
      adequate pain control, oral tolerance and spontaneous diuresis is achieved, and after
      examination by the surgeon in order to discard immediate complications. Postoperative oral
      treatment is prescribed to patients of both groups: dexketoprofen 25 mg/8 h + paracetamol 1
      gr/8.

      Follow-up is performed at the medical office by a blind observer (third surgeon) who didn't
      participate in the surgical procedure, at 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 1 year and annually
      thereafter. Pain is measured using a VAS scale (0-10).

      Operative data (including operating time, complications, hospital stay, etc.), early and late
      complications, acute and chronic pain and recurrence rate will be recorded.
