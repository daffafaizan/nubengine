      total of eight major metropolitan cities will implement the crowdsourced intervention. These
      cities will be chosen based on the following criteria: 1) previous Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) MSM sentinel surveillance site; 2) capacity for campaign
      implementation; 3) capacity for intervention implementation at the community level. Four
      cities will implement more intensive in-person events to promote engagement (Guangzhou,
      Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, Qingdao, and Jinan in Shandong Province) during survey
      intervention stage. The Randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be evaluated using two
      different sources of data: 1) online survey data from MSM in the eight cities prior to and
      after the intervention; 2) CDC routine surveillance data in the eight cities prior to and
      after the intervention.
