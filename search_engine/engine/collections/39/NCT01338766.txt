    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, multi-center (up to 30 sites) controlled clinical
      study enrolling 100 subjects following a pre-specified protocol with no site enrolling more
      than 30 subjects. All eligible subjects providing written informed consent and meeting study
      eligibility criteria will receive a facet preserving decompression using the FDA cleared
      iO-Flex® system on label. Treatment success using the iO-Flex® System will be analyzed using
      a precision estimate assuming a 55% positive response rate.

      In addition to baseline characteristics and procedural parameters, subject outcomes will be
      assessed at 6 weeks, 6-, 12-, and 24 months. The study will have an extended follow-up phase
      with annual follow-up contact through 5 years to evaluate retreatment for the original
      indication at these late time points.
