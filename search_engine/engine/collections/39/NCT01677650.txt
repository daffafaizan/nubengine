      medication) that decreases the amount of pain that people have after spine surgery. Five
      different doses of methadone will be compared to each other, while keeping the remainder of
      the anesthetic routine for surgery. The investigators will determine the analgesic
      dose-response of methadone. The investigators will also determine the effect of methadone on
      the incidence of opioid related side effects, the quality of outcome of recovery, and the
      change in the 3-month opioid use.
