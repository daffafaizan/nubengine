      informed consent will undergo a psychological assessment so as to determine eligibility for
      study entry. Patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomized in a
      double-blind manner in a 1:1 ratio to new integrative psychotherapy or treatment as usual
      (cognitive behavioral therapy plus standard psychopharmacological treatment). One month after
      the conclusion of the two forms of treatment (both lasting 6 months), patients will have
      access to the final follow-up assessment.
