      15% of infertile men, which translates to 645,000 males between the ages of 20 and 50 (prime
      reproductive years) in the United States. Spermatogenesis arises from a population of
      spermatogonial stem cells in the testes that maintain continuous sperm production throughout
      a man's post-pubertal life. Diseases or medical treatments that compromise the stem cell pool
      and/or prevent the stem cells from differentiating can cause infertility. Adult men have the
      option to cryopreserve a semen sample prior to therapy but this is not an option for
      prepubertal patients who are not yet producing sperm. This study will test the safety and
      feasibility of two approaches to restore sperm production using previously cryopreserved
      testicular tissues, which contain spermatogonial stem cells.

      The first approach is autologous transplantation of testicular cells, including
      spermatogonial stem cells, into the testis using ultrasound-guided rete testis injection. The
      second approach is autologous grafting of intact pieces of testicular tissue under the skin
      in the scrotum.
