      randomized into intervention and control group. Participants in intervention group received
      one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with 5% dextrose and control group
      received one-session ultrasound-guided perineural injection with normal saline. No additional
      treatment after injection through the study period. The primary outcome is visual analog
      scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Quick-DASH (Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and
      Hand), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the ulnar nerve, motor nerve conduction velocity and
      distal latency of the ulnar nerve. The evaluation was performed pretreatment as well as on
      the 2nd week, 1st and 3rd month after the treatment.
