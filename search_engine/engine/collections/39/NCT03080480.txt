      encoding the subunits of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide（NADPH）phosphate oxidase
      complex. In normal phagocytes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)
      activation links NADPH oxidase activity with enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) production. There is deficient mitochondrial ROS production in CGD，due to the lack of
      this upstream signaling by the NADPH oxidase and PPARγ. These patients are susceptible to
      bacterial and fungal infections, as well as extensive tissue granuloma formation.
      X-chromosome-linked CGD (X-CGD) is most frequently. And it generally produces a severe
      phenotype, with a mortality rate of 3% to 5% per year despite state-of-the-art prophylaxis
      and intensive multimodal treatment.

      At present the most curative treatment for patients with X-CGD is hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantion (HSCT). But for many patients without an HLA-matched donor and active
      infections/inflammatory complications still require novel approches.

      PPARγ agonist such as pioglitazone, approved for type 2 diabetes, was reported to bypass the
      need for the NADPH oxidase for enhanced mtROS production and partially restored host defense
      in CGD. What's more, some animal models and several clinical cases have proved its efficacy.
      The investigators propose to study the efficacy and safety of the therapy with pioglitazone
      for children with severe infection of CGD, and its long-term effects.

      Through this study the investigators hope to confirm the benefits of pioglitazone in the
      treatment of this rare disease especially for those patients without a prompt suitable
      matched donor or for whom the critical disease conditions force to postpone HSCT.
