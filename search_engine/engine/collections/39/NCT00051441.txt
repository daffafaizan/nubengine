    
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled study including an
      open-label standard of care arm, to determine the effectiveness and safety of benezydamine
      hydrochloride 0.15% oral rinse as compared with vehicle oral rinse, and vehicle oral rinse as
      compared to the care normally used in the treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis. The
      hypotheses are that benzydamine hydrochloride 0.15% oral rinse is better than vehicle oral
      rinse as measured by the proportion of patients reaching a WHO mucositis score of 3 by 5500
      cGy and vehicle is no worse than the standard of care as measured by the proportion of
      patients reaching a WHO mucositis score of 3 by 5500 cGy. Patients receiving benzydamine
      hydrochloride 0.15% or vehicle double-blind oral rinses will place 15 mL in the mouth for 2
      minutes, gargling for a few seconds at the beginning and end of the rinse, and then
      expectorate the entire dose. Dosing with oral rinses will be every 2 - 3 hours while awake
      for a minimum of 4 times daily to a maximum of 8 times per day. Double-blind oral rinses will
      continue daily throughout the duration of the subjects radiation treatment regimen plus 2
      additional weeks
