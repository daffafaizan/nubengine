      (MTD) and assess the efficacy of everolimus, irinotecan and panitumumab when given in
      combination for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and KRAS wild-type (WT). Patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that have failed fluorouracil based first line
      therapy will be included. It is anticipated that approximately 50 patients will be enrolled
      over a period of 24 months
