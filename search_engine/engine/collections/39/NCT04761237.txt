      carbon dioxide [P (v-a) CO2] in liquid resuscitation during early escharectomy in patients
      with large-scale burns, We investigate the effect of P (v-a) CO2 on postoperative tissue
      perfusion and oxygenation in order to seek a more effective intergrated target plan of liquid
      resuscitation for burn patients.

      Methods: a prospective observational study was conducted on 145 patients with extensive burns
      admitted to surgical intensive care unit（SICU）of Guangzhou Red Cross hospital from January
      2016 to December 2019. All patients received hemodynamic monitoring and goal-directed fluid
      therapy, patients with central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2)< 70% were excluded. Patients
      were divided into the following groups according to the changing trend of Pcv-aCO2 between T
      base (before induction) and T 0h (after surgery) : group 1 (H-H) : Pcv-aCO2≥6mmHg between T
      base and T 0h. Group 2 (L-H) : Pcv-aco2< 6mmHg at T base and≥6mmHg at T 0h; Group 3 (H-L) :
      Pcv-aCO2≥6mmHg at T base and < 6mmHg at T 0h. Group 4( L-L) : Pcv-aCO2 < 6mmHg between T base
      and T0h.Postoperative basic physiological indicators such as heart rate（HR）, blood pressure,
      central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output index (CI), Pcv-aCO2 and lactic acid were
      recorded at 0 and 18 hours after surgery. Oxygen dynamic indicators such as oxygen delivery
      index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index (VO2I), oxygen uptake rate (O2ER) and so on were
      calculated. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between
      Pcv-aCO2 and CI. The change of tissue perfusion and oxygenation with different levels of
      Pcv-aCO2 after fluid resuscitation were analyzed.
