      peri-procedural safety and potential effectiveness (mechanistic effect) of implanting the
      IASD System II in heart failure patients with an LV ejection fraction >40%, elevated left
      sided filling pressures, and who remain symptomatic despite optimal Guideline Directed
      Medical Therapy (GDMT). Clinical outcomes will also be evaluated.
