      tolerability of NNI-362. This FIH Phase I includes single and multiple ascending dose studies
      in healthy aged volunteers. Assessment of suicidal ideation/behavior will be performed at
      baseline and at all study visits and on days of inpatient confinement in conformance with FDA
      recommendations.
