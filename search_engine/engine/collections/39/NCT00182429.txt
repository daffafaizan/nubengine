      and mortality. Metronidazole alone is usually considered the drug of choice, however,
      frequent relapses occur at a rate of 10-40%. The purpose of this study is to address the use
      of a combined drug regimen treatment (Metronidazole and Rifampin) for the treatment of CDAD.
      These drugs used together have been successful. Objectives are to determine the time (days)
      to resolution of symptoms in each treatment arm; to measure clinical relapse rates; and to
      assess adverse reactions related to treatment.
