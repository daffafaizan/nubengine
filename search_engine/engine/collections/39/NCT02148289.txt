      capacity in athletes, healthy adults and subjects with peripheral vascular disease. Many COPD
      patients have reduced exercise capacity, The investigators hypothesized that acute nitrate
      consumption might increase incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) distance in COPD subjects
      compared to a matched, low-nitrate drink.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, crossover trial.

      Resting blood pressure, phlebotomy and ISWT are performed. Following completion, each subject
      is randomized to consume beetroot juice or placebo. 3 hours later, the same assessments are
      repeated by the same people. After a 7d washout, the entire protocol is repeated with the
      crossover beverage.
