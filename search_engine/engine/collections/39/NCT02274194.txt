      20 patients with severe OSA), male and female, aged > 21 years were recruited in the Sleep
      Laboratory of Hospital das Cl√≠nicas da Faculdade de Medicina (FMUSP). The volunteers were
      evaluated at the Sleep Laboratory (Incor) in two phases. First Phase: volunteers were
      assessed for breathing route awake and asleep (including respiratory events in OSA patients)
      and were indicated as nasal breathing and oronasal breathing. Second phase for OSA patients:
      two manual full-night CPAP titration with nasal and oronasal masks in a randomized order, 14
      days apart. Data and fluids were analyzed before and after both titration studies comparing
      both masks including supine and lateral position during asleep and CPAP titration. Third
      phase for OSA patiens: patients were treated with the best interface found in CPAP titration
      study during 30 days and patients were assessed for sleep quality, excessive sonolence during
      the day, airway symptoms, airway defense mechanisms biomarkers (mucociliary clearance, mucus
      properties, citology, inflammation cytokines and adhesion molecules and others) and serum
      cytokines and miRNA.
