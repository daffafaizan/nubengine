      Compared to depressed AHF patients who receive MEDS, patients receiving BA will have
      significantly greater improvements in the primary outcome of depressive symptom severity as
      measured with the PHQ-9 at 6-month follow-up. Significantly greater improvements will also be
      detected in the secondary outcomes of general physical and mental HRQoL (SF-12v2), heart
      failure-specific HRQoL (KCCQ), and caregiver burden (CBQ-HF) at 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Aim 2: To compare the impact of BA vs. MEDS on disadvantageous outcomes of Morbidity (as
      evidenced by ED visits, hospital readmissions, total days in the hospital), and Mortality
      among depressed AHF patients.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to depressed AHF patients who receive MEDS, those receiving BA will
      have significantly less Morbidity (as evidenced by less frequent ED visits, lower readmission
      rates, fewer total days in the hospital), and reduced Mortality at the data collection points
      of 3, 6, and 12 months.
