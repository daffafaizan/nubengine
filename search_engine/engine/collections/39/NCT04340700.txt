      conducted according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, random order, cross-over design,
      consisting of one 3-hour screening visit and 2 randomized, approximately 6-hour laboratory
      sessions. At the latter visits (following confirmation of eligibility), subjects will
      complete baseline questionnaires and assessments, including a driver simulator test, a blood
      draw, vitals, and an imaging session using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
      Subjects will then vape a first dose (either THC or placebo based on randomization). Vitals
      and questionnaires will then be administered throughout the visit, at baseline, and at
      approximately 15, 60, 90, 130, 165, and 210 minutes post initial dose. Subjects will also
      perform fNIRS testing at baseline, 30, and 180 minutes and driver simulator at baseline, 60,
      and 90 minutes post initial THC/placebo administration. A drug recognition expert (DRE) will
      conduct a standard field sobriety test to identify impairment at approximately 130 minutes
      post dose. Following the initial dose vaped at 0 minutes, standardized reduced doses will be
      vaped approximately 30, 60, and 90 minutes later. Given the cross-over design of this study,
      participants will be assigned to receive THC or placebo at the first laboratory visit and
      will receive the other substance at the second laboratory visit.
