      Counter is a wrist-worn device which detects the motions characteristic of taking a bite of
      food or a drink of liquid, to provide the wearer with a cumulative count of bites and sips
      over the day. In earlier studies the method was shown to accurately count bites across a wide
      variety of foods, utensils and subject demographics, and to provide an unbiased intake
      measurement. The proposed work will continue to improve the bite counting method by adapting
      to varying eating rates, develop a self-managed bite count-based weight loss protocol, and
      perform an independent test of the protocol. An improved Bite Counter device will also
      measure activity (steps).
