      aspirin) during noncardiac surgery if possible. Although previous study showed efficacy of
      continuous antiplatelet therapy in reducing perioperative ischemic cardiovascular events, its
      effectiveness is still not clear between perioperative bleeding and ischemic risk. Most
      previous trials support the absolute increase in bleeding risk with perioperative
      administration of antiplatelet. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that perioperative
      major bleeding may be related to increase cardiovascular risk. The investigators will compare
      the efficacy and safety of continuing versus stopping antiplatelet therapy during
      perioperative period in patients underwent PCI(Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) with next
      generation DES(Drug Eluting Stent).
