    
      The FAME 3 trial is a multicenter, international, randomized, controlled noninferiority
      trial. All patients with multivessel CAD (not involving the left main) will be screened by
      the site's Heart Team (including but not limited to an interventional cardiologist, cardiac
      surgeon and research coordinator). If all agree that the patient can be treated either with
      FFR-guided PCI or CABG, and all inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria are met,
      then the patient will be randomized.

      Baseline clinical, functional, laboratory and electrocardiographic data will be obtained.
      Patients will receive treatment within 4 weeks of randomization. Patients randomized to CABG
      will receive state of the art therapy at the discretion of the local surgeon with a strong
      emphasis on arterial revascularization. Patients undergoing PCI will have FFR measured with a
      St. Jude Medical coronary pressure wire across all lesions. If the FFR is â‰¤0.80, then PCI
      will be performed with the Medtronic Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent (DES) as per usual
      routine. If the FFR is >0.80 then PCI will be deferred.

      All patients will receive medical therapy as per published guidelines. Patients will
      follow-up at 1 and 6 months, and 1 and 3 years with an evaluation of clinical status,
      functional status, medications and events. Follow-up may be extended to 5 years, if funding
      allows.

      Core lab analyses will include formal quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) of the baseline
      angiograms with calculation of the Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with
      Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score and Functional SYNTAX Score.
