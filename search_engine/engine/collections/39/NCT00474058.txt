    
      The objective of this trial is to assess the effects of rotigotine on the control of early
      morning motor function and sleep disorders compared to placebo in subjects with idiopathic
      Parkinsons´s disease. In addition, effects of rotigotine on specific nocturnal and non-motor
      symptoms of Parkinson´s disease will be evaluated.

      After a Screening Period of up to 28 days subjects will be hospitalized for two nights. After
      the second overnight stay, subjects will be randomly assigned either to rotigotine patch or
      placebo patch. Afterwards patients will be titrated to their optimal dose. After subjects
      have reached their optimal dose (or the highest dose) they will be maintained on this dose
      for a certain period. At the end of maintenance the subjects will be hospitalized for two
      nights. Afterwards the doses will be continuously decreased.

      Efficacy will be assessed by application of sleep quality scores, motor examination scores,
      and scores to evaluate non-motor symptoms of Parkinsons. Safety assessments include adverse
      events, 12-lead electrocardiograms, blood pressure and heart rate assessments, and laboratory
      checks.
