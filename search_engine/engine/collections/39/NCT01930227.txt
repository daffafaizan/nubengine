      no-stimulation after spinal anesthesia respectively. 1.4 ml of bupivacaine mixed with 0.2ml
      of 50% glucose was given for spinal anesthesia under lateral position. Then the patient was
      switched to supine position and the OR table was tilted to the left for 15 degree. The
      sensory loss level was assessed. The blood pressure and heart rate every 2min were recorded
      for 30min after spinal anesthesia. The adverse events and use of ephedrine adverse events
