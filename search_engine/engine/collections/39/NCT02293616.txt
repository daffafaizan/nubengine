      experimental study designed to evaluate the effect of chronic NO3- supplementation via
      beetroot juice ingestion on the skeletal muscle strength and physical function in ICU
      patients. Patients will be randomized to receive either nitrate rich or nitrate depleted
      beetroot juice once daily during their ICU and hospital stay. Physical function and skeletal
      muscle strength will be measured at ICU (± 2 days) and hospital (± 2 days) discharge and 2
      months (± 2 weeks) after enrollment. Plasma levels of nitrate and nitrite will be measured 1,
      3 and 5 days after randomization into the trial and at ICU and hospital discharge. Skeletal
      muscle ultrasound will be performed to examine the size and echogenicity of patient muscles.
      Self-reported physical function will be measured using the Functional Performance Inventory
      Short Form (FPI-SF). The FPI-SF provides an overall score of patient self-reported functional
      performance in the areas of household maintenance, movement, family and social activities,
      work, avocation and recreation
