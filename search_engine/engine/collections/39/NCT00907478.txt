      Guidelines were sequentially enrolled into the following groups:

        -  Bone marrow biopsy at Baseline and Year 1

        -  Bone marrow biopsy at Baseline and Year 2

        -  Bone marrow biopsy at Baseline and Year 3.

      All participants received romiplostim for 3 years, unless withdrawn from the study early.
      Participants returned for one visit for End of Study (EOS) procedures 4 weeks after
      romiplostim discontinuation, or, for participants who were withdrawn from the study due to
      the presence of collagen fibrosis, or had a change to grade 3 reticulin, at 12 weeks after
      discontinuation of romiplostim.
