      suffering from an hematologic malignancy that has relapsed following hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation from a matched donor. The anti-MiHA T cell lines are derived from the matched
      donor for the patient, the original donor for a given patient. Both the patient and the
      matched donor will undergo screening to determine the expression of targetable MiHAs. Upon
      identification of the target MiHAs, donor cells will be collected through apheresis and
      primed against the selected MiHA. In this setting, the GLIDE 201/44 product will be
      cryopreserved, thawed and administered as a single infusion at a target dose of 4x10E+07
      viable T cells/m2 (range of dose is 0.4 4x10E+07 viable T cells/m2). A second infusion can be
      offered to the patients after an observation period of 42 days upon clinical evaluation by
      the treating physician. In the absence of secondary adverse events following the initial
      infusion, a second infusion of the GLIDE 201/44 product could be administered at a dose level
      up to 3-5 fold the original dose.
