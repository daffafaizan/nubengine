      This is a series of two prospective studies based on the Department of Veterans Affairs drug
      treatment guideline for the pharmacologic management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Our
      hypothesis is that novel strategies for medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) can decrease resource utilization without adversely affecting patient quality of life.
      The strategies tested in this project included 1) step-down management, whereby patients
      rendered asymptomatic on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are treated with less expensive
      medication, and 2) intermittent therapy, defined as administration of medication only for
      recurrence of GERD symptoms. We chose to examine an intermittent strategy of PPI
      administration since in addition to the VA guideline requiring step-down therapy,
      over-the-counter PPIs administered by intermittent therapy became available for use by
      patients during the study period.

      Objectives:

      The objectives of this project are to determine the efficacy of step-down therapy and
      intermittent therapy in patients with GERD, and the impact of these strategies on direct
      healthcare costs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Additionally, we will examine
      patient factors predictive of non-response to these management strategies that may be
      alternatives to traditional continuous PPI administration.

      Methods:

      Two separate studies were conducted in our population of patients with GERD symptoms
      (heartburn or acid regurgitation) rendered asymptomatic on PPIs. Both studies randomized
      subjects to an intervention strategy (Step-down or Intermittent therapy) or to a control
      group in which PPIs were continued on a daily basis.

      Step-down therapy: Step-down subjects discontinued PPIs and were prescribed
      histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) for 2 weeks, and if still asymptomatic, H2RAs were
      discontinued. If symptoms recurred, H2RAs were reinitiated, and if still symptomatic,
      subjects were prescribed PPIs at the dose that initially alleviated their symptoms.
      Intermittent therapy: Intermittent therapy subjects discontinued daily use of PPIs and were
      prescribed short courses of PPI (daily for 8 weeks) for recurrence of GERD symptoms. The
      primary efficacy measure was the proportion of subjects remaining free of GERD symptoms while
      on their prescribed therapy (step-down group: no symptoms on H2RAs or no GERD medication;
      intermittent therapy group: no PPIs for ï¿½2 weeks after discontinuation, and < 3 symptom
      recurrences requiring PPIs; control groups: no GERD symptoms on PPI). Follow up was conducted
      for 6 months after randomization. In addition to the primary efficacy measure, we examined
      total resource utilization (pharmacy and non-pharmacy), HRQOL, and potential predictors of
      non-response to step-down or intermittent therapy (requirement of daily PPI to control
      symptoms). Logistic regression and random-effects models adjusted for covariates and
      clustering effects.

      Status:

      Enrollment and follow-up have been completed. Efficacy measures are reported above. Outcome
      measures including comparison of direct health care costs, health-related quality of life,
      and determinants of non-response to step-down or intermittent therapy are being examined.
