      Over the past two years, the field of ophthalmology has witnessed a dramatic paradigm shift
      in the treatment of exudative and hemorrhagic diseases affecting the retina. This has been
      due largely to the introduction of two agents, bevacizumab and ranibizumab, into the clinical
      setting. These agents are humanized monoclonal antibodies which target vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF). We have observed that, in some patients, a diminished response to these
      agents occurs with time. One possible explanation for this is the emergence of neutralizing
      antibodies in patients who have become refractory to bevacizumab or ranibizumab.

      Study Population

      We will recruit patients from the National Eye Institute (NEI) who are currently receiving
      treatment with bevacizumab or ranibizumab for various exudative or hemorrhagic disease of the
      retina. We will also recruit patients with recently diagnosed exudative or hemorrhagic
      disease of the retina who are na ve to these medications and are going to be treated with
      them.

      Design

      This will be a prospective, observational study.

      Outcome Measures

      The main outcome measure will be the titer of neutralizing antibodies which is measured in
      patient sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This will be compared between
      three groups of patients: 1) 10 patients treated with long term (greater than 1 year)
      bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab in which decreased drug efficacy has been documented; 2) 10
      patients treated with long term (greater than one year) bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab in
      which decreased drug efficacy has not been documented; and 3) 10 patients who are na ve to
      treatment with bevacizumab and ranibizumab.
