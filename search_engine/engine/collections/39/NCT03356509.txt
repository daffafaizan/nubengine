      exercise (HIIE) bout, following two stress-inducing tasks, reduces addictive behavior to
      chocolate. Volunteers must complete the consent form before being able to participate in two
      days of testing (exercise day and control day) which will be presented in randomized order.
      The two days will be separated by a one to 7 day washout period. Subjects will be required to
      submit a three day chocolate diary then abstain from chocolate on the 4th day. They will also
      be asked to record everything they eat and drink on the day before and the morning of the
      study and list three types of chocolate they crave most. Two stress-inducing tasks will be
      performed on both days followed by completion of either 26 minutes of HIIE or seated resting
      condition followed by the completion of two mood and craving questionnaires. They will
      finally be asked to complete a task that measures the amount of attention they pay to
      chocolate. Statistical analyses will be conducted to determine the effect of either
      exercising or not on addictive behaviors to chocolate.
