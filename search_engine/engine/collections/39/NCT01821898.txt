    
      This study is a open label, randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the efficacy of
      a topical steroid preparation to an antigen (food) elimination diet.

      A total of 40 participants will be recruited for this study that are positive for food
      allergens. Study participants will be randomly assigned to treatments as described below, and
      the duration of each treatment phase will be 16 weeks.

      The subjects will be randomized to group A and B. Subject and study team will NOT be blinded
      to the group assignments.

      Group A will receive oral viscous budesonide at a dose of 1 or 2 mg daily depending on the
      height.

      Group B will receive an elimination diet (elimination of the foods the subject is allergic
      to).
