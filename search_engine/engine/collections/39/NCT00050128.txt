      major social and economic burden. Many of these patients receive different therapies in an
      attempt to improve their independence and quality of life. However, most of the current
      strategies are focused on the acute stage after stroke and are of limited influence in
      improving stroke outcome. One of the main problems of patients who have suffered a stroke is
      the difficulty in appropriately using the hand contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere; to
      date we have no successful means to improve the hand function in chronic stages of stroke.
      This protocol attempts to address this problem.

      A promising technique is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) that, so far,
      has produced some effects on motor function on other movement disorders like Parkinson's
      disease (PD). We hypothesize that rTMS will have a beneficial effect on motor function in
      chronic stroke patients. Specifically, we propose to look at the effect of 20 and 25 Hz
      stimulation since these types of stimulation have been shown to increase the excitability of
      the cerebral cortex.

      The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the effect of repetitive transcranial
      stimulation (rTMS) on the motor cortex of chronic stroke patients and motor function. Four
      different stimulation parameters within the limits of current safety guidelines will be used.
      We plan to determine; 1) which rTMS stimulation parameters induce more cortex excitability,
      2) whether there is any improvement of hand motor function after rTMS, and 3) if the applied
      stimulation parameters are safe in chronic stroke patients. The optimal parameters will be
      subsequently proposed for use in an experimental protocol for rehabilitation.
