      Subjects will complete each of the following 5-week long periods (unless they withdraw from
      the trial): 1) placebo pills and topical lidocaine patches, 2)extended-release oxycodone
      pills and placebo(vehicle) patches, and 3)placebo pills and placebo patches. Sixty subjects
      will be randomized to one of 6 treatment sequences. It is expected that this trial will take
      approximately 2 years to complete.
