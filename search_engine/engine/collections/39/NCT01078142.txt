      combination of Temsirolimus, Bendamustine and Rituximab will be established. In the phase I
      part of the trial 3 patients will be included in each dose level. After inclusion of 3
      patients, each patient has to receive at least 2 complete cycles without DLT until the
      enrolment into the next cohort can be initiated. In case of one DLT, 3 additional patients
      will be added to the specific dose level. If a second DLT appears, the last dose level
      without DLT will be considered the standard dose for the phase II trial. If the third dose
      level is achieved without any DLT, there will be no further dose escalation.

      In the phase II proportion of the trial, after establishment of a maximum tolerated dose, the
      efficacy of the combination regimens in two different patient cohorts will be evaluated. In
      the one cohort, 30 patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma will be treated; the second
      cohort will be composed of 30 patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma.
