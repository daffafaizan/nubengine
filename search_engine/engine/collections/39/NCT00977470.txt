           randomized into of the study groups: Group A (erlotinib) or Group B (erlotinib and HCQ).
           Study treatment will be divided into time periods called cycles. Each study treatment
           cycle is 28 days.

        -  Erlotinib (Group A and Group B) will be taken orally once a day. Hydroxychloroquine
           (Group B) will be taken orally once a day after taking erlotinib.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed day 1 of each cycle: physical
           examination, performance status assessment, questions about any symptoms or side
           effects, blood for routine tests. The following procedures will be performed at certain
           study visits: Research blood tests (cycle 1, cycle 2, then every other even cycle); eye
           exam (cycle 4, cycle 7, and then every 3 months); assessment of the tumor with CT or MRI
           scan (done at the end of even cycles.
