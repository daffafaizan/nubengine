    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Pemetrexed 500mg/m2 will be administered intravenously over approximately 10-minutes on
           Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.

        -  Folic Acid (350-1000 mcg. PO daily) will be taken by patients to reduce toxicity. At
           least 5 daily doses of folic acid must be taken during the 7-day period preceding the
           first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing should continue during the full course of therapy
           and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed.

        -  Vitamin B12 (1000 Âµg) will be administered as an intramuscular injection during the week
           preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and every 3 cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin
           B12 injections may be given the same day as pemetrexed.

      Performance Status: Karnofsky Performance Status 70-100

      Life expectancy > 12 weeks

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > 1500/mm3

        -  Platelet count > 100,000/mm3

        -  Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin < 1.5 X upper limit of normal (unless due to Gilbert's disease)

        -  Alkaline phosphatase and Alanine Transanimase (ALT) (SGPT) < 3 X upper limit of normal
           (ULN); may be < 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases. Alkaline phosphatase may be
           any value for patients with bone metastases.

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance >45 mL/min based on the standard Cockroft and Gault
           formula

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No congestive heart failure requiring therapy or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
           II or greater or active angina or known myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to
           study

        -  No unstable angina, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, or unstable symptomatic
           arrhythmia requiring medication within 6 months prior to being registered for protocol
           therapy

        -  Subjects with chronic atrial arrhythmia, i.e., atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal
           supraventricular tachycardia, or controlled hypertension are eligible

      Pulmonary:
