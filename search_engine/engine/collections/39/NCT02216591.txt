      training program to improve working memory and decrease impulsivity among HIV-infected
      individuals with poor medication adherence. The specific aims are to: (1) Investigate the
      effects of the cognitive training intervention on working memory and delay discounting in
      HIV-infected persons; and (2) Characterize adherence to antiretroviral medications in this
      population and examine medication adherence after cognitive training.

      The research design includes two parts: an eligibility screening and the Cognitive Training
      study. In Part 1, Eligibility Screening, participants will complete a 2-3 hour battery of
      standardized measures to assess for study eligibility. Eligible individuals will then be
      invited to enroll in Part 2, Cognitive Training Study. Part 1 of the study will involved
      screening approximately 60 participants, with an estimated eligibility rate of 67% for Part
      2. In Part 2, participants will be assigned to one of two groups (active cognitive training
      or control training; 20 participants per group) and will complete 12 training sessions over
      10 weeks. Participants assigned to the active cognitive training group will complete
      computerized modules designed to enhance working memory, while those assigned to the
      attention-matched control group will complete inactive modules that are not designed to
      enhance memory. All Part 2 participants will complete assessments at baseline and
      post-training to evaluate the impact of the training program.
