      was a pilot study done in Katete district of eastern province demonstrated the prevalence of
      NCC among people with epilepsy. There is need to provide an accurate estimate of the
      prevalence of NCC among people with cysticercosis in Zambia as well as understand the
      clinical manifestations of the disease in humans. Data on the full range of clinical
      characteristics of NCC is essential to accurately estimate the burden of the disease in the
      community.

      The epidemiology work package within the human health sector will create awareness of the
      size of the problem by delivering scientifically generated prevalence data on TSCT and NCC in
      various population groups (adults, children, and those living with epilepsy) in two provinces
      of Zambia. This will form an essential prerequisite for the development of public health
      policy guidelines for the control/elimination of TSCT/NCC in the country.

      Further, environmental factors that could play a role in the transmission and maintenance of
      T. solium eggs will be studied. This will provide essential data in understanding the
      epidemiology of the parasite in endemic regions.
