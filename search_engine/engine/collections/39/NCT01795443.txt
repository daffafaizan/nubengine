      A-Measure the effect of low- and high-frequency vibrations on lumbar repositioning in
      patients with chronic lower back pain.

      B-Measure the effect of low- and high-frequency vibrations on lumbar repositioning in healthy
      volunteers.

      Our working hypothesis is that low frequency vibrations induce an illusion of shortening, and
      high frequency vibrations induce an illusion of elongation. The variability of the error
      should not increase.
