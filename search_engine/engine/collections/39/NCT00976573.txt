      Primary

        -  To assess whether there is sufficient promise of an impact of the addition of everolimus
           to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab on progression-free
           survival that it would be recommended for further testing in patients with metastatic
           malignant melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the confirmed tumor response rate of each of the treatment regimens.

        -  To estimate the distribution of overall survival (OS) time for each of the treatment
           regimens.

        -  To assess the impact on the safety profile of the addition of everolimus to the
           combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to elevated LDH
      (above upper limit of normal) at baseline (yes vs no), location of metastatic disease (M1a
      [skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph node only] vs M1b [lung] vs M1c [other visceral sites])
      and prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15,
      paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day
      1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Arm I. Patients also
      receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) 3 times weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.
