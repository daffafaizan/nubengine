      been widely used in the various clinical situations warranting advance hemodynamic
      monitoring. It is considered as gold standard but unfortunately there is always risk
      associated with PA catheter and time lag between the clinical events and interpretation.
      Lidco Rapid is one of the non-invasive hemodynamic tools to measure various parameters. It is
      widely used in the intensive care set up for goal directed therapy but unfortunately there is
      not enough data to show whether it is useful in various peri-operative clinical conditions.
      In the online based survey, responses from the participants are recorded in the nominal scale
      ( 1 to 5 where 3 represents near normal). This survey will help to determine whether
      Investigators can replace the Lidco in any clinical situation warranting advance hemodynamic
      monitoring.

      No previous study was done to specifically find out the hemodynamic component that differs
      between these tools intraoperatively in varying hemodynamic conditions during cardiac surgery
      although there were few studies compared the trend in the cardiac output with difference in
      opinion on their accuracy.
