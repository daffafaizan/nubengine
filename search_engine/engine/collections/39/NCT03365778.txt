      intraocular pressure (IOP) and progressive vision loss. More than 3 million Americans have
      glaucoma and more than 150,000 are blind as a result.

      Regular use of glaucoma medications can usually lower intraocular pressure (IOP), prevent
      disease progression, preserve vision and prevent blindness. However, many people with
      glaucoma do not always use their medication as directed, with about one-third to one-half of
      patients with glaucoma not taking their drops as often as necessary, or have difficulty
      putting in the drops. There are also numerous local side effects from using glaucoma eye
      drops including red eyes, blurry vision and dry eye symptoms. Systemic side effects from eye
      drops range from triggering asthma, to lethargy and depression.

      Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) has been used safely and effectively for the treatment
      of elevated IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma for more than 20 years. SLT may result
      in mild and temporary IOP elevation, but this is a small risk and rarely significant. Other
      side effects include blurred vison and inflammation of the cornea (front, clear part of the
      eye), but they are extremely rare.

      The purpose of this study is to develop an educational program that will help improve the
      patients' understanding of what laser treatment is, how it might be beneficial to them, and
      why it should be considered as first glaucoma treatment before the use of glaucoma eye drops.
