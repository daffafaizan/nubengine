    
      Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found on
      certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects.

      Atezolizumab is an engineered anti-PD-L1 antibody.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the anti-CD27 antibody
      varlilumab in combination with atezolizumab.

      Eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to
      one of three dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 1200 mg of atezolizumab. The first
      phase of the study will enroll up to 18 patients and test the safety profile of the
      combination of varlilumab and atezolizumab in patients with various tumor types and determine
      which dose of varlilumab will be studied in Phase ll* of the study which will enroll only
      patients with RCC.

      *Note: This Study was terminated prior to initiation of Phase II.

      All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a
      response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.
