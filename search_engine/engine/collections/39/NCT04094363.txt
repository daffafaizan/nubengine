      Potential subjects will complete a pre-screening interview and a Screening Visit to assess
      their eligibility within 45 days prior to enrollment.

      Starting on Day 1, eligible smokers will be confined at the clinical site for 9 days.
      Subjects will participate in four separate Test Sessions for AL assessment, one for each IP.
      Each Test Session will last for approximately 4 hours during and following IP use. Subjects
      will be randomized to use one IP in each Test Session: Usual Brand (UB) combustible
      cigarettes, nicotine gum, and 2 Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS).

      For approximately a day and a half prior to each respective Test Session, IP will be
      dispensed for ad libitum use for product familiarization.
