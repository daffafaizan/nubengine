      region. Dietary intake plays a crucial role in ameliorating glycemia and other risk factors
      ,The aim of this study is to describe the trends in frequency of consumption of food groups
      and possible association with glycemic control among theT2D UAE patients.

      This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 800+ T2D diabetic aged â‰¥ 18
      years, attending Rashid Centre for Diabetes and Research(RCDR) Centre located in UAE during

      generated by dietitians after an interview based consultation using a structured pre-tested
      questionnaire. Multiple regression techniques will be used for model building, to determine
      the separate contribution of known confounders and food items with high carbohydrate and
      glycemic control.
