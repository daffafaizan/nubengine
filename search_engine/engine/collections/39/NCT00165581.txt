    
      -  Radiation treatment will be delivered in an outpatient setting, twice a day in 5
           consecutive treatment days. There will be a minimum 6-hour interval between the two
           daily treatments. The applicator is a simple tube with an inflatable balloon at one end,
           a channel in the middle of the tube for treatment, and two adapters at the other end.

        -  Following surgical removal of the breast cancer, the radiation oncologist with the
           assistance of the surgeon or radiologist will place the applicator in the surgical
           cavity. A small radioactive source, iridium-192, will be inserted into the applicator by
           a special machine and after the final treatment, the applicator will be removed.

        -  The following procedures will be done while the patient is on radiation therapy:
           post-partial mastectomy mammogram of micro-calcifications to confirm complete removal;
           CT scans for radiation treatment planning; monitoring of the skin for side effects;
           photographs of the breasts prior to the surgery, prior to placement of the applicator
           and at 60 days after radiation treatment to evaluate the cosmetic outcome of the
           treatment.

        -  Participation in this study will last approximately 2 months after completion of
           radiation treatment.
