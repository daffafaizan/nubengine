      twice daily or Lopinavir/r plus TDF/FTC once daily as part of the Gemini study. After 48
      weeks of the study, the patients will be treated with SQV film coated tablet 1500/100mg once
      daily plus TDF/FTC300/200mg once daily with good CD4 and VL outcomes. In this study, we would
      like to evaluate the once-daily dosing of SQV using SQV- SQV film coated tablet
      1500/ritonavir 100mg in combination with TDF/FTC300/200mg once daily. We believe that the PK
      parameters of SQV given at 1500mg daily will be equivalent to the 1000mg twice daily dosing
      when combined with RTV and TDF/FTC300/200mg OD, and that the once daily regimen will have
      better safety, tolerability profile than the twice daily regimen while maintaining good CD4
      and VL outcome
