      (DCS; a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist) for enhancing the effect of a novel
      psychosocial intervention, imagery rescripting (ImRs).

      ImRs is a therapeutic technique that has shown positive outcomes for people suffering from
      PTSD and as an adjunct to CBT for PTSD. Patients are asked to recall their memory of a
      specific traumatic experience, and then to imagine an intervention that changes the course
      and outcome of the event to produce a more satisfying result. It is hypothesized that
      reconsolidation of the trauma memory is the mechanism of ImRs. DCS augments exposure therapy
      but also appears to enhance reconsolidation of memory. We hypothesize that DCS will enhance
      the effect of ImRs by incorporating safety cues into the trauma memory.

      Sixty adults with PTSD symptoms due to a traumatic event at least three months prior to
      intake will receive 4 sessions of either: CBT + ImRs, or CBT + imaginal exposure (IE). In
      sessions 2 and 3, participants will be randomized to receive either DCS or placebo (PLA).

      We hypothesize that DCS + ImRs sessions will enhance treatment outcome by facilitating
      reconsolidation of the trauma memories incorporating new safety cues. We also hypothesize
      that ImRs + PLA will provide equal or better outcomes as the IE + PLA condition.

      The primary outcome measure will be improvements in PTSD symptoms, as assessed at baseline,
      post-treatment and at 1-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will be self-report
      questionnaires assessing depression symptoms, general psychological complaints, sleep
      quality, quality of life, and PTSD cognitions.
