      a pregnant woman (parturient) is admitted for a vaginal or cesarean delivery. The Hb
      concentration is normally measured from a venous blood sample in clinical laboratories using
      co-oximetry.

      A new point-of-care pulse co-oximeter, the Pronto-7 (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA), is
      a portable device that offers a non-invasive and quick spot-checking of Hb (SpHb).
      Measurement with the Pronto-7 takes about 60 seconds and does not require the transfer of
      blood samples to a laboratory. In addition to SpHb, the device provides a perfusion index
      (PI) value (a numeric estimation of the pulse strength at the measurement site), heart rate,
      oxygen saturation, and finger temperature. Potential advantages of the Pronto-7 include
      reduced staff work, decreased exposure to potential biohazards, and reduced pain and
      discomfort to the patient.

      A similar technology is used in Radical-7 pulse co-oximeter (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA,
      USA) for non-invasive Hb measurement. Radical-7 has been evaluated in human volunteers
      undergoing hemodilution, in patients undergoing spine surgeries, major urological procedures,
      and in critically ill patients. However, the results regarding the accuracy of this
      technology are conflicting.
