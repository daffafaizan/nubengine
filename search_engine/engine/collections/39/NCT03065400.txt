      pembrolizumab at the FDA approved dose (in head and neck cancer) of 200mg dose administered
      via intravenous infusion over 30 minutes given every 3 weeks. Nine patients will be enrolled
      in the first stage of the Simon-two stage design, and 15 in the second stage. A treatment
      cycle is 3 weeks and the core study period is 6 cycles. Response assessment by established
      consensus criteria will be used to assess response after 6 cycles in order to determine if
      the trial will progress to the second stage and for the purpose of determining the primary
      endpoint. In addition, allowed will be a maximum of ten patients with accelerated or blast
      phase disease (MPN-AP/BP) who are refractory or intolerant to conventional therapies such as
      decitabine, and in which hematopoietic stem cell transplant is not a therapeutic option
      (exploratory cohort), to enroll in the study as a separate exploratory cohort. These patients
      can be enrolled during stage 1 or 2 and will be analyzed separately from the primary cohort
      population.

      Exploratory biomarkers will be obtained from enrolled patients at baseline, cycle 3 and cycle
      7 and at 1 year of therapy. Patients that obtain at least a clinical improvement after 6
      cycles of therapy can continue receiving pembrolizumab until evidence of disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicity, and patient or physician decision for a maximum of 2 years.
