      and hydrated silica gel. Its leads to the coalescence of gas bubbles in the intestinal tract,
      facilitating its emission. To date, there are no contemporary studies evaluating the efficacy
      of simethicone on POI in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

      The proposed study is a pilot double-blinded randomized controlled trial of simethicone
      versus placebo in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. Starting on postoperative day one,
      patients in the experimental arm of the study will receive, in a blinded fashion, 160mg of
      simethicone orally four times a day for the first five postoperative days. Patients assigned
      to the control arm will receive a placebo agent orally with the same frequency and duration.

      All consenting patients over the age of 18 undergoing elective, abdominal colorectal surgery
      involving bowel resection with or without re-anastomosis at either the Juravinski Hospital
      and Cancer Center or St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario will be enrolled. This will
      include patients undergoing both open and laparoscopic surgery.

      Patients will be prospectively evaluated by a trained research assistant on a daily basis
      while in hospital. Passage of flatus, bowel movements, and postoperative pain will be
      evaluated at those visits. A two-week, and 30-day phone call to patients discharged from
      hospital will be done to assess for outcomes after discharge. Follow-up will end after the
      30th postoperative day.
