      Substances such as chlorhexidine are the most known and most applied for this purpose and, as
      a varnish, increased its anticariogenic potential. The antimicrobial effects of natural
      substances are being studied for exhibiting antimicrobial properties similar to those of
      chlorhexidine, but less toxic in some cases. Several studies with propolis has proven its
      efficacy against several microorganisms of the oral cavity, specially Streptococcus mutans. A
      pharmaceutical formulation containing brazilian green propolis was developed based on the
      chitosan polymer that is biocompatible and biodegradable. In a previous study, we observed in
      vitro antimicrobial properties of the varnish against Streptococcus mutans. This work aims to
      study the preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the propolis dental varnish in reducing
      Streptococcus mutans in saliva and in the biofilm control through a phase II study involving
      patients with 8-10 years. After 30 days, the results will be compared and statistically
      analyzed at a level of significance of 5 % .
