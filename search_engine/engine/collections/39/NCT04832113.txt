      Radiotherapy treatment plans require specific conditions:

        -  Reproductibility of patient's positioning (requiring management of bladder and rectal
           fillings at each session).

        -  An image-guided treatment consisting in acquiring an image before each session. This
           pre-treatment Imaging allows the optimal adjustment of the target volume and organs at
           risk (bladder and rectum).

      To allow reproductibility of target volume positioning at each radiotherapy session, it's
      recommended to have an empty rectum at the time of the radiotherapy preparation scan, and to
      check repletion before each session.

      It's recommended that the patient has a comfortably full bladder to limit the volume of
      irradiated bladder mucosa. The radiotherapy teams don't have any recommendations concerning
      the rectum and manage this problem session by session, according to the repositioning Imaging
      of the current day.

      According to a pilot study carried out in 2017 in the radiotherapy department of the Léon
      Bérard center, an intervention for a dilated rectum (probe or laxative) was necessary for an
      average of 25% of session per patient.

      These rectal problems can be partly explained by the age (60-80 years) and sedentary
      lifestyle of patients with prostate cancer. Physical activities, adapted hydratation and
      changes in eating habits are an integral part of the constipation and flatulence prevention.
