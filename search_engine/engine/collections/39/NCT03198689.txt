      widespread vascular injury and progressive fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. Internal
      organ involvement results in increased mortality of SSc patients. There is no effective
      treatment for the majority of patients with early active diffuse scleroderma (diffuse
      cutaneous systemic sclerosis; dcSSc). These patients early in their disease may be able to
      reverse their inflammation and reduce the probability of irreversible fibrosis via
      significant immune modulation. This is a pilot study that will treat 10 patients with early
      or active dcSSc who meet inclusion criteria to determine if the benefit of Brentuximab
      vedotin and safety are favorable in order to consider a randomized controlled trial. This is
      a Phase II study that is uncontrolled and patients will remain on their background immune
      suppressive treatment unless if contraindicated for safety or drug interactions. The trial is
      powered to show a mean change in mRSS of 8 over one year in an uncontrolled, unblinded study.
      The Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ), patient and physician global
      scores, inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), and combined response index in SSc (CRISS) will all
      be exploratory outcomes. Other outcomes such as changes in CD30-stained cells on skin
      biopsies with IHC from baseline to end of the trial will be explored if the study is
      positive.
