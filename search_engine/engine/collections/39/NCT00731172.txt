      following assessments:

      Clinical assessments:

        -  Crohn's disease activity will be assessed by components of the CDAI.

        -  Mucosal healing will be assessed by VCE (data will be quantitated using the Lewis
           score). Patients requiring colonoscopy according to Physicians decision would also be
           offered to participate in an endoscopic mucosal healing evaluation substudy. Patients
           participating will undergo colonoscopy and biopsies at the beginning (screening±1 week)
           and the end (week 12±1 week) of the treatment period. Endoscopic damage will be assessed
           using the CDEIS

        -  Mean (median) doses of corticosteroids and the average total aggregate dose of
           corticosteroids received per patient during the trial will be assessed.

        -  Quality of life will be assessed by components of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease
           Questionnaire(IBDQ).

      Safety:

        -  AE incidence

        -  Physical examination

        -  Clinical laboratory values

        -  Vital signs

      Tolerability and Safety:

        -  Adverse events, dropout rate will be registered.

        -  Proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinue the study.

        -  Proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinue the study due to Aes

        -  Time to premature discontinuation

        -  Time to premature discontinuation due to Aes.

      Immunologic assessment (including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion assays)
      will be performed at the baseline visit as well as weeks 4 and 12 and 16. Serum samples for
      cytokine studies 24 hours after first injection would also be collected.
