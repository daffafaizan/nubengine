      is then a critical issue of concern. Among skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma is the most
      common. Its treatment is mainly based on surgery that has to be done early. Indeed, CBC can
      lead to progressive destruction of tissues and significant morbidity in advanced stages. In
      these advanced stages (CBCa), they are no longer accessible to surgery or radiation therapy.
      The recently developed targeted therapies represent a significant therapeutic progress. To
      date, there are few data -none in France- concerning the cause of diagnostic delay .

      Thus, the main goal of this study will be to evidence the brakes and facilitators who chair
      the decision-making to consult in patients with a CBCa, by investigating:

        -  the perception of the target subjects (patients);

        -  the perception of the healthcare team; We will also conduct a critical meta-synthesis
           (qualitative meta-analysis) of the literature concerning the diagnostic delay and
           decision-making in onco-dermatology.

      It is a prospective non-Interventional exploratory qualitative study without direct
      individual benefit
