      and multiple medicines is a challenge for General Practitioners (GPs) and consequently, there
      has been an increased emphasis on ways to support GPs throughout this process. The
      integration of pharmacists into the general practice team is one approach being explored
      internationally and studies have shown that pharmacists, working as part of the general
      practice team, have influenced the safety and quality of prescribing. However, the evidence
      base is weak as there have been few high quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
      conducted and a range of modest effect sizes reported. Moreover, it is unclear whether such
      interventions can result in clinically significant improvements in patient outcomes. In
      Ireland, pharmacists are not integrated into general practice teams, therefore the
      feasibility of the integration of pharmacists into general practice warrants further
      exploration in the Irish primary care setting, prior to evaluation in a full scale RCT. The
      aim of this study is to develop and pilot test an intervention involving pharmacists, working
      within GP practices, to optimise prescribing in Ireland, which has a mixed public and private
      primary healthcare system.
