      negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia represent a critical unmet therapeutic need.
      There is wide acceptance of the notion that both negative and cognitive symptoms are best
      understood as features of hypo- rather than hyperdopaminergic activity. The primary negative
      and cognitive symptoms appear central to schizophrenia and predate the neurodevelopmental
      changes that subsequently give rise to the hyperdopaminergic state underlying positive
      symptoms. In using L-Dopa specifically, we avoid the abuse potential of agents such as the
      psychostimulants, or perturbations in pharmacological action as a function of dose, as
      observed with dopamine agonists. Further, more recent neuroimaging studies have provided in
      vivo evidence in keeping with the underlying rationale. First, imaging studies have
      demonstrated that L-dopa induces shifts in activity in both cortical and subcortical
      structures linked to reward, affect and cognition. Along similar lines, L-dopa-induced
      changes have been associated with improvement in motivation, cognitive tasks, and affect.
