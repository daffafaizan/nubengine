    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, 2 parallel group study. The first part of
      the treatment period will evaluate the pharmacokinetic bioequivalence of a single dose of a
      subcutaneous injection of 30mg of albiglutide from process 2 drug substance compared with
      process 3 drug substance. The second part of the treatment period will evaluate additional
      pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic parameters, immunogenicity, effects on
      glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose, and safety and tolerability of repeat
      doses of subcutaneous injections of 30mg of albiglutide given weekly for 12 weeks from
      process 2 drug substance compared with process 3 drug substance. Subjects with type 2
      diabetes whose glycemia is inadequately controlled on their current regimen of diet and
      exercise or stable dose of metformin will be recruited into the study.
