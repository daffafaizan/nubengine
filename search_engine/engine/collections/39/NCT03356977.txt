    
      Approximately 125 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects must have mild-to-moderate AD involving
      at least 5% treatable %BSA assessed on Baseline/Day 1. Treatable %BSA will be defined as the
      percent of a subject's total body surface area that is AD-involved, excluding the scalp.

      In addition, a cohort of at least 16 of the 125 subjects will be included in a subgroup for
      PK assessment. These subjects must have moderate AD and a minimum of 35% treatable %BSA,
      excluding the scalp, and must complete all PK assessments to be included in the PK analysis.
      Of these subjects, at least 3 subjects who are less than 9 months of age will be enrolled.
      Subjects discontinuing for reasons other than treatment emergent adverse event ( TEAE) may be
      replaced at the discretion of the sponsor to ensure 16 subjects complete the PK assessments.
      Only selected study sites will participate in the PK assessment.

      Scheduled study visits/telephone contacts for all subjects will occur at Screening (up to 28
      days prior to Baseline/Day 1), Baseline/Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 (end of
      treatment/early termination), Day 36, and Day 57 (end of study).
