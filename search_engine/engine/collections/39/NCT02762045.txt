      groups of patients receive dose-escalation (2×10^9VP, 2×10^10VP or 2×10^11VP) injections of
      Adenovirus vector vaccine (Ad5-gag). Two weeks post immunization of lower dose, if the
      vaccine is safe and well tolerant, the next dose of immunization will begin. patients are
      monitored for safety 72 hours after each immunization. In addition, each patient records
      adverse events in a diary. Patients have regular physical exams, pregnancy tests, and blood
      drawn for virologic and immunologic assessments. The induction of HIV-specific responses will
      be measured.
