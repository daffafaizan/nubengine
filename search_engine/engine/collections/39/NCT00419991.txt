      demonstrates a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity by inhibiting multiply resistant
      gram-positive, gram-negative, anaerobic, and "atypical" bacteria. It is being developed as an
      agent that overcomes tetracycline-resistance mechanisms and provides activity against
      emerging multi-drug resistant pathogens. These attributes may provide clinicians with a
      valuable therapeutic alternative. The purpose of this protocol is to determine the linkage
      between time related clinical measures of infection response and time to bacterial
      eradication in patients with intravascular catheter infections caused by Staphylococcus
      epidermidis and other coagulase negative staphylococci. The study is being conducted in two
      phases. The first treats patients who have removal of the catheter at the time of treatment,
      and the second treats patients who have the catheter remaining in situ during tigecycline
      treatment.
