      and pressure platform. The tests are performed in a control group of healthy subjects, and in
      an experimental group with DLC receiving a program of therapeutic exercise based and pain
      education based on neuroscience.

      After the collection of the records, the behavior patterns in both groups are evaluated, the
      possible differences among them are established for the clinimetric indicators analyzed
      related to the postural control, as well as a characteristic of the sample.

      Subsequently, through the evaluation after the intervention of the experimental group we will
      analyze the effect of a physiotherapy treatment based on the therapeutic exercise of motor
      control on parameters related to postural control and clinical variables (perceived pain,
      mechanosensitivity, disability and proprioceptive repositioning of the lumbar spine )
