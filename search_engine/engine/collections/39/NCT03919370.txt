      The neurobiomarkers that will be analyzed for detection of cerebral ischemia is Glial
      Fibrillary Acidic Protein, Neurofilament light chains, S-100, Neuron specific endolas,
      Total-tau. Cardiac biomarkers are troponin-t and NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide.

      Blood sampling will occur before anesthesia induction and 2 hours after plausible ischemia
      for patients undergoung surgery for carotid endarterectomy. for patients undergoing acute
      thrombectomy blood sampling will be performed as soon as possible after patient has arrived
      to the hospital.
