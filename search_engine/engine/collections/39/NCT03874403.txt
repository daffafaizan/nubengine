      intubation-related complications and for a smoother postoperative recovery. In recent years,
      investigator have completed more than 1000 NIVATS. However, the benefits on recovery
      including swallowing and esophageal function have nerver been demonstrated. The anesthetic
      components include an intravenous general anesthesia with an intraoperative nerve blocks.
      Monitoring and analyzing the components of anesthesia have rarely been studied. In this
      study, the investigator plan to do a radomized control study to demonstarte the differences
      between NIVATS and intubated VATS, and to investigate the differences on recovery and
      anesthetic components. Patients schedured for VATS operation, suitable for NIVATS will be
      included and randomized into NIVATS or VATS groups. DSA and Ce will be monitored throughout
      the surgical procedures. swalowing test, esophageal function and postoperative qustionare for
      food intake will be recorded, collected and analyzed.
