      different materials used for the transmucosal part of implants. Using a brace, the intraoral
      biofilm formation in healthy subjects will be measured after 28 hours (24 hours intraorally,
      4 hours rest). For this purpose 2 sterile platelets of each of the 8 differently processed
      materials (16 platelets in total) are inserted into the braces.

      The main target parameter is the quantification of the biofilm by crystal violet staining.
      For this purpose the samples are analyzed by spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 595 nm
      (OD595).

      As secondary target parameter possible bactericidal effects of the materials, which are
      analyzed by Colony forming units (CFU) determination, are used.
