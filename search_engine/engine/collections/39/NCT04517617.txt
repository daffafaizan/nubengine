      accurately estimate postpartum hemorrhage in clinical practice. Postpartum hemorrhage is the
      leading cause of maternal death in the world, accounting for 30% of maternal deaths. Studies
      have shown that most deaths caused by postpartum hemorrhage are avoidable. Domestic and
      foreign literature reports that the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage is 5%~10%, however,
      the amount of blood loss clinically estimated is often lower than the actual amount, the
      actual incidence of postpartum hemorrhage is higher. A large number of studies have confirmed
      that maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy such as particulate matter (PM),
      nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) can increase
      the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, gestational diabetes
      mellitus(GDM), hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy, preterm birth and low birth
      weight(LBW). So, a prospective cohort study is conducted to explore the influence of prenatal
      factors and environment on maternal hemorrhage.

      Research content: This research is a prospective cohort study from June 2020 to December
      2022, 500 pregnant women will be recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an
      Jiaotong University and First Affiliated Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University.
      A health management birth cohort will be established. ①To construct a spatial and temporal
      series about maternal hemorrhage influenced by maternal exposure to air pollution during
      pregnancy; ②To explore the effects of prenatal factors and environment on maternal
      hemorrhage.

      Research meaning：① Practical significance: To explore the factors that affect maternal
      hemorrhage, and to reduce the occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage, which contributes to
      reducing the healthy risks and medical economic burdens caused by the healthy problems of
      mothers and children. ② To define the critical period of the developing of maternal
      hemorrhage in spatial and temporal series, and to calculate the cutoff value of air pollution
      on maternal hemorrhage, propose short-term control target of air pollution related to
      maternal and child health, construct the first-level prevention strategy for adverse
      pregnancy outcomes.

      Research steps: ① Complete the recruiting of subjects, which meet the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria sign an informed consent before the carrying out of research; ② Follow up:
      Questionnaires will be conducted to acquire the information including sociodemographic
      characteristics, menstrual history and childbearing history, residence during pregnancy,
      lifestyle and diet habits, the information of illness and medication, history of past
      illness, etc. Then the maternal exposure level of air pollutants in every trimester will be
      calculated, based on air pollution detection station, from Shaanxi Meteorological and
      Environment Bureau according to residence information of participants; ③ Serum indicators:
      fasting venous blood samples will be taken before and after childbirth to detect serum level
      of hemoglobin, all the blood samples will be taken and tested in the laboratory of the First
      Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University and First Affiliated Hospital of the Fourth
      Military Medical University; ④ Monitoring of postpartum hemorrhage: closely monitor the
      volume of blood loss. During the whole study period, the subjects could withdraw the cohort
      at any time.

      Prenatal hemoglobin level: blood hemoglobin level within one week before delivery; Postpartum
      hemoglobin level: blood hemoglobin level 1 day after delivery; The difference of hemoglobin
      before and after delivery: prenatal hemoglobin level minus postpartum hemoglobin level (if he
      patient received red blood cell transfusion during this period, this value is the degree of
      hemoglobin change after calibration); The 24 h postpartum hemorrhage is calculated as 400 ml
      for every 10g/L drop in hemoglobin; Birth weight: the weight of newborn within the first
      hour.

      Statistical method: ①Univariate analysis: The maternal exposure levels of air pollution
      during pregnancy will be treated as independent variables, postpartum hemorrhage will be
      treated as dependent variables, univariate logistic regression will be used to analyze the
      relationship between them; ②Multivariate analysis: postpartum hemorrhage will be taken as
      dependent variables, maternal exposure levels, sociodemographic characteristics, nutritional
      status, dietary status, and other factors are included as independent variables, the
      multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to data analysis. In the multivariate
      regression the odds ration value and 95% confidence intervention of air pollution to affect
      adverse pregnancy outcomes will be calculated adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics,
      nutrition, dietary conditions and other factors; ③Spatial and temporal series analysis will
      be adapted to define the critical period of the developing of postpartum hemorrhage under
      maternal exposure to air pollution, and calculate the cut-off value of air pollution about
      postpartum hemorrhage.

      Research planning: ①Complete research design, follow-up questionnaires, and pre-experiments
      before July 2020; ②Complete enrollment of subjects, collect pregnancy-related information,
      follow-up of the study subjects, detecting of serum indicators, monitor the occurrence of
      postpartum hemorrhage before July 2022; ③Complete data export and analysis about basic
      information and data analysis; ④Clarify the relationship between maternal air pollution
      exposure during pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage, explore the potential mechanism in the
      occurrence of postpartum hemorrhage influenced by prenatal factors and environment.
