      potentially negative side effects that early open surgery carries in patients with acute
      pancreatitis, results in decrease of overall mortality and major morbidity. The DECOMPRESS
      study is designed to compare effects of decompressive laparotomy with temporary abdominal
      closure and percutaneous puncture with placement of abdominal catheter in patients with
      abdominal compartment syndrome during acute pancreatitis.
