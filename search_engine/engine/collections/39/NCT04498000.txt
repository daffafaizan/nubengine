      established and the pathophysiology of these phenotypes remains unknown: specifically if the
      occurence of pachyvessels is the primary event, or develops secondary to the inner choroidal
      attenuation.

      A longitudinal study of the pachychoroid phenotype will provide much needed information
      regarding the natural history of the pachychoroid phenotype. Secondly, a detailed chronicle
      of the choroidal alterations in the pachychoroid disease spectrum may yield insights into the
      pathogenesis, and facilitate the development of disease modulation strategies.
