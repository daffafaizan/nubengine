      patients fulfilling criteria will be involved. Upon ICU admission, patients will be connected
      to full monitoring and confirming patient hemodynamic stability and no active bleeding
      through drains. Patients will be in supine position and baseline readings will be recorded.
      Fluid responsiveness will be assessed with mini fluid challenge by 150 ml of albumin 5% given
      over 1 minute. After fluid administration stroke volume (SV) assessed by trans thoracic echo
      (TTE) and other hemodynamic parameters will be recorded. Remaining 350 ml of albumin 5% will
      be continued over 14 minute to have total volume given 500 ml. after fluid administration SV
      and other parameters will be recorded. The fluid challenge will be given intravenously via a
      specific wide pore venous line. Fluid responsiveness will be defined as an increase in the SV
      by 15% after the infusion of fluid.

      TT Echo Examination:

      A single LVOT diameter will be measured for each patient as the distance between the
      inﬂection points at the base of the aortic valve cusps from the left parasternal long axis
      view during systole.

      Assuming a circular cross section, the LVOT area will be calculated from the LVOT diameter
      as:

      π X (LVOT diameter/ 2)2 = (LVOT diameter)2 X 0.785 Pulse wave Doppler sampling cursor will be
      placed in the middle of the LVOT immediately proximal to the aortic valve in 5 chamber apical
      view.

      The sonographer manually will trace the velocity-time envelope (VTI). SV values will be
      calculated by multiplying VTI by cross sectional area.
