      after surgery are of vital importance for patients. Knowledge of the trajectory and degree of
      long-term functional recovery following emergency laparotomy, including the regaining of
      optimal HRQoL is limited as most research relating to this field has been done in patients
      undergoing planned surgery. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the pattern of
      recovery and restoration of baseline HRQoL is also important to researchers wishing to assess
      the full impact of interventions in order to improve outcomes following emergency laparotomy.
      Assessing HRQoL in this surgical population remains a challenge in the absence of a validated
      instrument. The investigators plan to undertake a feasibility study to assess utilisation of
      four patient questionnaires, well established within other surgical populations, to describe
      the quality of early and long-term recovery following emergency laparotomy. The investigators
      will utilise the QoR-15 to describe short-term (in - hospital) recovery metrics and versions
      of the WHO-DAS and the WHOQOL-BREF to describe longer term disability free survival and
      return towards baseline HRQoL. The Post-Operative Morbidity Survey (POMS) will help capture
      the onset of complications at different points during recovery. The study also aims to test
      the feasibility of assessing the impact of pre-operative co-morbidities, age, quality of
      peri-operative and intra-operative care, surgical indication and findings as well as
      post-operative complications on long-term HRQoL.
