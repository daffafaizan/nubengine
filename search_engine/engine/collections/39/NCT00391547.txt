      agents, Peridex and Listerine, have received the Seal of Acceptance from the Council on
      Dental Therapeutics of the American Dental Association for the control of supragingival
      plaque and gingivitis. Peridex (0.12% chlorhexidine, bisbiguanide cationic detergent) is a
      prescription mouthrinse that demonstrates potent anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis action.
      Chlorhexidine rinses are also prescribed to prevent post surgical infections. Chlorhexidine
      has broad spectrum antibacterial activity and substantivity. With prolonged use,
      chlorhexidine maintains its effectiveness but causes staining of natural teeth and composite
      materials used in restorative dentistry. Other side effects associated with chlorhexidine are
      calculus formation and possible alterations in taste. Although chlorhexidine rinses and
      supragingival irrigations have demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing plaque and
      gingivitis, chlorhexidine has had a minimal impact in treating periodontal disease.
      Listerine, comprised of essential oils, is an over-the-counter mouthrinse that is less
      effective than chlorhexidine in controlling plaque and gingivitis, but has minimal side
      effects. Other agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds and metal salts are rarely used
      alone but can be used in combination with other antimicrobial rinses to enhance their
      effectiveness.
