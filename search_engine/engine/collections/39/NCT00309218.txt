      patients after NTx. Over a 2-year period, two treatment regimes will be compared in
      randomized form in patients with a stable renal transplant function in the course of 12 - 24
      months after transplantation (controlled first study phase):

      Branch A: CyA + MMF + withdrawal of steroids over a three-month period following
      randomization

      Branch B: CyA + MMF + 4 mg/mÂ² methylprednisolone (or prednisolone equivalent)/day

      After two years of observation, steroids in the control group (branch B) can be withdrawn
      optionally in conformity with the same protocol as in branch A (uncontrolled second study
      phase). It is to be expected that part of the patients will decide in favour of a withdrawal
      of steroids. In the uncontrolled second study phase, a comparison will thus be drawn among
      three therapy groups over a period of another 15 months (altogether 3.5 years beginning with
      randomization), in order to throw some light on the medium-term effect of steroid-free
      immunosuppression on length growth and transplant function.
