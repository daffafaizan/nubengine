      for correlations between chlamydia-specific cellular responses and protection against
      incident infection.

      At enrollment participants will undergo a history and physical examination; blood draw; and
      pelvic examination including collection of vaginal and cervical samples, STD testing and
      endometrial biopsy.

      Participants will have follow up visits conducted at 1, 4, 8 and 12 months following
      enrollment. At the follow-up visits, participants will undergo a repeat history and physical,
      blood draw and pelvic examination including collection of vaginal and cervical samples and
      STD testing.

      The study design will allow comprehensive identification of the antigen-specific cell
      mediated immune responses most strongly associated with protection against C. trachomatis
      infection.

      The primary objective is to prospectively follow 200 women with or at risk for cervicitis to
      determine the chlamydia-specific cellular responses that correlate with protection against
      incident infection.
