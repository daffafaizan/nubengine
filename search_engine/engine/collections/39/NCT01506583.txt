      drug resistance detection using the test (QFlu Combo Test) under investigation. The remaining
      portion of the sample is used for culture. The culture positive samples are used for
      determination of IC50 values, which is used as a gold standard for defining whether a virus
      isolate is resistant to a drug or not. The sensitivity and specificity of the QFlu test will
      be calculated by comparing to the gold standard test.
