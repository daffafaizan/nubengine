        -  Determine the overall and progression-free survival in patients with supratentorial
           glioblastoma multiforme treated with accelerated radiotherapy and conformal stereotactic
           radiotherapy boost followed by carmustine.

        -  Determine the short and long-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive daily accelerated radiotherapy 5 days a week on weeks 1-2. On weeks
      3-6, patients receive accelerated radiotherapy 4 days a week (3 days a week on week 6) and
      conformal stereotactic radiotherapy boost once weekly. Patients then receive carmustine IV
      over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 every 8 weeks for 6 courses beginning within 1 month after the
      completion of radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.
