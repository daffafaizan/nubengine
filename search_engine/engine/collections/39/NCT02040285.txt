    
      Computed Tomography Colonography (CTC) is a valid alternative to colonoscopy in the detection
      of cancer, polyps and other colon lesions.

      High volume cathartic preparations, low volume cathartic solutions with oral tagging agent
      and tagging agent only are the procedures available for CTC.

      High volume preparations are a considerable burden for patients. Low volume cathartic
      solutions are more accepted by the patients, reduce the amount of tagging agent and the
      waiting time to the exam. Tagging agent only preparations represent a risk if they are taken
      without medical supervision.
