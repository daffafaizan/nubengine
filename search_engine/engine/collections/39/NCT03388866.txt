    
      A total of 94 patients, 3 years of age or older, with clinical diagnosis of AD, without
      distinction of gender, ethnicity or social group, will be selected at HCFMRP-USP Allergy and
      Dermatology outpatient clinics. These patients will undergo clinical evaluation and
      laboratory tests, including blood count, total IgE, inhalant panel specific IgE, and
      immediate hypersensitivity skin tests, and mite allergen-specific IgG4 (Der p 1 and Der p 2),
      before of the study. To calculate the sample size, a response rate to the medication was
      defined as a 15 - point decrease in SCORAD (a score that includes lesion extent, intensity
      and subjective symptoms such as pruritus and sleep), which was determined through the
      experience of the service. It was estimated that 40% of the patients in the treatment group
      and 15% of the placebo group reached the proposed rate through a test with 80% power, and the
      need for 47 individuals in each group was defined.

      Patients in the treatment group will undergo allergen-specific immunotherapy sublingually,
      with weekly doses of extracts of mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides
      farinae (60% and 40% respectively), according to the scheme described in Tables 1 and 2.
      Patients in the control group will be submitted to the same administration schedule, but with
      the diluent of the allergenic extract (doubly distilled water solution and glycerin).
      Patients will be divided into groups according to randomization.

      Subjects will be randomly divided into blocks of random size 4 or 6 and stratified according
      to age (less than 12 years and greater / equal 12 years), performed through the RedCap
      platform, available at FMRPUSP. This process will be performed by laboratory staff who will
      provide the extracts and the researchers will not have access to the lists of patients in
      each group. As for blinding, the bottles with extract and placebo will be provided by the
      already coded laboratory, and the team will only be responsible for the delivery and storage
      of the same.

      Individuals will be the outpatient clinics of the Allergy and Dermatology Service of the
      HCFMRP-USP. All medical records and clinical and dermatological examination will be recorded
      in medical records, as well as clinical evaluation by SCORAD , quality of life questionnaire
      and personal scale of symptoms, being evaluated at the beginning of treatment, after two,
      three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen and eighteen months of evolution.

      Serum levels of IgG4 specific mite for Der p 1 and Der p 2 will be determined by ImmunoCAP
      and evaluated at the beginning and the end of treatment. Interleukins 4, 5, 9, 10 13, 17,
      TNFα, TGFβ and interferon-γ will be performed in plasma in the beginning, with 9 months of
      evolution and at the end of the study.
