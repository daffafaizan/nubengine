      open-label, interventional , non-randomized trial that investigates the feasibility and
      efficiency of OCT guidance for left main PCI in 10 active French interventional cardiology
      centres. The aim of the study is the appliance of a pre-defined standardized protocol for LM
      PCI . The LM PCI strategy is guided by 3 OCT runs, according to a pre-determined protocol.
      The first OCT run (run1) is performed before any stent implantation, the second run (run2) is
      performed after the stent is implanted, POT (proximal optimization technique) is applied and
      side branch iss rewired through stent struts. The third run (run3) is performed after PCI
      optimization. In case of additional stent optimization, a supplementary OCT run is applied in
      order to assess final result.
