      spectacles (Test) and standard non-free-form PAL spectacles (Control) for one week each. All
      subjects wore both Test and Control spectacles, and the pair to be worn first was randomly
      assigned. At dispensing and after 1 week of wear, subjects were tested for distance and near
      visual acuity (VA) under both high and low contrast; in addition, 30 degree off-axis VA was
      measured using a novel apparatus, as was the horizontal extent of undistorted vision at
      reading distance. Subjects also completed a set of questionnaires detailing their
      satisfaction levels, adaptation times, and preferences for Test or Control spectacles for
      different visual tasks.
