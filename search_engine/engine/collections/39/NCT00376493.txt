      trials. A recent evidence showed that endometritis post cesarean section needs no treatment
      after hospital discharge. The objective of this study is to verify if this finding also
      applies to infected abortions.

      After in hospital treatment, the patients will be randomized to the traditional treatment
      (metronidazole and doxycycline) or to placebo until 10 days of treatment is completed. Active
      follow-up will be done every 2 days, and the patient will be reevaluated at the end of
      treatment.

      Cure will be defined as the absence of fever, pain and bleeding. Failure of treatment will be
      considered as the need for hospitalization or additional antibiotics.
