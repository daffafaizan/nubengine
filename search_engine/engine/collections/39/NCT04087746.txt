      diabetic macular edema for intra-vitreal injection of AVEGF group I (200 patients eyes)
      received aflibercept 2.0 mg and group II (200 patients eyes) received ranibizumab 0.3 mg.
      Injection was at 4 weeks interval according to the used protocol. The primary outcome was
      measuring the mean change in visual acuity as functional outcome and the secondary outcomes
      were the mean change in central macular thickness, as anatomical outcome rather than safety
      and efficacy of those two anti-VEGF drugs.
