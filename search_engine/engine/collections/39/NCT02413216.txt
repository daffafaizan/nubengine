      for tics (CBIT) have been shown to be effective for reducing tics in some children with
      chronic tic disorders, including Tourette's disorder. Although effective, many parents and
      children do not have access to a provider trained in these therapies and practical barriers
      such as travel and high costs for ongoing therapy limit treatment dissemination and
      utilization.The investigators recently developed an online, computerized, self-administered
      version of CBIT called TicHelper.com. This program is an 8-week online program designed to
      teach children and families empirically-supported tic management skills. The current study
      will test the efficacy of TicHelper.com in a randomized clinical trial in which 64 children
      with Tourette's Disorder or a persistent (chronic) tic disorder will be randomly assigned to
      8-weeks of TicHelper.com (N=32) or an 8-week internet resource control condition (N=32). Tic
      symptoms will be assessed by a condition-blind independent evaluator at baseline,
      post-treatment, and 1-month follow-up. Information regarding patient acceptability of the
      program will also be collected. This project will test whether TicHelper.com is an
      efficacious and acceptable way to teach tic-management skills for children with tics.
