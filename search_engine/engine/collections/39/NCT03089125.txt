      point during the course of their illness. Unfortunately, few interventions exist to treat
      this distressing symptom of cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a brief behavioral intervention may help
      relieve breathlessness in individuals with advanced lung cancer. Participants will have a
      50/50 chance of receiving the behavioral intervention or standard care. The principal
      investigator of the study, Dr. Joseph Greer, is a licensed clinical psychologist who has
      trained oncology nurses in how to deliver the behavioral intervention. The oncology nurses
      will meet with participants during their outpatient oncology appointments, such as
      chemotherapy infusions, to review the behavioral skills that may help with breathlessness.
      This intervention involves no medications but rather teaches patients skills for breathing
      control and relaxation of the body.
