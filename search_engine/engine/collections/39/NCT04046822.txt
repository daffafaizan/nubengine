      liraglutide 3.0 mg with placebo both administered subcutaneously once-daily in subjects with
      established obesity. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either liraglutide
      3.0 mg or placebo as an adjunct to standard-of-care.All baseline assessments will be done
      prior to administration of the first dose of trial product while all the follow up
      assessments will be done at the end of the trial. Dose escalation of liraglutide/placebo will
      take place during the first 4 weeks after randomisation as described. All subjects will aim
      at reaching the recommended target dose of 3.0 mg liraglutide once-daily or the corresponding
      volume of placebo. In this trial approximately 70 subjects will be randomly assigned to trial
      product.
