    
      This is an open-label (both physician and participant know the treatment that the participant
      receives), randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), multicenter clinical study
      assessing the safety of 2 rivaroxaban treatment strategies and one vitamin K antagonist (VKA)
      treatment strategy in participants, who have paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and have had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
      with stent placement.

      A target of 2,100 participants will be randomized into the study, with approximately 700
      participants in each treatment strategy group. The randomization will be stratified by the
      intended duration of DAPT (1, 6, or 12 months).

      The study consists of a screening phase, a 12-month open-label treatment phase, and an
      end-of-treatment/early withdrawal visit. The total duration of participation in the study for
      each participant is approximately 12 months.
