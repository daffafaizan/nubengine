    
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of unrecognized cognitive
      impairment (CI) pre-operatively in older surgical adults through measurement via virtual
      instruments.

      In a preoperative assessment 1-30 days prior to their scheduled surgery, patients will be
      asked via telephone to complete TICS-M and will complete the AD8, a single cognitive
      question, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0),
      Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL), EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L), Geriatric
      Depression Scale (GDS) via online survey. These questionnaires will be repeated at follow-up
      visits at 30-, 90-, and 365-days post-surgery. If patients agreed to have an informant
      participate in the study as well, then the informant will go through a similar consent
      process and will complete only the IADL at every time point in the study as separate
      submission.
