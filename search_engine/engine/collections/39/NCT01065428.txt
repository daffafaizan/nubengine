      first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (5-6
      cmH2O) for 30 minutes. Patients who did not fulfill the criteria for successful SBT, or
      required assist, or deceased within 48h post-extubation were considered extubation failure
      (F). Patients who completed the SBT and remained extubated > 48 h were considered
      successfully extubated (S). Before and during the SBT, arterial blood gases, heart, rate,
      blood pressure, and EAdi, flow, Vt, f, and, airway pressure (Paw) were measured. At 0, 5, 10,
      15 and 30 minutes of the SBT, f/Vt, diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi), NME, and NVE were
      calculated. NME was calculated as Paw/EAdi during inspiratory occlusion. NVE was calculated
      as Vt/EAdi during unassisted inspirations.Arterial blood gases, heart rate, and blood
      pressure were measured. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to
      evaluate the predictive performance of each index.
