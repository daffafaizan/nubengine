      available. To help pregnant women and their partners make informed decisions based on their
      values, needs and preferences, a decision aid (DA) has been developped and online shared
      decision-making (SDM) training program for health professionals has been created to support
      the use of this DA and give health care professionals key elements on SDM. The decision aid
      was found relevant and acceptable to pregnant women and their partners; the relevance and
      acceptability of the online SDM training program aren't evaluated yet. This study aim to
      assess the intention on using a DA after taking the online training program, to evaluate
      knowledge acquisition and to assess the program's acceptability and perceived usefulness.
      This is a multi-center, two-arm, controlled trial (RCT). Thirty-six participants will be
      randomly allocated to either 1) an experimental group that is exposed to the investigator's
      complete 3 hours online training program intervention (n = 18) or 2) a control group that is
      exposed to an intervention which will be a 3 hours online training program focused on
      prenatal screening alone.
