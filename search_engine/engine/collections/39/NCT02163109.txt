      patients. Patients will be recruited from the population of already intubated and ventilated
      individuals on an adult intensive care unit (AICU). Once patients have been recruited we will
      insert the optical gas analyser (OGA) into the ventilation circuit (tubing) for 48 hours.

      Data will be continuously collected until 48 hours from attachment of the OGA, death or
      extubation of the patient, and analysed retrospectively. A time series describing oxygen
      consumption with a resolution of one minute or less will be prepared and standard measures of
      dispersion calculated. In addition, variables that are routinely recorded on the computerised
      clinical record during the same period will then be examined and associations sought between
      these variables and changes in oxygen consumption as measured with the OGA. We have
      prospectively identified variables which, based on the published literature, are likely to be
      associated with variation in oxygen consumption (VO2) upon which attention will focus, though
      others may become apparent during the study:

        -  Body temperature

        -  Seizures

        -  Change in haemoglobin concentration (including due to blood transfusion)

        -  Bolus fluids

        -  Vasoactive drugs

        -  Beta-agonist drugs

        -  Drugs affecting the angiotensin-converting enzyme system

        -  Renal replacement therapy

        -  Feeding

        -  Sedation

        -  Neuromuscular blockers

        -  Mode of ventilation

        -  Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)

        -  Physical activity

        -  Surgery
