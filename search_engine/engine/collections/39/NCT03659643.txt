      using a method of Statistical Pattern Recognition (SPR) in six academic Memory Clinics in
      four Nordic countries. In the current study, those from the former study diagnosed either
      with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n= 120) or with Subjective Cognitive Impairment (SCI;
      n=60) are contacted again and evaluated for cognitive impairment. The EEG registered at entry
      in the former study is considered in relation to their current diagnosis (SCI,MCI or
      dementia) and thereby, the prognostic value of the method is evaluated.

      In the second part of the study (n=120), new patients evaluated in the Memory Clinics and
      diagnosed with MCI (not SCI) are invited to participate for a two year follow up.

      In the diagnostic work-up, simple screening tests and information from a close relative form
      the basis of the cognitive status (SCI;MCI, Dementia). In evaluating the cause of cognitive
      impairment, detailed neuropsychological testing is performed as well as MRI of the brain and
      CSF for AlzheimerÂ´s markers. qEEG with SPR analysis is registered but the clinician is
      blinded to its outcome.

      The end point in both parts of the study is a diagnosis of a dementing disorder.
