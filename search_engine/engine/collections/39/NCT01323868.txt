      infections can end up inside the eye and cause an infection inside the eye (called endogenous
      endophthalmitis).

      Prior to modern and rapid treatment of systemic infections, the rate of endogenous
      endophthalmitis was reported to be 37% in 1982. By 1997, the rate was reported to be 2.8%.
      This study aims to determine the rate of endogenous endophthalmitis at Stanford Hospital in
      the modern medical era in that our rates may be different as those reported in the
      literature. This potential difference may be a reflection of treatment protocols and
      antibiotics currently in use at Stanford Hospital.
