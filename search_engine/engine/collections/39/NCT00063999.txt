      I. To determine if the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel (TC) chemotherapy is
      therapeutically equivalent to the combination of doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride),
      cisplatin and paclitaxel (TAP) chemotherapy with regards to survival.

      II. To determine if estrogen/progesterone receptor status provides prognostic information in
      patients treated with chemotherapy.

      III. To assess whether combination TC chemotherapy is superior to combination TAP
      chemotherapy with regards to toxicity profile, specifically neurotoxicity and infection.

      IV. To measure differences in patient-reported neurotoxicity and quality of life (QOL) among
      the regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with left ventricular
      ejection fraction < 50% at randomization who are initially randomized to Arm I are
      immediately crossed over to Arm II.

      ARM I: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over approximately 15-30
      minutes on day 1, cisplatin IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day
      2, and filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 3-12 or pegfilgrastim SC on day 3.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on
      day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 7 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
