    
      Deiodinase 2 (DIO2) is a selenoenzyme responsible for the deiodination of T4 to T3, which
      makes it crucial for the proper functioning of thyroid hormones. Polymorphisms of DIO2 alters
      the enzymatic function. In addition, the Ala92Ala genotype was reported to be related with a
      reduction in the placental activity of D2, which could worsen gestational complications.

      In the other hand, the TSHβ gene (NC_000001.11) located on chromosome 1 at position 38p12,
      codes for the beta unit of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). It is admitted that genetic
      variants can show a different spectrum of actions.

      This was a clinical, comparative, prospective and transversal study. Pregnant women aged
      18-44 years old, were invited to identify it they had a DIO2 polymorphism or the TSHβX1
      splice variant.
