      (TKA) at our center. All patients meeting inclusion criteria will be recruited for enrollment
      into the study. Informed consent will be obtained from the patient prior to randomization.

      At that time, each patient will be randomized into one of two groups by an independent staff
      using computer generated randomization and allocation concealment. The two patient groups
      will include:

        1. Study group: patients treated with a medial pivot TKA.

        2. Control group: patients treated with a conventional TKA. Patients will be preoperatively
           assessed and postoperatively at regular intervals (6mo, 12 mo, and then annually) by
           orthopaedic surgeons not involved in the surgeries or cares.
