        -  Assess the prognostic utility of the MGH 2-gene and the GHI 21-gene expression
           signatures in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer treated with tamoxifen
           followed by either placebo or letrozole on clinical trial CAN-NCIC-MA17.

        -  Assess the ability of the MGH 2-gene and the GHI 21-gene expression signatures to
           predict responsiveness to letrozole.

        -  Compare the prognostic utility of quantitative immunofluorescence vs standard
           immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2, tumor
           aromatase, cyclooxygenase-2, GATA-3, and NAT-1 in these patients.

        -  Assess the ability of quantitative immunofluorescence and standard immunohistochemistry
           of these proteins to predict responsiveness to letrozole in these patients.

        -  Use gene discovery from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens to identify
           novel gene expression profiles that may predict outcome and responsiveness to letrozole
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a controlled study.

      Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue samples are analyzed for MGH 2-gene and
      GHI 21-gene expression signatures using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
      Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence are used for analysis of estrogen receptor,
      progesterone receptor, HER-1 and -2, aromatase, GATA-3, NAT-1, and cyclooxygenase-2.
      Microarray hybridization is used to identify novel gene expression signatures.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 957 specimens will be accrued for this study.
