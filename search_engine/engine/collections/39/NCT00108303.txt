      receptor gene is abnormally expressed in people with schizophrenia. The immediate objectives
      of this proposal support the long-term objectives of a comprehensive description of the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia and new drug treatments by carefully defining the
      physiological genotype-phenotype relationship for a single candidate gene. Subjects and
      family members with a mental illness or who appear to have a mental illness will be asked to
      undergo an interview, perform some mental tests and have a blood, urine, and saliva sample
      taken one time.
