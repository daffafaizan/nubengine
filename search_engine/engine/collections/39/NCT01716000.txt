      its active microbicidal ingredient(s) (APIs) throughout the body, derives from the time- and
      space-dependent distribution of the gel itself within the vaginal canal. That distribution
      may also serve as a physical barrier that retards migration of semen-borne HIV virions to
      epithelial surfaces. Within the vagina, the gel creates local physical forces ("stresses")
      against the epithelial surfaces; and its distribution along the canal might be so extensive
      that gel leaks out from the introitus. A woman may have sensations of those stresses and also
      feel gel leakage. Thus, intravaginal microbicide gel distribution is central to both its
      biological functioning (to deliver APIs and also to slow HIV transport) and the behavioral
      perception of it by users (i.e. how it "feels" and whether that experience is pleasurable or
      not). The latter, in turn, can govern acceptability of the gel and adherence to designated
      gel use in clinical trials. This study will characterize and correlate gel distribution and
      women's sensory perceptions and preferences of that distribution, for two relevant volumes (2
      mL and 4 mL) of a current microbicide placebo gel. An optical vaginal imaging device will
      measure gel distribution in the vagina. A computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) survey will
      capture women's perceptions and preferences.
