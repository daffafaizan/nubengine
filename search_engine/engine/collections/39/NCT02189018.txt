      Collectively, the proposed studies will gather data on the role of novel exercise
      interventions in those with PAD who are receiving conservative treatment as well as those who
      have undergone an endovascular intervention for lower extremity arterial disease.

      We hypothesize that patients who undergo an exercise intervention will: A) show improved
      lower extremity perfusion and B) improve their functional ability, compared to a standard
      care control group over 6 months of follow-up. We further hypothesize that these improvements
      are mediated through angiogenesis and increased perfusion of the lower limb, as well as
      improvements in muscle strength, mass, and function.
