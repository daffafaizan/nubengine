    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple
      ascending dose study to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IV PGB and to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and PK of an admixture of IV PGB and a fixed dose of 1300 mg IV
      APAP in healthy adult volunteers.

      Up to 60 subjects will be enrolled into one (1) of six (6) sequential cohorts (n=10 per
      cohort [8 APAP + PGB and 2 placebo]).

      The dose for the first cohort will be 1300 mg APAP and 100 mg PGB. For subsequent cohorts,
      the dose of APAP will remain constant at 1300 mg while the dose of PGB will be varied (will
      start with 100 mg TID and then based on tolerability will be either increased or decreased by
      25 mg) based on Safety Monitoring Committee decision.

      The placebo will be the saline solution.
