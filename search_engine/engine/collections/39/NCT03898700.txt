      injury. A randomized crossover delayed treatment design will be used. Consented caregivers
      will be assigned to one of two groups: coaching via face-to-face and delayed coaching via
      phone. Each caregiver will participate in up to 10 coaching sessions. Each coaching session
      will last up to 90 minutes. Coaching sessions will be audiorecorded for assessment of
      treatment fidelity.
