    
      Duarte galactosemia (DG) is an autosomal recessive genetic condition characterized by partial
      loss of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT), which results in partially impaired
      metabolism of the sugar, galactose, which is abundant in milk and also found at lower levels
      in many other foods. There is currently no consensus on long-term outcome prognosis for
      infants with Duarte galactosemia (DG) and some studies suggest these children might be at
      increased risk for developmental difficulties later in childhood. There is also no conclusive
      data on whether children with Duarte galactosemia (DG) might benefit from dietary restriction
      of galactose. The investigator will be assessing whether 6-12 year old children with Duarte
      galactosemia experience developmental disorders relative to controls, and if so, whether
      dietary exposure to milk in infancy or early childhood is associated with developmental
      outcomes in this patient population.
