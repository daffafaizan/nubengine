      unclear which biopsy strategy offers the highest detection rate for significant PCa. The
      hypothesis of this study is that MR-targeted biopsy improves the detection rates of
      significant prostate cancers compared with systematic TRUS-guided prostate biopsy.

      Men with at least one previously negative TRUS-guided biopsy and persistently elevated PSA
      values (> 4 ng/ml) will be submitted to a multiparametric MR imaging examination of the
      prostate. Subsequently, participants with suspected regions at MR imaging will be randomized
      (1:1) into the two study arms. In study arm A patients will be submitted to MR-targeted
      in-bore prostate biopsy based on the multiparametric MR imaging findings. In study arm B
      patients will be submitted to systematic TRUS-guided prostate biopsy with saturation scheme.
