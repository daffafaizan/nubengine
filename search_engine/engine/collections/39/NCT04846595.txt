      increase their life expectancy. However, these promising results suffer from a very large
      variability within the socio-epidemiological subgroups, and life expectancy at 20 years of
      age is still one third lower than in the general population. Few studies of metropolitan
      cohorts investigated precariousness as an independent risk factor for mortality. The
      investigators chose to consider the vulnerability of people living with HIV (PLWHA) through
      the measurement of a validated French quantitative score, called EPICES (Evaluation of
      precariousness and health inequalities in health examination centers). Using a
      self-administered questionnaire administered during an annual follow-up visit to an
      infectious disease specialist, the investigators seek to define in the alpine arc region in
      france, socio-demographic data associated with greater precariousness among PLWHA.
