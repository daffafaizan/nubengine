      anaesthesia.Various local anaesthetic mixtures can be used to prolong local anaesthesia
      duration and epinephrine , opioids and dexmedetomidine are frequently used for this purpose.
      this study was conducted to compare the effects of adding dexmedetomidine to local
      anaesthetics in the supraclavicular brachial plexus block by using nerve stimulators and
      ultrasonography guided. dexmedetomidine has also been found the prolong the duration of
      bupivacaine infraclavicular brachial plexus block.
