      infection study. Healthy male subjects, 18-55 years of age who fulfil all of the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will be randomly assigned to one of five
      inoculation dosages of a live attenuated diarrheagenic E. coli strain (n=6 per group).
      Subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual pattern of physical activity and their
      habitual food intake, but to reduce and standardize their dietary calcium intake. After a
      standardized evening meal and an overnight fast, subjects will be orally infected on day 14
      and 35 with a live, but attenuated, diarrheagenic E. coli (strain E1392/75-2A; collection
      NIZO food research). Five groups of 6 subjects will be provided one of the following dosages
      at day 14: 1E10 CFU (standard dose); 1E9 CFU; 1E8 CFU; 1E7 CFU or 1E6 CFU of the E.coli
      strain. At study day 35, all subjects will receive a second inoculation of 1E10 CFU of the
      E.coli strain.

      At various time points before and after diarrheagenic E. coli challenges an online diary will
      be kept to record information on stool consistency, frequency and severity of symptoms, and
      blood and stool samples are collected to quantify antibody levels and to quantify fecal
      infection parameters.

      The hypothesis of this pilot study is that the E. coli infection dose at primary inoculation
      determines the outcomes of the protective immune response and the extent of clinical symptoms
      at a secondary inoculation.Therefore the CFA/II-specific IgG antibody response, in relation
      to clinical symptoms, is the main outcome.
