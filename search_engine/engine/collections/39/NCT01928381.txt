    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, two-part study in adults (ages 18-75 years) with Painful
      Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN).

      In Part 1 of the study, eligible subjects will enter a 4-week Pain Training Period. During
      the Pain Training Period, subjects will receive three weekly in-clinic training sessions
      using repeated rating of experimental pressure pain stimuli. Subjects will receive feedback
      during this training and will be evaluated on their pain-reporting ability during each
      in-clinic session. Subjects with acceptable pain-reporting ability at the conclusion of the
      Pain Training Period will be eligible to enter Part 2 of the study. Subjects with
      unacceptable pain-reporting ability at the conclusion of the Pain Training Period will be
      discontinued from the study.

      Part 2 of the study will consist of three consecutive double-blind crossover periods. Each
      crossover period will include 31 days of double-blind treatment. A follow-up visit will occur
      14 Â± 7 days after the last dose of study medication.

      One of three treatments (placebo, pregabalin, or pregabalin + AZD5213) will be administered
      during each crossover treatment period, as determined by a randomly assigned treatment
      sequence.

      Approximately 65 subjects will be screened in Part 1 of the study, in order to randomize up
      to approximately 32 subjects in Part 2 of the study.
