      extensively studied, little research has evaluated the role of attending supervision on
      patient safety and education.

      Investigators conducted a 9-month randomized, cross-over trial on an inpatient medicine
      teaching service where 22 faculty provided either: 1) direct supervision where attendings
      joined work rounds on established (previously admitted) patients or 2) standard supervision
      where attendings were available, but did not join work rounds. Each faculty member
      participated in both arms in random order. The primary safety outcome was rate of medical
      errors. Secondary safety outcomes included deaths and transfers to the intensive care unit.
      Resident education was evaluated via a time motion study to assess resident participation on
      rounds and surveys to measure resident and attending educational ratings.
