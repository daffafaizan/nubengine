      health. Fatty fish, including Atlantic salmon, is an important dietary vitamin D source.
      However, due to a considerable change in fish feed composition, the contribution of vitamin D
      from salmon fillet has been reduced. The aims were to investigate how intake of tailor-made
      salmon affected bone biomarkers, nutritional status (vitamin D, omega-3), as well as body
      composition and bone mineral density (BMD). The 122 healthy postmenopausal women (median 55
      years) included in this 12 weeks intervention study were randomized into four groups: three
      salmon groups (150 grams/two times/week) and one tablet group (800IU vitamin D and 1000 mg
      Calcium/day). The salmon groups also received calcium supplements (1000 mg/d). The salmon had
      three different vitamin D3/vitamin K1 combinations: high D3 + high K1, low D3 + high K1, or
      high D3 + low K1.
