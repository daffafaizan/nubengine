    
      Purpose: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of moderate daily
      alcohol consumption on hepatic glucose uptake and peripheral glucose storage. Secondly, the
      effect of moderate alcohol consumption on gastric emptying and postprandial wellness will be
      studied. These effects will be studied in apparently healthy, lean or overweight young men.

      Design: Randomized, partially diet-controlled, placebo controlled cross-over design.

      Subjects: Healthy male lean and obese volunteers aged between 18 and 40 years (n=18).

      Intervention: During 2 periods of 21 days either white wine or white grape juice has to be
      consumed with the evening meal. The last 7 days of each period will be fully dietary
      controlled.

      Treatment A: 375 ml of white wine (35 g alcohol) per day Treatment B: 375 ml of white grape
      juice per day

      Measures:

        -  Glucose metabolism: glucose uptake and peripheral glucose storage (measurement of
           isotopic enriched plasma glucose levels.

        -  Gastric emptying and postprandial wellness.

        -  Postprandial glycemic response and related factors (glucose, insulin, lactate, FFA,
           glucagon, ghrelin, CCK, GIP, GLP-1, PYY, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL
           cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, paracetamol (absorption test)
