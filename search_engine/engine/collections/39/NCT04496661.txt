      with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)
      guidelines. Sixty participants with chronic low back pain will be randomized into one of
      three tDCS groups associated with PES: motor primary cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      and sham stimulation. Each group will receive transcranial direct current stimulation at an
      intensity of 2 mA for 30 minutes daily for 10 consecutive days. Participants will be assessed
      with a Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Medical
      Outcomes Study 36-item Short - Form Health Survey (SF-36) and electromyography at baseline,
      endpoint (after 10 sessions) and 1-month follow up. This study will help to clarify the
      additive effects of tDCS combined with peripheral electrical stimulation on pain relief,
      muscle function and improvement in quality of life. Additionally, the investigators will
      provide data to identify optimal targets for management of chronic low back pain.
