        1. Can group differences among behavioural outcomes be explained through a mediation model?
           Hypothesis: The covariance of the assigned conditions (habit formation, planning +
           education, education control) on child PA will be explained by parental co-activity
           habit, and through the use of consistency and cues regulation strategies (i.e.,
           manipulation check). The habit formation condition will not affect parental support
           intentions or underlying outcome expectations (benefits of PA) for support of child PA
           because its effect on behavior is to tie initial intentions to behavioural action or to
           work independent of goals and intentions.

        2. Do factors such as quality of life, parental competence, and family functioning improve
           with increased PA? Hypothesis: Conditions that increase PA will show commensurate
           increases in these factors.

        3. Is there an intergenerational, seasonal, or gender difference across primary outcomes by
           assigned condition? Hypothesis: Parents in the habit formation condition will show
           higher PA via the activities being performed with their children in comparison to the
           other conditions. No differences in gender or season are hypothesized based on the
           current research at present
