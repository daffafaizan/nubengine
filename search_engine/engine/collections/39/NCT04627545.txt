      normal sperm parameters, are eligible for the study. An electronically generated
      randomization list will allocate the first half of the oocytes to one arm and the other half
      of the oocytes to the second arm. In case an odd number of oocytes will be inseminated, one
      extra oocyte will be allocated to the first arm. In this prospective observational pilot
      study, the fertilization potential of 40 patients will be evaluated.
