    
      Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to Cohort A or Cohort B. Each cohort will undergo 3
      nasal challenges, each separated by 3 weeks. Cohort A will undergo 2 nasal allergen
      challenges, and 1 nasal diluent challenge. TNSS, PNIF, spirometry, and samples of blood,
      urine and nasal secretions will be collected until 24h post-challenge to assess
      reproducibility. Cohort B will undergo 3 nasal allergen challenges; one of the challenge will
      be conducted after 14 days treatment with placebo, and one challenge will be conducted after
      14 days treatment with triamcinolone acetonide aqueous nasal spray at a dose of 220 mcg
      administered twice daily for a total daily dose of 440 mcg. TNSS, PNIF, spirometry, and
      samples of blood, urine, nasal secretions will be collected until 24h post-challenge to
      determine reproducibility, and nasal tissue will be collected 24h post-challenge to determine
      effect of steroid treatment.
