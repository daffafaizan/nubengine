      consist of questions developed by Bayer and submitted to the Steering Committee of the
      existing registry, ATHN-2. Once enrolled to participate in the ATHN-2 registry and provided
      consent to participate in the Bayer nested study, patients who have switched from another
      product to Kovaltry or Jivi within the past 50 weeks or at the time of enrollment will be
      prompted to answer the additional survey questions.

      Conclusion of the ATHN-2 registry is scheduled for 2021. Once data is cleaned and locked by
      the registry, the data will be delivered to Bayer for conduct of our analyses.
