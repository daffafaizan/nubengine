    
      Study consists of 3 cohorts (12 to 23 months, 24 to 35 months, and 36 to 47 months). Within
      each cohort subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ration to receive one of three dose levels of
      FMP1/AS02A (Cohort A, 10 ug; Cohort B, 25 ug; Cohort C, 50 ug) or Imovax Rabies vaccine.
      Immunization was staggered among dose cohorts; subjects in Cohort B received their first
      immunization only after the Local Medical Monitor and Data Safety Monitoring Board reviewed
      Cohort A safety data for the eight-day follow-up period following their first immunization.
      The same procedure was followed for the immunization of Cohort C. This will be conducted in
      western Kenya a the Walter Reed Project Lumbewa Clinic.
