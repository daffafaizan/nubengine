      virus transmission and disease progression, Tat represents a key target protein for the host
      immune response and an optimal candidate for such a vaccination strategy.

      Preclinical studies demonstrated that vaccination with a biologically active Tat protein is
      safe, elicits a broad and specific immune response and induces a long-term protection against
      infection. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in natural infection suggest that the
      presence of an anti-Tat humoral immune response correlates with asymptomatic infection and
      with a slower disease progression while the presence of CD8+ T cell responses to Tat
      correlate with early virus control both in humans and monkeys. Since the immunogenic regions
      of Tat are well conserved among the HIV-1 M group, a vaccine based on Tat may be used in
      different geographic areas of the world.

      This Phase I study was directed at evaluating the safety profile (as a primary end-point) and
      the immunogenicity (as a secondary end-point) of the recombinant HIV-1 Tat vaccine in HIV-1
      infected adult volunteers with mild immune deficiency (Clinical category A according to CDC),
      CD4+ T cell counts 400/mL and levels of plasma viremia < 50,000 copies/mL.

      Study Design: Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Safety/Immunogenicity Study.
