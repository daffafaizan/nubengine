      1136 patients with echocardiographic studies, 14.7% of the patients were diagnosed with
      patent arterial duct. The PDA is an abnormal communication between the aorta and pulmonary
      artery. Untreated it can rise the intrapulmonary pressure and lead to serious complications
      like cardiac insufficiency.

      The incidence of ducts as an isolated heart disease is between 3.6 and 7% of all congenital
      heart diseases at sea level, and 10 - 14% at high altitude; rising up to 20% in cities at
      more than 2.500 m about sea level. The ducts at high altitude are generally wider and larger
      than at sea level.

      One treatment alternative is a percutaneous transluminal implantation of a permanent implant
      which closes the defect. The device under investigation "Nit-OccludÂ® PDA-R" is developed for
      closure of the PDA with a minimal diameter of 2-8 mm.

      The device performs the function of generating the defect occlusion by the body itself. The
      implant stimulates the body to generate an epithelium over the implant so that the PDA
      closes.
