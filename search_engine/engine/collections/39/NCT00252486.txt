      a predominant mood state of irritability, and often mixed, rapid-cycling, and psychotic
      symptoms. Results of randomized controlled trials of lithium, valproic acid, and
      antipsychotics for early onset bipolar disorder offer hope of improvement for many, yet also
      demonstrate need for additional treatment options for those children who do not respond
      adequately to, or cannot tolerate, a first-line mood stabilizer alone or in combination with
      an atypical antipsychotic. As popular over-the-counter dietary supplements, omega-3 fatty
      acids represent an appealing option for treatment in the younger bipolar population as they
      are likely to be better tolerated and cost less compared with conventional mood stabilizing
      agents. In addition, they have appeal to parents and adolescents due to their perception as a
      'natural' substance and relative lack of systemic side effects. To our knowledge, there are
      no prospective, randomized, controlled trials of flax oil for the treatment of bipolar
      disorder or selectively evaluating omega-3 fatty acids in the child and adolescent bipolar
      population.

      Children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with symptomatic Bipolar I or II disorder (n=51),
      manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressed, were randomized to either flax oil capsules containing
      550 mg alpha-linolenic acid per 1 gram or an olive oil placebo adjunctively or as
      monotherapy. Doses were titrated to 12 capsules per day as tolerated over 16 weeks. Primary
      outcomes included changes in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Child Depression Rating
      Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), and Clinical Global Impressions- Bipolar (CGI-BP) ratings using
      Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Baseline and end-of-study free fatty acids were measured and
      examined for change and relevance to effect.
