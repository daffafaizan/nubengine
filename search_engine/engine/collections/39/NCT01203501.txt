      hemorrhage (IVH) in extremely premature infants of mothers given magnesium sulfate (MgSO4)
      may be reduced. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of MgSO4 exposure on
      adverse outcomes in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. For infants included in the
      NICHD Neonatal Research Network Generic Database, data were prospectively collected on
      maternal/infant conditions and MgSO4 exposure (including indications, timing and duration of
      exposure).
