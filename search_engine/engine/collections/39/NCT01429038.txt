      administration after liver or kidney organ transplantation. Ten patients undergoing liver
      transplantation and 10 patients undergoing kidney transplantation will be included in the
      experimental arm to receive a single infusion of MSC. The outcome of each of these 2
      subgroups will be compared with that of similar control patients undergoing liver or kidney
      transplantation but who will not receive MSC.

      Liver and kidney transplanted patients will receive standard immunosuppressive therapy,
      TAC-MMF-steroïds and TAC-MMF-steroïds plus an IL-2-R antibody respectively. Patients enrolled
      in the experimental arms will be infused with a single dose of 1,5-3,0 10E6 MSC/kg, 3(+/-2)
      days after the transplantation.

      Weaning of immunosuppression will be attempted from month 6 in liver transplant patients who
      did not present a rejection episode and show normal graft function and graft biopsy.

      Kidney transplant patients will continue standard immunosuppressive therapy indefinitely.

      Male or female (>18 years) individuals unrelated to the recipient or the graft donor will be
      MSC donors. MSC donors need to fulfill generally accepted criteria for allogeneic HSC
      donation.
