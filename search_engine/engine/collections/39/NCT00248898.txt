      years, it is 6.3 years (US Bureau of Census 2000). There are currently 1.6 million
      nonagenarians and roughly 72,000 centenarians living in the United States. With this
      increasing elderly population, knowledge of the special management issues and long-term
      sequela are imperative. Bacchetta and coworkers from our institution presented a 10-year
      outcomes experience in nonagenarians undergoing cardiac surgery. In 42 consecutive patients,
      in-hospital mortality was 7%, and 30-day mortality 5%. Postoperative morbidity was documented
      in 67% with arrhythmias accounting for 31% of the cases, followed by respiratory
      complications, infections, and strokes. While this is mostly in-hospital data, long-term
      follow-ups have not been performed.
