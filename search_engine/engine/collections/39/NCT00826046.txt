      GVHD expanded access of Prochymal. It is anticipated that a maximum of 10 patients per month
      for a total of 120 patients per year will be treated according to this protocol.

      Patients will be treated with Prochymal twice per week at a dose of 2 x 106 human mesenchymal
      stem cell (hMSC)/kg (actual body weight) for each of 4 consecutive weeks. Infusions will be
      administered at least 3 days apart.
