      cancers are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and occur in the setting of cirrhosis of the
      liver. Body fat and systemic inflammation are determinants of HCC risk. Cirrhotic patients
      with HCC are often treated with locoregional therapies including transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) as a bridge to liver transplantation. Despite this, HCC recurrence
      rates approach 80%. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest the benefit of exercise in
      cancer patients. Exercise decreases disease recurrence and improves survival in other primary
      cancers by altering tumor biology and influencing response to treatment. Although animal
      models suggest biologic plausibility, whether or not exercise prevents HCC recurrence in
      cancer patients remains unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the effect of
      exercise to delay or avert HCC recurrence and gain information regarding the potential
      molecular mechanisms of HCC tumor inhibition by exercise.
