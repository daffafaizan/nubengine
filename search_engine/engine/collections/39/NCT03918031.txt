    
      The primary goal of the research study is to investigate the efficacy of a brief,
      personalized computer-delivered transdiagnostic intervention (PFI) that addresses smoking and
      distress tolerance to reduce smoking, increase quit attempts, reduce perceived barriers to
      cessation, increase distress tolerance, reduce anxiety/depressive symptoms, and increase
      adaptive coping skills compared to a personalized feedback on smoking only control. To
      address this aim, the investigators will implement a randomized controlled trial that will
      employ a longitudinal experimental design and involve four stages: (a) phone-screener
      (pre-screener); (b) baseline appointment consisting of a pre-intervention assessment
      (eligibility), random assignment to a one-session computer-delivered intervention (Active PFI
      versus Control PFI with no personalized feedback on distress tolerance), and a
      post-intervention assessment; (c) 2-week follow-up; (d) 1-month follow-up. Assessments will
      include a multi-method approach, including biological, behavioral, and self-report methods.
