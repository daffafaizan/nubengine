      our program of outpatient detoxification and naltrexone induction followed by a
      relapse-prevention treatment with Extended release-naltrexone (XR-NTX) . Eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to adjunctive treatment with lorcaserin (N = 40), or
      placebo (N = 20) with weekly therapy. Lorcaserin or placebo 10 mg bid will be started on Day
      1 of the study to address acute withdrawal, then maintained over the next 5 weeks, and
      stopped after the second XR-naltrexone is administered. Patients will be seen twice weekly
      for monitoring and offered two injections of naltrexone; at the end of oral naltrexone
      induction (end of week 1) and four weeks later (week 5). The primary outcome measures will be
      the proportion of patients successfully inducted onto XR-naltrexone.
