      and effectiveness of an investigational treatment to learn whether the treatment works in
      treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the treatment is being studied.

      MK-3475 is a humanized monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in
      the body in response to a foreign substance (particles not typically found in the body such
      as bacteria or viruses). Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection.
      Antibodies can also be produced in the laboratory for use in treating patients. MK-3475 is
      designed to restore the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target cancer
      cells.

      The FDA recently granted approval to MK-3475 as a treatment for patients with recurrent or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study is testing whether using
      radiation in combination with MK-3475 will make this drug work better in participants that
      might otherwise be unlikely to benefit from this drug because they have not responded to
      either this same drug given without radiation or another similar drug.
