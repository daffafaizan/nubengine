      problems fastest growing globally. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)
      is estimated to have diabetes approximately 382 million people in the world. It is shown that
      early interventions in lifestyle can reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes and factors of
      cardiovascular modifiable risk.

      This is an intervention study in cluster. 36-month integrated into 4 phases:

        1. Design and adaptation of educational intervention

        2. Population Screening

        3. Stepwise intervention program

        4. Evaluation results.

      For population screening test FINDRISC validated for the Latin American population will be
      employed and a score of 12 will be considered as a cutoff to all who have a score equal to or
      greater than 12 (moderate or high risk) they perform a test oral glucose tolerance (OGTT)
      according to the results 3 groups will be established

        -  High risk group: Subjects with FINDRISC score ≥12 and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)

        -  Moderate risk group: Subjects with FINDRISC score ≥12 and impaired fasting glucose or
           norm tolerant

        -  Low risk group: Subjects with FINDRISC score <12.

      Intervention program: One year of duration, 3 types of programs are established.

        -  Lifestyle Intervention program_ Communitarian: Intervention program at Community level
           with Low risk group.

        -  Lifestyle Intervention program_ Informative: Program information intervention for the
           group with moderate risk.

        -  Lifestyle Intervention program_ structured: intervention program for members of
           high-risk group.

      An evaluation of the different variables are studied at baseline and the final of the
      intervention in the three groups established.
