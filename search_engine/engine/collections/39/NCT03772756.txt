      of the advances in management of cancers in the last few decades. Endobiliary application of
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been developed in our unit and used in patients with
      unresectable bile duct and pancreatic head adenocarcinomas presenting with biliary
      obstruction. Various techniques of EUS-guided tumour ablation have been described, including
      RF ablation, photodynamic therapy, laser ablation, and ethanol injection. Endoscopic
      ultrasound guided RFA (EUS-RFA) of the pancreatic head using Habib EUS-RFA catheter through a
      19-gauge needle was well tolerated in 5 Yucatan pigs and with minimum amount of pancreatitis
      .
