      trial in periodontally healthy adult volunteers (no clinical attachment loss and bleeding on
      probing < 10%). We will include all eligible patients seeking dental treatment at the center
      after gaining a written informed consent. After the initial dental screening and a session of
      professional teeth cleaning procedures, participants will be instructed to refrain from
      regular oral hygiene practices for 2 weeks to develop experimental gingivitis. Participants
      will then be randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups [1:1:1] using a simple
      randomization method (i.e. computer-generated random numbers). They will be instructed to
      continue refrain from regular oral hygiene practices and use 10 ml of the assigned mouthwash
      twice daily for 1 minute. Treatment effect will be evaluated by comparing the baseline (day
      0) and post-intervention (day 14) values of all clinical parameters (modified gingival index,
      plaque index, proinflammatory interleukin-1Î² biomarker, and Gingival Bleeding Index).
