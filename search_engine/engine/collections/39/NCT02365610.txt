      described in this record.

      Subjects who satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will enter a four-week
      baseline period, followed by a two-week dose escalation period (400 mg twice daily for one
      week, then 600 mg twice daily for one week), a six-week stable treatment period (800 mg twice
      daily) and a 12-day taper period. Subjects will be required to attend eight study visits. A
      follow-up phone call will take place four weeks after last dose.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive in a 1:1 ratio, GWP42006 or placebo. Subjects will be
      required to record a daily diary with information about their seizures, investigational
      medicinal product (IMP) and concomitant antiepileptic drug (AED) administration.
