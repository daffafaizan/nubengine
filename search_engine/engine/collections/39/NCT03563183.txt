    
      As part of the study procedure, each subject enrolled in studies Zoster-006 and Zoster-022
      was asked to complete two quality of life (QoL) questionnaires named respectively SF-36 and
      EQ-5D at predefined study time points. These questionnaires were to provide relevant
      information about the quality of life (functional status, ability to socialize, mental
      health, etc.) of subjects before they develop shingles Extracting some elements of the
      Quality of Life questionnaires (QoL), EQ-5D and SF-36, completed by all study subjects at
      baseline, and combining them with other medical history data allows attributing of frailty
      scores.

      Analyses pertaining to efficacy, safety and immunogenicity as per frailty score might be
      performed according to the methodology used in the ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 studies.

      Additionally, the data collected can be used to assess if some physical, physiological and/or
      psychological characteristics reported by the subjects before the onset of HZ would be
      predictive of HZ.
