    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate absence of proven, probable, possible, suspected
      invasive fungal disease (IFDs) through the end of prophylaxis therapy and during 4 weeks
      after stopping of micafungin prophylaxis after Autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation in pediatric and adolescent neutropenia patients. Patients will receive
      micafungin until the earliest of the following: 1) neutrophil engraftment; 2) development of
      proven, provable, possible or suspected invasive fungal disease; 3) development of
      unacceptable drug toxicity; 4) withdrawal from study participation or discontinuation of
      study treatment. Safety profile of micafungin is also evaluated.
