      There are two main purposes of the study The first is to study the diet and heath of persons
      with intellectual disabilities. The second is to increase their knowledge on nutrition and
      health and that of service providers in municipalities housing facilities and to test, in an
      intervention, the effects of a method for weight reduction in adult persons with intellectual
      disabilities with overweight and obesity. Physical activity is also an important factor in
      weight reduction, but this study focuses only on nutrition, to obtain new information on this
      one factor in weight reduction. A combined study with many changes in a short period of time
      is very challenging for the group in question.

      The vision is that results from this study will lead to improved health promotive and
      preventive services in the municipality in the future, to adult persons with intellectual
      disabilities and that this study also can have effects on services also for other groups,
      such as those with the fields of psychiatry and drug problems.
