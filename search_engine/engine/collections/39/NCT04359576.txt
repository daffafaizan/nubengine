      estrogen/progesterone substitution during artificial cycle frozen embryo transfer (AC-FET) in
      assisted reproductive technology treatment (ART). An activation of the coagulation might
      induce an increased thromboembolic risk in these women. Thus, the present study may lead to
      improvement of the current treatment protocol for women receiving AC-FET and ultimately
      prevent thromboembolic complications for woman in fertility treatment.
