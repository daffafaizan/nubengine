      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of using reinforced lithium silicate
      endocrowns on the recurrent caries, patient satisfaction and retention in comparison to post
      retained reinforced lithium silicate crowns.

      The study is held to evaluate recurrent caries,patient satisfaction and retention of
      endodontically treated teeth restored with Endocrowns versus Post Retained Crowns using
      Reinforced Lithium Silicate after one year follow up .

      The clinical performance of ceramic endocrowns showed a survival rate of 99 % and the success
      rate of 89.9 % in a 10 year retrospective study done by Bellflamme et al. 2017.

      Endocrowns; a recently developed line of treatment, take the advantage of the rapidly growing
      discipline of adhesion to glass ceramics. As the retention and recurrent caries are decisive
      factors in the prognosis of a restoration' they have to be thoroughly investigated.

      Patients with endodontically treated lower first molars will be collected.after teeth
      preparation to receive endocrowns and crowns ,secondary impressions will be taken .The
      Patients will be divided randomly into two groups .One group will receive reinforced Lithium
      Silicate Endocrowns (intervention)and the other group will receive reinforced Lithium
      Silicate Crowns (control) retained with fiber posts.
