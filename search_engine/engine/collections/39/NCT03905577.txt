      execution. Action observation training consists of watching an action performed by someone
      else. Both motor imagery and action observation have been shown to produce a
      neurophysiological activation of the brain areas related to the planning and execution of
      voluntary movement in a manner that resembles how the action is performed in reality.

      Both motor imagery and action observation are interventions that can generate adaptive
      neuroplastic changes on a cortical level, leading to a decrease in chronic pain. These
      rehabilitation techniques are used in pain treatment and impaired movement injuries that
      could be due to a nervous system alteration.

      The effectiveness of motor imagery is controversial; several studies have presented
      unfavorable outcomes from this technique. Some variables, such as the duration of the
      sessions, the time employed the type of motor task or the number of sessions can influence
      the outcomes of these studies. Thus, it is necessary to clarify the controversial aspects of
      motor imagery, which lead us to perform this study.
