      will perform a door-to-door survey of all Atahualpa residents aged â‰¥ 40 years. These persons
      will be eligible for being screened with standardized questionnaires to identify those with
      suspected stroke or ischemic heart disease, and to evaluate their cardiovascular health
      (CVH). Persons will be directly interviewed unless aphasic or mentally impaired; in such
      cases, relatives or caregivers will answer the questions. We plan to use the epidemiologic
      method of capture-recapture to enhance the detection of all possible cases of stroke and
      ischemic heart disease [13]. So, besides the door-to-door survey, we will review the medical
      records from the only one health center of Atahualpa, as well as the original files of our
      survey performed in 2003 at the same village [12].

      In Phase II, certified neurologists and cardiologists will move to Atahualpa to examine all
      individuals who screened as suspected cases of stroke or ischemic heart disease. In addition,
      a random sample of 2% of individuals who were considered negative during the screening phase
      (matched by age and gender to suspected cases) will also undergo a complete neurologic and
      cardiologic examination to assess possible false negative cases during the survey. In Phase
      III, all patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke and ischemic heart disease will be
      invited to undergo further examination in Guayaquil.
