      Similarly, reductions in BP are associated with protection against AD. Treatment with
      antihypertensive medications, specifically angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I)
      such as ramipril, is associated with up to a 55% reduction in the prevalence of AD,
      suggesting a potentially promising role for ACE-I in the prevention of AD. It is unknown
      however 1) whether ACE-Is will have the same effect on Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ levels in
      humans as in animal models 2) whether ACE-Is induce changes associated with vascular function
      (i.e. levels of CSF angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and peripheral endothelial function)
      and 3) whether there are interactions between ACE-I-induced changes in CSF Aβ, CSF ACE and
      indices of vascular function.

      One mechanism by which antihypertensives may protect against AD is via Aβ neuropathology. In
      order to better understand the mechanisms through which ACE-I may modify CSF Aβ and possibly
      AD risk, we propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial,
      enrolling 20 middle-aged (age range 40 - 65 years), mildly hypertensive (between 130 - 160
      mmHg mean systolic and between 85 - 100 mmHg mean diastolic) participants, who are adult
      children of an individual with AD. The main objective of this trial is to examine the effects
      of the ACE-I, ramipril, on 1) CSF Aβ levels 2) CSF ACE levels and 3) peripheral endothelial
      function as measured by brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) and aortic
      augmentation index (AAIx), in middle-aged adults with mildly elevated BP, who are at
      increased risk of developing AD.
