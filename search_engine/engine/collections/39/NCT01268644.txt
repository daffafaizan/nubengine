      near-death, insulin deficient diabetic rodents. This makes leptin the only hormone, since the
      discovery of insulin in 1922, with this capability. Leptin normalizes the hyperglucagonemia
      of diabetes and reduces lipogenesis and cholesterologenenesis. Treatment of diabetic rodents
      with a combination of leptin and insulin, leads to a stable pattern of glucose control with
      reduced insulin requirements, as opposed to the high glucose variability that characterizes
      the treatment of type 1 diabetes with supraphysiologic doses of insulin alone. As such, we
      will initiate a pilot clinical trial to test combination leptin and insulin therapy in type 1
      diabetes. Fifteen leptin sensitive patients (body mass index <27 kg/mÂ²) with uncontrolled
      diabetes (HbA1c 7.0 to 10.0 %) will be treated with slightly supraphysiologic doses of
      recombinant human leptin (Amylin Pharmaceuticals). Subjects will be compared to themselves
      before and after treatment with leptin. Endpoint variables include HbA1c, change in daily
      insulin dose, mean and standard deviation of blood glucose from inpatient glucose monitoring
      and glucose meter download. We will also assess effects of leptin therapy on energy intake as
      assessed by 3-day food record and body weight and fat by DEXA. Intramyocellular and
      intrahepatic lipid concentration by 1H-MRS will be assessed before and after 3 months of
      metreleptin therapy. A satiety analysis will be employed. In addition, plasma hormones and
      inflammatory biomarkers will be assayed during the course of this study.
