      risk factors and the anesthetic management will be recorded in the computerized
      pre-anesthetic evaluation.

      A qualitative and quantitative ultrasound evaluation will be performed when the patient
      arrives in the pre-anesthesia room. The examination will be performed in the right lateral
      decubitus with a low frequency convex ultrasound probe.

      The main objective is to measure the prevalence of patients with a "full stomach" based on
      ultrasound criteria.

      The primary endpoint is the presence of solid or fluid greater than 1.5 ml / kg of the
      predicted ideal body weight during ultrasonographic evaluation of gastric contents. In this
      situation, the patient will be considered at high risk of inhalation (considered full
      stomach).

      This study will observe and record any anesthetic changes (ie : airway management) secondary
      to this ultrasouund assessment of gastric contents.
