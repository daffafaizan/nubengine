      following treatments and the recurrent diseases are less responsive to new treatments,
      detecting local/regional recurrence at an earlier time is crucial in order to provide salvage
      treatments. The primary objective of this prospective study is to compare the diagnostic
      accuracy of FDG PET/CT to FDG PET/MRI in the detection of local recurrence 12 weeks after the
      end of chemoradiation treatment in HNSCC patients. The hypothesis is that PET/MRI might be
      able to diagnose locoregional recurrence earlier and more accurately which would lead to a
      better outcome for the patient. If it is proven correct, it would be possible to optimize the
      use of PET/MRI imaging on selected patients who are likely to benefit clearly from the use of
      that modality.

      Forty patients aged more than 18 years who have a histologically confirmed HNSCC and have
      received chemoradiation therapy will be recruited for the study. The patients will be scanned
      with both FDG-PET/CT and FDG-PET/MRI 12 weeks after the end of CRT.

      All study participants will be consented, and the estimated time for completing the PET scans
      of 40 patients will take 12 to 15 months. The results will be reported in international
      peer-reviewed high-impact journals.
