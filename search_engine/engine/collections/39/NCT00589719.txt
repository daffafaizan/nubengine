      public health concern in Arkansas. Arkansas, a predominately rural state, has one of the
      leading mortality rates in the nation for African Americans. The specific aims of the study
      will examine asthma prevalence in children age 4-17 years old in public schools in Eudora and
      Marvell Arkansas. The study will also examine asthma morbidity among identified asthmatics by
      characterizing activity limitation, days missed from school, daytime and nocturnal symptoms,
      healthcare utilization and medication use. The specific aims of the current study will
      provide novel data on an understudied population of asthmatics and will test our working
      hypotheses that pediatric asthma prevalence in the Delta region of Arkansas is higher than
      national estimates; and asthma diagnosis is related to significant morbidity among rural
      asthmatics.
