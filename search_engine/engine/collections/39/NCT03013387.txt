      somatostatin receptor positive tumors. The somatostatin receptor targeting of the therapeutic
      will be checked with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT imaging prior to therapy. Treatment consists of 3
      cycles, 6-8 weeks apart. Cycle 1 dose is fixed with Cycles 2 and 3 doses to be determined by
      dosimetry-based calculation of renal doses from previous cycles not to exceed 23 Gy for the
      total renal dose.

      The goals of the project are to

        1. Demonstrate safety and efficacy of renal uptake dosimetry-guided peptide receptor
           radiotherapy (PRRT) using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) in patients with
           neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.

        2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using
           90Y-DOTATOC.

        3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) PET/CT as an accurate technique for
           diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.
