    
      This will be a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial with two treatment
      cohorts. Cohort 1 will consist of patients with closed peritrochanteric femur fractures who
      undergo open reduction internal fixation with a Stryker© Gamma™ cephalomedullary nail using
      traditional fluoroscopy for insertion of the lag screw. Cohort 2 will consist of patients
      with closed peritrochanteric femur fractures who undergo open reduction internal fixation
      with a Stryker© Gamma™ cephalomedullary nail using the Stryker© ADAPT™ platform to assist
      with insertion of the lag screw. Patients will be blinded to treatment group allocation as
      will clinicians/researchers during data processing and analysis.

      The primary outcome will be tip-apex distance, as measured on anteroposterior and lateral hip
      radiographs. Secondary outcomes will be position of the lag screw as described by Cleveland
      et al, operative time, fluoroscopy time, and number of Kirschner wire passes prior to final
      placement of the lag screw. Additionally, evidence of lag screw cutout on hip radiographs,
      hip range of motion relative to the contralateral hip, overall mobility, social dependency,
      and pain level will be assessed at 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year follow up visits.
