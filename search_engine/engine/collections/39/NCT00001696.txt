      low incidence of metastatic prostate cancer. Genistein is a known protein-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, and in preclinical studies it has been shown to increase cell adhesion. Increases
      in cell adhesion in vivo would phenotypically reverse the first step in the metastatic
      cascade, potentially preventing metastasis formation, and is consistent with epidemiologic
      findings. This study seeks to determine the pharmacokinetics of genistein in humans by
      administering a single dose of genistein and performing a pharmacokinetic analysis. Patients
      will be treated with two formulations of genistein (a 43% genistein preparation or a 90%
      preparation). This is a phase I study, and patients will be treated on one of three dosing
      levels. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive one formulation first, followed by a
      washout period, and will then receive the second preparation (i.e., a randomized cross over
      design). Information from this study will be used to optimally design a multiple dose study
      wherein patients will be treated for longer periods of time. The duration of this study is
      estimated to be about 4 weeks long for each patient.
