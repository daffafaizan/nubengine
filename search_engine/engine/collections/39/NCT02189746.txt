      with existing World Health Organization (WHO) thermoregulation care (warm delivery rooms,
      immediate drying after birth, KMC whenever possible, early and exclusive breastfeeding,
      postponement of bathing and weighing, appropriate bundling, and use of air incubator, radiant
      warmer, or heat mattress if the neonate develops hypothermia) will reduce the incidence of
      moderate hypothermia (32-36 degrees C) or severe hypothermia (<32.0 degrees C) in preterm
      infants (32-36 6/7 weeks of gestational age) when compared with routine WHO thermoregulation
      alone.
