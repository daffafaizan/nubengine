    
      Patients undergoing decompressive craniectomy and delayed reimplantation of the cryoconserved
      autologous bone flap are included in a clinical and image-based follow-up to identify cases
      and severity of bone flap resorption.

      The explanted autologous bone flaps are cryoconserved and reimplanted at a time-point defined
      by the surgeon according to standards of the participating hospital. The fixation of the bone
      flap is also performed according to the surgeon's decision.

      A cranial CT is performed within one week after reimplantation to define a baseline.

      A second, only clinical, follow-up will take place within 2 months after reimplantation.

      Two more follow-ups including photodocumentation of the cranial and facial symmetry (portrait
      and profile) and cranial CT will take place 12 and 24 months after reimplantation.

      The indication for surgical revision in case of bone flap resorption is independent from the
      study and falls under the responsibility of the treating surgeon.
