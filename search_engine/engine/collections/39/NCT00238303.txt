      I. Determine the efficacy of vorinostat (SAHA), in terms of 6-month progression-free
      survival, in patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the biologic
      effect of this drug in target tissues, including primary tumor tissue, in these patients.

      III. Correlate genetic alteration of tumors with response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      planned surgery (yes [stratum 1] vs no [stratum 2]) and number of prior chemotherapy regimens
      for progressive/recurrent disease (≤ 1 [stratum 1A] vs ≥ 2 [stratum 1B]).

      STRATUM 1: Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) twice daily for 2 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (not undergoing
      surgery)

      STRATUM 2: Beginning 3 days prior to surgery, patients receive oral SAHA once or twice daily
      for a total of 6 doses. Patients then undergo surgery to remove the tumor. Beginning within
      1-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive oral SAHA twice daily for 2 weeks. (undergoing
      surgery)

      Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
