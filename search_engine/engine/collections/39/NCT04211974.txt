      astrocytoma represent the most common intramedullary tumor. Although intramedullary
      astrocytoma is rare, it can cause significant mortality and morbidity. Different from its
      intracranial counterpart which can receive gross total resection and standard adjuvant
      treatment, intramedullary astrocytoma always cannot be removed completed due to its
      infiltrative nature and, additionally, radiotherapy and chemotherapy is controversial.
      Therefore, the treatment for this tumor is very limited. While the genetic profiling of
      intracranial astrocytoma is relatively well understood and standard treatment strategy has
      been developed, genetic alteration of intramedullary astrocytoma is less well understood.
      Identification of the molecular profiling can lead to well understanding of the
      pathophysiological mechanisms underlying intramedullary astrocytoma and more effective
      therapeutic strategy in future. Hence, we performed this study aiming to investigate the
      genetic profiling of intramedullary. All patients with intramedullary astrocytoma underwent
      surgery in our institution will be enrolled. Tumor tissue and matching blood will be obtained
      after the surgery. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from these
      specimens. Moreover, demographic information, progress-free survival and overall survival
      will be evaluated in 3 year of follow-up after the initial diagnosis.
