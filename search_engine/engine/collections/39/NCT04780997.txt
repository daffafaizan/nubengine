      fragility and increased fracture likelihood as a result of deterioration of the bone tissue
      microstructure.One of the important conditions determining the fracture risk in osteoporosis
      patients is fall. Balance exercises are perform to reduce the risk of falling.Virtual reality
      games are used in balance studies in many rehabilitation areas. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the effect of virtual reality exercises on balance patients with osteoporozis.
