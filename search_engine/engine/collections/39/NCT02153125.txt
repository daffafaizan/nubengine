    
      -  The goal of the study is to examine the short-term effects and safety of eplerenone, a
           systemic anti-aldosterone medication, in a group of patients with central serous
           chorioretinopathy (CSCR).

        -  There is currently no standard treatment or therapy for chronic CSCR, a potentially
           debilitating eye disease.

        -  There is evidence that high blood serum corticosteroid levels can cause or worsen CSCR

        -  Eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, has been shown to be of visual and
           anatomic benefit in a small series of 4 patients with chronic CSCR, suggesting that
           decreasing mineralocorticoid action in the eye may improve signs and symptoms of CSCR

        -  The study's aim is to evaluate a standardized dose of eplerenone in a controlled
           prospective fashion for chronic CSCR.

        -  The study consists of taking a standard dose of eplerenone, 25mg once daily for a week,
           followed by 50mg once daily, for a total of 3 months

        -  Patients will be monitored for efficacy and side effects from the beginning of treatment
           and for 6 months
