      Using computer for long hours is related to higher risk of computer-related muscular
      disorders like forward head posture and neck pain. Deep cervical flexor muscles are important
      head-on-neck posture stabilizers thus their training may lead to improvement in forward head
      posture (FHP) and neck pain (NP). Aim of study was to determine if 4 weeks of deep cervical
      flexors training is effective in alleviating neck pain and improving forward head posture in
      adolescent children using computer regularly. A pretest-posttest experimental group design
      was used. Subjects were randomly assigned into control group (receiving postural advice only)
      and experimental group (receiving deep cervical flexor training and postural advice).
      Dependent variables were measured on day 0 (at baseline) and after 4weeks of training. The
      photographic analysis was used for measuring forward head posture, visual analog scale (VAS)
      for neck pain intensity and Neck Disability Index (NDI) for functional disability.
      Experimental group received craniocervical flexion training for 4 weeks and postural advice.
      Control group received only postural advice.
