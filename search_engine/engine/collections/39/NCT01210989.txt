      countries. Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of NAFLD
      characterized by ballooning, lobular inflammation and liver fibrosis, have increased
      mortality rate and risk of cardiovascular disease. Besides, some patients progress to
      cirrhosis and may even develop hepatocellular carcinoma. In long-term studies, up to 13% of
      NAFLD patients died of hepatic complications.(1)

      Owing to westernization of lifestyle, NAFLD is also increasing dramatically in Asia. In a
      population screening study in Shanghai using ultrasonography, 15% of adult Chinese was found
      to suffer from NAFLD.(2) Among Chinese patients with NAFLD, significant necroinflammation and
      liver fibrosis are not uncommon.(3-5) These patients also often have progression of liver
      fibrosis with time.(6)

      Since NASH is closely related to type 2 diabetes and obesity, a logical approach would be to
      improve these metabolic parameters.(7, 8) Observational studies suggest that regular exercise
      and weight reduction benefit NASH patients. At present, there is no registered drug for the
      treatment of NASH. Although insulin sensitizers such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone may
      improve the metabolic profile and hepatic necroinflammation,(9, 10) the effects are not
      durable.(11) Weight gain and cardiovascular complications also limit the use of these
      agents.(12, 13) More effective and better tolerated treatment is urgently needed.

      Phyllanthus urinaria (HepaguardÂ®) is commonly used by patients with various chronic liver
      diseases.(14-16) Phyllanthus has excellent safety profile. In in vitro and in vivo models of
      NAFLD, Phyllanthus reduces hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis.(16) Oxidative
      stress and lipid accumulation are ameliorated. Whether the same beneficial effects apply to
      humans is unclear.
