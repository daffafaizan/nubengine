      90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14 in patients with relapsed or refractory non-small cell
      lung cancer. II. Determine the dosimetric and pharmacokinetic properties of this treatment
      regimen in the blood, normal organs, and tumors of these patients. III. Determine the
      stability and complexation with circulating carcinoembryonic antigen of this radioantibody in
      the plasma of these patients. IV. Determine the antibody response of these patients with this
      treatment regimen. V. Determine the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody MN-14
      (90Y-hMN-14). Patients undergo pretherapy imaging with indium In 111 anti-CEA monoclonal
      antibody MN-14 IV over 30-40 minutes on day -7 or -6, followed by external scintigraphy on
      days -7 or -6 to 0. Patients who show positive localization of at least one documented tumor
      site receive 90Y-hMN-14 IV over 30-40 minutes on day 0. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of 90Y-hMN-14 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD
      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks; every 3 months for 2 years; and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
