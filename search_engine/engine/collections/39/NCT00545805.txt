      silastic ring gastric bypass, insulin sensitivity will be studied by the gold-standard test,
      euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, since early postoperative follow-up (before significant
      weight variation), compared to a control group of bariatric surgery (same technique) alone.
      The variables will be analyzed in the post surgical evolution for correlation to metabolic
      changes: adiposity-related hormones and cytokines; lipid profile and other cardiovascular
      risk factors; molecular expression of biopsied subcutaneous adipocytes in vitro;
      anthropometrics; ultrasonography of abdominal subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat depots and
      carotid intima-media thickness (preclinical atherosclerosis evaluation).
