        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin and paclitaxel in patients with
           metastatic or unresectable cancer.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the therapeutic response to this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of this regimen and toxicity and
           response in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of oxaliplatin on peripheral blood cells and correlate this to
           pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours followed by paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for
      4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and paclitaxel until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more
      than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
