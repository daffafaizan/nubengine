        -  Compare the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover that occur in
           premenopausal women with resected early stage breast cancer during and after 6 months of
           adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the factors that predict bone loss during chemotherapy, particularly induction
           of amenorrhea, type of chemotherapeutic regimen, glucocorticoid exposure, and baseline
           BMD, in these patients.

        -  Determine whether zoledronate prevents bone loss in these patients when given during and
           after adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the effect of zoledronate on markers of bone turnover in these patients during
           and after adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Determine whether the effect on markers of bone turnover predicts response to
           zoledronate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative), progesterone
      receptor status (positive vs negative), and adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo IV over 15 minutes on day 1. In both arms, treatment
           repeats every 3 months for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression.
           Patients also receive calcium and cholecalciferol (vitamin D) supplements daily.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.

      Patients are followed at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
