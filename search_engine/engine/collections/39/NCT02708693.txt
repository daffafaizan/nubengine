      randomly assigned to group receiving ultrasound guided steroid injection and group receiving
      ultrasound guided corticosteroid injection and splinting. The steroid injection was using 1ml
      of 10 mg (10mg/ml) triamcinolone acetonide (Shincort) mixed with 1 ml of 2% lidocaine
      hydrochloride (Xylocaine). The inclusion criteria included an age of more than 18 years and
      typical signs of CTS according to American Academy of Neurology criteria lasting for at least
      3 months. The diagnosis of CTS was confirmed by electrophysiological tests.The exclusion
      criteria included the following: presence of thenar atrophy; existence of disorders such as
      hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, or rheumatoid arthritis; any
      accompanying orthopedic or neurologic disorders that could mimic CTS such as cervical
      radiculopathy, polyneuropathy, proximal median nerve entrapment, or thoracic outlet syndrome;
      prior steroid injection into the affected carpal tunnel or carpal tunnel surgery; history of
      distal radius fracture; pregnancy or lactation; regular use of systemic NSAIDs or
      corticosteroids; and known allergy to corticosteroids and local anesthetics.
