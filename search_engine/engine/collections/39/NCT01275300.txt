      contributions of different prostaglandins. The intention is that by better understanding
      these prostaglandins and various metabolites, it will provide insights into their roles in
      the cardiovascular system.

      Prostaglandins and metabolites are naturally occurring substances found in the blood and
      urine which can act as markers which can be quantified and studied as we will be doing in
      this study. Flushing response to niacin will also be assessed by laser doppler measuring
      blood flow of the facial skin.

      Untransformed and transformed data will be subjected to exploratory analysis of variance
      appropriated for a three factor design with one two period crossover factor and two
      non-repeated factors. Additionally, volunteer's test(s) for paired observations will
      characterize the magnitude of the niacin effect on the response variables within selected
      time points.
