      visual performance. However, there exist a vast number of markedly differing visual acuity
      tests worldwide; furthermore there are differing report formats to express acuity. This
      variety may critically interfere with standardization and comparability of this basic visual
      test method.

      Purpose of this study is to investigate the agreement, the test-retest reliability of three
      established and widely used visual acuity tests, i.e., the Early Treatment Diabetic
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity charts, a conventional projected distant visual
      acuity test according to DIN 58220 part 3, and the Freiburg visual acuity test (FrACT), to
      develop a mathematical transformation routine between the results from these three tests, to
      assess the examinees´ and examiners´ acceptance and to compare the test durations.
