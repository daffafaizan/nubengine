      regenerative therapies, with several studies demonstrating successful use for PRP in skin
      rejuvenation. Although PRP is widely used in clinical dermatology, experimental studies
      confirming the effects of PRP on aged fibroblasts are very limited.

      PRP contains concentrated platelet cells derived from autologous whole blood that are
      believed to induce the synthesis of collagen and other matrix components by stimulating the
      activation of fibroblasts, thus rejuvenating the skin when injected into an area of collagen
      degeneration. In this proposal we will examine whether PRP therapy provides similar or better
      rejuvenating capacity in women compared to saline solution. The study will be a randomized,
      controlled trial comparing microneedling with PRP to microneedling with saline solution, in
      females aged 45 and over with skin aging of face. This study will also compare PRP to saline
      (given through injections via filler injection technique) in females with aging skin of the
      hands. Microneedling will not be performed on the hands.
