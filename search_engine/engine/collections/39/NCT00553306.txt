      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in melanoma patients
      using autologous CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific T cell clones.

      II. To evaluate the antitumor effects of CD4+ and CD8+ antigen-specific T cells in patients
      with metastatic melanoma.

      III. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD8+
      antigen-specific T cell clones in the presence or absence of transferred CD4+ T cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the in vivo antitumor efficacy of the infused autologous antigen-specific CD4+ T
      cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I study followed by a phase II study.

      Beginning 48 hours before T-cell infusion, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV. Patients
      then receive antigen-specific CD8+ T cells IV alone or with CD4+ T helper clones over 1-2
      hours on day 0. Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously twice daily on days 0-13.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 8 weeks, and then
      periodically thereafter.
