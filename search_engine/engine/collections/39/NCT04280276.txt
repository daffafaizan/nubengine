      follow-up at the University of Maryland post-transplant clinic with at least 3 levels deemed
      as appropriately 12-hour trough levels within 3-36 months post-transplant.

      Group 1 - patients with high IPV (designated as â‰¥ 30%). Group 2 - patients with normal IPV (<
      30%). Will assess risk of subclinical acute rejection in patients with high IPV compared to
      normal IPV. All tacrolimus 12 h trough levels in patients with stable allograft function at
      least 3 months post-transplant.

      Calculation of IPV: CV (%) = (SD/mean Tac trough concentration) x 100 (if stable total daily
      dose). To take into account dose changes, obtained levels will be corrected for the
      corresponding daily dose of tacrolimus to help correctly calculate IPV (CV C0/D-IPV) (6-7).

      Patients will be tested with TruGraf one time during the study.
