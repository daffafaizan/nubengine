      Primary

        -  Evaluate the time to disease progression in patients with recurrent prostate cancer that
           progressed during androgen-deprivation therapy who are treated with dutasteride.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of dutasteride in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and objective radiographic
           response rate in patients treated with dutasteride.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with dutasteride.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with dutasteride.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dutasteride once daily until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
