    
      A prospective, randomized, multi-center, controlled clinical study of intact extractions
      (bony dehiscences <1/3 socket apico-coronal and mesial-distal dimension) with delayed implant
      placement. Study objective: to compare extraction socket management effectiveness and office
      economics of a frequently used wound dressing (control) with a soft tissue augmentation
      matrix (test) in 32-64 subjects 18 -75 years of age with intact (bony dehiscence, if present,
      < 1/3 socket dimension) extractions intended for dental implant replacement. Following
      screening subjects will undergo tooth extraction and randomization to either the control or
      test therapy. After treatment, subjects will be followed until 4- months, the time of implant
      placement. Primary outcome: soft tissue wound healing measured by (1) gap closure and (2)
      graft containment at all time points.
