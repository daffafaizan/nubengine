      Shaanxi and Hunan) of China, which contains Haiyang city, Rushan city, Shimen County, Chen
      Cang District, Qishan County, Taigu County and Qi County. 6/8 months children were recruited
      in this study, individuals were randomly assigned to experimental group and control group.
      Demographic information (age, sex, height and weight) was made and blood samples were
      collected for each individual in the same way.

      same time, 9 month old EV71 second dose was inoculated, blood samples from the participants
      were collected at 10 month old.

      Control group 1- 8 month old MR first dose was inoculated separately, blood samples from the
      participants were collected at 10 month old; Control group 2 - 8 month old EV71 first doses
      was inoculated, 9 month old EV71 second dose was inoculated, blood samples from the
      participants were collected at 10 month old.

      TestⅣ(JE-L+EV71):

      Experimental group - 8 month old JE-L first dose and EV71 first dose were inoculated at the
      same time, 9 month old EV71 second dose was inoculated, blood samples from the participants
      were collected at 10 month old.

      Control group 1- 8month old JE-L first dose was inoculated separately, blood samples from the
      participants were collected at 10 month old; Control group 2 - 8 month old EV71 first doses
      was inoculated, 9 month old EV71 second dose was inoculated, blood samples from the
      participants were collected at 10 month old.

      Immunogenicity end point Detection of serum antibody EV71 vaccine by culture neutralization
      test, the definition of positive for neutralizing antibody titers of <1:8 before inoculation,
      inoculation after neutralizing antibody titers than 1:8; or before inoculation neutralizing
      antibody titer is above 1:8, the titer of neutralizing antibody after vaccination appeared
      more than 4 times the growth.

      Hepatitis B vaccine seroconversion was defined as Anti-HBs<10mIU/ml before inoculation,
      Anti-HBs after inoculation was more than 10mIU/ml.

      Leprosy vaccine using measles rubella immunoglobulin ELISA detection test, measles >200U/ml
      positive for rubella >20U/ml positive or positive before inoculation; after inoculation,
      antibody positive growth is more than 4 times.

      Japanese encephalitis vaccine serum samples by using PRNT test before immunization antibody
      titer after inoculation was less than 1:5, at 1:10, or after vaccination antibody titer than
      before inoculation is no less than 4 times of growth is positive.

      Meningococcal vaccine samples A meningococcal bactericidal antibody level in serum by micro
      bactericidal antibody test, the antibody titer after inoculation than before inoculation is
      no less than 4 times of growth is positive.

      Safety assessment Safety assessment Participants were provided with diary cards to record the
      occurrence and severity of solicited local reactions at the injection site (pain, induration,
      erythema, edema, pruritus) during 7 days after vaccination, solicited systemic reactions
      (fever, headache, fatigued, cough, myalgia, asthenia, vertigo, diarrhea), and any unsolicited
      adverse during 29 days after vaccination.

      Statistical analyses The quantitative index lists the standard deviation, the median, the
      maximum and the minimum, and the qualitative index or the grade index list the frequency
      distribution table. The antibody titers of immunogenicity index should be represented by
      geometric mean, median, maximum and minimum value and 95% confidence interval. The antibody
      titer should be analyzed by logarithmic transformation.

      A list of the total population, susceptible and non susceptible seroconversion rate and 95%
      confidence interval, and calculation (test group and control group) rate difference and 95%
      confidence interval, non-inferiority test; the test group and the control group between the
      antibody geometric mean (GMT/GMC) compared with the t test after logarithmic transformation
      P, with less than 0.05 as there were statistically significant differences in the standard
