    
      This is a single arm, open-label, prospective, non-randomized Phase II clinical trial of
      locally advanced HNSCC with double checkpoint blockade and radiotherapy dependent on
      intratumoral CD8+ T cell Infiltration.

      All patients will initially be treated with the PD-L1 inhibitor Durvalumab (1500 mg q4w) and
      the CTLA-4 Inhibitor Tremelimumab (75 mg q4w / since Amendment 3 (01.04.2020): 300 mg
      absolute dose d5) and one cycle with Cisplatin (30mg/m² d1-3) and Docetaxel (75mg/m² d1).
      Treatment response will be evaluated clinically by endoscopy with biopsy. Changes of the CD8+
      T cell density in the second biopsy compared to the first one before therapy will be used for
      patient selection. Patients with a stable or decreased CD8+ tumor infiltrating immune cell
      density or clinical progressive disease will receive standard CRT outside the trial. For
      these patients toxicity will be monitored until the first dose of the subsequent standard
      CRT. Patients with an increased CD8+ tumor infiltrating immune cell density and at least
      clinically stable disease will receive radioimmunotherapy with the PD-L1 Inhibitor Durvalumab
      and the CTLA4-Inhibitor Tremelimumab (altogether 4 doses q4w including the induction dose)
      followed by maintenance therapy with Durvalumab (8 additional doses q4w). The primary
      endpoint is feasibility. Feasibility criteria are receiving the protocol treatment until
      cycle 6 of antibody treatment and absence of any of the DLT defined in the protocol. A
      feasibility rate of ≥80% is expected. The efficacy of radioimmunotherapy and predictive
      character of changes of CD8+ tumor infiltrating immune cells after induction
      chemo-immunotherapy are further endpoints. The follow up period will be two years after the
      completion of radiotherapy.
