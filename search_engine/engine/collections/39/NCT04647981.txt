    
      This study consists of a urine sample. During the participant's medical consultation with
      his/her urologist, for the monitoring of his/her non-invasive bladder tumor(s), a cystoscopy
      is performed. Before the examination, the participant gives a urine sample, which will be
      analyzed by the Xpert®Bladder Cancer Monitor test.

      The main objective of this non-interventional monocentric study is to compare the sensitivity
      of the Xpert® Bladder Cancer Monitor test performed on the GeneXpert® system to the
      sensitivity of cytology.

      The reference test is a combination of cystoscopy and histology. The algorithm is as follows:
      if the cystoscopy is negative, it will be considered that there is no recurrence; if the
      cystoscopy is positive, a biopsy of the "abnormal" area will be performed and histology will
      be requested. If the histology is positive, it will be considered that there is a recurrence;
      otherwise, it will be considered that there is no recurrence.

      The gold standard is, therefore, the couple: cystoscopy +/- histology

        -  A cystoscopy will be considered positive if to the naked eye the urologist sees a
           macroscopically suspicious lesion (e.g. a budding lesion).

        -  If the cystoscopy is positive, the urologist will take a sample of the suspect lesion
           and have it analyzed by the pathologist. If the lesion analyzed has the same histology
           as the original lesion, it will be considered a recurrence.
