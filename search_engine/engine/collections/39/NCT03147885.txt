      In the phase 1B component the investigators intend to enroll patients in a 3+3 dose
      escalation design. Newly diagnosed indolent and diffuse large cell lymphomas as well as
      relapsed/refractory indolent B cell lymphomas are eligible for enrollment in the phase 1
      component. The primary end-point for this component would be to establish the recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Selinexor in combination with standard dose RCHOP chemotherapy.

      In the phase 2 part of the study the investigators will use recommended phase 2 dose of
      Selinexor plus standard dose RCHOP combination to treat newly diagnosed DLBCL patients with
      the primary end-point being 2 year Progression free survival.

      Maintenance Phase: Patients with Follicular Lymphoma and Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma able
      to achieve PR or better at the end of therapy scan will be put on maintenance Selinexor for a
      total of one year. The dose of Selinexor in the maintenance phase would be similar to the
      last dose used for that particular patient in the treatment phase 1 or 2.
