    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the
      efficacy and tolerability of REN-1654 in subjects with sciatica. After screening and baseline
      clinical assessments, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive REN 1654 100 mg or
      matching placebo, once daily for 3 weeks. Leg pain, back pain and other efficacy measures
      will be assessed at 1 and 3 weeks after initiation of treatment. A subset of patients will
      undergo analysis of blood levels of REN-1654 during the course of the study
      (pharmacokinetics). Subjects will discontinue treatment after 3 weeks and return after a
      further 3 weeks off therapy for a final clinical assessment 6 weeks after initiation of
      treatment. If a subject does not return for follow-up, an effort will be made by telephone to
      document their clinical status and whether other interventions have been made.
