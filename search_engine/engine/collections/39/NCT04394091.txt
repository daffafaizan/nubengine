    
      Newly-diagnosed patients with stage III or IV non-metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (AJCC
      8th) will be recruited. All subjects receiving chemoradiotherapy will undergo a baseline
      integrated [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography (PET/CT) scan or traditional follow-up examination before the start of
      chemoradiotherapy.

      NPC Patients receiving IMRT treatment will receive a dedicated FDG PET/CT and
      high-sensitivity PET/CT protocol simultaneously 12 weeks after the end of chemoradiotherapy
      (primary endpoint).

      The results of FDG PET/CT and high-sensitivity PET/CT analyzed and compared.
