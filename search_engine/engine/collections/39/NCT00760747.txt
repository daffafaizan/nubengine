      120 patients with ADHD from 6 years to 16 years of age. After the screening period, patients
      will be randomized (centrally in a 1:1 ratio) either to a transition period of 10 weeks (slow
      switching arm) or to a transition period of 2 weeks (fast switching arm). After completion of
      the 10 week open phase patients will be treated for a further 4 weeks with atomoxetine.
