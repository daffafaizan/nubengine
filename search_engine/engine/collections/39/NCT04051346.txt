      meals containing high amounts of oxalate can increase urinary oxalate excretion, which is a
      risk factor for calcium oxalate kidney stones (CaOx KS). Small increases in oxalate can
      stimulate urinary crystals to form which can elicit an immune response. This study consists
      of having healthy subjects consume both low and oxalate enriched diets to evaluate the effect
      of oxalate on urinary crystals and immune responses. Participants will receive a low or high
      oxalate diet for 4 days prior to having a wash out period for 6 days. Participants will then
      crossover to the opposite oxalate diet for four more days.
