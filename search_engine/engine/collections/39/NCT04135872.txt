      acute first-ever ischemic stroke and admitted within 72 hours after onset; (2) clinical
      stroke diagnosis was confirmed with positive diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      (DW-MRI), those with isolated posterior circulations infarcts were exclude ; (3) presented
      with mild stroke severity ( admission NIHSS score ≤5); (4) age between 40 and 80 years.

      Clinical data including demographic characteristics, risk factors, and baseline NIHSS score
      were assessed and collected using a standardized table by experienced neurologists. Lab tests
      were performed with fasting venous blood samples within 18 hours of admission.

      Patients were followed up for 6 months. The cognitive functions were assessed using the
      Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).

      Contributing factors to post-stroke cognitive impariment (PSCI) were determined by comparing
      clinical data between PSCI and non-PSCI groups. All potential confounders were introduced
      into the multivariate regression models.
