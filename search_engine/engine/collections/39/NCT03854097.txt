      of fat in the arteries. Atheroslerosis in the lower limbs is termed peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD). The initial symptom is pain in the lower limbs followed by ulceration and
      gangrene. The literature has indicated that intermittent negative pressure (INP) can be used
      to reduce pain and facilitate wound healing. INP is a non-invasive technique that aims to
      increase arterial and skin blood flow in lower limbs and foot. This study aims to investigate
      the underlying mechanisms that are involved in changes in blood flow following application of
      INP. The Flow-Ox 'boot' will be used to apply INP for periods ranging from 4-8 weeks, for an
      hour twice per day, to the lower limb to determine the effects of INP on vascular function
      and blood flow. Specifically, vascular tests such as assessments of endothelial function,
      arterial stiffness, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) and blood borne metabolic and
      inflammatory markers will be performed before and after INP application. A pain chart will be
      employed before and after INP application to determine whether there is any change in
      perception of pain felt by individuals who suffer from pain associated with lower limb
      arterial disease.
