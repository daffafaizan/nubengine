      myocardial infarction (MI) size as a fraction of left ventricular (LV) size at 48-72 hours in
      patients presenting with an ST segment elevation MI who undergo successful percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI).

      The primary endpoint for this study will be myocardial infarction size as a fraction of left
      ventricular size at 48-72 hours as measured by contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI.
