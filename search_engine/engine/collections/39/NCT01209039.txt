      schizophrenia and depression.

      This study described in the present protocol consists of two parts. Part A is a multiple
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ascending
      doses of GSK1144814. The study is a single blind, randomised, placebo controlled design in
      healthy male and female (of non childbearing potential) subjects. Part B is an open label
      design in healthy male subjects to assess the GSK1144814 Neurokinin 1 receptor occupancy
      after repeat oral dosing by positron emission tomography scanning with [11C] GR205171.
