      survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM is still very poor; no treatment is curative;
      and the quality of life of patients with this tumor is compromised significantly, not only by
      their disease but also by side effects of these rigorous treatment plans. Especially in
      elderly patients, a treatment modality is needed that will improve the results of current
      standard treatments without further impairing the quality of life of these patients for their
      limited life span.

      The objective is to test the feasibility and timing of treatment with the TTFields device in
      elderly patients with newly diagnosed GBM simultaneous or subsequent to RT/ CRT.

      The primary rationale to conduct this study is to improve treatment in the segment of
      high-grade brain tumors with the highest medical need.

      All procedures regarding TTFields are representing routine clinical care within the approved
      use of the medical product in Germany; the present trial aims to investigate the optimal
      timing of TTFields use in elderly GBM patients.
