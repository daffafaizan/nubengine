      during sequential adjuvant chemotherapy and prior to surgery, aiming to find the most
      efficient modality to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of the primary breast
      cancer and its possible lymph node metastases. Post-surgical histology and a 6 month
      follow-up (to detect occult metastases) will constitute the standard of truth for
      determination and comparison of diagnostic performances.
