      contact lenses. The children's self-perceptions will be measured at baseline and every six
      months. We will compare the change in self-perception between spectacle and soft contact lens
      wearers over three years. We will also examine the effect of how much children initially like
      or dislike to wear glasses on the change in self-perception over three years.
