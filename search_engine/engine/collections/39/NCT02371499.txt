      (Enterolactis plus®) effect on overall abdominal pain/discomfort, symptoms and gut microbiota
      composition in patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. The investigators suppose that, due to
      the immunomodulatory action of probiotics, overall abdominal pain/discomfort and symptoms
      will improve, fecal Immunoglobulin A levels will change, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels
      will decrease and the production of regulatory cytokines as Interleukin 10 will improve
      following consumption of Lactobacillus casei DG (Enterolactis plus®).
