      and persistence of L. helveticus R-0052, L. casei NI319, B. breve NI337, and B. longum R-0175
      strains in feces of healthy adults following the start and the end of IP intervention,
      respectively. This study will have an initial baseline period (4 weeks), a probiotic
      intervention (2 weeks) and a washout period (4 weeks). Participants will complete daily
      questionnaires regarding stool frequency, time of stool collections, and IP intake. A weekly
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire will be administered. Transit time
      will be assessed using radiopaque markers.
