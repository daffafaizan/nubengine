      were given with 200 mL of water and swallowed without chewing the drug. For multiple doses
      administration at Day 2 until Day 5, the study drugs were administered at a regimen of one
      tablet each day, 30 minutes after breakfast. Time of drug administration was standardized for
      all participating subjects throughout the study period.

      From each subject, on Day 1 until Day 5 blood samples were drawn 5 mL before breakfast and
      drug administration; and breakfast was provided only on Day 2 until Day 5. Only on Day 1 and
      Day 5 after drug administration, the blood samples were drawn 5 mL each at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,
      3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 hours.

      The blood samples drawn on Day 1 were used to show the single dose pharmacokinetic profile
      under fasting condition; while those drawn on Day 5 were used to show the
      multiple-dose-pharmacokinetic profile after meal intake.

      One week after the first drug administration (washout period), the same procedure was
      repeated with the alternate drug.

      The plasma concentrations of metformin were determined by high performance liquid
      chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). The pharmacokinetic parameters assessed
      in the single dose study were AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax, tmax, and t1/2. The pharmacokinetic
      parameters assessed in multiple doses study at steady state phase were AUCtau, Cmax, Cmin,
      and t1/2.
