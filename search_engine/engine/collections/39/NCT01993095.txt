      that is compounded by the symptom manifestations of MS. However, there is increasing evidence
      to support the importance of physical activity in MS. Unfortunately, structured, safe, and
      efficacious physical activity programs that are often conducted in medical or university
      settings are often not accessible to many older adults with or without MS. We propose to
      conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial testing the efficacy of a DVD-delivered physical
      activity intervention which targets factors that have the potential to reduce disability in
      older adults with MS. This DVD-based intervention has been previously approved by the IRB at
      the University of Illinois for a similar study with low-active, community-dwelling older
      adults (IRB Protocol Number: 09765). This novel intervention provides systematic,
      programmatic activities with alternative versions of each exercise that allow individuals of
      all capabilities to complete the program successfully. It focuses on improving flexibility,
      strength, and balance and has been demonstrated to be feasible, well-accepted, and
      efficacious in a large sample of older adults without MS. Importantly, intervention resulted
      in clinically significant improvements in the Short Physical Performance Battery, reliable
      determinant of disability, institutionalization, morbidity, and mortality. If such an
      intervention was equally successful in older persons with MS, this could have considerable
      public health impact.
