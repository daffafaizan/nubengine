      Depression Decision Aid protocol with nurses and patients using questionnaire and
      administrative data.

      One to two nurses will deliver the Decision Aid protocol to 40 low-income patients (aged 21
      and over) scoring >10 via routine PHQ-9 screening. Consenting nurses will be assessed
      regarding their satisfaction with the protocol following its use with each patient subject.
      Nurse fidelity to the protocol will be evaluated via their documentation of protocol use in
      the EHR. Consenting patient subjects will be assessed at baseline; week 1 to determine their
      decision about depression treatment, satisfaction with the decision-making process; and week
      12 to determine treatment initiation or change, treatment adherence, and depressive status.
      Medical records will also be examined for documentation of medication prescription and other
      depression treatments.

      The study will test the following hypothesis concerning the Depression Decision Aid protocol:

      1. Feasibility and Acceptability: a) At least 85% of each nurse's intervention sessions will
      meet fidelity standards via Electronic Health Record (EHR) data; b) Nurses will report high
      levels of satisfaction with the Decision Aid; c) Patients will report high levels of
      satisfaction with the decision-making process;
