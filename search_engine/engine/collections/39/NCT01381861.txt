      models, VEGF-inhibitors diminish ovarian tumor growth, metastasis and malignant ascites
      formation. Independent Phase 2 trials have demonstrated single-agent activity for bevacizumab
      in recurrent ovarian cancer, and randomized controlled Phase 3 trials are ongoing in the
      first-line setting (GOG 0218 and ICON-7) and for recurrent disease (GOG 0213, OCEANS).

      TRC105 is an antibody to CD105, an important non-VEGF angiogenic target on vascular
      endothelial cells. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical
      models. In a Phase 1 study of advanced solid tumors, TRC105 therapy caused a global reduction
      in angiogenic biomarkers and reduced tumor burden at doses that were well-tolerated. We
      hypothesize that TRC105 will have single-agent activity in recurrent ovarian cancer. By
      targeting a non-VEGF pathway, TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGF inhibitors which
      could represent a major advance in ovarian cancer therapy.
