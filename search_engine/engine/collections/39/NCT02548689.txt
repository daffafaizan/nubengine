      non-scarring hair loss and in these subjects vs normal age-matched controls. Hair loss
      subjects will have their Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern Medical Faculty
      Foundation medical records reviewed to ensure they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. All
      subjects will have a 4 mm punch biopsy on the scalp. Tissue PAI-1 levels from scalp skin
      biopsies will be determined by immunohistochemical staining. Samples will be kept for
      approximately 15 years, after which time unused samples will be destroyed.
