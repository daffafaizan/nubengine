    
      Forty individuals with chronic low back pain will be randomly assigned, by a researcher not
      involved in data collection, to two treatment groups: Thrust manipulation (side-lying
      rotational manipulation standardized to the L4-L5 level) or non-thrust manipulation
      (side-lying grade III rotational non-thrust manipulation). A single treatment session will be
      provided.

      Outcome measurement will be conducted immediately after the treatment session. Data will be
      collected by a blinded assessor. Between-group differences will be calculated by constructing
      mixed linear models following an intention-to-treat principle.
