      improve adolescent nutrition, health and education in Burkina Faso. Findings from this study
      will clarify the optimal supplementation strategy (iron and folic acid alone or adding other
      essential nutrients) and provide a basis for scale up of national micronutrient
      supplementation programs to benefit the adolescent population as a whole in Burkina Faso.

      This will be a cluster randomized study with 3 arms. At the beginning of the academic year,
      42 schools per country will be enrolled (14 schools per arm) to receive either 1)
      supplementation with weekly iron and folic acid (IFA); 2) supplementation with daily multiple
      micronutrient supplements (MMS) (including IFA); or 3) to serve as controls. Students in
      intervention schools will receive supplementation and students in control schools will
      receive the usual care (which does not include supplementation but does include existing
      curriculum on nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene [WASH]). The program will be
      evaluated comparing effects of weekly IFA and daily MMS on anemia status, school
      attendance/performance, and adolescent development outcomes.
