      a 2-week cycle of physical rehabilitation. The rationale for this chemical-physical cocktail
      stems from the fact that increase in shear stress (achieved with exercise), or heparin (when
      used alone) have no significant effect on coronary arteriogenesis. Nevertheless, when the two
      stimuli are coupled coronary arteriogenesis is consistently present, and clinically
      significant.

      The basic principle of heparin treatment is to potentiates angiogenic growth factors, which
      are over expressed by increased shear stress at the site of pre-existing collateral vessels
      as a result of exercise or pacing. Although the precise mechanisms by which heparin
      potentiates arteriogenesis remain to be completely elucidated, heparin administration
      combined with exercise has great potential in treating patients with effort angina who are
      not indicated for conventional revascularization therapy.
