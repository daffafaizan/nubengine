      The investigators collected images on patients with PIV (Peripheral Intra Venous)/PAC
      (Peripheral Arterial Catheter) and central line catheters. The investigators collected images
      of deep vessel structures for offline processing to improve NICU-Tech algorithms for vessel
      segmentation.
