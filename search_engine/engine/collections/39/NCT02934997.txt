      of morbid long-term outcomes in patients with sepsis. Despite successful early management,
      sepsis is a disease with a high incidence of chronic critical illness (CCI - intensive care
      unit stay â‰¥ 14 days with organ dysfunction) and morbid long-term outcomes (functional
      dependence or death at 1 year), which occur frequently in early survivors. Both the rapid
      identification of patients at risk for morbid outcomes and the development of novel therapies
      are crucial for improving outcomes after sepsis. High density lipoprotein (HDL) defends
      against sepsis-associated organ injury by: 1) neutralizing bacterial endotoxin, 2) modulating
      innate cellular immunity and preventing release of inflammatory cytokines, and 3) preventing
      endothelial cell activation and dysfunction. However, HDL can become dysfunctional (Dys-HDL)
      in the setting of inflammation, losing protective functions and becoming pro-inflammatory.
      Our preliminary results demonstrate that Dys-HDL is present in early sepsis and that
      persistent Dys-HDL elevation (first 48 hours) is associated with adverse outcomes (death,
      hospice or nursing home care). The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate and fully
      characterize the role of Dys-HDL in a diverse population of patients with both CA and
      HA-sepsis. The central hypothesis of this study is that structural and functional changes in
      HDL during sepsis are associated with the persistent presence of Dys-HDL as well as the
      inflammation and endothelial dysfunction that lead to acute organ dysfunction, CCI, and
      morbid long-term outcomes. To test this, we will enroll 160 patients in a two-site,
      prospective, longitudinal, cohort study.
