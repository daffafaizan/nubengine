      group and the linezolid + vitamin B6 group, the line of division being whether vitamin B6 is
      to be applied or not in the course of treatment. The purpose is to evaluate the role that
      vitamin B6 plays, during the process of linezolid therapy, in the relief of erythropenia and
      cytopenias.
