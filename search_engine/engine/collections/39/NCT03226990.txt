      technique regarding the pressure areas and retention of the complete dentures constructed.
      Forty patients with edentulous maxillary arches were selected from the outpatient clinic of
      removable prosthodontics department, faculty of oral and dental medicine, Cairo university
      .The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group I received dentures constructed
      from impression technique with wax spacer while group II received dentures constructed from
      impression technique with no spacer. On the day of denture insertion pressure areas were
      detected using pressure indicating paste and denture retention was measured using force
      gauge. The data was collected and analyzed using student's t-test.
