      cardiopulmonary bypass with aortic cross clamping were randomly assigned to receive
      amiodarone, lidocaine, or saline placebo prior to removal of the aortic cross clamp.
      Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that amiodarone administration decreases the
      incidence of ventricular fibrillation, the number of defibrillation attempts and the total
      energy and current required for defibrillation should ventricular fibrillation occur.
