    
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial in which adults receiving drug abuse treatment
      will be recruited to participate in a HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) testing study. The purpose of
      this study is to test the efficacy of two HIV/HCV testing strategies on increasing receipt of
      test results: (1) on-site bundled rapid HIV/HCV testing (i.e., joint offer of HIV and HCV at
      the point of encounter), and (2) standard of care for HIV and HCV testing. Secondary outcomes
      include linkage to care and HIV and HCV risk behaviors. Participants will complete a baseline
      assessment to report their demographics, sexual risk behaviors, drug-using risk behaviors,
      utilization of drug abuse treatment services and will be randomized to one of two groups. At
      one-month post-randomization, participants will complete a follow-up assessment to determine
      whether or not they received their HIV or HCV test results. At three months
      post-randomization, participants will complete a follow-up assessment to assess linkage to
      care and changes, if any, in their HIV and HCV sexual risk behaviors.
