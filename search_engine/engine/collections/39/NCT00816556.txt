      to the vaginal introitus for the treatment of atrophic vaginitis, a common condition
      affecting up to 40% of postmenopausal women. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial
      with three arms-estradiol, estriol and placebo. The intervention will last for 12 weeks. The
      outcomes we will be most interested in are the efficacy of the treatments for symptoms of
      atrophic vaginitis compared to placebo and whether there is any measurable systemic
      absorption from the locally applied estrogen creams. These outcomes will be measured,
      primarily, by the use of patient questionnaires and secondarily, clinical examination scores.
      Safety will be evaluated with serum estrogen concentrations. All measures will be collected
      at baseline and at the termination of the study. Hormone concentrations will be collected,
      additionally, at week 2. This trial will answer important questions regarding the impact of
      very low doses of locally applied estrogens and symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. It will
      provide information on effect size and validity of outcome measures. It will also give
      information about whether low doses of estrogen creams, locally applied to the vaginal
      introitus, result in systemic absorption
