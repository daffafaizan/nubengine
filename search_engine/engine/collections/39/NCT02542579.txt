      of the mucosa. We hypothesized that the degree of inflammation depend on the composition of
      microbiota. This study was aimed to define gastric and duodenal microbiota leading to
      abnormal histopathology. We further tried to elucidate whether the composition of duodenal
      microbiota is altered by gastric microbiota.

      Among the dyspeptic subjects who visited for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy, subjects
      with drug intake (antibiotics, PPIs, laxatives, antidepressants, statins, metformin) within 3
      months will be excluded. Three biopsies will performed at the greater curvature side of the
      mid-antrum, greater curvature side of the mid-body, and at the duodenum, respectively. Next
      generation sequencing analysis will be performed for 16S rRNA variable regions using the
      biopsied samples.

      Primary study endpoint is 16S rRNA sequencing findings of gastric and duodenal microbiota.

      Secondary endpoints are microbiota linked with higher degrees of inflammation, activity,
      atrophy and intestinal metaplasia based on the updated Sydney classification. Furthermore,
      correlation between the microbiota and endoscopy finding will be analyzed.
