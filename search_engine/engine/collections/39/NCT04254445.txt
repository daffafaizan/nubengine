      tap, will be randomized to watch a personalized custom video training, explaining the
      procedure, in addition to the verbal explanation given by the medical staff, or to get the
      standard verbal explanation alone. Questionnaires regarding their understanding of the
      procedure, their feelings and the level of anxiety will be filled before and after the
      video/verbal explanation, and after the procedure. the study aims to check whether the video
      training provides better understanding of the procedure, increases cooperation and engagement
      and decreases anxiety.
