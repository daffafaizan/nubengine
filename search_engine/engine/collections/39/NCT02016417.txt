      an average of 80 cases per 100,000 population are reported each year. Nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma is both radiosensitive and chemosensitive. The National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN) guidelines (version 1, 2013), have recommended use of concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) and induction
      chemotherapy (IC) followed by CCRT plus AC as standard treatment for NPC. However, it was
      unclear whether patients with NPC could benefit from IC. Recently, many new drugs including
      docetaxel and gemcitabine have been incorporated in the induction chemotherapy phase of NPC.
      The investigators designed the present study with induction chemotherapy follow by CCRT for
      locoregionally advanced NPC, comparing induction chemotherapy regime of gemcitabine plus
      cisplatin (GP) and docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF).
