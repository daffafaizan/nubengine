      therapy for a malignancy--who are interested in pursuing or preserving fertility. In
      particular, it investigates chromosomal abnormalities or aneuploidy in the embryos of those
      individuals as compared to the general infertility population. Embryonic aneuploidy is
      largely due to reproductive senescence. As such the investigators will discuss oncofertility
      prevalence and treatment as well as reproductive senescence and assessment of embryonic
      aneuploidy. The study will seek to determine if there are changes in embryonic aneuploidy
      rates in oncofertility patients that differ from simple age related risks.
