    
      This is an observational cohort study utilising all available data from the Tysabri TOUCH
      (TYSABRI Outreach: Unified Commitment to Health) prescribing programme (US) supplemented with
      data from European Union (EU) multiple sclerosis (MS) registries to estimate the risk of PML
      and other serious opportunistic infections (OIs) among patients on Tysabri who have switched
      from newer DMTs (including fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate and teriflunomide) and the
      established DMTs (interferon beta and glatiramer acetate).

      This study will provide cumulative data from its two components separately: a retrospective
      component (data captured prior to 1 January 2016) and a prospective component (data captured,
      and patients followed up, from 1 January 2016 through 31 December 2023; total prospective
      study duration of 8 years). All patients who switched to Tysabri from another DMT through 31
      December 2020 will be included. The study will continue to follow-up patients until 31
      December 2023 to allow for a minimal follow-up of 3 years.
