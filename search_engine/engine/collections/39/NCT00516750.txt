      Primary

        -  Analyze the correlation between gene expression profile and the effect of chemotherapy
           and detect the significant cluster of genes useful to predict chemosensitivity.

        -  Confirm the reduction in original tumor size in patients with invasive bladder cancer
           treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cisplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the reduction in size of metastatic lesions in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive methotrexate on days 1, 15, and 22, vinblastine on days 2, 15, and 22,
      doxorubicin hydrochloride and cisplatin on day 2. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patient samples will be collected for gene expression profiling.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 3 years.
