      exposed to radio-contrast dyes, for example during a cardiac angiogram.

      We hypothesize that an infusion of saline + furosemide + mannitol will reduce rates of
      contrast-induced nephropathy when compared with saline infusion controls.

      We define an episode of contrast nephropathy using the conventional often published
      definition of a 25% relative increase in serum creatinine OR a 44 umol absolute increase in
      serum creatinine within 48 hours of contrast exposure.
