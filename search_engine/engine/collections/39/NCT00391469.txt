      circulation (ROSC) to hypothermia with rapid infusion of 2 liters of 4oC Normal Saline IV
      solution over 20 to 30 minutes, IV sedation and muscle paralysis or to standard of care
      following ROSC.

      The primary objective of this study will be to determine whether induction of mild
      hypothermia using an infusion of cold normal saline will improve the proportion of patients
      who survive and are discharged awake from the hospital.

      Hypothesis: In cardiac arrest patients who achieve ROSC in the field, initiation of
      hypothermia by infusion of cold normal saline will result in a greater proportion of cardiac
      arrest patients discharged awake from the hospital compared to standard care.
