    
      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, single-center study that will compare efficacy of
      pain treatment with ITDD to efficacy of pain treatment with CMM in patients suffering from
      pancreatic cancer pain.

      There will be two treatment groups: Study group (ITDD): These subjects will have a Prometra
      System implanted and managed with the appropriate drug regimen to treat their pain. Systemic
      analgesics will not be prescribed for this group. Control group (CMM): These subjects will be
      treated with CMM to treat their pain.

      A maximum of 30 subjects (maximum of 15 in each treatment group) may be enrolled in this
      study at one study center.
