      frovatriptan taken by patients for up to 12 perimenstrual periods (PMPs) for the prevention
      of menstrual migraine (MM). The study required approximately 300 patients to treat 6 PMPs and
      100 patients to treat 12 PMPs. To achieve these numbers, 550 patients were to be enrolled
      into the study. Once enrolled, patients were requested to treat at least 6 PMPs in the first
      9 months and 12 PMPs overall. Patients were to remain in the study for a maximum of 15 months
      or until they had completed the treatment of 12 PMPs, whichever occurred sooner.Patients were
      to take a loading dose of frovatriptan 5 mg (two tablets) twice daily on Day 1, followed by
      frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice daily on Days 2-6.
