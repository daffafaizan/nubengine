      acceptability of each "version" of the LNS-child (LNS-child with cardamom flavor, LNS-child
      with no added flavor),LNS-PLW (LNS-PLW with cumin flavor, and LNS-PLW with no added flavor)
      and MNP to the others in terms of taste, smell and texture, as well as amount of the
      test-dose consumed. In Step 2, participants in the Phase 1 trial will receive a 2-week supply
      of one of the LNS products or MNP, which they will consume daily in their homes for 14 days
      under real-life conditions. In Step 3, focus group discussions will be held with participants
      to discuss different aspects of infant and child feeding and discuss best ways for the LNS or
      MNP product to be used in the context of Bangladesh.
