      The primary objective is to determine the safety profile of SX-682 alone and in combination
      with pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic melanoma, including the maximum dose that can
      be administered until adverse effects prevent further dose increases, and the dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT).

      The secondary objectives are to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of SX-682 in combination with
      pembrolizumab on the basis of the objective response rate, the duration of response, and the
      rate of progression; and 2) characterize the SX-682 single-dose and multidose PK profile.

      Exploratory objectives are to: 1) assess overall survival (OS); and 2) explore potential
      biomarkers associated with pharmacodynamic and clinical response to SX-682 alone and combined
      with pembrolizumab, where the biomarker measures include, but are not limited to, tumor
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), Tregs and CD69/CD8 T cells, and in the circulation,
      T- and B-cell subpopulations, neutrophils, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tregs,
      the CD4:CD8 ratio, chemokines, cytokines, and LDH.

      Overview of Study Design

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation with expansion study of
      twice-daily SX-682 in subjects with metastatic melanoma treated concurrently with
      pembrolizumab (Combination Stage) following a 21 day dose-escalation safety evaluation of
      SX-682 monotherapy (Monotherapy Stage). SX-682 is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of the
      CXCR1/2 chemokine receptors that are believed involved in MDSC-recruitment to tumor and other
      pro-tumoral mechanisms. Dosing of SX-682 in the Combination Stage is conditioned on ongoing
      concurrent treatment with pembrolizumab, and a subject who discontinues pembrolizumab may not
      receive further doses of SX-682.
