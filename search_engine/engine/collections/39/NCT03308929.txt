      outcomes, radiological outcomes and further characterize the safety profile of the G7 Dual
      Mobility Hip Arthroplasty System. This will be accomplished by assessing these domains using
      the Harris Hip Score, UCLA Activity Score, and EQ-5D-3L, obtaining and assessing radiographs
      and the tracking of device or procedure related adverse events. Subjects will undergo
      unilateral primary or revision total hip arthroplasty and will then be followed for 10 years
      with intervals at 6 weeks, 1-, 2-, 3- 5- and 10 years. For the 10 year visit, subjects will
      not be required to present in their doctor's office, but will fill out a survey. Subsequent
      to 10 year data collection, the subject's participation in the study will be compete.
