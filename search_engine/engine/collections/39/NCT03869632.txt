    
      This is a open-label, single-center, dose-escalation, phase I study of YL-13027 comprised of
      a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part in subjects with advanced stage solid
      tumors. The study will investigate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      efficacy of YL-13027, and will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of YL-13027 using an
      accelerated titration test and 3+3 design. a dose expansion part will identify the
      recommended phase 2 dose. YL-13027 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits
      protein serine/threonine kinase of activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) and blocks
      intracellular signaling of TGF-Î² by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ALK5 substrates. In
      this clinical trial, YL-13027 is given orally daily. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days.
      Adverse events (AEs) were graded by NCI-CTCAE V5.0. Efficacy was evaluated according to
      RECIST V1.1.
