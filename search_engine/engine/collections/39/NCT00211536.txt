      hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM subjects, as demonstrated in numerous European studies. Glycemic
      control is difficult to attain in subjects using exogenous insulin due to the risk of severe
      hypoglycemia. This study is aimed at comparing the efficacy of intraperitoneal (IP) insulin
      therapy to intensive subcutaneous insulin therapy over a period of 12 months.
