      metabolism in the Tako Tsubo Cardiomyopathy physiology, in both humans and an animal model,
      and to investigate which metabolic pathway is preferentially adopted by acute Tako Tsubo
      Cardiomyopathy myocytes during this severe functional shut down with largely preserved
      variability. The human model will be used to determine the preferential stimulated uptake of
      glucose/fatty acids under optimal metabolic conditions for each (hyperinsulineamic euglycemic
      clamp for 18F-Fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) and fasting for
      14Fluorine-18Fluoro-6-Thia-Heptadecanoic Acid (18F-FTHA cardiac Positron Emission
      Tomography)). In the rat model the investigators will examine both the metabolic tracer
      uptake (using micro Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography) as well as the
      downstream modulation of the two metabolic pathways (transcriptional regulators,
      mitochondrial respiration, expression of the uncoupling proteins, levels of Adenosine
      Triphosphate generation and reactive oxygen species production).

      The investigators aim to test the hypothesis that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the
      pathophysiology of this condition by further exploring: 1) In the rat model define time
      course, extent and subtypes of cellular infiltrate, 2) In the rat model of Tako Tsubo
      Cardiomyopathy, demonstrate the presence of inflammatory macrophages using in-vivo Ultrasmall
      Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide-cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and whether this relates to
      numbers and types of macrophages present as determined by immunohistochemical analysis, 3) In
      clinical patients, define the time course of specific peripheral blood monocyte subsets and
      the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines versus matched controls and 4) In clinical
      patients, establish the compartmentalisation of tissue macrophages in the left ventricle its
      time course resolution using Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide-enhanced cardiac
      magnetic resonance.

      The investigators will assess the psycho-emotional factors involved in Tako Tsubo
      Cardiomyopathy given that in the majority of cases intense emotional trauma is immediately
      preceding onset.
