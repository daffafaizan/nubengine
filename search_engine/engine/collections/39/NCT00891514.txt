      study the interactions of adipose tissue and the paretic and non-paretic muscle inflammation,
      insulin signaling and action in hemiparetic stroke patients and the ability to employ
      exercise training to reverse these abnormalities in this ethnically diverse population.
      Participants aged 40-75 years with chronic stroke will be randomized to treadmill training
      versus stretch control group using a one-two-one blocked randomization on race (black vs.
      white), sex (male vs. female), and glucose tolerance status (normal vs. impaired and type 2
      diabetes).

      Stroke occurs in over 780,000 persons each year in the U.S., the vast majority reported in
      persons older than 55 years of age. Following stroke, patients remain at continued high risk
      for recurrent stroke. Inflammatory processes lead to cardiovascular events/stroke and
      contribute to disease risk progression by impacting insulin resistance and the development of
      type 2 diabetes. Interventions that reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity have
      important clinical implications, especially in the stroke population.

      Task-oriented treadmill training is utilized to improve cardiovascular fitness and functional
      mobility in hemiparetic stroke patients. Additionally, preliminary data indicates that
      progressive treadmill training in this population improves glucose tolerance.
