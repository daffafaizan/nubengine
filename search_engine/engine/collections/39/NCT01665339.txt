      consuming a low-energy-dense preload while none assessed the sustainability of lower amount
      of energy intake and body weight changes in a long-term. On the other hand, the
      sustainability of lower energy intake in a long term might be affected by higher dietary
      diversity score due to considering preload in diets. Notably, increased diet variety is
      associated with higher overall dietary energy intake and weight gain.
