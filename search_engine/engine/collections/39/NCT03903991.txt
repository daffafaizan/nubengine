      Temperature monitoring is therefore essential. However, the reliability of esophageal
      temperature during open chest lung surgery is discussed and not accurately assessed in the
      literature.

      The investigators therefore decided to evaluate the reliability of the oesophageal
      temperature in open chest lung surgery by comparing it to the continuous tympanic
      temperature.
