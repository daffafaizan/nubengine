    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate product satisfaction of the following test
      articles A, B, and C: Lindi Skin soothing balm (product A), Lindi Skin face serum (product
      B), and Lindi Skin face wash (product C). This will be done by measuring change in Skindex-16
      questionnaire at two time points (baseline and follow-up visits) and by evaluating responses
      to the investigator administered product satisfaction survey.

      The secondary objective of this study is to see if there is any correlation between product
      satisfaction and grade of skin toxicity based on NCI-CTCAE v.3.0 scale.

      Participants in this study will be patients seen at the Northwestern University SERIES clinic
      or Lurie Cancer Center who are receiving chemotherapeutic and or radiation treatments.
      Subjects who choose to participate complete a Skindex16 questionnaire, and will after
      consenting to participate, be given all three test articles A, B, and C to use daily for one
      month. (These test articles are currently marketed products classified by the FDA as
      cosmetics).

      At the return visit, 1 month after baseline visit, the participant will be asked to return
      the test articles and complete an investigator administered product satisfaction
      questionnaire for each test article used. 100 participants will be surveyed. Subjects will be
      telephoned to check for product compliance after 1 week and 2 week intervals.
