      to evaluate effect of 940 nm diode laser disinfection performed in addition to conventional
      irrigation on postoperative pain of retreatment cases. Eighty-four patients with chronic
      apical periodontitis were treated. Root canal fillings were removed using rotary files. Root
      canals were irrigated using sodium hypochlorite between instrument changes. Final irrigation
      was performed using sodium hypochlorite and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The cases
      were randomly allocated into 2 groups: Group 1: Diode laser disinfection group, Group 2:
      control group. Root canal fillings were applied and crowns were restored. All treatments were
      completed in a single appointment. Patients were given a pain scale and they were requested
      to mark the code that reflects their pain intensity during 3 days.
