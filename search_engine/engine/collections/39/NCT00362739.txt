      blood samples and the risks of developing a particular lung disease, or severity of a lung
      disease. The findings of this study might be important to develop future preventative methods
      and potential treatments for the management of lung disease. The investigators aim to collect
      blood samples from 300 people with lung disease and 300 controls over 5 years.
