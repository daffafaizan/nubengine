      patients (6-17 years of age) diagnosed with ADHD, when administered with a FDA-approved
      medication (psychostimulant) in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) in pediatric subjects. Participants will be screened for eligibilty for up to 4 weeks,
      and he/she will continue to take their prescribed psychostimulant ADHD medication during that
      time. Following the screening period, eligible subjects will receive SPN-812 with their
      current psychostimulant treatment for ADHD for 8 weeks. For the first 4 weeks of treatment
      subjects will take SPN-812 dose in the morning (AM dosing), and for the last 4 weeks of
      treatment, subjects will take SPN-812 dose in the evening (PM dosing). The total duration of
      the study between the screening visit and the end of the treatment period/end of study (EOS)
      visit is up to 12 weeks.
