      overcome many underlying causes of infertility, pregnancy success rates remain relatively
      low, mainly due to implantation failure. Embryo quality and endometrial receptivity are two
      significant factors that believed to be the key points in implantation. Since recent studies
      that showed high expression of some HOXA genes affects on successful implantation rate, thus
      we examined the expression of HOXA genes in NAC supplementation during window of implantation
      (WOI) in women with (RIF). Also the effect of NAC on the improvement of implantation in RIF
      patients was investigated. Forty unfertile women with a diagnosis of RIF, referred to Royan
      Institute were included in the study. The study was of the type a single center, double
      blinded, placebo controlled, randomized trial. Expression of HOXA genes were assessed on the
      day of WOI (using Real Time PCR) biopsies from endometrium. Subjects randomly assigned to
      receive either NAC (A) or placebo (B) with both effervescent tablets having similar color,
      size and appearance. The patients were randomly categorized in two groups (A/B) to receive
      NAC 1200 mg/day or placebo, for at-least 6 weeks before starting ovarian stimulation.
      Pipelled-based biopsy from endometrium was done on specific day (19-21) of their cycle. Then
      patients were undergone ovarian stimulation (using NAC) ended to IVF treatment. RNA
      extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed from endometrium samples and then we evaluated
      expressions levels by Real-time PCR. Then we analyzed our data by independent Sample T-test
      and Mann-whitney U Test.
