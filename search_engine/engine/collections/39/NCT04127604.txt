    
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a psychosocial
      intervention designed to improve treatment adherence in Veterans with comorbid bipolar
      disorder and substance use disorders (BP-SUD) following a psychiatric hospitalization.
      Participants will be randomized to either the specialized psychosocial intervention or an
      enhanced safety monitoring program, both as adjuncts to VA treatment as usual. Veterans with
      BP-SUD will be recruited from the Providence VAMC inpatient psychiatric unit and assessed at
      baseline and at 3 (mid-treatment), 6 (post-treatment), and 9-month post-discharge.
