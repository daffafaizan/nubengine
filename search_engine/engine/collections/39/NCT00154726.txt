      shown to have a 55% response rate in anthracycline-resistant patient. Recently, regimen
      combining paclitaxel and moderately-high-dose 5-FU (1500mg/m2) has had response rate up to
      61.5% (including 23%CR) in a small group of gastric cancer patients (8 responders in 13
      patients). Thus, the sequential use of weekly paclitaxel followed by weekly HDFL regimen may
      become a new generation of chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of gastric cancer.
      Further study with a larger group of patients and further testing of possible schedules of
      administration are warranted.
