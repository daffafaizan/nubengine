      helping frequent marijuana smokers cut down or stop using marijuana. Vilazodone is FDA
      approved for the treatment of depression- in this study, vilazodone's effect on marijuana
      dependence is being investigated.

      Participation in the study takes 10 visits over a period of approximately two to three
      months. The first visit is a screening visit to determine if participants are eligible to
      participate. After the initial assessment visit, the weekly visits take about 30 minutes,
      with the exception of three therapy sessions which take approximately 60-90 minutes. The
      three therapy sessions will focus on participant's marijuana use and reasons they may have
      for stopping or cutting down on use. After completing an initial therapy session,
      participants will be randomly selected to receive the study medication, either vilazodone or
      placebo (a capsule that does not contain any active medication). Participants will have
      weekly study visits with a clinician. At each study visit, they will be asked to fill out
      forms and answer specific questions concerning their substance use, anxiety symptoms, and
      feelings in general. They will be providing urine samples to check for illegal drugs of abuse
      including marijuana and other drugs. They will also have blood samples drawn during to
      determine if you are taking the medication as directed.
