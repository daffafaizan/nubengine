      multi-center, prospective, open-label, single-arm study of doripenem in the treatment of
      complicated lower urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis in adults. Patients are
      hospitalized, but subsequently, patients may treated as outpatient or through home-based
      therapy at the discretion of the investigators. Conventional laboratory data will be
      collected from patients at specified times throughout the study. The primary endpoint is
      microbiological response measured at test of cure visit. The patients will receive doripenem
      with duration of therapy up to 10 days.
