      Measurements will include non-invasive measurements of blood and tissue oxygen and venous
      blood draws for cytokine levels.

      The altitude part of the study involves ascent to the University of California's White
      Mountain Research Center Barcroft Laboratory, at 12,500 feet elevation. The subjects will
      remain at that altitude for at least 48 hours for measurements of oxygenation and blood
      cytokines.
