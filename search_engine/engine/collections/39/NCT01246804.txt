      if its claimed positive effects on memory, concentration and depression. Alternative medicine
      can cause drug-drug interactions with regular HIV-medication. Raltegravir is a newly
      developed HIV integrase inhibitor. It is metabolized in the liver by UGT1A1 and therefore its
      pharmacokinetic profile can be influenced by inhibitors or inducers of UGT1A1. So far there
      are no data of the potential effect of ginkgo biloba on glucuronidation in vivo. The current
      study is designed to evaluate the potential inductive effect of ginkgo biloba on the
      pharmacokinetics of raltegravir and the safety profile when used in combination.
