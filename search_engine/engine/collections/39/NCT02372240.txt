      intravenous (IV) infusion administered with low dose dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16
      of a 28-day cycle in patients with confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma with relapsed or
      relapsed and refractory disease (RRMM).

      The phase 1 trial design follows an Initial Accelerated Titration design followed by a
      traditional "3+3" cohort design to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
      phase 2 dose (RPTD) for the phase 2 portion of the study. It is anticipated that patients
      will receive 6 treatment cycles. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease
      progression, patients have the option of continuing treatment beyond 6 cycles, if the
      investigator determines that the patient may benefit further from it.
