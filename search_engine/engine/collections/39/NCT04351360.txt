      movements. The phenotype combines chorea, dystonia and / or myoclonus with frequent facial
      involvement, axial hypotonia, fluctuations and / or episodes of paroxysmal dyskinesia which
      can be nocturnal and / or painful.

      Many treatments have been tried, with no obvious efficacy. Two patients from the same family
      (a father and daughter) told investigators that caffeine had a dramatic effect on their
      paroxysmal episodes. They said that taking coffee would prevent episodes and reduce their
      duration (efficacy estimated at 80%), an effect specific to caffeine since it was reproduced
      by the ingestion of caffeine citrate capsules. Very interestingly, there is a rationale
      underlying this phenomenon. Indeed, caffeine is an antagonist of the adenosine A2A receptors
      (A2AR), receptors which activate ADCY5 and which are localized preferentially in striatal
      neurons expressing dopamine D2 receptors. As caffeine is an A2AR antagonist, it likely
      inhibits ADCY5, and therefore induces clinical improvement in patients with hyperactivity of
      this protein.

      In addition, the investigative team noted anxiety in some of its patients, and the question
      of the presence of psychiatric disorders in ADCY5 patients was recently raised in the
      literature.

      The investigative team wishes to collect standardized preliminary data by questioning
      patients on the effect of caffeine on their motor symptoms and their overall clinical state,
      and on the possible existence of psychiatric comorbidities using structured questionnaires
      which will be carried out by phone.
