      single-center prospective phase 2 pilot study. It will enroll a convenience sample of
      children with SCA, obtain cross-sectional baseline data at enrolment, and follow them as a
      prospective cohort for a period of 24 months. The cohort will be divided into two arms based
      on the initial screening TCD result: 1) those who have a normal (less than 170 cm/sec time
      averaged mean velocity (TAMV)) initial screening TCD and will be an observation/control
      cohort; and 2) those who have an elevated initial screening TCD (either conditional (170-199
      cm/sec) or abnormal (greater than or equal to 200 cm/sec) TAMV) and will be a treatment
      cohort that receives open-label hydroxyurea therapy as per the dosing and administration
      schedule. Those who are found to have a normal TCD at enrolment and are part of the
      observation/control cohort will undergo repeat TCD 12 months after enrolment. If the TCD at
      12 months has changed to an elevated velocity (conditional or abnormal), the study
      participant can begin study treatment, but will not be included in the primary endpoint
      analysis. The primary hypothesis is after 12 months of hydroxyurea therapy, children with
      conditional TCD velocities will achieve a mean decrease of >15cm/sec from their baseline TCD
      TAMV.
