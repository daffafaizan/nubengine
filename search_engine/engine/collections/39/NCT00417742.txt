      promoted as a preferred strategy for managing patients with chronic disabling headache.

      Chronic headache affects between 6% and 17% of the population and is associated with
      significant numbers of days lost from work and reduced quality of life, as well as
      disproportionate use of medical resources. Current treatment is sub-optimal, with patients
      often not adequately diagnosed and/or not receiving appropriate preventive and acute
      pharmacologic therapy or behavioral modification. As a result, chronic headache is associated
      with sub-optimal quality of care, high patient dissatisfaction as well as high cost to
      individuals, insurers, and society.

      The specific hypothesis of this study is that a properly designed headache management program
      (HMP) will reduce headache-related disability, improve process of care, and reduce management
      costs for patients with chronic headache. The format is a randomized controlled trial in
      which a patient population participating in a HMP will be compared with a corresponding
      patient population receiving usual care. A pilot study1 has determined the components of an
      optimal HMP and the effectiveness of a prototype of this service with a limited number of
      patients at a Kaiser Permanente facility in Santa Rosa, California.
