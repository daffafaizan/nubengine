      hospitalisation rates. They are also at high risk of further falls and other adverse
      outcomes. However, there is currently limited available evidence to inform best practice.

      The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a targeted multi-factor
      intervention in improving health and well being of older people who present to an ED after a
      fall. It also aims to identify those within this high-risk population most likely to benefit
      from the intervention program.

      Approximately 800 people aged 60 years and over will be invited to participate at the
      Emergency Department from the end of September 2002. Those who are eligible to participate
      will have a falls risk assessment in their own home and will be required to complete a falls
      diary for 12 months. There is a 50/50 chance (random allocation) that participants will
      receive an individualised falls prevention program.

      The duration of a falls risk assessment is up to 2 hours and there is no cost involved.
      Participation in the research program will not affect routine management from the Emergency
      Department.

      Becoming a participant may lessen the risk of having another fall and help others as well.
