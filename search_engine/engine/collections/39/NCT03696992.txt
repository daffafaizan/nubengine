      Consecutive adult patients, age 40 or above, undergoing outpatient colonoscopy in the Queen
      Mary Hospital are invited to participate in this prospective randomized study. Patients are
      excluded if they are unable to provide informed consent or have undergone previous colorectal
      resection, or have personal history of colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease,
      familial adenomatous polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, or other polyposis syndromes.
      Patients who are considered to be unsafe for polypectomy including patients with bleeding
      tendency and those with severe comorbid illnesses will be excluded. In addition, patients are
      excluded post-randomization if either the cecum could not be intubated for various reasons or
      Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score is <2.

      Study design and randomization:

      This is a prospective randomized crossover trial comparing the proximal adenoma detection
      rate and miss rate of BLI (ELUXEO endoscopic system) vs NBI (290 video system) vs WLI which
      is conducted in the Endoscopy Center of the Queen Mary Hospital of Hong Kong. Eligible
      patients are randomly allocated to four groups in a 1:1:1 ratio to undergo tandem colonoscopy
      of the proximal colon, defined as cecum to splenic flexure. The three groups are: (1) NBI
      follow by WLI; (2) BLI follow up WLI; (3) WLI follow by WLI. Randomization will be carried
      out by computer generated random sequences and stratified according to endoscopist's
      experiences (experienced versus fellows) and indications of colonoscopy (symptomatic vs
      screening/surveillance). All procedures are performed with high-definition endoscopes. The
      patients are blinded to the group assignment.
