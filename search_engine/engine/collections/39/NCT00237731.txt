      of 0.05 mg/kg in pre-hospital pain METHODS : Consecutive patients with severe, acute pain
      defined as a verbal rating scale (VRS) of 60/100 or higher may be included. 106 patients at
      all are required in the study. They will be randomised in two groups : group A will receive
      an initial intravenous injection of 0.05 mg/kg then injections of 0.025 mg/kg every 5 minutes
      and group B will receive an initial intravenous injection 0.1 mg/kg then injections of 0.05
      mg/kg every 5 minutes. The pain scale will be checked every 5 minutes during 30 minutes. The
      titration will be stopped before, if the VRS is < or = 30. The patient will be followed
      during the study until 60 minutes.
