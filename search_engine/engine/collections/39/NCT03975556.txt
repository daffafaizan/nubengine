      based on staple foods as well as culturally-appropriate strategies to reduce cardiometabolic
      risk factors of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Based on preliminary results from studies in the
      island, investigators will conduct a 4-month, 2-arm intervention among 200 adults (100 per
      arm) ages 25-65 living in Puerto Rico with at least 2 of 5 cardiometabolic risk factors. The
      two arms are: (1) intervention group consisting of culturally-appropriate advice in an
      initial individual session with daily text messages for 2 months (delivery phase); (2)
      control arm of standard general nutritional advice at the initial individual session, and
      text messages for 2 months. A reinforcement phase of 2-months will follow to repeat the
      education and text messages. Investigators will measure changes in cardiometabolic risk
      factors and in eating-behaviors and psychological measures.
