    
      A randomized, sham controlled, masked trial of up to 30 eyes will be recruited into the
      study. Participants with a qualifying study eye will be randomized after screening and
      baseline evaluations to receive 2 NT-501 ECT implants in the study eye (20 eyes), 1 NT-501
      ECT implant (5 eyes) or a sham surgery (control arm; 5 eyes). No explant will be required. An
      examination for safety will occur one day and one week following implant and periodically
      thereafter for 24 months post-implant. Patients in the control arm may be offered 2 NT-501
      ECT implants after the 12-month post-operative follow-up visit.
