      our trauma center. Investigators will collect DNA, utilizing discarded blood samples, from
      3000 injury victims in an effort to identify perhaps 50 - 100 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNP) (out of 1000s) that can be used, when taken together, to identify patients at highest
      risk for developing complicated sepsis and death
