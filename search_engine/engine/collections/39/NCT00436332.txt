      Primary

        -  Determine overall survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV bronchioloalveolar
           carcinoma (BAC) or adenocarcinoma with BAC features treated with erlotinib hydrochloride
           and bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare, preliminarily, response as assessed by RECIST criteria vs response as assessed
           by a central computer-assisted image-analysis system in patients with measurable disease
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
