    
      Part 1 of the study will first evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZW25 plus standard
      first-line combination chemotherapy (XELOX, FP, or mFOLFOX6 for GEA; mFOLFOX6 with or without
      bevacizumab for CRC; and CisGem for BTC) and will confirm the recommended dosage (RD) of ZW25
      when administered in combination with each of these multi-agent chemotherapy regimens. Then,
      Part 2 of the study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of ZW25 plus combination
      chemotherapy in HER2-expressing GEA, BTC, and CRC.
