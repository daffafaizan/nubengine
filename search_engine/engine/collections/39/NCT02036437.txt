           prolonged gestational age stands as the most common indication. It is well recognized
           that with an unripe cervix, induction may be difficult and often unsuccessful. The use
           of an agent to ripen the cervix prior to induction is acceptable in the modern practice.

        -  Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, is the most interesting alternative to
           Dinoprostone because of its effectiveness, low cost, and temperature stability. It
           ripens the cervix by inducing regular uterine contractions. However, it is associated
           with several adverse effects especially uterine hyperstimulation, which is painful and
           may result in fetal compromise.

        -  Testing the efficacy and safety of titrated oral misoprostol versus vaginal dinoprostone
           may develop a new safe and effective method for labor induction.
