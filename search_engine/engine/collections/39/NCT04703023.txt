      inhaled particles through mucociliary transport. In chronic inflammatory airway diseases such
      as COPD or cystic fibrosis, infectious agents, inflammatory cells and products of
      inflammation such as DNA, increase mucus viscosity which results in decreased mucociliary
      clearance of inhaled particles, increasing the likelihood of respiratory infections. This
      pilot study is planned as basic research on the properties of bronchial mucus.

      Water isotherms and efficient water activity (sorption and desorption) of the collected
      samples are examined in defined temperature and humidity settings using DVS Intrinsic
      (Dynamic Vapour Sorption System, Surface Measurement Systems, London, UK). Findings will
      provide insights into possible treatment programs targeted at altering specific mucus
      components.
