      criterion is to get an informed consent either from the residents or from their relatives.
      The following data will be recorded: Year of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure
      and heart rate, daily calcium intake from diet, nursing home scales on pain, depression,
      dementia and activities of daily life, date of entry to the home, diagnosis and medication
      lists. From a venous blood sample the investigators get: calcium, phosphate, albumin,
      creatinin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathormone (intact).

      Primary endpoint: Proportion of medication lists of residents complying with federal
      recommendation on vitamin D and calcium supplementation.

      Secondary endpoints: 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, effect of an intervention with a nursing
      home-applied recommendation to the physicians.
