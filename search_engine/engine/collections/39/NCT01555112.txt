      genital warts, is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. There are a wide
      variety of available treatments of genital warts, but none are considered completely
      effective. It has been suggested that AS101 works by stimulating the innate and acquired arms
      of the immune system.

      In previous proof-of-concept clinical study AS101 topical cream was tested on HPV warts and
      shown cure in high percentages. However the cream formulation was unstable therefore a new
      formulation was developed mainly for the carrier. In this study the improved AS101 ointment
      will be tested in female patients with external genital warts in an open study to assess its
      safety and efficacy.
