      bronchial radiofrequency ablation system to the Boston Scientific Bronchial Thermoplasty
      System (Alair System). The study population consisted of subjects with severe asthma who are
      still symptomatic despite being managed on high dose ICS and LABA. Patients with severe
      asthma who still have symptoms, despite the standard drug maintenance recommended by the
      guidelines, after signing the informed consent, who meet the inclusion exclusion criteria
      enter the baseline period and continued to use uniform ICS and LABA, which will last at least
      4 weeks. Patients with at least two days asthma symptoms during the baseline period, and meet
      the eligibility criteria are assigned to the experimental or control group at a 1:1 ratio
      based on a central randomized system. A total of 160 subjects will be enrolled, 80 in the
      experimental group and 80 in the control group. The experimental group is treated with SyMap
      radiofrequency ablation system, and the control group is treated with the same procedure
      using Boston Scientific Bronchial Thermoplasty Aliar System. For subjects in the experimental
      group and the control group, follow-up by telephone call will be performed at 1, 2, 7 days
      after each procedure and at 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 months after the third procedure,
      and outpatient follow-up will be performed at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after the third
      procedure. ICS and LABA are administered within one year after the third procedure. The
      difference in the rate of severe asthma exacerbations per year (the number of severe asthma
      exacerbations per person per year), at 12 months after bronchial radiofrequency ablation, is
      the primary endpoint of the study, and the success rate of procedure, postoperative adverse
      events, and serious adverse events are safety endpoints.
