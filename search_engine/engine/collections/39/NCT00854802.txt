      parallel-group, multiple dose phase II study comparing 3 Debio 025
      (alisporivir)/peg-IFNα2a/ribavirin regimens to SOC treatment in treatment naïve chronic HCV
      genotype 1 patients.

      Patients are randomised into 1 of 4 arms receiving either Debio 025/peg-IFNα2a/ribavirin
      triple therapy for a fixed treatment duration of 48 weeks (Treatment A) or 24 weeks
      (Treatment B), Debio 025/peg-IFNα2a/ribavirin triple therapy for a response-based treatment
      duration of 24 or 48 weeks (Treatment C), or blinded SOC treatment for 48 weeks (Treatment
      D). Follow-up is 24 weeks in all treatment arms.
