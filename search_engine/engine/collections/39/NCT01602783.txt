      acetate PET scan. This scan is designed to detect small amounts of your tumor that were not
      detected by the CT scan or the bone scan. On the day of the scan, you will fast for at least
      four hours prior to being given the tracer injection by vein. You will then be scanned in the
      PET scanner. The entire procedure will take approximately 2 hours.

      The investigators would like to keep track of your medical condition after you have completed
      your scan. The investigators would like to do this by looking up information in your medical
      record during the year following the scan to see how you are doing. Checking your condition
      helps us understand whether the [11C] acetate PET scan will be helpful to other patients in
      the future.
