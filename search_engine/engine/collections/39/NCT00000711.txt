      which may be present before any symptomatic illness. These individuals could, therefore,
      benefit from therapy with an effective antiretroviral agent. AZT, which is a powerful
      inhibitor of human retrovirus, has been approved for management of patients with symptomatic
      HIV infection. GM-CSF not only stimulates the bone marrow, it enhances the function of mature
      blood cells and has been found to enhance the ability of AZT to suppress HIV replication in
      vitro (test tube). Combination therapy with GM-CSF and AZT may lower complications as well as
      the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection.

      Colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is administered subcutaneously, once a day or every other
      day, for 4 weeks to AIDS and advanced ARC patients who have been receiving and will continue
      to receive a constant dose of AZT. Treatment is on an outpatient basis.
