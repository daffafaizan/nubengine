      (NRTIs) are recommended by the current guidelines all around the world as the main background
      drugs for initial therapy of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. This
      indication is based in results of clinical trials, but patients who participate in these
      studies usually are greatly motivated to continue their prescribed regimen, and can be
      different from the "real life". Therefore, clinical practice often cannot reproduce published
      results.

      Methods: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was performed with 36 na√Øve-treatment
      patients, who started therapy with LPV/r or EFZ, with follow-up of 36 months. The primary
      endpoint was virological success (HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) in the first six months and at the
      end of the study. Effectiveness was examined comparing time to virological failure and CD4
      recovery.
