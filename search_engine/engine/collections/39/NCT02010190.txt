    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate biomarkers of vascular injury (inflammation, hemostasis, endothelial
           activation) among childhood cancer survivors compared to age/gender-matched controls.

        -  Assess vascular function among childhood cancer survivors compared to age/gender-matched
           controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Investigate additional biomarkers of vascular health and function among childhood cancer
           survivors compared to age/gender-matched controls.

      Eligible persons who consent to participate in this trial will be asked to do the following:

        -  Vital sign measurement including resting heart rate, blood pressure, height, and weight.

        -  Biomarker analysis will be completed by the Cytokine Reference Laboratory, Department of
           Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School and the Vascular Biology Center
           (VBC), Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School.

        -  An echocardiogram to assess cardiac function.

        -  Pulse wave analysis will be measured with the CR-2000 Cardiovascular Profiling System.

        -  Pulse contour analysis will be studied using the Endo-PAT2000 system.

        -  Pulse wave velocity will be assessed using the SphygomoCor CVP Clinical System.
