      and November 2013, with a population of 6-14 year olds seeking entry to the program. During
      an application period (May-July 2012), 2,603 guardians (the experimental cluster) applied on
      behalf of 2,999 6-14 year olds. Approximately half of the guardians were randomly offered
      early admission in September 2012, with the rest offered admission in September 2013.
      Baseline and follow-up data were collected on outcomes which will be explored for full-group
      and specific sub-groups (children with less educated mothers, and boys or girls exposed to
      violence).
