      approximately 12-hour intervals. Patients randomized to the imatinib 400 mg arm will receive
      imatinib once a day throughout the study.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the rate of Major Molecular Response(MMR) at 12 months (1
      month = 4 weeks = 28 days), defined as BCR ABL1/ABL% â‰¤ 0.1% by international scale. The
      Molecular Response(MR) rate will be measured every 3 months by Real-time
      Quantitative(RQ)-Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) in a central laboratory. All patients will be
      treated and/or followed for 12 months (48 weeks) after randomization.
