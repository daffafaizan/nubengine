      however in recent years, the use of CT-coronary angiography has emerged in the literature for
      being a non-invasive and well tolerated examination, with imaging findings often equivalent
      to standard coronary angiography, especially for imaging grafts in patients undergone
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

      These patients present with complex anatomy of the coronary arteries making invasive coronary
      angiography a demanding and time-consuming examination in which the patient is exposed to
      large doses of radiation and volume of contrast.

      Multislice computed tomography shows high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of obstruction
      of the grafts while the advancement of technology continuously improves the diagnostic
      accuracy of the imaging findings. Of course, axial coronary angiography is more sensitive and
      specialized in the imaging of grafts, compared to the native coronary arteries of the heart.

      Therefore, the use of CT-coronary angiography before performing the respective invasive
      procedure is believed that it may reduce the overall duration of the procedure, the radiation
      received by the patient and the amount of contrast administered.

      The aim of the present study is to compare the performance of CT-coronary angiography before
      invasive coronary angiography compared with the performance of invasive coronary angiography
      alone. Î¤he extent to which the information obtained from CT-coronary angiography contributes
      to the guidance of invasive coronary angiography that will follow will be studied, regarding
      the total procedure time, the volume of the contrast administered the radiation to which the
      patient is exposed and the patient's course over a period of 30 days.
