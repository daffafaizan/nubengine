      Flotation-REST may be an effective treatment for reducing pain but little is known about the
      short-term effects of a single session of Flotation-REST on the day-to-day variability of
      pain, stress, and sleep. Sleep, stress, and pain are all bidirectionally related to each
      other, and previous research shows that Flotation-REST may positively influence all three of
      these outcomes. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to examine changes in pain,
      stress, and sleep following Flotation-REST. The secondary aim is to investigate whether
      various subjective experiences during the intervention are associated with changes in pain,
      stress, and sleep following the interventions.
