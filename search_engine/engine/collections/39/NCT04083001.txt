      studies and the excellent results of biocompatibility tests reported in the Investigator's
      Brochure allowed to design a clinical investigation in humans named MATRISS. As this is a
      First-In-Man (FIM) study assessing OTR4132-MD, it is designed as a single ascending dose
      (SAD) to evaluate the safety, tolerability of a single intra-arterial injection of OTR4132-MD
      in AIS patients treated with combined thrombolysis and thrombectomy.

      The FIM will include up to 18 patients in up to five dose groups. Each group will comprise 3
      subjects. This FIM study will also monitor a dose response relationship in humans: lesion
      volume change throughout the study period. Patients will be given a single intra-arterial
      injection of OTR4132-MD with a predefined dose of OTR4132. In the first dose group, the
      OTR4132 dose is 0.20 mg.

      The results of this study will serve as a groundwork for the design of a pivotal study in the
      intended patient population.
