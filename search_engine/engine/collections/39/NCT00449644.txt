      (Stage 1) and a proof of effectiveness stage (Stage 2). During Stage 1, a panel of 50
      participants will be randomized (participants are assigned different treatments based on
      chance) to receive either TMC207 or placebo for 8 weeks on top of a BR. In Stage 2, another
      panel of 150 participants will be randomized to receive either TMC207 or placebo for 24 weeks
      on top of a BR. TMC207 will be dosed as 400 mg every day for the first 2 weeks, and as 200 mg
      3 times/week for the following 6 or 22 weeks during Stages 1 and 2, respectively. When the
      participants in Stage 1 have completed 8 weeks double-blind (neither theparticipant nor the
      physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage) treatment with
      TMC207 or placebo (or have discontinued earlier), the primary Stage 1 analysis will be
      performed on all data of the first 8 weeks of treatment. Following this Stage 1 analysis,
      Stage 2 will be initiated and a panel of 150 new participants will be enrolled. After the
      double-blind treatment phase in both Stage 1 and Stage 2, participants will continue to
      receive MDR-TB treatment as per national treatment guidelines. They will be followed for
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and microbiological efficacy for 96 weeks after
      receiving their last dose of TMC207 or placebo. The Data Safety Monitoring Board Committee
      will review these data on a regular basis. The DSMB/DSMC is a group of experts in
      tuberculosis and clinical trial conduct who have no commercial interests in the development
      of TMC207 and the company (Tibotec, BVBA) that is developing the new TB drug.
