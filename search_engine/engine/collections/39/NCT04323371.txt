    
      Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a heterogenous syndrome with in-hospital mortality up to 60%, that,
      unfortunately, has remained stagnant over the time, despite observed improvements with
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological approach, even though only in terms of haemodynamic
      stabilization.

      While very early mortality in CS is largely related to sudden and severe circulation failure,
      subsequent death is strongly influenced by activation of neurohumoral and inflammatory
      response leading to multiorgan failure. Previous studies on CS have almost exclusively been
      focused on CS following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients with acutely decompensated
      heart failure (ADHF) represent a different pathophysiologic phenotype compared with acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, which may lead to a differential response to device
      therapy.

      In the face of complex biological phenomena guidelines are incapable of distinguishing the
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and give us input to standardize, whereas there is
      an unmet need for a personalized medicine.

      The evaluation of changes and the relationship among markers of inflammation (IL-6) and
      markers of increased endothelial permeability (Ang-2) or endothelial glycocalyx perturbation
      (Syndecan-1 and HS) and an exploratory analysis throughout targeted metabolomics may help us
      to better understand the time course of different biological mechanisms involved in CS.
