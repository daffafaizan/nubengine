      each participant, after admission to hospital with a diagnosis of mild to moderate COVID-19
      infection, will be administered either a dose of rapamycin or the placebo daily. Each subject
      will receive the assigned treatment until hospital discharge or death. Evaluations will be
      performed at the beginning of the clinical trial and then daily up to 4 weeks.
