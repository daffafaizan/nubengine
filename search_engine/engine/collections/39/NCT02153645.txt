      enrolled. Amantadine has been used for many years as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. It
      has been reported in the literature to effectively treat the motor complications of levodopa,
      especially dyskinesia, but it must be given 2 to 4 times a day. The purpose of this
      multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 16 week study is to compare the
      efficacy and safety of two different dose levels of Amantadine Extended Release Tablets to
      placebo for the treatment of levodopa induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's
      disease. The dose will be given once a day in the morning so that amantadine concentrations
      are maintained throughout the day for treating the levodopa induced dyskinesia, but will be
      lower during the night, potentially reducing the negative impact of amantadine on sleep.
