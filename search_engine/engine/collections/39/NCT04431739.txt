      and metastatic compression fractures may be mistaken for each other in the acute phase (Wong
      and Suresh, 2018). Edema in the acute phase of benign fractures may replace normal bone
      marrow and cause hypointense signal changes in T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal
      changes in T2-weighted images, at the same time taking contrast material. These changes are
      also typical for metastasis and cause confusion in diagnosis when only one lesion is present
      (Mauch et al., 2018).

      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has recently appeared as a new method of screening in
      characterizing lesions without necessitating contrast material and in evaluating the
      vertebrae quantitatively (Lee et al., 2019) Diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI) provides
      microscopic information from water protons which is not possible using conventional magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) (Partridge et al., 2017). DWI measures the random (Brownian) extra,
      intra and transcellular motion of water molecules (Ahlawat and Fayad, 2018)
      Apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC) is a quantitative parameter calculated from DWI that
      combines the effects of capillary perfusion and water diffusion (Wang et al., 2018) In a
      comparatively small number of surveys, ADC values have been studied in discriminating the
      infectious lesions from the malign lesions The utility of apparent diffusion coefficient
      obtained in diffusion-weighted MR imaging for the differentiation between benign and
      malignant vertebral lesions, and to determine the sensitivity and the specificity in
      differentiating benign and malignant vertebral lesions according to the optimal cutoff ADC
      value (Dahnert et al., 2017)
