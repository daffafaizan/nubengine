        -  Determine the pathologic complete response rate in patients with locally advanced cancer
           of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with radiotherapy administered
           concurrently with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and fluorouracil before esophagectomy.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the tumor response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the relationship between the presence of genetic polymorphisms in these patients
           and the toxicity of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1 and 22 and
      fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-42. Beginning on day 1 of chemotherapy, patients
      undergo radiotherapy to the esophagus 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding
      disease at 4-8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy undergo esophagectomy and complete
      dissection of the mediastinal and perigastric lymph nodes. Beginning 8 weeks after surgery,
      patients who underwent curative resection may receive a maximum of 2 additional courses of
      paclitaxel and carboplatin in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before chemotherapy on days 1 and 22, and within 2
      weeks before surgery.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 4 years.
