      study that will assess the potential interactions between IV cocaine and 3 escalating oral
      doses of GBR 12909. The primary objective is to determine safety of GBR 12909 administration
      and if there are significant interactions between GBR 12909 treatment concurrent with IV
      cocaine infusions.
