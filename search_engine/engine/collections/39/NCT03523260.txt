      tunneled dialysis catheters (TDC) for hemodialysis access. The primary objective of this
      study is to compare outcomes of participants who undergo left internal jugular placement of a
      split-tip versus a step-tip versus symmetric tip catheter. Participants will be randomized to
      receive a split-tip, step-tip or symmetric tip catheter in a 1:1:1 ratio. All participants
      will be followed per their referring physician's standard of care. Information regarding any
      patient complications will be obtained from Dr. Allon's dialysis patient database (Vascular
      Access in Hemodialysis Patients, IRB # X980813005). This study will review and compare the
      complication rate and function of the three catheter designs. There are no studies to our
      knowledge that compared catheter designs placed specifically via the left internal jugular
      vein. The investigators hypothesize that because the left internal jugular vein is
      anatomically more complex than the right one, tunneled dialysis catheters with split-tip
      design may perform sub-optimally, compared to step-tip and symmetric tip designs, when placed
      via the left internal jugular vein. If this hypothesis is true, the results of the study may
      influence future clinical practice and reduce the rates of replacement of catheters placed
      through the left internal jugular vein, resulting in better patient care and significant
      cost-savings.
