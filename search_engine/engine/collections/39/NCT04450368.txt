      in the United States. Exacerbations, a worsening or "flare up" of symptoms cause most COPD
      hospitalizations. Early detection of lung function deterioration would facilitate early
      intervention and help prevent hospitalizations, since most exacerbations can be treated with
      changes of inhalers and/or oral medications. Air trapping, defined as an abnormal increase in
      the volume of air remaining in the lungs after exhalation, is a common finding in all forms
      of COPD. Air trapping has been shown to increase during exacerbations and decrease when
      exacerbations resolve. Moreover, increasing recent evidence indicates that air trapping is an
      earlier harbinger of deteriorating lung function than spirometric changes. Recent research
      shows that lung air trapping can be measured by low-frequency ultrasound (1-40 kHz). Thus,
      acoustic monitoring of air trapping could provide clinicians with a non-invasive tool to when
      medical intervention is needed to avoid unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations. The
      investigators have developed a low-cost, non-invasive, acoustic-based wearable device, Sylvee
      that is capable of continuous monitoring of lung resonance. The device has machine-learning
      algorithms that can detect minor changes in lung resonance, which our preliminary results
      suggest corresponds to changes in air trapping. The overall objective of this pilot project
      is to validate Sylvee's algorithms in a cohort of 60 patients with COPD and variable degree
      of air trapping. Ultimately, Sylvee will allow physicians to remotely monitor their patients'
      lung function and adjust their medications to reduce healthcare costs and improve patients'
      quality of life.
