      quality of treatment, the national cancer plan aims at a unified certification of cancer
      centres.

      The project "Wirksamkeit der Versorgung in onkologischen Zentren" (WiZen) investigates
      effects of treatments in certified cancer centres across large populations and different
      cancer entities in comparison to hospitals that do not hold a certificate.

      WiZen is a retrospective comparative cohort study that analyzes incident cases of eight types
      of cancer diagnosed within 2009-2017 based on nationwide health insurance data provided by
      WIdO (the AOK research institute) and data from regional clinical cancer registries (CCR) for
      the period 2006-2017. These eight types of cancer are colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer,
      breast cancer, gynecologic tumors, lung cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck tumors and
      neuro-oncological tumors.
