    
      The specific objectives are:

        1. To determine the fungal species causing invasive fungal infection in different parts of
           the world.

        2. To determine the clinical pattern of disease and document procedures performed for
           confirmation of the diagnosis.

        3. To describe the therapeutic regimens used and their efficacy.

        4. To share clinical isolates among the contributors of Fungiscope.

        5. To develop molecular biology tools for identification of strains in histopathologically
           proven invasive fungal infection.
