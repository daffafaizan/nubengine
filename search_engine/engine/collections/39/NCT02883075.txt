      or when the health of the baby or mother is compromised. Cesarean section may be planned,
      urgent, or performed emergently when the life of the baby or mother is threatened.

      Cesarean section is performed using different anesthetic techniques including: spinal,
      epidural, combined spinal and epidural, and general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is the most
      common technique chosen due to its relative safety, rapid onset and avoidance of potential
      complications from general anesthesia. It is the technique of choice for elective cesarean
      section unless contraindicated. Spinal anesthesia causes sympathetic blockade followed by
      sensory and motor blockade. Nerve fiber size explains the speed of onset and differential
      block. The critical moments during spinal anesthesia come as soon as local anesthetic is
      injected into the subarachnoid space.
