      disorders, proven by clinical practice and many epidemiological studies, genetic and
      neuroscience. This gives risk to the diagnosis of Dual Pathology: an addiction and another
      mental disorder.

      Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that anterior cingulate cortex is associated with
      substance´s dependence and craving. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) stimulates
      parts of the brain and can change it´s activity.

      Researchers are interested in reduce cravings for substance dependence on patients with Dual
      Pathology using tRNS in anterior cingulate cortex.

      Aims: To determine whether tRNS in anterior cingulate cortex can reduce craving over Dual
      Pathology patients.
