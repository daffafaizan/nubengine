      in finger photoplethysmographic waveform of surgical patients is related to a local or a
      sistemic changes in the vascular tone. The investigators will studied 15 patients undergoing
      regional brachial plexus anesthesia for upper limb surgeries. Photoplethysmography will be
      continuously recorded in the thumb of the tested hand (anesthetized hand) and in the thumb of
      the control, opposite hand. Duplex color and power Doppler will measure flow in the both
      brachial arteries and in the aorta (supraesternal view). The contour analysis of both,
      photoplethysmogram and arterial flow velocities will be analyzed, correlated and compared.
