      surgically. Forty-four patients (64 sides) were treated with the supratemporalis approach,
      and forty patients (48 sides) were treated with traditional preauricular approach. Data on
      the surgical procedures and complications were recorded. The follow-up periods were 12
      -24months. The evaluated parameters include facial nerve injury，the maximum mouth opening,
      mandibular movements, occlusion, scar formation，hemorrhage and infection.Seven patients
      sustained facial nerve paresis in the group treated with the traditional preauricular
      approach. No case of facial nerve injury was observed in the supratemporalis approach group.
      No other significant differences were detected between the two groups in the functional and
      esthetic aspects.
