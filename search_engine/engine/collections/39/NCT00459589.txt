      population during tumour progression. It's well established that loss of weight is poor
      prognosis factor in patients treated by chemotherapy in digestive cancers. Small number of
      studies assessing undernutrition, its management and consequences on prognosis were
      published. Previous study lead by our team in oncogeriatry in Aquitaine accrued 364 patients
      more than 70 years old and treated by chemotherapy for cancer. Median follow-up at 13 months
      for intermediary analysis about 155 first patients revealed at first geriatric evaluation, 28
      pts (18.7%) were malnourished (MNA<17) and 72 pts (48.0%) at risk of malnutrition (MNA 17 to
      23.5). At one year median follow-up major mortality was observed in 20 (71.4%) undernourished
      patients, 34 (47.2%) patients at risk of undernutrition and 13 (26.0%) patients without
      nutritional problem. According to consensus undernourished patients received nutritional
      support. Management of patients at risk of malnutrition is not clear. Our hypothesis is that
      nutritional support in patients at risk of undernutrition detected during geriatric
      evaluation could increase survival, safety, functional status and quality of life of
      patients. We construct an open multicentric two group randomized trial comparing usual
      nutritional management versus usual nutritional management plus nutritional intervention with
      dietician at each cycle of chemotherapy in 6 first cycles to maintain 30 kcal/kg/d and 1.2
      protein/kg/d. Principal objective is to increase survival at 1 year with 10%. According to
      O'Brien and Fleming method we have to include 410 pts in each group, about 1640 pts will be
      evaluated by MNA test.
