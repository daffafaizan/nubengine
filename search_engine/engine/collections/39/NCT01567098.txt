      become more popular and various case series and reports had described its feasibility in many
      general surgical procedures including appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and colectomy. Despite
      this, strong evidence in support of SILS to be equivalent or even superior to conventional
      multi-port approaches remain scarce, although there are case series and comparative studies
      with promising results in cholecystectomy and colectomy. There are many case series available
      stating that single incision appendectomy may be a feasible alternative to conventional
      approach, but may be at the expense of a longer operating time and a higher post operative
      wound pain score. A recent randomized trial by St. Peter et al. was the first to test the
      feasibility of this approach to standard 3-port approach in appendectomy in children. Under
      randomized settings of this trial the single incision appendectomy produced longer operating
      times and resulted in greater charges. However, the primary outcome measure in this trial was
      wound infection and the result showed no significant differences between the two approaches.
      The answer to whether single incision appendectomy produces a longer operating time when
      compared to conventional 3-port approach remained undetermined, in particular the adult
      population, and therefore a randomized trial design based on operating time as its primary
      outcome is desired.
