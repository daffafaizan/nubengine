    
      Patients with macular holes classified in stages 3 and 4 will be randomized into 2 groups. .
      In Group A, patients will undergo peeling with complete removal of the internal limiting
      membrane (ILM) and in the group B, the inverted ILM peeling technique will be performed. The
      20% sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas will be used as a tamponade agent in all surgeries, and
      patients will be instructed to avoid the prone position for 5 days.

      OCT images will be performed in the first 5 postoperative days and months 1, 3 and 6.

      The primary outcome is anatomic closure of the MH closure in the month 6. The second outcomes
      are: mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at month 6, mean change in the BCVA at month 6;
      integrity of the perifoveal external limiting membrane and ellipsoid zone on Optical
      Coherence Tomography (OCT); MH closure rate over time in days; functional improvement of
      microperimetry Statistical analysis will be performed with Student t-test and the p-value of
      â‰¤ 0.05 is considered significant.
