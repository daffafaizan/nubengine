      through childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood in our ongoing study (PRO15080516 -
      Effects of Prenatal Cocaine Use: 25-Year Follow-Up). Further, 21-year-olds with PCE in our
      study were twice as likely to have been arrested as non-exposed offspring, were more likely
      to be diagnosed with Conduct Disorder, had higher disinhibition scores, were significantly
      more likely to use alcohol and marijuana earlier, and to have earlier sexual intercourse. The
      effects of PCE on the developing nervous system may cause changes in brain function that
      underlie these behavioral outcomes.

      This study seeks to examine dopamine (DA) transmission in vivo, using positron emission
      tomography (PET) with [C-11]NPA, in striatal regions of interest in subjects who have a
      history of exposure to prenatal cocaine (PCE). We hypothesize that PCE is associated with
      increases in dopamine in the striatum relative to COMP. This may explain the impulsivity and
      high risk behaviors in PCE subjects
