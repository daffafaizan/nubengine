      sensors placed in two locations: forehand and finger. Each subject will serve as their own
      control, with measurements of signal quality evaluated at 2 second intervals over a period of
      one hour. The measurements will be recorded simultaneously with a computer program and laptop
      computer. Finger and forehand sensors will be applied according to manufacturer's guidelines.
      An output connection will be made from each pulse oximeter computer unit to a password
      protected, laptop computer for data downloading. Data will be collected for a 1 hour period
      at 2 second increments and stored in the hard drive of the laptop. Following completion of
      data collection, the study sensors will be removed.
