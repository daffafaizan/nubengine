      selectively enrich beneficial bacteria in the human gut and will be tolerated in healthy
      participants compared with a placebo control supplement. Each participant will consume two
      sachets of supplement for eleven days, separated by a two-week washout before starting the
      second and third arms. To determine the effect of dose, the placebo-control supplement will
      be administered in the first arm, followed by the low and high dose. Participants will
      collect stool and first morning urine and study personnel collected blood from each
      participant at baseline (day 0) and at the end (Day 11) of each study arm for all three arms.
