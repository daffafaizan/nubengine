      development on treatment adaptation, quality of life and well-being in schizophrenia patients
      and the interaction between these variables over time.

      The study was conducted with 42 schizophrenia patients (n=21 intervention group; n=21 control
      group) using a quasi-experimental research design. Patients were evaluated using a pre-test,
      post-test, monitoring test, "Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS)", "Quality of Life
      Scale for Schizophrenia (QLSS)" and "Flourishing Scale" (FS). The measurements were taken 3
      times: pre test, post-test and 3-months post-test.
