    
      An evaluation of the incidence of complications resulting from far lateral spine surgery
      utilizing the K2M RAVINE® Lateral Access System (RAVINE) with ALEUTIAN® Lateral Interbody
      Spacer System versus literature reported results for the NuVasive XLIF® system (XLIF) in the
      treatment of degenerative disc disease (DDD) with up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L2-S1
      requiring surgical intervention at one or two contiguous levels. Safety will be assessed by
      the following: 1.) Evaluation of all adverse events including device related, procedure
      related and additional serious adverse events; 2.) Additional surgical intervention at the
      operative site including the need for removals, revisions, re-operations or supplemental
      fixation required to modify the device; and 3.) The incidence and severity of any psoas
      muscle injury, genital femoral nerve injury and lumbar plexus injury will be determined for
      all patients. Supplemental fixation of any kind may be included as long as the procedure is
      completed via a minimally invasive approach.
