      resulted in enhanced expression of heat shock proteins in the retina. To test clinical
      efficacy of sub-visible retinal therapy using ms-range exposures of visible lasers one needs
      first to establish proper titration methods necessary to assure on one hand the lack of
      tissue damage, and on the other hand sufficient hyperthermia to elicit cellular response. We
      used an algorithm based on computational and experimental data to provide parameters that can
      cause photothermal stimulation to the retinal pigment epithelium without causing collateral
      damage to photoreceptors or choroid. This method will be used to treat macular diseases such
      as diabetic macular edema, branch retinal vein occlusion macular edema, chronic central
      serous retinopathy and macular telangiectasia.
