    
      HAE is characterized by recurrent localized angioedema caused by uncontrolled activation of
      the complement and contact systems due to a congenital deficiency of functional C1 inhibitor.

      rhC1INH has been developed to offer a more widely available therapeutic alternative to the
      existing plasma-derived C1INH (pdC1INH) products that have been used in the treatment of
      acute angioedema attacks patients with HAE.

      Patients who have qualified for enrollment in advance and who present to a study center
      within 5 hours of onset of an attack will be evaluated for eligibility. 75 eligible patients
      will be randomized (3:2) to receive an intravenous infusion of rhC1INH or saline in a
      double-blind fashion. Open-label rhC1INH may be provided as rescue medication to patients who
      do not experience the beginning of relief within 4 hours or who experience life-threatening
      oropharyngeal-laryngeal angioedema symptoms.

      Any patient having received a randomized treatment will be allowed to receive treatment with
      rhC1INH in an open-label fashion for subsequent eligible attacks.
