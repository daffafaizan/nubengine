      prognostic value in outpatients with cirrhosis, but its usefulness in hospitalized patients
      has not been studied. Objective: To analyze the prognostic value of PA in hospitalized
      patients with cirrhosis. Patients and Methods: 100 hospitalized patients with cirrhosis will
      be consecutively included and PA will be determined by bioimpedance at admission. The
      correlation between PA and liver function and frailty markers, and the evolution during
      hospitalization, as well as the incidence of falls, hospitalizations and mortality during
      follow-up will be analyzed. Substudy II. Given the multidimensional nature of the FS, we
      propose a multifactorial non-pharmacological intervention based on evidence from previous
      studies that could be implemented in daily clinical practice. Objective: To evaluate if a
      multifactorial intervention can improve the FS and decrease the related events
      (hospitalizations, falls and mortality) in patients with cirrhosis. Patients and Methods: 150
      outpatients with cirrhosis will be included and evaluated using the Liver Frailty Index.
      Frail and pre-frail patients will be randomized into two groups: one group that will receive
      a multifactorial intervention, consisting of exercise at home, branched-chain amino acids and
      multispecies probiotic for one year, and one control group. The evolution of the Liver
      Frailty Index and other parameters (muscle and cognitive function, bioimpedance, risk of
      falls, quality of life) and biomarkers (miostatin, immune response, microbiota) of FS, and
      the incidence of hospitalizations, falls and mortality in both groups will be prospectively
      analyzed.
