      I. Define toxicity profile of escalating doses of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)
      given in conjunction with a fixed dose of 5 Azacytidine (5AC) (azacitidine) in patients with
      locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and natural killer (NK)-T cell
      nasal lymphoma.

      II. Define the biologically optimal dose of SAHA given in conjunction with a fixed dose of
      5AC in patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NKT cell
      nasal lymphoma based on evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic induction in tumor
      biopsies and plasma.

      III. Study the effect of 5AC on the pharmacokinetic of SAHA in patients with locally
      recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma.

      IV. Assess the effect of SAHA on histone acetylation as measured in tumor and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells of patients with locally recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma V. Assess the effect of 5AC on EBV promoter
      demethylation as measured in tumor patients with locally recurrent and metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma and NK-T cell nasal lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat (SAHA).

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-10 and vorinostat orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with responding disease may continue treatment at the discretion of the principal
      investigator. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
