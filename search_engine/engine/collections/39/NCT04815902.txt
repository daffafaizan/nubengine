      the safety and efficacy of a senolytic agent (Fisetin) and an anti-fibrotic agent (Losartan),
      used independently and in combination, to improve beneficial effect demonstrated by the

      osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II-IV) will be randomized into one of four arms
      (1:1:1:1). All subjects will receive an injection of BMAC. Group 1-n=25: Control (BMA
      concentrate + Fisetin Placebo + Losartan Placebo) Group 2-n=25: BMA concentrate + Fisetin
      Placebo + Active Losartan Group 3-n=25: BMA concentrate + Active Fisetin + Losartan Placebo
      Group 4-n=25: BMA concentrate + Active Fisetin + Active Losartan
