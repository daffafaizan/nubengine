      radiosurgery (active treatment group) or repeated catheter ablation (control treatment
      group). Details on inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided below.

      Randomization Eligible patients will be assigned to 2 treatment arms - radiosurgery (active
      arm) or repeated catheter ablation (control arm) in 1:1 fashion by covariate-adaptive
      randomization algorithm considering age, gender, etiology of structural heart disease (SHD),
      left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)
      level.
