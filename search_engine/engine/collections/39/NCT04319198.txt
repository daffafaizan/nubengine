      receive sacituzumab govitecan therapy at the dose they were receiving in the parent study. No
      participant will receive more than 10 mg/kg dose of sacituzumab govitecan. Treatment with
      sacituzumab govitecan will be uninterrupted as eligible participants rollover/transition from
      the parent study to the rollover study. Participants may continue to receive sacituzumab
      govitecan until they experience toxicity, disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, lost
      to follow-up, or upon participant withdrawal of consent or Sponsor termination of the study.
