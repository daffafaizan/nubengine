    
      This is a 26-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled two-arm parallel-group trial
      of d-cycloserine, a pharmacological treatment selected based on positive results from
      previous preclinical and clinical studies, for the treatment of chronic, refractory low back
      pain (CBP). After a 2-week screening period, individuals will be randomized to receive either
      12 weeks of d-cycloserine or placebo and then followed for an additional 12 weeks to evaluate
      persistence of benefit at study endpoint, 24 weeks after randomization. During the 12-week
      treatment period, participants will undergo evaluation at baseline and at clinic visits on
      weeks 2, 6 and 12 after randomization to assess pain, proper treatment use and side effects.
      During the subsequent 12-week follow-up period, pain and safety will continue to be assessed
      monthly by phone calls. All patients will also be assessed daily using an electronic diary
      (eDiary) to record pain and mood. T1-MRI, resting state fMRI DTI-MRI, and ASL will be
      performed at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks for individuals completing MRI.
