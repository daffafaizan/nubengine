    
      The purpose of this research study is to see if a study drug called rituximab (RituxanÂ®)
      prevents CAV. Rituximab destroys certain types of white blood cells called B cells. B cells
      are important cells in the immune system that help the body fight infection by producing
      substances called antibodies. B cells and the antibodies they produce are also involved in
      some kinds of rejection after organ transplantation. Rituximab decreases the number of B
      cells in the blood and other tissues. The goal of this study is to determine if decreasing B
      cells with Rituximab can prevent injury to the transplanted heart.
