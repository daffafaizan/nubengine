    
      BC-819 (also known as DTA-H19) is a double-stranded DNA plasmid, 4,560 base pairs (bp) in
      length, carrying the gene for the Diphtheria toxin A (DT-A) chain under the regulation of the
      H19 promoter. This is a Targeted Cancer Therapy; DT-A chain expression is triggered by the
      presence of H19 transcription factors that are only up-regulated in tumor cells. The
      selective initiation of toxin expression results in selective tumor cell destruction via
      inhibition of protein synthesis selectively in the tumor cell, enabling highly targeted
      cancer treatment.
