      of blood supply in the surrounding tissue neoplastic lesions can be identified from a
      distance.

      The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a fiberoptic
      probe containing novel Polarization Gating Spectroscopy (PGS) technology to identify patients
      with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) by field effect theory. EIBS markers, deoxyhemoglobin
      concentration (DHb), and average blood vessel radius (BVR) were evaluated in patients with
      PAC versus controls.

      During the subjects' esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with upper endoscopic ultrasound (EUS),
      the new optic probe was inserted inside the endoscope and advanced to the tip of the
      endoscope prior to the scope being withdrawn. As the scope was withdrawn, the light optic
      probe was used to examine approximately 5 sections of the small bowel: 1) directly on the
      ampulla, 2) approximately 5 mm proximal from the ampulla, 3) approximately 5 mm distal from
      the ampulla, 4) 1 cm proximal from the ampulla, and 5) 1 cm distal from the ampulla.
      Spectroscopy measurements were obtained four times in each of these five peri-ampullary
      locations. The rest of the EGD and upper EUS endoscopy procedures were then completed as
      clinically indicated. During the procedure, all visualized mucosal abnormalities were
      recorded and photographed.
