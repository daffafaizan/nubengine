    
      BeSingCardioRehab is an intercontinental, multi-center, retrospective cohort study conducted
      in two cardiac rehabilitation referral centers (Heart Center Hasselt in Belgium and National
      Heart Center Singapore in Singapore).

      Patients will be divided in four groups (1:1:1:1) based on i. whether or not they received
      phase II cardiac rehabilitation and ii. whether they are from Belgium or Singapore.

      The first objective of BeSingCardioRehab is to compare the impact of phase II center-based
      cardiac rehabilitation on Major Adverse Cardiac Events for ischemic heart disease patients
      between Europe (i.e. Belgian) and Asia (i.e. Singaporean) in the long-term. The second
      objective is to compare the efficacy of phase II cardiac rehabilitation on short-term
      morbidity (assessed with the validated SMART Risk Score) between index European and Asian
      ischemic heart disease patients. The level of compliance of the Belgian and Singaporean
      cardiac rehabilitation programs to European guidelines standards will also be evaluated.
