      publications have highlighted the importance of medicines management and have called for
      local strategies to be introduced. An Integrated Medicines Management Programme (IMMP) has
      been implemented within Northern Health and Social Care Trust to ensure that a co-ordinated
      pharmacy service is available throughout the hospital stay for its medical patients. The IMMP
      has resulted in a number of benefits including improved patient safety, more effective use of
      medications, reduced length of stay, reduced readmissions rates, improved communication
      across the healthcare interface and user satisfaction.

      It is widely accepted that a number of medication related problems can occur post discharge
      when complicated medication regimens can often prove confusing. This can lead to
      mismanagement of medicines and early rehospitalisation of patients. Although these problems
      are frequently commented upon, research in this area is still lacking. The present project
      aims to examine an extension of the present IMM service by evaluating the impact/patient
      benefit of a customised outpatient service provided by clinical pharmacy staff to patients
      post-discharge. An increase in patients' medicines adherence, a greater satisfaction with
      information about their medicines, improved beliefs about the necessity of their medicines, a
      decrease in medicines-related problems, a decrease in re-hospitalisation rates, extended time
      to re-hospitalisation, and a decrease in overall costs of patients care is anticipated.

      This study will be carried out as a collaboration between the School of Pharmacy at Queen's
      University Belfast and the Northern Health and Social Care Trust (2 sites; Antrim Area
      Hospital and Whiteabbey Hospital).
