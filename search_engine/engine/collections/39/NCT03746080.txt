    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy of Plerixafor
      administered with a modified radiation regimen that includes a component of WBRT. The primary
      endpoint is 6-month progression free survival post initiation of Chemoradiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the median survival of patients treated with continuous infusion
      plerixafor/WBRT.

      II. To assess the toxicities both short and long term of continuous infusion plerixafor/WBRT.

      III. To assess the patterns of failure (in and out of irradiated brain field, out of brain)
      of continuous infusion plerixafor/WBRT.

      OUTLINE:

      After completion maximal safe surgical resection, patients undergo radiation therapy for 42
      days, initiating whole brain radiation therapy at day 21 (dose 16 of radiation therapy) and
      receive temozolomide daily on days 1-42. Beginning 7 days before the completion of whole
      brain radiation therapy, patients receive plerixafor by continuous infusion on days 1-28.
      Beginning 1 week after completion of plerixafor infusion and 35 days after completion of
      whole brain radiation therapy, patients receive temozolomide monthly for 6-12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for adverse events for 30 days
      after the last dose of Plerixafor and then every 12 weeks for 5 years for survival follow-up.
