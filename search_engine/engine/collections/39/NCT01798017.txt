      regimen for uterine evacuation which consists of 200 mg mifepristone followed 24 hours later
      by 800 mcg buccal misoprostol is acceptable to women and providers and feasible for
      introduction in public sector facilities in Bangladesh. It will also determine the
      feasibility of women availing the option of taking their dose of misoprostol outside the
      facility.

      The specific aims of this project are as follows:

        -  Assess whether a uterine evacuation regimen that allows women the option of taking their
           misoprostol outside the facility and which consists of 200 mg mifepristone followed 24
           hours later by 800 mcg buccal misoprostol is feasible for introduction in a range of
           clinical settings in government facilities in Bangladesh;

        -  Determine whether a mifepristone-misoprostol regimen for uterine evacuation is
           acceptable to women and providers; and

        -  Determine what proportion of women, if offered the choice, would prefer to take
           misoprostol in the facility and what proportion would prefer to take it outside the
           facility.
