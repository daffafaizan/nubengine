        -  Determine the feasibility of cyclophosphamide and surgical resection or radiotherapy
           followed by thiotepa, carboplatin, and autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue in
           patients with recurrent medulloblastoma or supratentorial neuroectodermal and pineal
           tumors.

        -  Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Cytoreductive Phase: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2
           and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 7 and continuing
           until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats after discontinuation of G-CSF for 2-4
           courses. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested after each course of
           cyclophosphamide. Patients undergo surgical resection or radiotherapy after the
           completion of chemotherapy. Patients achieving complete response proceed to
           myeloablative therapy.

        -  Myeloablative Phase: Patients receive thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days 1-3. Autologous
           PBSC are reinfused on day 5 and patients receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 10
           and continuing until blood counts recover. Beginning 2 days after the completion of
           G-CSF, patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Autologous PBSC are
           reinfused on day 5 and patients receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 10 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
