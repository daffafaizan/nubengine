      the harmonic-analysis indexes of the blood pressure waveform (BPWs) to provide information
      about arterial pulse transmission (by monitoring arterial pulse waveform, Cn) and
      cardiovascular regulatory activities (by monitoring coefficients of variation, CVn).

      Secondarily, data on Cn and CVn could be useful for detecting the arterial elastic properties
      induced by external stimulation such as exercise, cold stimulation, mental stress,
      acupuncture, medications such as antihypertensive drugs, or pathological factors such as
      metabolic syndrome, and breast cancer. The collected data may thus provide information about
      underlying health.

      Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical technique for evaluating the pulse and
      hemodynamic changes in frequency. The device obtains a volumetric measurement of an organ via
      optical illumination (e.g LED). PPG has been used to determine the PaO2, heart rate, and
      blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, SBP and diastolic blood pressure, DBP) at fingertip
      and harmonic proportion at fingertip or from the radial artery waveform at the wrist.

      However, to the investigator's knowledge, this is the first preliminary study to determine
      the effects of physical activity on harmonic proportion evaluating by PPG at fingertip.
      Ultimately, this data may help to develop a non-invasive, external device that could rapidly
      detect information about cardiovascular and underlying health.
