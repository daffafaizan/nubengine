    
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions
      characterized by fat accumulation in the liver. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is one
      form of NAFLD that may progress to cirrhosis in some people. Currently, there are no
      medications that are approved for the treatment of NASH. Milk thistle is sold
      over-the-counter as a dietary supplement. Milk thistle has been used for hundreds of years as
      a supplement to support liver function, and is commonly taken by people with a variety of
      liver conditions. Milk thistle may help to reduce inflammation and fibrosis (scar tissue) in
      the liver, so it may be beneficial in the treatment of NASH. As NAFLD is very common in the
      population, there are probably many people with NAFLD taking milk thistle supplements.
      However, there are no published studies of milk thistle in NAFLD. Therefore, this study is
      designed to provide preliminary evidence of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of milk
      thistle in people with NASH.

      Comparison: The milk thistle supplement (called Siliphos) will be compared to a placebo
      (sugar pill) in this study.
