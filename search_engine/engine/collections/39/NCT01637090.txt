    
      Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a rare form of lymphoma of the skin. While early stages are
      usually confined to the skin, later stages may spread to blood, lymph nodes and other organs.
      At this point, patients usually require systemic chemotherapy. This study will investigate
      the effect of everolimus as a treatment for patients diagnosed with CTCL that has either not
      responded to previous treatments or has recurred despite previous treatments. Everolimus is
      the common name for the commercial drug AfinitorÂ® (Novartis). It is approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in kidney and brain cancer. In several different forms
      of lymphomas, everolimus is used as an investigational drug, which means it has not been
      approved by the FDA for this group of diseases.

      Everolimus blocks a protein (mTOR) that helps cells and tumors to grow. Earlier studies have
      indicated that the drug everolimus may work against lymphomas including cutaneous T-cell
      lymphomas. Participation in this study will last as long as the study doctor believes disease
      has not gotten worse, and patients continue to tolerate the study medication for a maximum of
      1 year. Once off the treatment, patients will be followed for two years.
