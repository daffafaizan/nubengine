      left ventricular systolic function. An alternative is pacing the left ventricular apex, which
      has shown more favourable results in terms of left ventricular pump function than the RVA in
      small series. The left ventricular apex may be paced via the coronary sinus tributary (e.g.
      in the anterior cardiac vein). Our study will compare effects of these two pacing sites on
      left ventricular ejection fraction measured by 3D-echocardiography.
