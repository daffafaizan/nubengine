      Placebo and fluoride varnish (conventional prevention) in the management of early approximal
      carious lesions. Early approximal carious lesions refers to decay between teeth, diagnosed
      with radiographs, not extending more than 1/3 of the way into dentin. Management of early
      approximal carious lesions refers to halting lesion progression, or encouraging lesion
      reversal after an early carious lesion is detected.

      SDF provides a novel, low-cost intervention option for managing early carious lesions that
      could potentially bridge the 'gap' between non-operative and operative options; thus,
      postponing the first placement of a restoration. SDF has been used in arresting carious
      lesions for more than 100 years. However, SDF has never been tested in the arrest of
      approximal caries lesions in permanent teeth.

      SDF acts to both prevent and arrest tooth decay in multiple ways: 1) it acts on the body of
      carious lesions by precipitating silver ion into the lesion, thus blocking diffusion pathways
      for cariogenic acids; 2) it interacts with dental enamel leading to the formation of
      fluoroapatite crystals making the tooth surface more acid resistant; and 3) the precipitated
      silver from SDF acts as a bactericidal agent disturbing the formation of cariogenic biofilm.
