      Primary

        -  Assess whether treatment with valproic acid (a type I histone deacetylase inhibitor) can
           alter the kinetics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in patients with
           non-metastatic prostate cancer and biochemical progression.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of PSA response.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients who achieve a complete response.

        -  Assess the percentage of patients who achieve a partial response.

        -  Assess the quality of life of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (observation): Patients undergo observation according to standard of care.

        -  Arm II (valproic acid): Patients receive oral valproic acid twice daily for up to 1 year
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year.
