      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CBL0137. The secondary objectives are to describe the
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and adverse event profile of CBL0137, to describe the
      pharmacokinetic profile of CBL0137, to document any objective responses to CBL0137. This is a
      study of CBL0137 with a standard "3+3" design. Escalation will proceed to the MTD based on
      DLT in the 1st cycle in 1 of 6 participants in a cohort.
