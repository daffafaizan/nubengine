      need recommendations corresponding to their fitness of driving during cardiac rehabilitation.
      Little trial data are known, only a position paper of the German Cardiac Society (DGK) of
      2010 discusses the aptitude of driving a car of cardiovascular patients on experience. For
      judgement and recommendations automotive monitoring via contactless sensors might be helpful.
      Therefore while "driving" in a simulator distinct heart circulation situations will be
      created. Vital signs will be measured via long term electrocardiography (ECG) in comparison
      to contactless capacitive ECG (cECG) measurements via embedded sensors in the car seat as
      well as heart rate and breathing rate measurements via camera.
