      including following dietary recommendations, taking prescribed medications, monitoring
      symptoms, and regular light exercise have been shown to improve quality of life and survival
      in persons with heart failure.

      Both CBT and antidepressant medications have been used in previous studies to treat major
      depression in patients with heart failure. Participants in the intervention arm in this trial
      will start with CBT. Those who do not improve very much within the first 5-10 weeks of CBT
      may also be referred to their own physician to discuss antidepressant medications.

      Heart failure self-care education and support will be provided after the first 8 weeks of the
      depression intervention. The study will determine whether people with heart failure benefit
      more from self-care education and support after their depression has been treated with a
      stepped care intervention, as compared to usual care for depression as provided by primary
      care providers.
