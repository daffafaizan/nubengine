    
      The objective of this clinical study are: to evaluate the long term efficacy of OsteoAMP in
      patients requiring 1 to 2 adjacent level, instrumented posterolateral spinal fusion procedure
      of the lumbar or lumbosacral spine, and to evaluate OsteoAMP in spinal fusion procedures
      based on fusion results, adverse event rates, and pain and health scores.

      Patients that are scheduled to undergo instrumented, posterolateral spinal fusion (PLF)
      surgery as part of their medical treatment and comply with the study eligibility criteria
      will be recruited and entered into the study. Subjects recruited into the study will receive
      OsteoAMP as part of an instrumented PLF surgical procedure. The surgery may also include
      nerve root decompressions through laminectomies and foraminotomies. As is consistent with the
      current standard of care.

      The study involves consecutive patients suffering from lower back and leg pain due to
      degenerative disc disease (DDD), degenerative spondylolisthesis (up to grade 1), and/or mild
      degenerative scoliosis that are candidates for an instrumented PLF with pedicle screws in 1
      or 2 motion segments of the lumbar or lumbosacral spine. Patients will require a total bone
      graft volume of at least 10cc per side per level in the PLF procedure, including OsteoAMP
      granules hydrated with bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and local autogenous bone.

      Subjects will be followed for 24 months post-surgery.
