      study aims to provide effect size estimates and justification, clinical trial and
      intervention feasibility data, and procedural materials for a full-scale randomized
      controlled trial that will determine the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the Dietary
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-a recommended dietary pattern based on proven
      cardiovascular benefits-as adjunct therapy to standard care for adults with uncontrolled
      asthma. Eligible, consenting participants (n=90) will be randomized to receive usual care
      alone or combined with a DASH intervention. Follow-up assessments will occur at 3 and 6
      months. By evaluating a dietary pattern approach to improving asthma control, this study
      could advance the evidence base for refining clinical guidelines and public health
      recommendations regarding the role of dietary modifications in asthma management.
