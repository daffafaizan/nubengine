      32.4%.Coughing response could result in postoperative bleeding,even cause respiratory tract
      obstruction,affect patients' postoperative recovery .Dexmedetomidine,an Î±2 adrenergic
      agonist,has hypnotic,analgesic, anxiolytic,antisympathetic effects,which could facilitate the
      sedation of patients while maintaining their consciousness and keep respiration and
      circulation stable .For these benefits,dexmedetomidine was widely used for general
      anesthesia.However,whether dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of postoperative coughing
      is unclear.Therefore,the investigators conduct this randomized controlled double-blind
      trial,to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine on coughing and postoperative recovery
      quality in patients undergoing tyroid surgery with general anesthesia.
