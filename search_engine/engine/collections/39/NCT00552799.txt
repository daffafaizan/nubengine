      skin and subcutaneous tissue. It currently accounts for 2-3% of UK hospital admissions. The
      average length of in-patient stay is 9 days (Hospital Episode Statistics, Department of
      Health (UK), 2002-2003) and 25-50% of treated patients suffer further episodes and other
      morbidity, such as oedema and ulceration.

      Cellulitis of the lower leg is usually due to streptococcal infection that has entered into
      the body via a relatively subtle portal, such as toeweb fissures. Penicillin is the most
      useful of the commonly used oral antibiotics against streptococci, although other agents such
      as flucloxacillin are often used if staphylococcal infection is a clinical possibility.

      There are numerous risk factors for cellulitis of the lower leg and recurrent disease is one
      the biggest problems.

      Existing evidence for the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent further episodes is very
      limited. Two small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) hint at possible benefit, but these
      studies are very small (16 and 40 participants respectively). Despite this, many physicians
      routinely use prophylactic antibiotics for recurrent cellulitis, although opinions on the
      value of such practice is firmly divided.

      This study will recruit over a 12-24 month period participants who have completed the therapy
      for the current episode of cellulitis. Participants will be followed up for up to 24 months
      with telephone calls at 10 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months and then every 6
      months after completing the intervention. A diary will also be provided as an "aid memoir" to
      phone calls and to note missed tablets and recurrence of cellulitis.
