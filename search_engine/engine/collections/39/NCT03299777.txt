      controls and to find out if the changes are reversible after labor.

      Materials and Methods This prospective observational case-control study will include 50 women
      admitted to the fetal-maternal Unit at 24 - 41 weeks gestation and diagnosed with mild/severe
      preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is diagnosed as a new onset of hypertension over 140/90, at least
      two measurements at least four hours apart, and proteinuria (â‰¥+1 in dipstick or >300 mg/24
      hr) after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive woman.

      A control group will consist 100 normotensive women with normal pregnancy outcomes who were
      admitted to our fetal-maternal unit during the same period. Demographic, clinical, laboratory
      and sonographic data for the women participating will be collected from their chart. All
      patients diagnosed with preeclampsia will undergo the following workup: sign and symptoms
      evaluation, blood pressure follow up, 24-hour protein excretion in grams per day, complete
      blood count, hepatic function test: AST, ALT and coagulation study, HBA1C, coagulation
      function test and fibrotest. The Fibroscan test will be performed by a trained hepatologist,
      who was blind to the women diagnosis. The fibroscan test will be done during the admission
      after the diagnosis of preeclampsia, after delivery and 6 weeks post-partum.

      Commonly used cutoffs are >7 kPa for significant fibrosis. Statistical analysis will be
      performed with SPSS using Mann Whitney test. Continuous variables will be analyzed using the
      student's T test and categorical variables were analyzed using 2. Statistical significance
      was set at a P value of < 0.05. The local institutional review board approved this study.
