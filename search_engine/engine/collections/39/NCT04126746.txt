      collected as part of usual clinical care according to the standard of care transplant
      protocols at each site. Specimens and study data will be collected during standard of care
      visits and study coordinators will review medical records and extract available clinical data
      every 6 months. Study coordinators will collect Pulmonary Function Test data that will be
      transferred to the Data Coordinating Center as in CTOT-20. Subjects will be asked to complete
      quality of life questionnaires on an annual basis.

      The majority of times, blood samples will be collected during clinical care routine
      venipuncture based on clinic visit scheduling. In the rare circumstances in which research
      blood is missed during a standard of care venipuncture or one is not scheduled, a participant
      may be asked to undergo venipuncture for study purposes.

      Standard of care (SOC) bronchoscopies with collection of Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) lung
      fluid will be performed at each center according to clinical management protocols. During SOC
      bronchoscopies, research participants will undergo additional fluid instillation for research
      BAL sampling as in CTOT-20.
