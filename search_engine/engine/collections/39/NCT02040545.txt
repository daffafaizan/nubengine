      immunoassay for monitoring patient estrogen and progesterone levels during treatment for
      infertility using controlled ovarian stimulation (COH) and in vitro fertilization (IVF).
      Specifically, inter- and intra-assay precision, correlation with serum measurements (the
      gold-standard), and user satisfaction will be determined. Ultimately, the potential
      applicability and reliability of salivary steroid monitoring in IVF cycles will be assessed.
