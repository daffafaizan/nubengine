      The study compared the efficacy and tolerability of neoadjuvant lapatinib and paclitaxel,
      versus trastuzumab and paclitaxel, versus the combination of lapatinib with trastuzumab and
      paclitaxel given as neoadjuvant treatment in HER2/ErbB2 over-expressing and/or amplified
      primary breast cancer. Subjects were randomized to receive lapatinib, trastuzumab or
      lapatinib plus trastuzumab for a total of 6 weeks. After this biological window, subjects
      continued on the same targeted therapy plus weekly paclitaxel for a further 12 weeks, until
      definitive surgery (total neoadjuvant therapy duration of 18 weeks). Paclitaxel could be
      initiated at Week 4 if there is evidence of progressive disease (PD) at that time. Within 6
      weeks after surgery, subjects received 3 cycles of adjuvant 5-flourouracil, epirubicin and
      cyclophosphamide (FEC) followed by the same targeted therapy as in the biological window of
      the neoadjuvant phase for a further 34 weeks (to complete 52 weeks of anti-HER2 therapy).

      After completing 52 weeks of (neo-)/adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy, subjects were scheduled to
      attend post-treatment follow-up every 3 months during the first year (months 12, 15, 18, 21,
      and 24), every 6months in Years 3 to 5 inclusive, and annually thereafter up to Year 10. Each
      subject was to be followed for 10 Years. All subjects were to be followed for EFS and OS up
      to 10 years from last subject randomized.
