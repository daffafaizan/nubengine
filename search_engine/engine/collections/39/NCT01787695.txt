      patches affecting the skin and mucous membranes. Mucocutaneous lesions develop secondary to
      selective destruction of melanocytes. The etiology of vitiligo is largely unknown but more
      likely to be multifactorial. There are several theories on the pathogenesis of vitiligo
      including mainly the autoimmune, neurohormonal, and autocytotoxic theories. The autoimmune
      hypothesis has the strongest evidence with alteration mainly in the cellular immune response.

      There are many treatment modalities available for vitiligo, however, none of them cure the
      disease. These include different topical treatments, phototherapy, surgical therapy, and
      depigmentation therapy. Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) is currently the preferred treatment over
      topical psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA), for patients with vitiligo. However,
      overall response of vitiligo to NB-UVB has been variable. Ultraviolet A1(UVA1) phototherapy
      is now useful for a variety of skin diseases, specifically scleroderma. There are only a few
      studies published on the efficacy of UVA1 in vitiligo.

      One of the main side effects of UVA1 is prominent tanning which might be due to melanocyte
      stimulation. Therefore, the investigators hypothesis is that UVA1 will induce significant
      skin pigmentation to improve vitiligo. The investigators plan on conducting a prospective
      single-blind randomized clinical trial to assess efficacy and safety of UVA1 in the treatment
      of vitiligo.

      Study Objectives

        1. To evaluate the potential for UVA1 to induce repigmentation within vitiligo patches.

        2. To assess the side effect profile of UVA1 when used in the treatment of vitiligo.
