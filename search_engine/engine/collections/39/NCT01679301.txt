      they're oxygen saturation (SpO2) is monitored. The study has a cross-over design, in which
      participants will receive their oxygen prescription in two different modes at different times
      during the night. The assignment (sleep vs. continuous mode) to which participants will
      initiate the night will be randomized, and all participants will utilize each of the two
      modes during the study. The hypothesis of this study is that there will not be a significant
      difference in SpO2 for participants while they use the SimplyGo Portable Oxygen Concentrator,
      set in 'Sleep Mode', or pulsed oxygen flow, as compared to their SpO2 while on continuous
      flow oxygen during sleep during the course of the one night sleep study.
