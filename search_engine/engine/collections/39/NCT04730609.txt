      deliveries. Patients will be recruited and consented for the study pre-operatively and if
      they display Grade 3 or 4 shivering at the time of delivery then they will be enrolled in the
      study. Doses of dexmedetomidine will be selected according to a sequential up-and-down
      method, using a biased coin design to find the estimated dose at which 90% of patients would
      have desired effect - cessation of shivering within 5 minutes of medication administration.
      An anesthesia physician not involved in patient care or assessment will prepare the
      dexmedetomidine for intravenous use. Anesthesia will be initiated with spinal anesthesia with
      our institution's typical dosing of 1.6 mL 0.75% bupivacaine with dextrose, 15 mcg fentanyl,
      and 150 mcg morphine.

      Shivering will be graded using a five-point scale as outlined by Crossley and Mahajan.
      Members of the anesthesia team caring for women in the study will be educated on the grading
      scales.

        -  Grade 0: no shivering;

        -  Grade 1: one or more of the following: piloerection, peripheral vasoconstriction,
           peripheral cyanosis, but without visible muscle activity; Grade 2: visible muscle
           activity confined to one muscle group;

        -  Grade 3: visible muscle activity in more than one muscle group;

        -  Grade 4: gross muscle activity involving the whole body
