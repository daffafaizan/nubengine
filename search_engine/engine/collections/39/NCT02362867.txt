        -  Return patient to normal activities or increase mobility by restoring knee function.

        -  Provide stability to enhance rehabilitation without external support.

        -  Eliminate or reduce knee pain.

        -  Assess the clinical efficacy after total knee replacement.

        -  Determine implant survivorship and viability.

        -  Evaluate patient function and satisfaction.
