      chitinase like proteins and is a highly conserved glycoprotein. YKL-40 is produced by cancer
      cells and macrophages and promotes cancer progression by activating inflammation and
      inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Thus, YKL-40 could be a new therapeutic target for patients
      with cancer.

      T-ChOS™ is a technical name for a food supplement product that is marketed in Iceland under
      the name Benecta™. T-ChOS is manufactured using shellfish derived chitin as a raw material
      and is produced by Genis in Iceland. It is a blend of chitooligosaccharides that are
      hetero-complexes of N-acetyl-glucosamine and D-glucosamine. T-ChOS chitooligosaccharides have
      been specially selected to have high bioactivity in inflammatory models and strong binding
      affinity to YKL-40. Chitooligosaccharide induced blockade of YKL-40 signalling pathways may
      represents a promising approach. Pharmacokinetic profile of the T-ChOS in patients with
      advanced solid malignancies is not available.

      Safety and tolerability data will be collected to expand the safety/tolerability database for
      patients with advanced solid malignancies treated with oral T-ChOS. Patients will be allowed
      to receive T-ChOS on a continuous basis and therefore have the possibility to gain clinical
      benefit, if any. Safety and tolerability data collected after pharmacokinetic part of the
      study will be also added to the safety database for patients with advanced solid malignancies
      treated with oral T-ChOS.
