      activity, a large proportion of Chilean children do not meet the physical activity
      recommendations (Aguilar-Farias et al., 2018). Since most children spend a majority of their
      waking hours at school, this environment is appropriate for the implementation of preventive
      interventions, particularly those that include activities promoting physical activity (Naylor
      & McKay, 2009). With the absence of opportunities for physical activity during the school
      day, before-school programs have become a popular option to help children increasing their
      physical activity levels (Stylianou, van der Mars, et al., 2016). Although several recent
      studies support a positive effect of before school-based physical activity on health
      (Westcott, Puhala, Colligan, Loud, & Cobbett, 2015), less literature has evaluate the
      cognitive outcomes (Stylianou, Kulinna, et al., 2016) such as attention capacity.
