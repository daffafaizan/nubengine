      staphylococcus has become the most common nosocomial bacteremia. Despite its prevalence, no
      prospective study has investigated how these infections should be treated. Removal of the
      intravascular device is associated with a reduction in recurrence rate from 20% to 3% but the
      required duration of vancomycin therapy is not known. We propose to test the hypothesis that,
      following removal of the intravascular device, treatment with 2 days of vancomycin is
      equivalent to 7 days of vancomycin.

      INTERVENTION: Randomized double-blind equivalence trial to test the hypothesis that 2 days is
      equivalent to 7 days of vancomycin treatment for intravascular device associated bacteremia
      due to coagulase negative staphylococcus. The definitions for the surveillance of
      intravascular device associated bacteremia from the Laboratory Centre for Disease
      Control-Health Canada will be used.

      MEASUREMENTS: Surveillance blood cultures on days 4 and 9 following removal of intravascular
      device. Relatedness of strains will be determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
