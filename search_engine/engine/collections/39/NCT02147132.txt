      significant difficulty quitting, and there is evidence that a majority of
      methadone-maintained patients smoke most of their cigarettes in the 4 hours following
      methadone dosing. The objective is to provide a preliminary test of the ability of two
      pharmacological treatments, the nicotine nasal spray and varenicline, relative to placebos,
      to reduce smoking during the 4 hours following methadone dosing.
