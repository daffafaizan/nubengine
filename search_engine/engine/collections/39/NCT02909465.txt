      induced agitation has limited its usage by many physicians. As a solution, some propose using
      midazolam or haloperidol before ketamine injection. In this randomized double blind clinical
      trial, patients who are eligible for sedation by ketamine are allocated in 3 groups. In first
      group, the patients will receive 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, in second group 5 mg of haloperidol
      and in 3rd group a placebo five minutes before receiving the sedative dose of ketamine (1
      mg/kg). The patients are assessed for agitation during and after the procedure the
      clinician's satisfaction with sedation instrument is evaluated after the procedure. The
      investigator will fill standard questionnaires for agitation assessment (Richmond
      Agitation-Sedation Scale and Pittsburgh Agitation Scale).
