      detectable and continuously monitored by a physiological control (reserve control)not yet
      discovered.

      High reserve at rest characterizes a healthy person while low reserve at rest characterizes
      low functional capacity e.g. heart failure. The lower the reserve the severer the morbidity.

      The reserve is decreased reversibly with aerobic activity and may reach an exhaustion
      threshold in which the assumed reserve control induces a reversible fatigue and dyspnea which
      dissolve once the activity decreased.

      The reserve may be estimated through CVRI (cardiovascular reserve index) which is computed by
      an algorithm composed of physiological measurements taken during the patient visit (composed
      of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, central venous pressure or its estimation,
      weight, height and gender.

      In this study the investigators evaluate CVRI capability in prediction of functional capacity
      in comparison with the clinical evaluation during the same visit (cross sectional
      comparison).
