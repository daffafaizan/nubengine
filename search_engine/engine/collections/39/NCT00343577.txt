      protein excretion. Proteinuria is recognized as an important risk factor for progression of
      chronic kidney disease. Our hypothesis is that using drugs that reduce urine protein
      excretion (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) will have a beneficial effect on patients with Fabry
      disease who already are receiving enzyme replacement therapy. A longitudinal, observational
      study is being undertaken to determine the utility of these agents in Fabry disease,
      realizing that these agents are primarily indicated for reducing systemic blood pressure, and
      most patients with Fabry disease have relatively low blood pressures at baseline.
