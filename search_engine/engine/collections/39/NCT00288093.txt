      I. To determine the maximal tolerable dose (MTD) of 3-AP administered in combination with
      radiation therapy (XRT) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To document the therapeutic response of this combination in patients with locally advanced
      pancreatic carcinomas.

      II. To establish radiographic correlates using secretin stimulated magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI).

      III. To measure deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) levels in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs)before and after treatment at specified times and try to correlate findings to
      activity and toxicity of triapine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 3-AP (Triapine®). Patients undergo radiotherapy
      once daily, 5 days a week, for approximately 5½ weeks (a total of 28 fractions).

      Patients also receive 3-AP (Triapine®) IV over 2 hours 3 days a week every other week for 5½
      weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 3-AP (Triapine®) until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 1
      year.
