      conducted a study to evaluate the efficiency of experimental desensitizing agents in reducing
      TS caused by bleaching agents.

      Methods. To test experimental desensitizing agents in TS caused by dental bleaching the
      authors selected 113 participants without TS and randomly treated them with T1-16% carbamide
      peroxide (14 days) or T2-35% hydrogen peroxide (single session). The period of the study was
      14 days. Participants (in T1 and T2) used domestic-use (DU) or in office (IO) desensitizers
      (D): Control Group; (DU)- experimental dentifrice with 7,5% of Biosilicate
      micro-particles-(D1); Sensodyne® dentifrice-(D2); (DU)-Odontis RX Sensiblock®
      dentifrice-(D3); (IO)-Biosilicate micro-particles paste, 1:1-(D4); (IO)-bioglass type 45S5
      paste, 1:1 (D6); (IO)-Desensebilize Nano P-(D6). On days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14, the authors
      received the participants to apply IO desensitizers and to record TS with Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS). Data was analyzed with two-way ANOVA (considering time and desensitizing as
      factors) and post-hoc Bonferroni test (α=0.05).

      Results. The use of experimental desensitizing agents G2 and G5 did not cause significantly
      difference in TS comparing to baseline. TS was not significantly different when G2 was used
      after 16% carbamide peroxide and G5 after 35% hydrogen peroxide application. Self-perception
      TS values were significantly (p<0.001) higher than recorded VAS.

      Conclusions. Experimental desensitizing agents containing Biosilicate® can prevent TS caused
      by bleaching agents: in dentifrice form when associated to 16% carbamide peroxide and in
      paste, when 35% hydrogen peroxide is used.
