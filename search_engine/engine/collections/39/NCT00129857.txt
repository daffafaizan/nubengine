      dextro-configuration is compatible with activation of cannabinoid receptors in the brain. It
      combines the ability to block NMDA receptors and neuroinflammatory cascades in the same
      molecule. Dexanabinol scavenges free radicals, protects neurons from toxicity of free radical
      generators and inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced production of prostaglandin E2, NO and
      TNF-a by macrophages in culture.
