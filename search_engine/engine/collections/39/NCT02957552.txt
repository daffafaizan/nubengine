      survival in pediatric liver transplantation (pLT). However, CNI toxicity leads to significant
      morbidity. Moreover, CNIs cannot prevent long-term allograft injury.

      Mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSC) have potent immunomodulatory properties, which may
      promote allograft tolerance and ameliorate toxicity of high-dose CNI. The MYSTEP1 trial aims
      to investigate safety and feasibility of donor-derived MSCs in pLT.

      Methods/Design: 7 to 10 children undergoing living-donor pLT will be included in this
      open-label, prospective pilot trial. A dose of 1 Ã— 106 MSCs/kg body weight will be given at
      two time points: first by intraportal infusion intraoperatively and second by intravenous
      infusion on postoperative day 2. In addition, participants will receive standard
      immunosuppressive treatment. Our primary objective is to assess the safety of intraportal and
      intravenous MSC infusion in pLT recipients. Our secondary objective is to evaluate efficacy
      of MSC treatment as measured by the individual need for immunosuppression and the incidence
      of biopsy-proven acute rejection. We will perform detailed immune monitoring to investigate
      immunomodulatory effects.

      Discussion: Our study will provide information on the safety of donor-derived MSCs in
      pediatric living-donor liver transplantation and their effect on immunomodulation and graft
      survival.
