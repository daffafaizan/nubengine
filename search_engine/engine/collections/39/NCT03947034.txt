      responsible of a wide range of metabolical side effects such as hyperammonemia. Those are
      poorly described, due to the modification of the pharmacopeia, and the recent recognition of
      several of these adverse events. This study investigates the main characteristics of patients
      affected by metabolic side effects imputed to drugs in particular hyperammonemia. A causality
      assessment according to the WHO-UMC (World Health Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Center)
      is systematically applied.
