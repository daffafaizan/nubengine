      gemcitabine chemotherapy. We hypothesize that earlier administration of systemic chemotherapy
      may prolong the interval to distant progression and improve overall survival in these
      patients. In this study, we will treat pancreatic cancer patients with locally advanced
      disease with 3 weeks of gemcitabine, followed by Trilogy(TM) SBRT and additional gemcitabine.
      30 patients will be accrued to this study at Stanford University Medical Center, the only
      site participating in this research study. Treatment on this protocol requires placement of
      3-5 gold (99.9% pure) fiducials for targeting purposes. Four to 7 days after placement of the
      fiducials, patients will then undergo a 4D pancreatic protocol CT scan through the upper
      abdomen. In addition, an FDG PET scan is required for treatment planning purposes. This
      imaging set will be processed for radiosurgery, using a modified linac based radiation
      treatment planning system (EclipseTM). An SBRT treatment plan will be developed based on
      tumor geometry and location. All patients will receive a single fraction of 25 Gy prescribed
      to the isodose line that completely surrounds the gross pancreatic tumor volume (GTV) as
      defined by the contrast CT. Following SBRT, patients will be monitored clinically and
      radiographically.
