      transduced class I peptide-pulsed DC with total volumes for each intradermal injection of no
      more than 1 ml to be split into four injections of 0.25 ml each in four limbs in node
      draining areas (proximal arms and thighs), for a total DC dose of 2 X 10^6, 10^7 or 2 X 10^7
      cells to be administered intradermally. DC injections in one course of therapy will be given
      four times at intervals of weekly for two doses (days 1 and 8 +/- 72 hrs.), then every two
      weeks for two doses (at days 22 +/- 72 hrs. and 36 +/- 72 hours). Cells will be harvested for
      DC administration and a flow cytometry analysis as well as microbiologic analysis including
      bacterial/fungal cultures and gram stain will be performed prior to infusion. All injections
      will be based on number of DC, not number of total cells.
