      rarely recognized, masked by the general state of disability or the presence of other
      neurological complications. With prolonged survival and improved quality of life of
      HIV-infected patients, myelopathy is increasingly becoming a common source of disability. The
      cause of AIDS-myelopathy is unknown, but it is probably an indirect effect of the long-term
      presence of the HIV virus in the nervous system rather than the result of a direct infection.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether methionine, an amino acid present in low
      doses in the normal diet, can improve myelopathy or stop its progression.
