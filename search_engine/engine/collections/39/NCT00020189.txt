        -  Determine the standard response rate (complete response and partial response) and
           duration of response in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of
           the head and neck treated with flavopiridol.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the effects of anti-platelet agents, aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate, on the
           pharmacology of flavopiridol in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of prophylactic anticoagulation with anti-platelet agents, aspirin
           and clopidogrel bisulfate, on the incidence of flavopiridol-related thrombosis in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive flavopiridol IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients also receive oral aspirin and clopidogrel bisulfate beginning on day 0 and
      continuing throughout the study.

      Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3 years.
