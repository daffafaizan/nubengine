      stimulation protocols. These improvements have also moved into the way of administration of
      the different treatments, and at present, with subcutaneous devices, it is possible to offer
      advantages such as the ability to ensure administration of the correct dose or modify the
      dose before charging.

      Simplification of ovarian stimulation protocols can help to reduce physical stress of the
      donors and the cancellation rate. The need for daily injection does not worsen the degree of
      compliance, but it generates some anxiety related to the administration of the right dose and
      / or the possibility of making a unconsciously mistake . Innovations in delivery devices
      could help reduce the stress associated with the stimulation itself and improve the welfare
      of the donor. Given these considerations, the need to develop a stimulation protocol that
      reduces the physical and emotional burden of reproduction treatment is established.

      Corifollitropin alfa molecule is a full-length recombinant FSH generating a sustained effect
      of stimulation; a single subcutaneous injection of this drug is able to replace the first
      seven injections of any daily FSH preparation, so finally, the result would be an overall
      decrease in the number of injections needed for the whole cycle. Pharmacological and
      pharmacodynamic characteristics of corifollitropin alfa could facilitate the design of simple
      stimulation protocols and the need for fewer resources when monitoring the donor, including
      fewer clinic visits.
