      environment are needed to prevent a large projected increase in the incidence of obesity and
      cardiometabolic disease in the U.S. Prior studies from the investigators group and others
      suggests that the human preference for immediate gratification from food drives dietary
      overconsumption, but this knowledge has not yet translated to more effective dietary
      intervention strategies. This project tests whether a novel snack vending machine system that
      uses brief time delays to reduce the immediacy of reward from unhealthy snacks will improve
      the healthfulness of snack choices. This study uses an experimental design to compare brief
      time delays, two forms of 25% differential pricing, and time delays combined with both forms
      of 25% differential pricing on their ability to increase purchasing of healthy snacks. Test
      machines will be placed in existing, high-volume vending locations, and each of these five
      experimental conditions will run for roughly four weeks. Additionally, baseline purchasing
      under no intervention will be monitored for four weeks before and four weeks after the five
      experimental conditions. Specific Aim 2 compares the effects of these five interventions
      against baseline on the proportion of total vending sales from healthy snacks. Specific Aim 3
      tests whether time delays or differential pricing harm overall vending machine sales in the
      test machines. This study not only tests a compelling theory about the effects of time delays
      and immediate reward on food choice, but evaluates the efficacy and feasibility of a novel
      intervention to improve the healthfulness of snack choices in worksites, schools, and other
      settings.
