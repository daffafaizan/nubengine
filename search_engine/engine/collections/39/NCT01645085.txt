    
      An Open-label, Single-center, Randomized, 4-way Crossover Study to Assess the Bioequivalence
      of R406 in Healthy Volunteers when 100 and 150mg of Fostamatinib are Administered as the 13%
      Drug-loaded Tablet Versus the 38% Drug-loaded Tablet.

      Treatment sequences will be determined using two 2-2 crossover designs in sequence, 1 for
      treatments A and B, and 1 for treatments C and D. The order of the designs containing AB/BA
      and CD/DC within the overall design, as well as the order of treatments within each design,
      will be randomized. This gives a total of 8 possible treatment sequences as follows: ABCD,
      ABDC, BACD, BADC, CDAB, CDBA, DCAB, DCBA.
