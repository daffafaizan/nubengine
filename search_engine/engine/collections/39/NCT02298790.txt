      type 2 diabetes, and up to 30% of adults have pre-diabetes. Recent research studies have
      suggested that it is not just what we eat, but also when we eat that may put us at risk for
      obesity and type 2 diabetes. Skipping breakfast and eating late at night have been associated
      with an increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), substantiated by recent animal
      and human experimental studies showing that altered meal timing itself, without changes in
      caloric intake, can influence weight regulation and impaired glucose tolerance. This research
      will determine in prediabetic and non-diabetic participants whether delaying meal times
      worsens glucose tolerance, leads to physiological changes favoring a positive energy balance,
      and increases caloric intake. This research will provide mechanistic insights into the
      metabolic consequences of changing meal timing and may help in evidence-based approaches to
      improve dietary interventions in the fight against obesity and T2D.
