      to corticosteroids would improve 6-month survival of patients with severe alcoholic
      hepatitis. This multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, phase 3 trial was
      conducted in 24 centers located in France and Belgium. Alcoholic hepatitis was biopsy-proven.
      All eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive corticosteroids +
      Pentoxifylline or corticosteroids + Placebo. The primary outcome of the study was 6-month
      survival. Assuming a two-sided type I error of 0.05, a randomization ratio of 1:1 between the
      2 groups, 6-month survival of 64% in the Placebo and Corticosteroids group and of 78 % in the
      Pentoxifylline and Corticosteroids group, we estimated that with 268 randomized patients (134
      in each group), the study would have a power of 80% to detect this increase in 6-month
      survival in the Pentoxifylline and Corticosteroid group.
