      to start mobilizing intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving vasoactive drugs. Before a
      randomized controlled trial can be designed, several uncertainties need to be addressed. This
      includes clarifying what standard care is, what potential recruitment rates would be and what
      the most suitable primary outcome measure is.

      This study is an exploratory observational study which will aim to recruit up to 40 ICU
      patients receiving vasoactive drugs to further clarify standard care and to measure
      preliminary feasibility outcomes.

      Upon enrolment, patients and clinicians will be surveyed about the hypothetical acceptability
      of recruitment into a future randomized controlled trial. Then any routine mobilization that
      occurs whilst the patient is receiving vasoactive drugs will be analyzed, for example, to
      describe how clinicians assessed safety for mobilization. Finally, patient participants will
      be followed up at day 60 to assess the feasibility of measuring candidate primary outcome
      measures.
