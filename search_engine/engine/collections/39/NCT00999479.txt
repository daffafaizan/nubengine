      University of Oklahoma private practice OB/GYN clinic and at the University of Oklahoma
      Resident Women's clinic. After clear and appropriate consent and discussion regarding
      options, we plan to randomize patients to monophasic OCPs vs. placebo following surgery. We
      plan to enroll 35 patients in each arm and follow them for 24 months following the surgery.
      Surveillance with pelvic exam and transvaginal ultrasonography will occur at 2, 6 and 12
      months. The patients surgery will be done prior to enrolling in our study. We will use
      information from their surgery only to confirm the diagnosis of endometrioma. The only
      procedure the subjects will undergo during the protocol are periodic transvaginal
      ultrasonography.
