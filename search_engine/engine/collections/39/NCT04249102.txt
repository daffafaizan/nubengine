    
      All subjects will start with a 7 days run-in phase using their current Flash Glucose
      Monitoring System associated with a blind Continuous Glucose Monitoring system (Envision,
      Medtronic).

      After one week, subjects randomized in the the interventional group will be provided with the
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring (Guardian Connect, Medtronic) and trained by dedicated diabetes
      educators for Continuous Glucose Monitoring usage including insertion of the sensor,
      calibration of the device twice daily and interpretation of the data. Subjects will use the
      sensors according to the license.

      For both groups, insulin doses decisions are made by the participant according the received
      education.

      After one week, all subjects will be contacted by phone focusing on the use of the
      technology. The treatment period is 8 weeks. The last week of the treatment period, subjects
      will use the blind Continuous Glucose Monitoring system (Envision, Medtronic) in addition to
      their allocated Glucose Monitoring system.
