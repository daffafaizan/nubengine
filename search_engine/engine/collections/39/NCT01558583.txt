      ranking and rating, and a balance sheet on screening test preferences for colorectal cancer
      screening and prostate cancer screening using online surveys. Recruitment will be conducted
      through Survey Sampling International (SSI), an online survey research firm. Participants
      will be randomized to one of three arms to take online surveys. Patients will complete either
      a conjoint analysis task, in which they will be asked to make a series of choices between
      hypothetical screening testing strategies with different attributes; a rating and ranking
      task for these same attributes; or they will make a choice after viewing a balance sheet of
      attributes.
