      Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely
      without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants, not everyone who participates in
      this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose you get will
      depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you and how
      well they have tolerated their doses.

      We will actively monitor your condition for up to 30 days after you come off the study. If
      you come off study for a side effect we will monitor your condition until the resolution or
      stabilization of the side effect
