      response seen after conventional chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast
      cancer, using a regimen in which Doxil is substituted for conventional doxorubicin. We expect
      that the low or minimal effect on cardiac function produced by Doxil will minimize any
      additional risk of cardiotoxicity from Avastin. We will also measure left ventricular
      ejection fractions before and after treatment to see if the substantial rate of subclinical
      cardiotoxicity reported by Swain et al 5 and Perez et al 7 can be avoided. The reported rates
      of cardiotoxicity after treatment with relatively high doses of Doxil are substantially lower
      than those of doxorubicin; few data are available to estimate the rate of cardiotoxicity of
      Doxil in patients treated with only about 100 mg/m2 total accumulated dose, the dose to be
      utilized here. The drug has been used in a few patients in the primary systemic therapy
      setting, with no reported clinical cardiotoxicity.

      The expectation is that clinical and subclinical rates of cardiotoxicity will be very low or
      negligible at the total doses to be used here.
