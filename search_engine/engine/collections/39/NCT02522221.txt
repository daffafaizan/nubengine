    
      This will be a randomized, parallel-arm, open-label study comparing the safety and efficacy
      of tecarfarin and warfarin in approximately 1000 subjects who have an indication for chronic
      oral anticoagulation. The study will be fully enriched with subjects who are taking at least
      one CYP2C9-interacting medication and have either chronic kidney disease stage 3 or 4 and/or
      a genetic variant allele for CYP2C9. The study will be conducted at approximately 140 sites
      with experience in the management of anticoagulation subjects. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized to receive either tecarfarin or warfarin for a period ranging from 6 months to a
      maximum of approximately 24 months.
