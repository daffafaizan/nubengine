    
      Study Design: Severely injured trauma patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 70 or
      SBP ≤ 90 with a heart rate ≥ 108 bpm at the scene will be enrolled and randomized to receive
      either 2 units of frozen plasma thawed in the field or normal saline (the current standard of
      care), as the initial resuscitation fluid. After this initial resuscitation fluid, both
      groups will receive the same standard of care, including packed red blood cells, additional
      normal saline, or plasma as needed based on laboratory and clinical evidence of coagulopathy.
      Blood samples and clinical information will be collected throughout the hospital stay up to
      28 days after injury.
