      providing informed consent. Candidates will have their wound cleansed and debrided (if
      necessary), photographed and measured. Blood will be drawn for laboratory analyses. Patients
      will return two weeks later for assessment.

      Upon return, per the original protocol, patient would have been randomized at <20% closure;
      per Amendment 1, if the wound has closed <30% in area during the 2 week Screening Period and
      all other eligibility criteria are met, the patient will be randomized (1:1) to receive
      either AMNIOEXCEL® with Standard of Care (SOC) or SOC alone.

      All patients enrolled in this study will receive SOC. For the purposes of this study,
      Standard of Care (SOC) includes debridement of necrotic/non-viable tissue, moist wound
      dressings, off-loading (where appropriate, DH Walker only) and infection surveillance and
      management. For those randomized to receive AMNIOEXCEL®, in addition to SOC, the tissue will
      be applied after the wound has been debrided and hemostasis achieved. The wound will then be
      dressed with a non-adherent dressing (e.g. Adaptic) and covered with a moisture retentive
      dressing.

      The patient will return once weekly for wound care, photographs and ulcer measurement. At
      each visit, the wound will be assessed and AMNIOEXCEL® reapplied as appropriate, based upon
      physician judgment. All patients complete their participation at Week 6.

      This is an open label study and no attempt will be made to blind subjects or Investigators to
      randomization allocation.
