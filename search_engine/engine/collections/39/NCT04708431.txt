      which is coded for by the androgen receptor gene (AR gene). Individuals with abnormalities of
      this receptor gene can present with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). There are a
      variety of phenotypes including complete female phenotype (complete androgen insensitivity or
      CAIS), ambiguous genitalia in cases of partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS) and male
      phenotype associated with infertility of hypospadias in mild cases of AIS. Complete androgen
      insensitivity is a rare condition with an estimated incidence of 1:20,000-64,000, while PAIS
      is rarer still and mild AIS has likely not been studied enough to ascertain it s prevalence.
      Individuals with complete and partial AIS present some management conundrums as traditionally
      they have undergone gonadectomy in order to avoid gonadal tumors as well as pubertal
      virilization in girls with PAIS. Because this is a rare condition, little is known regarding
      the risks and benefits of gonadectomy, optimal hormone replacement after gonadectomy as well
      as general health in individuals with these conditions. Furthermore, the androgen receptor is
      found in many tissues in the body including skin, bone, muscle, and the neurologic, immune
      and metabolic systems. Finally, some testosterone effects may be through mechanisms other
      than AR receptor and these are not well understood. A natural history study in individuals
      with AIS may provide information regarding health risks and optimal management of individuals
      with AIS as well as elucidate the role of the androgen receptor in human health.
