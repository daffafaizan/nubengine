      persistent epithelial defect or ulcer that can lead to permanent vision loss from corneal
      scarring, perforation or endophthalmitis. An infectious corneal ulcer requires immediate
      treatment with intensive topical fortified broad-spectrum antibiotics to try to eliminate the
      pathogen. Corneal tissue destruction can be caused directly by infectious agents, the
      associated inflammatory response, or by ocular toxicity from frequent dosing of fortified
      antibiotics.1 Sutured amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) has been shown to reduce pain
      and promote healing in human bacterial keratitis.2 ProKera® is a sutureless form of CryoTek
      amniotic membrane that is clipped into a dual polycarbonate ring system with the epithelial
      side up when in contact with the ocular surface. ProKera Plus® contains a double layer of
      CryoTek amniotic membrane tissue to provide extra therapeutic benefit. ProKera Plus® has
      several advantages over sutured AMT including ease of administration in a clinic setting and
      reduced overall procedural cost.

      The role of ProKera® in the treatment algorithm of corneal ulcers has yet to be fully
      clarified. There are currently no prospective case studies comparing the use of ProKera® to
      standard of care conventional treatments in corneal ulcers. The utility of this device would
      provide valuable information in the treatment of bacterial corneal ulcers.

      The objectives are:

        1. To determine if ProKera Plus® can lead to better visual recovery when used with
           bacterial corneal ulcers compared to conventional treatment

        2. To determine if ProKera Plus® can actively modify corneal wound healing during the
           course of managing bacterial corneal ulcers and decrease the overall time to
           re-epithelialization

        3. To determine if ProKera Plus® can decrease pain associated with bacterial corneal ulcers
           compared to conventional treatment

        4. To determine if ProKera Plus® can decrease the amount of corneal opacity and corneal
           thinning associated with bacterial corneal ulcers compared to conventional treatment

        5. To determine if ProKera Plus® can decrease the need for further interventions or
           surgeries related to complications from bacterial corneal ulcers
