      space surrounding the brain (the subarachnoid space) fills with blood. This condition is
      called subarachnoid hemorrhage. The bleeding due to the rupture of a pouch-like structure or
      a bulge (called an aneurysm) that formed on one of the blood vessels is condition called
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).

      In this study, clazosentan is being tested against normal routine medical care to determine
      if clazosentan can reduce the risk of developing complications related to vasospasm and
      permanent brain damage.

      Participation will last for approximately 6 months from the episode of bleeding. For subjects
      randomized in the high-risk prevention group, treatment will start within 96 hours following
      the time of the aneurysm rupture, and be administered where possible, for 14 days. For
      subjects randomized in the early treatment group, treatment must begin within 24 hours of the
      time of the angiogram documenting the cerebral vasospasm necessary for entry into the study.
      Treatment will be administered for a minimum of 6 days and a maximum of 14 days.

      The end-of-study will be conducted as a telephone interview 6 months after the episode of
      bleeding.
