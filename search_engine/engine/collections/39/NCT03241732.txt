      diagnostic evaluation of cTBI patients. The evaluation uses a battery of neurocognitive
      tests, laboratory levels of specific inflammatory compounds, and functional MRI, PET, and
      quantitative EEG. Participants shall be evaluated with this overall test battery initially,
      and then at approximately 3 and 6 months to determine the time course of changes within the
      brain associated with an integrative medicine approach. Three groups of participants will be
      enrolled in the study: anti-inflammatory diet group, a group who receive N-acetyl cysteine,
      and control group. NAC, is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid,
      L-cysteine. It is a common over-the-counter supplement that is also available as an
      injectable pharmaceutical that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose.
      Laboratory studies have displayed some benefits to use of NAC. It has the potential to reduce
      markers of oxidative damage, protect against cell death, and to increase glutathione in
      blood, which might be useful in preventing oxidative damage in TBI patients.
