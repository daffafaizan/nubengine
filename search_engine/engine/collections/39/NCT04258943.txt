    
      The Phase 1 part of the study employs a 6+4 design (no DLT in 6 patients or 1 DLT in 10
      patients) and incorporates additional PK information before escalating to the next dose
      level. If there is unacceptable toxicity or if PK results have exceeded the acceptable
      exposure levels for the adult equivalent dose, further dose escalation will be prohibited.
      The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) is defined as the dose that results in
      equivalent(approximately Â±20% of the adult values) PK exposure to 500 mg/day in adults and
      with 0 of 6 or <2 DLTs observed out of 10 evaluable patients with Ph+ CML and resistance or
      intolerance to prior TKI therapy. The phase 2 part of the study will enroll the following
      patient populations.

        -  Newly diagnosed (ND): newly diagnosed pediatric Ph + CML patients in chronic phase (CP)

        -  Resistant/intolerant (R/I): chronic phase or advanced (accelerated (AP) or blast phase
           (BP) pediatric Ph+ CML patients with resistance or intolerance to at least 1 prior TKI
