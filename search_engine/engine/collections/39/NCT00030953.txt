      The purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of
      Tourette's Syndrome (TS) with nuclear magnetic spectroscopic imaging. The basal ganglia have
      been implicated in the origin of tics, and we plan to use spectroscopy to determine whether
      there is any neuronal degeneration or a decrease in aminobutyric acid (GABA) within the basal
      ganglia, thalamus, or frontal cortex of patients with TS when compared to normal individuals.

      STUDY POPULATION

      This research will be conducted using patients with TS and normal volunteers.

      DESIGN

      Patients and normal volunteers will be scanned with 3 Tesla General Electric (GE) magnetic
      resonance imager using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure N-acetylaspartate,
      choline, creatine, lactate and GABA.

      OUTCOME MEASURES

      Concentrations of metabolites will be compared between two groups.
