      diseases. Morbidity due to STHs is greatest in school-age children who typically have the
      highest burden of infection. In 2001, WHO passed a resolution for the use of large-scale mass
      drug administration (MDA) to deworm vulnerable children. Though effective, there is concern
      that MDA might not be sustainable over extended periods. Additionally the current MDA
      strategy do not consider child malnutrition, a very common malady in resource limited
      countries. The investigators report a pilot evaluation of an innovation that bundles school
      feeding and deworming.

      The investigators designed a maize (corn) flour fortified with grounded dried papaya (Carica
      papaya) seeds and used it to prepare porridge as per the usual school meal recipe. Children
      from three primary schools from Nandi County in Kenya were randomized into three arms: One
      school received 300 ml papaya fortified porridge daily (test school), a second school
      received similar serving of plain porridge without the pawpaw ingredient (placebo) and a
      third school received the placebo porridge and the conventional MDA approach of one time
      400mg dosage of albendazole. Prior to the randomization, an initial baseline stool microscopy
      analysis was done to determine presence and intensity of intestinal worms. Core indicators of
      nutrition-height, weight and hemoglobin counts-were also assessed. The children were
      monitored daily for two months and final stool sample analysis and clinical monitoring done
      at the end of the study. Baseline and follow-up data were analyzed and compared through SAS
      version 9.1 statistical package.
