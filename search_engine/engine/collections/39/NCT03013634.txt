      specific Î±2-adrenoeptor agonist, has sedative and analgesic properties without significant
      respiratory depression at the clinically approved dosage. Some investigations indicated that
      dexmedetomidine was able to protect the myocardium via improving the activity of
      Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphate enzyme and Ca2+-adenosine triphosphate, alleviating
      inflammation reaction and avoiding Ca2+ overload. However, the effect and the mechanism of
      dexmedetomidine on myocardial injury during liver transplantation remain unclear.
