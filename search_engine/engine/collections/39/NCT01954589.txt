      active drug and two on placebo). Each subject will participate in one treatment period, with
      the exception of subjects in the crossover part (i.e., almorexant reference group at the
      fourth dose level), who will participate in two treatment periods. At this dose level
      subjects on active drug (six) will receive in one treatment period ACT-462206 and in the
      other 400 mg of almorexant; subjects on placebo (two) will receive the corresponding placebos
      (double-dummy).
