      neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer, increase appropriate referrals to medical oncology for
      consideration of preoperative systemic therapy (as determined by adherence to NCCN
      pre-operative systemic therapy guidelines), and to improve communication between the
      multidisciplinary team and patient regarding the appropriateness, selection, and timing of
      neoadjuvant therapy. Secondary objectives include a) evaluation of the impact of the
      intervention on actual prescription of neoadjuvant therapy to eligible patients and b)
      evaluation of the impact of the intervention on surgeons and medical oncologists' knowledge,
      attitudes, and beliefs about the benefits of neoadjuvant therapy. We will also explore the
      acceptability and utilization of the Carevive care plan during medical oncologists' initial
      consultations after referral of patients from surgical practices. In this project, 25 newly
      diagnosed breast cancer patients will be recruited over a 3-6 month period, screened for
      eligibility for neoadjuvant therapy, and assessed for patient treatment preferences at time
      of surgical consultation using a novel and commercially available electronic technology, the
      Carevive Care Planning System (CPS). Patients will receive a care plan that explains
      neoadjuvant therapy among possible treatment options. In addition, patients will be screened
      for distress as well as eligibility for genetic counseling (according to NCCN referral
      criteria) and fertility preservation (according to ASCO guidelines) referrals, and the
      Carevive care plans provided will also incorporate personalized referrals to these related
      services where applicable.

      Retrospective chart reviews (from both surgical and medical oncology practices participating
      in this project), complemented by data extracted from the Carevive CPS, will be used to
      assess changes in rates of referrals to medical oncology for discussion and actual
      prescriptions of neoadjuvant therapy, as compared to historical data from prior publications
      documenting low rates of referral to, and receipt of, neoadjuvant therapy. Provider
      questionnaires exploring knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the benefits of neoadjuvant
      therapy will be completed at baseline and again at follow-up (â‰¤4 weeks following intervention
      visit of their last patient) and changes will be explored using a pre-/post-test design. Use
      of a care planning technology to provide tailored education and individualized information
      may provide an easy, accessible and effective way to improve provider abilities to
      proactively identify patients eligible for specific therapies, understand patient treatment
      goals, concerns, drive shared decision making (SDM) and sufficiently collaborate with the
      multi-disciplinary team to provide optimal care.
