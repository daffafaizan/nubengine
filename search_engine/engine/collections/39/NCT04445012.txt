      capable of automatically diagnosing any valve disease present and its severity. This will
      help GPs produce more accurate diagnoses, reduce costs by having fewer unnecessary referrals
      for echocardiogram, and produce more accurate diagnoses in countries where echocardiograms
      are not readily available due to their cost. Using a small sample of data as well as some
      which has been labelled by clinician auscultation, the team has created an award-winning AI
      algorithm capable of accurate detection of heart murmurs. However, in order to improve the
      accuracy and capability of this system more heart sound recordings from a range of diseases
      (matched with echocardiogram diagnosis) are required. The key to the success of this study
      will be to produce an AI algorithm that is more accurate than different grades of doctors at
      detecting the specific abnormality and severity underlying a heart murmur. This methodology
      will also provide a comprehensive study on acoustic characteristics of different heart
      sounds. So far all the acoustic characteristics of heart sounds taught to medical students
      are based on subjective opinion. This study will be able to objectively analyse these
      acoustic characteristics.
