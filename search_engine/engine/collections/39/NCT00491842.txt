      disclosure about Huntington's disease (HD) and HD risk to family and friends, and to
      investigate whether an association exists between disclosure about HD and psychological
      adaptation to HD. HD is reported to be one of the conditions most frequently involved in
      cases of nondisclosure about genetic risk. Little is known about the extent of disclosure and
      the process of disclosure within the HD population. Evidence suggests that a relationship may
      exist between disclosure of one's condition to others and psychological adaptation to the
      condition; however, this theory has never been tested. The conceptual framework of the study
      is informed by Shelly Taylor's Theory of Cognitive Adaptation. We will use a cross-sectional
      survey to 1) investigate individuals' patterns of disclosure about HD and 2) assess
      psychological adaptation to HD. Participants will be recruited from HD clinics, HD support
      groups, HD websites, and HD online mailing listservs. Eligible participants will be asked to
      complete either a web-based or a paper survey. The main outcome measure is psychological
      adaptation to HD.
