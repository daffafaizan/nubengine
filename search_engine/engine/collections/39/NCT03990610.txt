      I. Determine incidence of patients who develop lymphedema following autologous breast
      reconstruction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall complications of prophylactic vascularized lymph node transfers.

      II. Compare the incidence of patients who develop lymphedema following autologous breast
      reconstruction among patients who had prophylactic lymph node transfer and a historical
      cohort who did not have prophylactic lymph node transfer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo vascularized lymph node transfer during standard of care breast
      reconstructive surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and then
      at 1 and 2 years.
