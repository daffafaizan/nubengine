      niche provides important cell-cell interactions and signalling molecules that regulate
      localization and proliferation of myeloma cells. stromal cell-derived factor
      1(SDF-1)/Chemokine (C-X-C Motif) Receptor 4 (CXCR4) plays an important role in this process.
      G-CSF is reported to induce stem cell mobilization by decreasing bone marrow SDF-1. Our in
      vitro study found that G-CSF enhanced bortezomib activity by inhibiting SDF-1/CXCR4. Myeloma
      patients treated with Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone have achieved a
      relatively good response, with an ORR about 80% and complete remission about 40%. We
      hypothesized that G-CSF may mobilize myeloma cells from myeloma niches thus to enhance
      bortezomib activity.
