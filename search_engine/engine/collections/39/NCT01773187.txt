    
      Multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial comparing the safety and efficacy of
      pacritinib with that of BAT in patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis.
      Approximately 322 eligible patients will be randomized in a 2:1 allocation to pacritinib
      (400mg QD) or BAT (includes any physician-selected treatment for myelofibrosis with the
      exclusion of JAK inhibitors (inhibitors of Janus kinases)). Spleen volume will be measured by
      MRI or CT at baseline and every 12 weeks thereafter. An independent radiology facility (IRF),
      blind to treatment assignments, will measure spleen volumes. Patients will also be followed
      for safety, Leukemia Free Survival (LFS), Overall Survival (OS), frequency of red blood cell
      (RBC) and platelet transfusions, and other exploratory endpoints. An Independent Data
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will evaluate the safety of pacritinib.
