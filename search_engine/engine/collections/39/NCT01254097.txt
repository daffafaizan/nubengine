      antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in hospitalized patients. However, the extent to which
      probiotics may benefit healthy adults taking a course of antibiotics has not been
      investigated in primary care. Furthermore, patient willingness to take a probiotic supplement
      concomitantly with antibiotics has not been explored. We aimed to conduct an exploratory
      study using probiotics in adults requiring an acute course of antibiotic therapy.

      Methods Patients prescribed antibiotics for treatment of acute infections in an outpatient
      family practice setting were randomized to receive either a probiotic or placebo
      concurrently. Patients completed adherence diaries and daily symptom checklists to assess
      gastrointestinal and vaginal (women) symptoms and collect information about adherence.
