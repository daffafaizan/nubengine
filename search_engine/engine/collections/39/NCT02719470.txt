      outcomes in Parkinson's disease (PD). While cognitive status is considered as a determinant
      of rehabilitation outcome, no studies about this issue have been performed before.

      Methods: 438 PD patients hospitalized for a 4-weeks Multidisciplinary Intensive
      Rehabilitation Treatment (MIRT) were enrolled. According to Mini Mental State Examination
      (MMSE), patients were divided into: normal cognition (MMSE 27-30), mild cognitive impairment
      (MMSE 21-26), moderate or severe cognitive impairment (MMSE ≤ 20). According to Frontal
      Assessment Battery (FAB), subjects were divided into patients with normal (FAB ≥ 13.8) and
      pathological (FAB < 13.8) score. The outcomes measures were: Unified Parkinson's Disease
      Rating Scale (UPDRS), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Six Minutes
      Walking Test (6MWT), Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale (PDDS).
