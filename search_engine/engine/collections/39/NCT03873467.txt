      metabolic syndrome, pulmonary and heart disease. Approaches to weight-loss are lacking, yet
      necessary, due to the unique physiological and cognitive needs of persons with CVA. There is
      evidence that interventions that improve physical activity and healthy eating behaviors
      concurrently offer greatest potential for weight-loss. The Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB)
      intervention is a 12-month, evidence-based weight-loss program that has been used extensively
      with the general population, but not with people after CVA. Investigators modified the
      program to meet the needs of people post stroke (GLB-CVA).

      Study Aims:

      The study consists of five specific aims.

      Specific Aim 1: To create an appropriate adaptation of the DPP-GLB program that meets the
      unique needs of people post CVA (GLB-CVA) using a Community-Based Participatory Research
      approach and Advisory Board of key stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians,
      researchers).

      Specific Aim 2: To establish the feasibility of delivering the GLB-CVA intervention.

      Specific Aim 3: Conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of
      the GLB-CVA on primary and secondary outcomes in the intervention group compared to the
      wait-list control group at 3, 6, and 12 months from baseline.

      Specific Aim 4: Describe the effect of the GLB-CVA on metabolic biomarkers in the
      experimental group compared to the wait-list control group at baseline, 3, and 6 months.

      Specific Aim 5: Describe the association between biomarkers of neurodegeneration and
      physiologic, functional, and patient reported outcomes at baseline, 3, and 6 months.
