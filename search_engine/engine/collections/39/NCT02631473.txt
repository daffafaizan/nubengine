      Primary

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of a new pharmaceutical formulation of efavirenz
           (NANO-efavirenz) in HIV negative healthy volunteers after single dose and a
           steady-state.

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of a new pharmaceutical formulation of lopinavir
           (NANO-lopinavir) in HIV negative healthy volunteers

      Secondary

        -  To investigate the safety and tolerability of NANO-efavirenz and NANO-lopinavir in HIV
           negative healthy volunteers

        -  To assess the bioequivalence of a selected single-dose of NANO-efavirenz to a single
           dose 600mg of efavirenz as SustivaÂ®

        -  To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition genes
           and drug exposure
