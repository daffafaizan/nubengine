      of the knee in young patients. Real-world, patient-centered data on clinical and imaging
      results after fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation are needed.

      This study is a prospective, observational, unicenter, patient-centered outcomes research
      study. Patients undergoing cartilage repair with fresh osteochondral allograft
      transplantation for osteochondral knee lesions are eligible to participate.

      Clinical results are evaluated from baseline to 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and
      15 months postoperatively. At each time point, participants respond to several
      patient-reported outcome instruments to measure clinical results (IKDC, Kujala, Womet and
      Tegner) and patient satisfaction is captured.

      Imaging results are evaluated with MRI (9 months and 15 months postoperatively) using the
      OCAMRISS evaluating cartilage features, bone features and ancillary features; and with CT (1
      day, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months postoperatively) evaluating subchondral bone and
      osseous integration.

      Variations will be explored using additional or alternative covariates such as concomitant
      surgery procedures, osteochondral allograft morphology, age, sex at birth, IMC, living
      situation and employment status.
