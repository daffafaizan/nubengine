      Primary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer
           that did not progress on prior first-line palliative induction chemotherapy when treated
           with adjuvant gefitinib vs placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of gefitinib in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to initial disease stage (IIIB vs IV), WHO performance status at the
      end of prior first-line palliative induction chemotherapy (0-1 vs 2), best patient response
      to prior first-line palliative induction chemotherapy (objective response vs stable disease),
      and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. In both arms, treatment continues in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 598 patients (299 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 8.5 years.
