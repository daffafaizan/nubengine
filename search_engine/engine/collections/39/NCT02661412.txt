      a frequent alternative for delayed implant procedures. IL concepts reduce chair time, the
      number of surgical interventions and pain, and offer instant comfort to the patient. Its
      reduced treatment time results in obvious socioeconomic advantages. Although there is at
      present abundant evidence that supports IL, evaluation of long-term biological and mechanical
      stability outcomes of large patient populations could allow quality improvement and more
      accurate patient selection. The Departments of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the
      Department of Dentistry of the General Hospital Saint-John Bruges act as one of the pioneers
      of IL in Belgium, routinely performing the concept since 2001.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the biological and mechanical short- and long-term outcome
      of IL in partially or completely edentulous patients. Moreover, the investigators aim to
      detect potential influencing risk factors predicting undesirable prosthetic outcome.
