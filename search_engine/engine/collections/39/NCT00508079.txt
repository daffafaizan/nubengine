      the peripheral veins, which carry blood from the hands and feet back to the heart to receive
      oxygen. The most common cause of peripheral venous disease is a blood clot that blocks a
      vein. Varicose veins, which are swollen blood vessels near the surface of the skin, and
      chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which blood in the leg veins does not drain
      properly, are two other common types of peripheral venous disease. From 1996 to 2000, the San
      Diego Population Study (SDPS) evaluated a group of individuals to gather information on the
      prevalence of venous disease. This current study will re-evaluate the SDPS participants to
      document changes that have occurred in their leg veins over the past 11 years, including any
      new venous disease and any progression of existing venous disease. Study researchers will
      also evaluate how venous disease relates to risk factors, symptoms, and quality of life
      issues.

      This study will enroll people who participated in the SDPS study. Each participant will
      attend one study visit. Study staff will conduct a 1-hour interview with each participant to
      collect information on their medical history, disease-related symptoms, risk factors for
      venous disease, family health history, health habits, and quality of life. Blood collection
      will occur, participant's leg veins will be examined and photographed, and blood flow in the
      legs will be measured with an ultrasound.
