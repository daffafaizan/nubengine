    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. TAK-954 is being tested in healthy
      participants in order to evaluate the effect of the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole on
      the single-dose PK of TAK-954.

      The study will enroll approximately 10 participants. Participants will receive the following
      treatment sequences:

      â€¢ TAK-954 0.2 mg; Itraconazole 200 mg + TAK-954 0.2 mg

      Participants will be given an intravenous infusion of TAK-954 on Day 1 of First Intervention
      Period (6 days) followed by minimum 7-day washout period, after which participants will be
      given Itraconazole capsule on Days 1 to 8 along with TAK-945 infusion on Day 4 of Second
      Intervention Period (9 days).

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall duration to
      participate in this study is 7 to 8 weeks. Participants will visit the clinic on Day -1 and
      remained confined until Day 6 (First Intervention Period) and Day 9 (Second Intervention
      Period). Participants will return for a Follow-up Visit 10 to 14 days after last dose of
      study drug (approximately up to Day 34).
