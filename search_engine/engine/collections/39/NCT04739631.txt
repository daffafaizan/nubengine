      especially in some types of patients with cancer. The effect of acupuncture, an ancient
      Chinese medicine technique, was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the
      treatment of several diseases. The postulated mechanisms associated with acupuncture in
      analgesia or neurogenesis are still under investigation. Considering a moderate
      recommendation for duloxetine in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
      (CIPN) based on based on neuropathic pain, and a few treatment options with evidence for
      CIPN, acupuncture might be another option. Nowadays, only small scale pilot studies provided
      initial proof of acupuncture in CIPN, particularly in decreasing neuropathic pain and
      improving neurotoxicity, the study aims to determine the beneficial effects of acupuncture on
      CIPN with a large-scale, multicenter, randomized sham-controlled clinical trial. Furthermore,
      the aim of the study will provide evidence for the clinical therapeutic guideline of CIPN in
      the future.
