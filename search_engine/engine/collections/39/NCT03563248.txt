      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved FOLFIRINOX as a treatment option
      for this disease.

      The FDA has not approved losartan or nivolumab for this specific disease but they have been
      approved for other uses.

      FOLFIRINOX is a combination of 4 chemotherapy agents that may help shrink your tumor before
      surgery. Losartan is a drug that is used to lower blood pressure. Nivolumab is an antibody (a
      cell that attaches to other cells to fight off infection) that may cause programmed cell
      death of cancer cells. Radiation therapy is believed to increase the likelihood of response
      of immunotherapy (the prevention/treatment of a disease through an immune response).
