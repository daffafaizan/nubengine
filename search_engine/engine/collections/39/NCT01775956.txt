        -  Determination of impact of rapidity of implementation of antibiotic therapy, source
           control (where required) and fluid resuscitation on mortality of septic shock

        -  Utility of persistence or increase of vasopressor needs over the 1st 24 hours of shock
           as a predictor of a complicated ICU course (ICU duration > 1 week) or death

        -  Assessment of initial biochemical parameters, co-morbidities and new onset organ failure
           at admission as predictors of a complicated ICU course (ICU duration > 1 week) and death

      Data Collection: Data collection would be performed by a combination of study nurses and 2nd
      or 3rd year medical students hired for the summer for this research project. Research nurses
      and student will be trained by the principal investigator. A minimum of 10% of the charts
      will be randomly audited by the principal investigator to ensure appropriate data extraction.
      This will allow the PI to review and correct any discrepant coding issues and judge specific
      questions (e.g. appropriateness of antibiotics/presence of effective antibiotics or not).

      Data Collection Tool: Attached. In addition, data in the ICU registry includes basic
      epidemiologic data (age, sex, all pertinent medical/surgical comorbidities/risk factors, etc)
      as well as all Apache II
