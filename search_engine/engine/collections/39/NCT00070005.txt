      Primary

        -  Compare functional outcome in patients with mid- or distal rectal adenocarcinoma when
           treated with J-pouch coloanal anastomosis vs side-to-end coloanal anastomosis after
           preoperative radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these procedures.

        -  Compare anorectal function in patients treated with these procedures.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and gender. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo total mesorectal excision followed by a J-pouch coloanal
           anastomosis.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo total mesorectal excision followed by a side-to-end coloanal
           anastomosis.

      In both arms, patients receive a temporary ileostomy. The ileostomy is closed after 1 week
      provided recovery is uneventful and no radiological signs of anastomotic leakage are
      detected. If early closure is not possible, the ileostomy is closed after 6-8 weeks.

      Functional outcome, quality of life, and anorectal function are assessed before surgery and
      at 4 and 12 months after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
