      maintain their involvement in social, recreational, spiritual and physical activities
      experience positive effects on their health and quality of life. While winter creates
      challenges to community participation for many Manitobans, these difficulties are magnified
      for older adults and particularly for older adults who use wheelchairs. The aim of this study
      is to explore ways to improve or maintain community participation of community-dwelling older
      adults who use wheelchairs in the winter. Using a single-subject design, five older adult
      Manitobans who are wheelchair users will each select three community-based participation
      goals to work on throughout the winter months. Each older adult participant will work with an
      occupational therapist to receive individually-focused interventions aimed at increasing his
      or her community participation. The investigators will use a client-centered outcome measure
      designed to detect changes in performance and satisfaction in the goals that the individual
      has self-identified as being important to him or her, yet difficult to perform. The findings
      of this study will help determine the feasibility of conducting a larger scale study that
      would include a greater number of older adult Manitobans. Older adult wheelchair users in
      Manitoba bear a disproportionate burden in the winter when aging, mobility limitations, and
      weather coincide to create conditions that make community participation exceedingly
      difficult. It is important to the health and well-being of older adult Manitobans to find
      effective ways to promote community engagement throughout the winter months.
