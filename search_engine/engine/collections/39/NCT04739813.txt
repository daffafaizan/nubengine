    
      Background:

        -  Combination chemotherapy with rituximab has been the mainstay of treatment for
           CD20-positive B-cell lymphomas.

        -  Significant advances have been made in curing aggressive B-cell lymphomas with
           chemoimmunotherapy, but indolent lymphomas and relapsed/refractory aggressive lymphomas
           remain mostly incurable with chemotherapy alone.

        -  Targeted therapies, aimed at disrupting key survival pathways in lymphoid malignancies,
           are emerging and showing significant activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in both the
           relapsed and first-line settings.

        -  Mechanistically based combinations of targeted agents are likely to benefit patients who
           cannot tolerate or who relapse after or are refractory to standard chemoimmunotherapy.

        -  ViPOR-P targets major survival pathways in B-cell lymphomas including BCL-2 (apoptosis);
           BTK (B-cell receptor signaling and NF-kB); Cereblon (NF-kB) and CD20 with additional
           genotoxic stress from the anti-mitotic antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD79b,
           polatuzumab.

      Objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the safety and toxicity profile of
      polatuzumab in combination with venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and
      Revlimid(SqrRoot) (lenalidomide) (ViPOR-P) in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas

      Eligibility:

        -  Women and men greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory B-cell lymphoma,
           excluding mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic
           lymphoma (CLL/SLL)

        -  Adequate organ function unless dysfunction secondary to lymphoma

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, non-randomized phase 1 study

        -  Standard 3 + 3 design will be used to determine the MTD of polatuzumab in combination
           with venetoclax, ibrutinib, prednisone, obinutuzumab and Revlimid (lenalidomide)
           (ViPOR-P) in relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas

        -  A small expansion cohort will be treated at the MTD in a further analysis of safety and
           preliminary activity.

        -  Maximum 6 cycles of combination targeted therapy every 21 days.

        -  To explore all dose levels in the phase 1 study and to allow for the possibility of a
           few screen failures and inevaluable subjects, the accrual ceiling will be set at 32
           patients.
