      with 19% of all children between 5 and 18 years being either obese or overweight in Belgium.
      Obesity and especially visceral adiposity early in life may contribute to the development of
      cardiovascular disease at older age, as it shows tracking into adulthood and is be associated
      with cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, arterial
      hypertension and low grade inflammation, in a variable percentage.

      Low grade inflammation, as assessed by hSCRP, was found to be present in 20.6 % and 19.8 % of
      overweight children and adolescents. In adults, hSCRP levels between 1 and 3 mg/L and above 3
      mg/L are considered coronary disease risk factors.

      Endothelial dysfunction, know to precede the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, can be
      assessed in a non-invasive manner in children by peripheral artery tonometry. Only few
      studies have been performed in obese children with this bed-side technique, showing either
      normal of a disturbed function, reflected by a lower reactive hyperemia index. The
      association with low grade inflammation however was assessed in only one study. The
      investigators hypothesize that in adolescents and young adults with a history of childhood
      obesity a more disturbed endothelial function will be present in those with and /or current
      elevated hSCRP value.
