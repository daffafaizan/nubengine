      Primary

        -  To compare the clinical response rates (complete and partial responses) at 6 months in
           postmenopausal women with operable stage II or III breast cancer treated with
           neoadjuvant anastrozole vs fulvestrant.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the breast surgery conservation rate in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  To correlate imaging findings by mammography, ultrasonography, and MRI with histological
           and clinical response in these patients and with sensitivity profile to these drugs.

        -  To compare histological response in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  To define criteria appropriate for neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.

        -  To correlate baseline molecular characteristics and modifications during treatment with
           response in these patients.

        -  To compare the tolerability of these drugs in these patients.

        -  To compare the serum proteomic profile of patients treated with these drugs.

        -  To correlate 3-year event-free and overall survival rates with clinical and histological
           response in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral anastrozole once daily for 4-6 months in the absence of
           clinical progression.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 1, 15, and 29 in the first
           month and then every 28 days in each subsequent month. Treatment continues for 4-6
           months in the absence of clinical progression.

      Patients in both arms then undergo surgery and radiotherapy according to institutional
      guidelines. Patients then receive adjuvant hormonal therapy for at least 5 years.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
