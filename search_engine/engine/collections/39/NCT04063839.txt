      a low-threshold clinic. All patients are offered treatment for HCV and subsequently followed
      for to years

      Inclusion Consenting patients older than 18 years attending the low threshold HCV clinic in
      Oslo

      The primary aims are to assess the efficacy (SVR rate) of DAA treatment among PWID treated in
      a low-threshold primary care setting (Work Package 1) and to estimate the incidence HCV
      reinfection f

      The secondary aims are to:

        -  Evaluate adherence to DAA treatment (Work Package 1)

        -  Identify factors associated with SVR and adherence (Work Package 1)

        -  Characterize reinfection using next generation sequencing (Work Package 2)

        -  Identify factors associated with reinfection (Work Package 2)

        -  Evaluate changes in recent injecting risk behaviours longitudinally (Work Package 2)

        -  Identify factors associated with changes in risk behaviours (Work Package 2)

      The hypothesis is that high SVR rates and good treatment adherence will be achieved in PWID
      treated for HCV infection in a low-threshold primary health care setting. Further,it is
      anticipated that the incidence of reinfection will be 5-10/100 PY and associated with younger
      age, low education level and ongoing injecting risk behaviours.

      The study will include 300 patients and are close to achieving that aim the summer of 2019
