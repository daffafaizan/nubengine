      philosophy in the 21st century. It remains unclear what consciousness is and how it emerges
      from brain activity. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and
      electroencephalography (EEG) studies will be carried out to reveal the neural correlates of
      consciousness. Consciousness of the subjects will be manipulated with anesthetic agents
      dexmedetomidine acting through Î±2-agonism, with propofol and sevoflurane both mainly acting
      through the enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, and with S-ketamine acting
      through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism. One-hundred-and-sixty (160) healthy
      male subjects will be recruited to receive EC50 concentration of either dexmedetomidine,
      propofol, S-ketamine or sevoflurane, or placebo while being imaged for cerebral metabolic
      rate of glucose (CMRglu). 40 subjects will receive dexmedetomidine, 40 subjects propofol, 20
      subjects S-ketamine, 40 subjects sevoflurane and 20 subjects will receive placebo. Also
      genetic, immunological and metabolomics samples will be taken and analysed to find possible
      genetic factors explaining the variability in drug response and to find possible
      immunological and chemical fingerprints of acute drug effect.
