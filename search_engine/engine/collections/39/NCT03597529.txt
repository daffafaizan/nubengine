      most effective for treating acute migraine in children and adolescents who have episodic
      migraine. Investigator will identify the most effective dose to pull forward into a future
      fully-powered placebo-controlled efficacy study. If both doses are equally effective,
      Investigator will bring forward the best tolerated dose. If doses are equally well tolerated,
      Investigator will bring forward the lowest effective dose, as this will minimize cost to
      families should this treatment become widely adopted.
