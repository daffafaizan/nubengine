    
      This is a modified case control study to investigate the association of genotype with
      phenotype in subjects who experienced alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin derangements
      following exposure to lapaquistat acetate.

      The DNA profile of subjects who experienced significant biochemical hepatic derangement
      following exposure to lapaquistat acetate (cases) will be compared with a population of
      pre-genotyped untreated individuals (controls) from a public database. The DNA from subjects
      who had hepatic derangement during lapaquistat acetate studies, in the absence of exposure to
      lapaquistat acetate, will be stored. If data from the subjects exposed to lapaquistat acetate
      indicates that there is a genetic marker of interest, the stored DNA from non-exposed
      subjects will be assayed to further investigate the signal. One 10 mL sample of whole blood
      will be collected in plastic K2EDTA tube, after informed consent has been obtained.

      Each subject will sign the informed consent document prior to undergoing the study-related
      procedure. One 10 mL sample of whole blood will be collected from each subject. Extracted DNA
      will be analyzed using a whole genome scan approach as well as a candidate gene approach.
