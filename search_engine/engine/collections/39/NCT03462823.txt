      recommended as the standard of care following an ACL tear or rupture, with the
      bone-tendon-bone (BTB) graft and hamstring tendon graft the most common. Although a BTB
      autograft is widely recognized to offer high mechanical performance and rapid graft healing,
      these advantages come at the cost of a longer surgery time and higher risk of severe patient
      discomfort at the graft harvest site. Use of a hamstring tendon autograft is less painful,
      but is generally slower to heal with higher risk of mechanical graft failure due to poor bone
      ingrowth. The aim of the current study is to augment graft-to-bone incorporation by use of an
      osteoconductive scaffold enlaced into the hamstring tendon autograft. This bovine derived
      composite bone substitute is inserted into the articular aperture of the femoral bone tunnel
      and should provide an osteoconductive / osteoinductive environment at a biomimetic attachment
      site leading to improved secondary graft-fixation and a reduced incidence of tunnel widening.

      Primary objective of the study is to evaluate efficacy of the surgical technique for ACL
      reconstruction using an osteoconductive scaffold, enlaced into the hamstring tendon
      autograft, compared to the traditional technique.

      Secondary objectives aim to assess the clinical outcome of the interventional treatment
      including patient subjective knee function and objective measures of knee stability.
