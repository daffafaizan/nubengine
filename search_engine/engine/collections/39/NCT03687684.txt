    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. This study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of TAK-831 when administered
      as single or multiple oral doses in healthy adult Asian participants (Japanese and Chinese
      participants).

      The study will enroll approximately 40 participants and include up to 5 cohorts of healthy
      adult Japanese or Chinese participants as following (8 participants per a cohort). Cohorts 3,
      4 and 5 are optional and will be decided to run based on the data of Cohorts 1 and 2. Dose
      level for these cohorts will be defined based on the result of Cohort 1 or Cohort 2.

        -  Japanese Cohort 1-A; TAK-831 100 mg single dose + TAK-831 300 mg single dose

        -  Japanese Cohort 1-B; TAK-831 100 mg single dose + Placebo single dose

        -  Japanese Cohort 1-C; Placebo single dose + TAK-831 300 mg single dose

        -  Japanese Cohort 2; TAK-831 300 mg or TAK-831 matching placebo, single dose + TAK-831 300
           mg or TAK-831 matching placebo, multiple dose *

        -  Chinese Cohort 3; TAK-831 600 mg or TAK-831 matching placebo, single dose + TAK-831 600
           mg or TAK-831 matching placebo, multiple dose

        -  Japanese Cohort 4; TAK-831 600 mg or TAK-831 matching placebo, single dose + TAK-831 600
           mg or TAK-831 matching placebo, multiple dose

        -  Japanese Cohort 5; TAK-831 50 mg or TAK-831 matching placebo, single dose + TAK-831 50
           mg or TAK-831 matching placebo, multiple dose *The dose in Cohort 2 will be adjusted
           based on the safety and tolerability as well as PK and PD in Cohort 1.

      Above all treatment, randomization information will remain undisclosed to the participant and
      study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need) and TAK-831 will be
      administered orally.

      This single center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in
      Cohort 1 of this study is approximately 12 days and 19 days in Cohorts 2 to 5. 11 days (for
      Cohort 1) or 12 days (for Cohorts 2 to 5) after last dose of study drug, participants will be
      contacted by telephone for a follow-up assessment unless abnormal, clinically significant
      findings are observed upon discharge.
