      rest (washout) period. The two RMR evaluation periods are as follows:

        1. RMR with MedGem® Indirect Calorimeter

        2. RMR without MedGem® Indirect Calorimeter

      Study recruitment will be performed at PBRC. Screening, consenting, and all study procedures
      will be performed within a single study visit at PBRC within the Inpatient Unit. All subjects
      will be introduced to the ventilated hood to determine presence of claustrophobia prior to
      enrollment (i.e., signing of the consent form).
