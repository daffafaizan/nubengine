      norms correlates with his skin care attitudes or behaviors. A stronger understanding of these
      associations may enable dermatologists to better understand their patient's perception of
      skin care. The utility of this knowledge lies in creating outreach interventions and
      informing risk stratification. The study also seeks to determine whether skin care knowledge
      varies by adherence to masculine norms. This knowledge can be used to guide patient education
      in a clinical setting.
