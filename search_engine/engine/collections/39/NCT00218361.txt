      understand, predict, and control this maladaptive choice behavior may lead to improved
      prevention and treatment strategies. HYD is a drug that is currently used as a cough
      suppressant and to relieve pain. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to
      which opioid drug seeking behavior by heroin dependent individuals can be reduced by
      environmental factors, including supplemental opioid drug availability, drug price, and
      alternative non-drug reinforcers. Specifically, this study will determine whether knowledge
      of post-session HYD availability influences drug seeking behavior in heroin dependent
      individuals, who are maintained on buprenorphine during their participation.

      Participants in this observational study will take part in multiple trials in which they have
      the opportunity to choose either HYD or money. On the first two experimental days, prior to
      choice sessions, participants will receive a sample of the drug doses that can be chosen.
      During test sessions, participants will have 12 opportunities to choose either drug or money.
      Participants will use a computer to earn choices. Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart
      rate, and blood pressure will be monitored throughout choice trials. Supplemental HYD will be
      made available following some choice sessions. Self-report questionnaires will be completed
      at different times during the study. Participants will be maintained on buprenorphine
      throughout the study, with a minimum 2-week lead before the experiment, and a fixed 3-week
      detoxification after study completion.
