      10 patients with chronic periodontitis having two or more infrabony defects will be selected
      from the Outpatient section of Dept. of Periodontology, Dr. D. Y. Patil Dental College and
      Hospital, Pimpri, Pune - 18.

      A detailed clinical examination, case history and written consent will be obtained from all
      the participants.

      Before surgery, each patient will be given careful instructions regarding proper oral hygiene
      measures. A full-mouth phase I therapy will be performed. A periodontal re-evaluation will be
      performed after 4 to 6 weeks of phase 1 therapy to confirm the desired sites for the study.
      The selected sites will be divided randomly by using a Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed
      envelopes (SNOSE) randomization into control and test sites. The control site will be treated
      with Access Flap Surgery (AFS), whereas test sites will be treated with AFS and 1.2%
      Rosuvastatin gel. Suitable antibiotics and analgesics will be prescribed along with
      Chlorhexidine digluconate rinses (0.2%) twice daily for 14 days. Patients will be examined at
      4 weeks, 3 and 6 month after surgery.
