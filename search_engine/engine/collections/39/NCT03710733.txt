      whole breast irradiation plus sequential boost versus concomitant boost after breast
      conservative surgery. It will be conducted on 124 patients who will be randomized using
      permuted blocks. The primary outcome measured is the cosmetic outcome, while secondary
      outcomes are patient satisfaction (using breast questionnaire), acute toxicity (using RTOG
      acute toxicity scoring criteria), and late toxicity (using RTOG late toxicity scoring
      criteria).
