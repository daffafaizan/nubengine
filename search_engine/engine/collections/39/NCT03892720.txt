      I. To evaluate local control and toxicity of patients who receive escalated dose stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT) reirradiation with HyperArc for recurrent head and neck cancer
      (rHNC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical benefit of HyperArc through the analysis of overall survival
      (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and locoregional progression-free survival (LPFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate dosimetric data including dose to target and organs at risk (OAR).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo treatment planning with both standard radiation treatment software and
      HyperArc software technology. The most optimal plan will be delivered to a total dose of 55
      Gy in 5 fractions, given 2-3 times weekly.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.
