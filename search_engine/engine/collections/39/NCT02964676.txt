      case series will recruit 246 Chinese POAG, 123 cases in the experimental group will receive
      AIT treatment and 123 cases in the control group will receive trabeculectomy(Trab)
      surgery.Measurements of intraocular pressure(IOP) , visual acuity, refraction, slit lamp
      examination of the anterior segment and fundus, optical coherence tomography(OCT) to detect
      retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, macular thickness, visual field, gonioscopy and
      ultrasonic biological microscopy (UBM) will be recorded.They will be followed up for 12
      months. The main outcome is success rate of IOP reduction and the other outcome are the
      number of antiglaucoma medication and complications .
