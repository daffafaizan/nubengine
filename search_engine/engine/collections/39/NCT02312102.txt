        -  The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. The
           investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that
           can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants
           that have, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same
           dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who
           have been enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.

        -  Dose escalation will occur using a standard 3+3 dose escalation approach, beginning in
           dose level I with dose cohorts and rules for escalation and de-escalation.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks). The first two cycles are called the
           induction cycles. If the participant respond to treatment during the first two cycles,
           they can continue on to the maintenance cycles.
