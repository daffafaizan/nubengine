      Nephrology of the Federal University of Juiz de Fora, Brazil. MS was defined according to the
      criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III
      (NCEP-ATPIII). The study was divided into two phases: phase 1 (baseline) and phase 2
      (intervention). At the first study visit, a full medical history was taken and a clinical
      examination was performed. Blood samples were taken to determine plasma glucose levels, both
      after fasting and 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose overload (oral glucose tolerance test; OGTT),
      as well as levels of plasma insulin, creatinine, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
      triglycerides, and uric acid. At visit 2, the preliminary results were evaluated and urine
      samples were collected in duplicate for measurement of microalbuminuria. Creatinine clearance
      was estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, corrected for body surface area. The
      subjects were kept free of any medication (statins, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory
      drugs) over the entire study period. The only medications allowed during the study were
      analgesics such as dipyrone and hioscin. At visit 3, each patient was evaluated by a
      registered dietitian with expertise in medical nutrition therapy with the aim of achieving a
      weight loss of at least 5% from baseline. Patients were commenced on a 12-week
      calorie-restricted diet consisting of 50% carbohydrate, 20-25% protein, and 25-30% fat. The
      patients were evaluated by the dietitian every 2 weeks. At the final visit all laboratory
      tests were repeated. At the end of phase 2, patients were divided into two groups:
      responders, who had achieved at least a 5% reduction in body weight and non-responders, who
      had not achieved the target weight reduction.
