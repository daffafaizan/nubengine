      by Next-Generation Sequencing Technology)sample. Clinicians use their knowledge and
      experience to decide antibiotics use with the guide of Culture results or mNGS results.
      According to the way of guide, the researcher divide patients into (1)mNGS targeted group ,
      (2)Culture targeted group and (3)Experience group. First evaluate how much can mNGS guide
      clinical antibiotics use. Secondly to evaluate the time consuming and accuracy between the
      mNGS and Culture methods. Finally, to compare the clinical outcome, microbiologic outcome and
      survival rate antibiotics and so on between the groups.
