      package from General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI on 115 patients with biopsy
      proven adenocarcinoma of the breast, who will be receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy as per
      standard therapeutic protocol, prior to surgical management. The spectroscopic data will be
      analyzed to determine whether this can enable early prediction of therapeutic response as
      assessed by RECIST and ultimately surgical pathology after the completion of the full course
      of drug treatment. The 1H MRS, which is performed at baseline, prior to treatment, halfway
      through and at the end of the chemotherapy course, just prior to surgery, will be added to
      the routine MRI examination for the affected breast. Since chemotherapy courses vary in
      length, the exact timeline will depend on the specific course given. 1H MRS will add 10
      minutes to the routine MRI examination, but will not involve additional injections of
      contrast. In addition, we will perform two extra MRIs combined with 1H MRS examinations for
      the affected breast, one set the day after and the second set one week after the initiation
      of chemotherapy. The MRI and 1H MRS will be performed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
      Center, 1275 York Avenue, NY, NY 10021 or at any offsite of MSKCC.
