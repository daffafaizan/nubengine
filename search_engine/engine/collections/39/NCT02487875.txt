      to impaired mobility. Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should include strength
      training, in particular to lower limbs. Furthermore, simple tools for the assessment of lower
      extremity muscles' performance are required. Objectives: To assess the muscle strength of
      COPD patients by the sit-to-stand test (STST) as compared to the one-repetition maximum
      (1-RM), considered as the gold standard in non-laboratory situations, and to evaluate the
      responsiveness of STST to a PR program with specific strength training (SPR), compared to
      usual PR program (UPR). Methods: 60 moderate-to-severe COPD inpatients were randomly included
      into either the SPR or into the UPR. 30-sec STST, 1-min STST, 1-RM and 6MWT were assessed
      before and after PRs.
