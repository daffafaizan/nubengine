      will be screened for eligibility and treated at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Dr Heitor
      Vieira Dourado in Manaus, Brazil. A total of 104 vivax malaria patients will be recruited
      into the study, 52 G6PD deficient (Arm 1) and 52 G6PD normal (Arm 2). Patients with
      spectrophotometrically-confirmed G6PD deficiency (10-60% of adjusted mean male activity) will
      be divided into three subgroups of 10 patient each. All arms will receive standard 3-day
      chloroquine course. Additionally, Arm 1a will receive a delayed course of primaquine for 7
      days, starting only at the fifth-day post-chloroquine initiation [ARM HALTED DUE TO SAFETY
      CONCERNS]. Arm 1b will receive weekly primaquine, once a week, for 8 weeks. Arm 1c will
      receive prophylactic 12-week course of chloroquine, as recommended by national guidelines for
      such patients (control group in terms of safety). Arm 2, the control group of efficacy, will
      receive standard regimen, comprised of 3-day chloroquine plus concomitant 7-day primaquine.
      All patients will receive directly observed therapy (DOT) and will be closely monitored for
      clinical parameters and laboratory markers of hemolysis including hemoglobin, methemoglobin,
      lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocytes, indirect bilirubin, aspartate
      aminotransferase, and urinalysis. All groups will be followed for 6 months after treatment to
      assess relapse rate. Primary endpoint is the tolerability of the regimens defined by
      hemoglobin fall. Secondary endpoints include treatment failure (relapse during follow-up),
      frequency of adverse effects, and rate of hemoglobin fall during treatment.
