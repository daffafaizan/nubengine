      treatment group or the standard of care group. This means:

      The subject will be given either the treatment drugs with standard of care for stroke or only
      standard of care. If the subject is placed in the treatment group the subject will be again
      randomly administered either diphenhydramine oral or through an injection in the vein for 4
      days or dextromethorphan tablet orally for 2 days. In the treatment group the subject will
      receive another drug named famotidine through an injection in vein as a prophylaxis to
      prevent any gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration whereas in the standard of care group the
      subject will receive pantoprazole through an injection in the vein for the same purpose. If
      the subject cannot take medication orally then we will put a tube through the nose to the
      subject's stomach or small intestine or we might also put a gastric tube directly into the
      subject's stomach surgically through a small cut in the belly. The investigators will collect
      information for the medical charts to include: imaging data, stroke assessments and medical
      history. A neurological exam will done, called the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
      (NIHSS). It is used to assess the neurologic damage caused by stroke. A Modified Rankin Scale
      (m-RS) will also be performed and this is a scale used to measure the degree of disability or
      dependence in the daily activities after a stroke.

      The subject will be asked to come for a follow-up at 3 months after the discharge from the
      hospital and the following will be done:

        1. Modified Rankin Scale (m-RS) scores NIH Stroke Scale scores

        2. CT or MRI of the head without contrast
