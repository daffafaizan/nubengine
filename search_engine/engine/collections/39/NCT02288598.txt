      skills in clinical and healthy populations. The benefits of single sessions of TDCS are
      short-lived. However, stimulation over multiple sessions can increase and prolong learning
      effects that can persist for several weeks after the end of the stimulation period. We aim to
      target left hemisphere frontal regions involved in speech production with TDCS, and to pair
      this stimulation with speech fluency training.
