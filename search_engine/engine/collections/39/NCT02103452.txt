      two equal groups, group 1 with ovarian endometrioma and group 2 with normal ovary. Ovarian
      and endometrial samples were evaluated by hematoxlin & eosin for histopathology (HP) and of
      oct-4 for immunohistochemistry (IH) for SCE.

      Evaluation of IH parameters revealed that the most important factors for evaluating SC were
      arranged as score ( Edessy Stem Cell Score=ESS).
