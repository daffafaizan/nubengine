      I. To compare R115777 (tipifarnib) maintenance therapy to observation only with respect to
      disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with AML in second or subsequent complete remission
      or in complete response (CR) following primary induction failure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare overall survival of patients in both arms. II. To evaluate the long-term safety
      and toxicity of extended administration of R115777 in AML patients in remission.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients undergo observation only.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
