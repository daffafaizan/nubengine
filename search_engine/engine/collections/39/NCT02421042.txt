    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, single-dose, sequential-cohort study in
      subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, classified according to the Child-Pugh
      system, who will be matched with normal healthy subjects as controls. The study will be
      conducted in two phases: Pretreatment and Treatment. The Pretreatment Phase will have two
      periods: Screening and Baseline. The study will enroll a sufficient number of subjects so
      that at least 24 subjects complete the study. This will include six subjects with mild
      hepatic impairment (Group 1), six subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Group 2), four
      to six subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Group 3), and eight subjects with normal
      hepatic function (Group 4). Potential study subjects with hepatic impairment (Groups 1, 2,
      and 3) and those with normal hepatic function (Group 4) will first be screened for study
      entry. Group 1, 2, and 3 subjects will be enrolled sequentially into the study first. The
      Group 4 normal healthy subjects will be enrolled following enrollment of all of the hepatic
      impairment subjects. Subjects determined to be eligible for the protocol will receive either
      a 5- or 10-mg single oral dose of lenvatinib on Day 1, depending on their hepatic status.
      Subjects will be discharged from the unit on Day 17 (+/- 2 days) after all study discharge
      procedures have been completed.
