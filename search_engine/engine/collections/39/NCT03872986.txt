      mouth design. 100 patients will be included in the study. The teeth will be randomized into
      four groups according to the restorative materials.

      Group 1: SDF (Riva Star) + Giomer (Beautifil II, (Shofu Dental, Tokyo, Japan) Group 2: Giomer
      (Beautifil II, (Shofu Dental, Tokyo, Japan) Group 3: SDF (Riva Star) + GIC (Equia Forte, GC,
      Japan) Group 4: GIC (Equia Forte, GC, Japan)

      The restorations will be evaluated clinically at baseline and 6., 12., 18., 24. months and
      radiologically at 6., 12. and 24. months. The modified US Public Health Service criteria
      (secondary caries, marginal integrity, marginal discoloration and retention) will be used for
      clinical evaluation of restorations. Intra-oral photos will be taken directly after treatment
      and at control appointments.

      The data will be analysed statistically using Wilcoxon test, chi square test and the
      Kaplan-Meier survival method will be used to estimate survival percentages.
