      in pregnancy than is recommended. Unfortunately, the prevalence of excessive gestational
      weight gain is increasing. Gestational weight gain greater than that recommended by the
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) is associated with increased risk of gestational complications
      (hypertension, diabetes, and preeclampsia), infant macrosomia, and complications in delivery
      including increased risk of cesarean delivery. Currently, there is no evidence-based prenatal
      counseling protocol available to prevent excessive gestational weight gain. We hypothesize
      that consistent counseling on appropriate pregnancy diet, weight gain, and the potential
      complications of excessive gestational weight gain will result in fewer women gaining above
      the IOM recommendations.
