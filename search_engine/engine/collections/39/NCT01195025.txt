      crystalloid one time, only colloid another time, and on the third occasion first a colloid
      and then a crystalloid one hour later. The different protocols will be in random order in the
      different volunteers. During all these tests we will sample the hemoglobin (both invasive and
      non-invasive) every fifth minute in the beginning (every tenth minute later) after the
      infusion. On six to nine occasions during each test we will analyse Albumin, Cystatin-C,
      Ig-G, Ig-M as markers of hemodilution and D-Dimer, Fibrinogen, Factor VII, PK-INR
      (prothrombin complex international normalized ratio), and aPTT (activated partial
      thromboplastin time) as markers of coagulation. The volunteers are also monitored regarding
      non-invasive blood pressure and pulse rate.
