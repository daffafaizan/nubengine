      Description of stool appearance is important in clinical practice. Parents are often asked to
      evaluate stool of their child. At present parents also take more frequently photos using
      smartphone camera when they are concerned with child's stool appearance and show it to their
      doctors. To make stool evaluation easier there have been stool form scales created. One of
      this is Amsterdam Stool Scale that enables stool assessment of children who are not yet
      toilet trained. This scale facilitates to describe amount, consistency and color of the
      stool.

      AIM:

      To assess interobserver and intraobserver variability of the Amsterdam Stool Scale in
      clinical practice.

      METHODS:

      After passing a stool by the child participating in the study, within a short-time interval
      (<5 min), the stool will be assessed independently by one of the parents and the medical
      doctor. At the same time a parent will take 2 photos with phone camera. The photographs then
      will be independently evaluated by another doctor who will be unaware of both the "in vivo"
      stool appraisal and child condition.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

      Then the interobserver (between a parent, the doctor and the doctor assessing photograph)
      variability will be evaluated by calculating the kappa (Îº) statistics for nominal data for
      the stool consistency, amount and color separately.
