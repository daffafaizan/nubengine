      of prostaglandins is frequently limited by various contraindications. Dilapan-S is a
      hygroscopic uterine neck dilator. Its mode of action consists in the hydrophilic properties
      of the device absorbing fluids from surrounding tissue structures, thus expanding the volume
      of Dilapan-S sticks which subsequently exert radial pressure on the surrounding structures
      (uterine neck) to dilate progressively. Endocervical pressure on the uterine neck results not
      only in its mechanical dilatation but pressure on endocervical structures also stimulates the
      production of endogenous prostaglandins, which promote cervical ripening through its
      collagenolytic action. Although Dilapan-S is widely used in labor pre-induction, published
      study data comparing its clinical efficacy and safety in females with/without caesarean
      section in medical history are lacking.
