      hematopoietic stem cells. The most common types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are AML with
      myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) and AML-NOS. AML-MRC patients are usually with
      multilineage pathological hematopoiesis, previous history of MDS or MDS-related cytogenetic
      abnormalities. Compared with AML-NOS, AML-MRC patients are usually older, with poor prognosis
      of cytogenetic changes, low remission rate of chemotherapy, and worse overall prognosis. The
      treatment strategies mainly include demethylation drugs, chemotherapy and allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The main purpose of treatment is to delay disease
      progression, prolong survival, and even be cured.

      Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone deacetylation have been considered to
      be involved in the occurrence and development of MDS. Demethylation drugs, such as
      5-azacitidine (AZA) and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine), can inhibit DNA
      methyltransferase, reduce excessive methylation of tumor suppressor genes, promote cell
      differentiation and apoptosis, and play an anti-tumor role. Demethylation drugs are important
      therapy for MDS patients. Compared with supportive treatment, demethylation drugs can reduce
      the risk of AML progression and improve survival.

      Therefore, we proposed this project in order to further clarify the role of azacytidine in
      therapy for high-risk and middle-risk MDS and AML-MRC patients, and evaluate its clinical
      efficacy, to explore the optimal azacytidine treatment strategies for high-risk and
      middle-risk MDS and AML-MRC patients.
