      100 Korean patients with BPH. At each visit, patients' height, weight, abdominal
      circumference will be checked. Laboratory parameters including fasting glucose, HbA1c, serum
      testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, estradiol, maximum flow rate
      (measured by flowmetry) will be tested. Blood test will be performed twice (at baseline and
      at the end of study). 5mL of blood will be needed at each time from one subject. And total
      IPSS score will be evaluated after 1 year of treatment of 5 ARI. At every visit, use of above
      prohibited medicines and other medications will be investigated. In addition, any surgical
      procedures undertaken during study period will be asked and recorded.

      Subjects of study will be allocated into 3 separate groups. Group 1 will be those taking 5
      alpha reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) only for 1 year. Group2 will be those who switch from
      alpha blocker to dutasteride and take dutasteride for 1 year. Group 3 will be composed of
      those taking both alpha blocker and dutasteride for 1 year.
