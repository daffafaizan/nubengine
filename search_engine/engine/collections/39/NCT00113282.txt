      HIV-infection, most of the patients with a controlled viral load and a high level of CD4
      count (over 200/mm3) who received IL-2, experienced an increase of their CD4 cell count
      superior to what is observed with antiretroviral therapy alone.

      The efficacy of IL-2 when the viral load is high and the CD4 cell count is low is not known.
      The purpose of this multicentric national study is to compare the effects of an optimized
      antiretroviral regimen with or without IL-2.The choice of the antiretroviral regimen will be
      made from a genotype resistance test.

      Ninety eight HIV-1-infected patients experiencing advanced treatment failure with a CD4 count
      below 200/mm3 and a plasma viral load above 10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml, will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups: with or without IL-2.

      The group with IL-2 will receive a dose of 4.5 million International units by subcutaneous
      injection twice a day for 5 days (up to a total of 8 cycles, ending at Week 42), the first
      two cycles 4 weeks apart, the following cycles 6 weeks apart.

      Evaluation will be done at week 52 and further at W76. The primary endpoint is the proportion
      of patients reaching an absolute CD4 count over 200/mm3 at Week 52. Secondary endpoints
      include the proportion of patients increasing their CD4 count over 50/mm3 between Week 00 and
      Week 24,and between Week 00 and Week 52, the occurrence of HIV-related events, drug safety
      and the evolution of CD4 cells and of HIV RNA and HIV DNA loads over time.
