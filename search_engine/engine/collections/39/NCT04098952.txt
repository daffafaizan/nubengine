      region combined with local techniques on the temporomandibular joint versus an intervention
      that applies only local techniques in subjects diagnosed with temporomandibular disorders.

      This is an experimental study with a sample size of 42 subjects randomly divided into two
      groups: the control group, who underwent techniques of ischemic compression and decompression
      of temporals at the local level, and the intervention group, which, in addition to the
      techniques applied to the The control group is given an electric massage at the cervical
      level. Pre-and post-intervention levels of oral opening, Pressure Pain Threshold (PDU),
      perceived pain intensity and cervical range of motion were assessed. The assessments were
      made before the intervention, immediately after and after 4 weeks of follow-up.
