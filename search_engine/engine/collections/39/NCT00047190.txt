      I. To evaluate the response rate in MMM patients treated with R115777. II. To evaluate the
      toxicity of R115777 in patients with MMM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the benefit of therapy with R115777 in alleviating disease-associated anemia
      in patients with MMM.

      II. To evaluate the benefit of R115777 in reducing palpable splenomegaly in patients with
      MMM.

      III. To evaluate the effect of R115777 on the hypercatabolic symptoms from MMM. IV. To
      evaluate the effect of R115777 on the pathologic increase in circulating myeloid progenitors
      in MMM patients through baseline measurement and measurement after the first cycle.

      V. To correlate response/relapse with in vitro myeloid colony sensitivity to R115777 at the
      time of either response or relapse.

      VI. To evaluate the effect of R115777 on bone marrow histologic features of MMM including
      osteosclerosis, reticulin fibrosis, and angiogenesis (through serial bone marrow microvessel
      density grading).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.
