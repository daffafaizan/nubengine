      safe and effective in adults with chronic Acquired Brain Injury. Limited data have
      established the safety of tDCS in children with neuropsychiatric and neuromotor disorders.
      However, these tDCS safety paradigms may not be relevant to children with ABI due to their
      abnormal brain structure and function, decreased ability to communicate, variable
      symptomology, and time-consuming care needs that exist in this population.

      In this open-label, single-group, dosage escalation study, investigators aim to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and feasibility of incrementally higher tDCS currents in 10 pediatric
      patients with ABI on an inpatient rehabilitation unit. The study will include up to three
      sessions of tDCS (sham, 1mA, and then 2 mA) either over the left dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex or over the primary motor cortex based on the goal to evaluate change in either
      cognitive or motor function. We will also explore whether tDCS improves consciousness in
      pediatric DOC. Additionally, we will explore whether EEG (resting-state coherence and
      event-related potentials) improve following tDCS and predict current behavioral function and
      recovery form ABI. Mozart classical music, as a concurrent intervention, will be played
      during sham, 1 mA, and 2 mA tDCS applications.
