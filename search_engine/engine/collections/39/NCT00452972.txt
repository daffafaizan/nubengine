      replacing it into the abdominal cavity after the completion of a double layer closure, or by
      suturing it in situ. Exteriorization of the uterus has been shown to decrease blood loss
      during Cesarean delivery when compared to in situ repair. However, at the same time, it is
      thought to be uncomfortable for the patient with respect to intraoperative nausea, vomiting
      and pain. Intraoperative nausea and vomiting in patients who receive regional anaesthesia for
      Cesarean section is a complex multifactorial problem arising from anesthetic and
      non-anesthetic causes. Additionally, it can influence hemodynamic stability.

      The study was a prospective, randomized and single blinded study. It compared the effects of
      exteriorization of the uterus and in-situ repair during Cesarean delivery with respect to
      patient's comfort, hemodynamic changes, uterine contractility and blood loss in patients
      under spinal anesthesia. All low risk patients undergoing elective C-delivery under spinal
      anesthesia were considered for this study.

      Spinal anesthesia was performed in the sitting position with 10-12 mg of 0.75% hyperbaric
      bupivacaine, mixed with 100 mcg of preservative free morphine and 10 mcg of fentanyl. Any
      drop in blood pressure was treated with 100 mg of phenylephrine titrated to maintain systolic
      blood pressure within 10% of the baseline values throughout the procedure. Oxytocin was used
      judiciously, in aliquots of 0.5 IU. Obstetricians were asked to allow assisted spontaneous
      delivery of placenta rather than manual extraction. During surgery, patient's complaints of
      nausea, vomiting, pain or any discomfort were recorded.
