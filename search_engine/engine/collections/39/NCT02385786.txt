      unmedicated subjects with MDD were enrolled in the study. All subjects with MDD underwent
      depression severity assessment at baseline and after the 8-week intervention was complete to
      measure change. In addition, the subjects underwent blood sampling at the same time points to
      measure C-Reactive Protein change over the 8 weeks.

      The primary goal of this pilot study is to determine the efficacy of MBCT as a primary
      treatment for adults with MDD. We will also measure change in the inflammatory biomarker
      C-Reactive Protein for an examination of the effects of depression treatment on this measure.
