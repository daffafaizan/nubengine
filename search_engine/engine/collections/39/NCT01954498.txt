    
      Purpose: The investigators are testing the hypothesis that two ounces of whole-shelled
      walnuts/day added to the diet of men with oligo- astheno- or teratospermia will beneficially
      affect sperm parameters. The investigators found in a previous study (Robbins et al. 2012,
      Biology of Reproduction 87(4):101, 1-8.) that walnuts added to a Western diet improved sperm
      parameters in healthy, young men of unknown fertility and the most improvement occurred in
      participants with poor sperm parameters at baseline. The investigators now test the walnut
      dietary intervention in a fertility clinic population known to have poor sperm parameters.
      The investigators will compare the walnut intervention to the usual care suggestion of adding
      an OTC multivitamin supplement to the diet. Neither walnuts nor the OTC multivitamin have
      been tested for efficacy in this fertility clinic population previously.

      Methods: A randomized, parallel two-group, dietary intervention trial with single-blind
      masking of outcome assessors will be conducted with up to 140 men who present for fertility
      work-up with semen parameters below the 25th centile for count, and 10th centile for motility
      and/or morphology according to the WHO 5th Edition, Laboratory Manual for the Processing and
      Examining of Human Semen, 2010. Repeated measures at baseline and 12 weeks include: semen
      analyses (primary outcome), blood fatty acid/ nutrient profiles (secondary outcomes); IPAQ
      physical activity questionnaire and IIEF index of erectile function (potential modifiers or
      confounders). Dietary intake will be assessed throughout using 24-hour ASA dietary recall x 5
      and fertility assessed by questionnaire at one year post enrollment.
