      conditions, some lines of evidence suggest its protective effects against reperfusion injury
      in several tissues by its specific receptor.

      Preclinical studies have indicated a broad variety of cardioprotective actions for EPO. It
      improves cardiac function and exercise capacity in congestive heart failure, angiogenesis,
      limit myocardial inflammatory response, cardiac remodeling, infarct size and apoptosis
      extension induced by reperfusion injury. Activation of EPO receptor in endothelial and
      cardiac cells is suggested to attenuate proinflammatory cytokines production and inflammatory
      cells infiltration, and increasing nitric oxide production through possible mechanisms.

      Reperfusion injury is unavoidable event during cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary
      bypass.It is associated with inflammation, cell injury and attenuate contractility property.

      Although it is an area of concern and many clinical studies have been designed by different
      interventions, it remains a major challenge. EPO intervention during heart reperfusion
      (surgery/ percutaneous angioplasty) as a new promise of cardioprotection strategy is the main
      design of several studies with conflicting results .
