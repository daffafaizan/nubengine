      PET/CT and multi-sequence MRI for prostate cancer in patients undergoing diagnostic prostate
      biopsy. Patients will receive image-guided (targeted) prostate biopsies and metabolomic
      profiling of prostate biopsy tissues to evaluate underlying metabolic changes in comparison
      with pathological Gleason grading.
