      associated with increased morbidity and mortality. No evidence-based treatment exist of this
      condition. Haloperidol is the most frequently used agent to treat ICU-related delirium, but
      according to the available literature there is no firm evidence of efficacy and safety of
      this intervention. AID-ICU aims to assess the benefits and harms of haloperidol in adult,
      critically ill patients with delirium in the ICU.
