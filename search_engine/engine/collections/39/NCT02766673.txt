    
      This is a randomized, blinded cross-over study of infants with a diagnosis of Severe BPD that
      are mechanically ventilated. Participants will receive 3 sets of treatment (2.5mg Albuterol,
      1.25mg Albuterol, 3ml normal saline placebo), in random order. Each treatment will be
      administered every 4 hours for 24 hours. After a 6 hour washout phase, the next group of
      interventions will be applied. Following another wash-out phase, the final group of
      intervention will be applied. Pulmonary mechanics from the ventilator (e.g. airway
      compliance, airway resistance, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure, Forced Expiratory
      Flow at 75% of forced vital capacity, etc.) and the patient short term response to therapy
      (heart rate, blood pressure, heart rhythm) will be assessed for the duration of the treatment
      period.
