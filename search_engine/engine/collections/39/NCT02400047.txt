    
      Methodology :

      Non inferiority, phase III, therapeutic trial. Prospective, randomized double-blinded,
      monocentric study. Inclusion of 567 patients. Inclusion will be performed by the
      anesthesiologist, the day of surgery during the preoperative visit.

      Each patient will be randomised to receive intraoperative DXM (0.2mg/kg), DXM (0.4mg/kg) (max
      20mg) or ketoprofen (1mg/kg) (max 100mg).

      The clinical data will be collected prospectively in an electronic database. If the
      hypothesis of non-inferiority is verified, it is planned to test the superiority of the
      hypothesis secondarily.

      Treatment :

      Single injection of DXM (Mylan Dexamethasone® 20 mg/5 ml or 4 mg/1 ml injection ampoule
      solution) at 0.2 mg / kg or 0.4 mg/kg or single injection of ketoprofen (Medac ketoprofen ®
      100 mg/4 ml injection ampoule solution) at 1 mg /kg after general anesthesia induction and
      before surgery incision.
