      randomized to oral L-citrulline (6 g/day) or placebo (maltodextrin) for 14 days, and switched
      to the other treatment for another 14 days after washout. Peripheral vascular function was
      assessed under conditions of rest, leg exercise, and cognitive engagement. Gait performance
      was assessed using clinical walking tests.
