    
      Background:

        -  Aggressive B-cell lymphomas with secondary involvement of the CNS (sCNSL) have a grave
           prognosis

        -  No standard of care exists for sCNSL; treatment approaches include combination
           chemotherapy regimens effective in primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL)

        -  Ibrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and has demonstrated a high
           response rate in PCNSL and sCNSL but with short response duration

        -  We developed a novel regimen that combines ibrutinib with a chemoimmunotherapy platform
           maximized for CNS penetrance that includes temozolomide, etoposide, Doxil,
           dexamethasone, and rituximab (TEDDI-R) for aggressive B-cell lymphomas in the CNS

        -  A phase 1 study of TEDDI-R demonstrated durable remissions in refractory PCNSL

        -  We propose a small phase 2 to study the safety and efficacy of TEDDI-R in sCNSL

      Objective:

      -To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) after TEDDI-R or TEDD-R in secondary CNS
      lymphoma (sCNSL)

      Eligibility:

        -  Aggressive B-cell lymphomas with secondary involvement of the CNS (sCNSL)

        -  Relapsed/refractory from prior therapy or untreated with CNS involvement

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  No pregnant or breast-feeding women.

        -  Adequate organ function (defined in protocol)

      Design:

        -  Phase II study of 29 evaluable participants with untreated and relapsed/refractory sCNSL
           (accrual ceiling will be set at 36 to allow for a few possible inevaluable participants
           and screen fails)

        -  Participants will first be treated with a 14-day "window" of ibrutinib monotherapy in
           combination with isavuconazole to establish efficacy of ibrutinib. Participants who are
           known refractory to BTK inhibitors will skip the 14-day and proceed on to chemotherapy.

        -  Following the 14-day ibrutinib window, participants with at least a 20% reduction in
           bidimensional masses on imaging scans or those without measurable disease will receive
           ibrutinib with TEDD-R (TEDDI-R) chemotherapy for 4 cycles. Participants who are
           previously known to be refractory to BTK inhibitors and those who have less than a 20%
           reduction during the ibrutinib window will receive TEDD-R (without ibrutinib) for 4
           cycles.
