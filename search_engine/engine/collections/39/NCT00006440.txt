      several years. The need to develop and evaluate interventions to reduce the incidence of HIV
      infection among women is urgent. The behavioral intervention method tested in this study
      integrates elements from diverse theories and empirical evidence for women to feel empowered
      to use methods of protection against disease. Although the overall objective of the study
      intervention is to reduce the risk of HIV infection through sexual contact, the intervention
      must also address drug usage among women.

      Women are randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to either the intervention or control condition. The
      Intervention Group participates in 4 group sessions over the course of 1 month and then in an
      additional reunion session approximately 1 month after the 4th group session. Sessions are
      2.5 hours long and include 6 to 10 participants. The sessions involve talking about HIV, ways
      to avoid HIV, and ways women can support each other. All participants complete a short-term
      assessment visit 1 week after the 4th group intervention session. The Control Group does not
      participate in group sessions. All participants are paid for their time and effort.
