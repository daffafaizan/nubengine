    
      Primary Objectives:

      Phase 1b: To determine the RP2D and assess the toxicity and tolerability of the combination
      of CDX-3379 (ERBB3 antibody) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) in NRAS and BRAF/NRAS WT melanoma
      patients

      Phase 2: To estimate the response rates and duration of response of the combination of
      CDX-3379 (ERBB3 antibody) and trametinib in NRAS positive and BRAF/NRAS WT melanoma patients

      Secondary/Exploratory Objectives:

      Phase 1b: To assess clinical activity and steady-state pharmacokinetics of CDX-3379 and
      trametinib Phase 2: To compare the efficacy of the combination of CDX-3379 (ERBB3 antibody)
      and trametinib is more effective than a MEK inhibitor alone in NRAS positive and BRAF/NRAS WT
      melanoma patients alone using locally assessed progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS).
