      over 25 years ago, studies have implicated this molecule in modulating such processes as
      atherosclerosis, impotence, angina, platelet function, and blood pressure, among others.
      Through vascular smooth muscle relaxation in both coronary and skeletal muscle arteries, as
      well as via independent mechanisms, nitric oxide has also been implicated in improvement of
      exercise capacity. In addition, NO may be involved in the immune system, assist in memory
      function and sleep regulation, and act as a cellular signaling messenger. Youthful, healthy
      and athletic individuals generally have a healthier NO system, compared to sedentary,
      unhealthy and aging individuals. NiteworksTM is a dietary supplement that includes
      L-arginine, an amino acid that acts as a nitric oxide donor and has been shown to increase
      levels of this molecule in the body. NiteworksTM has been formulated as a composite mixture
      along with other supplements, including antioxidants, that may act synergistically with
      L-arginine in enhancing exercise capacity.
