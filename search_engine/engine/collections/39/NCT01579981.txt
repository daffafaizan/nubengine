      while beta-cell function is increased in type 2 diabetic (T2D) subjects. The aim of this
      study is to establish causality between the two observations. By meal testing 10 T2D subjects
      with infusion of saline or exendin (9-39), a GLP-1R specific blocker, before and 1 week and 3
      months after RYGB we hope to demonstrate the role of GLP-1 in improveing beta-cell function
      and maintaing glucose tolerance after RYGB in T2D subjects. Furthermore, effects of GLP-1 rec
      blockade before and after RYGB on ad libitum energy intake is examined
