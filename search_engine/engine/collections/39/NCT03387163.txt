      describe retrospective electronic health record data. We will use the PCORnet (Patient
      Centered Outcomes Research Network, see "data sources" below) infrastructure to (1) identify
      a cohort of chronic systolic HF patients initiated on sacubitril/valsartan (N=200) as well as
      a comparator group of similar HF patients not initiated on sacubitril/valsartan (N=200) but
      with background ACE/ARB therapy and (2) evaluate baseline and follow-up PROs via an
      electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) form in the eCOS database for 12 weeks.
