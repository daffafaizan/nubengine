      carinii pneumonia (PCP). This study will assess the safety and tolerance of this drug in
      HIV-infected patients who do not have PCP.

      Escalating doses of WR 6026 will be studied in successive patient cohorts. Four patients will
      be randomized to active drug or placebo in a 3:1 ratio at each dose level until moderate
      toxicity is demonstrated. If one patient at a given dose level experiences WR 6026-related
      moderate or worse toxicity, the sample size for all subsequent dose levels will be doubled.
      If two or more patients at a given dose level experience moderate or dose-limiting toxicity,
      an additional four patients (randomized in the same 3:1 ratio) will be entered at that level,
      and sample size at all subsequent dose levels will be doubled. Dose escalation will continue
      until three of six patients receiving active drug at a given dose level experience
      dose-limiting or worse toxicity, or until two of six patients at a given dose level
      experience life-threatening toxicity. The MTD will be defined as the dose immediately below
      the highest dose studied. Eight additional patients will be studied at the presumed MTD to
      confirm tolerance.
