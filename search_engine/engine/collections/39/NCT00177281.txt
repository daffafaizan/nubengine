      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (highest dose that can safely be given to subjects)
      of S CKD602 when given every three weeks.

      To determine the incidence and severity of toxicity (side-effects) of S CKD602 when given
      every three weeks.

      To determine a subject's body handles the drug (pharmacokinetics) following administration of
      S CKD602.

      In addition to the above, we would also like to analyze how the genes (material inside each
      cell that is responsible for cell functioning and appearance) found in a subject's blood
      affect how the study drug S-CKD602 is broken down in a subject's body. This process is
      referred to as "metabolic genotyping analyses". This evaluation is performed using a blood
      sample and is optional.
