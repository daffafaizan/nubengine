      office-based educational intervention for the prevention of iron depletion in young children.
      Healthy children will be recruited from a community pediatric office which serves a diverse,
      urban population. Children will be randomized to the intervention education group or the
      control education group at 9 months of age. Blood work (~4mL) for complete blood count and
      ferritin along with additional measures such as transferrin, iron, and reticulocyte count
      will be obtained at 24 months of age. Rates of iron depletion and anemia will be compared in
      the two groups. The two groups will also have 25-hydroxy vitamin D, calcium and alkaline
      phosphatase levels analyzed at the 24 month visit to ensure that the intervention for
      prevention of iron depletion does not adversely affect these measures.
