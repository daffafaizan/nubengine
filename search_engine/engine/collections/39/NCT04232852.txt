    
      Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation (SI). Activation
      of the mechanisms of inflammation is triggered by the inflammatory cytokines produced in the
      adipose tissue. Among them, IL-1β interleukin plays a central role in cardiovascular disease.
      The active form of IL-1β results by the conversion of its inactive precursor after an
      infectious/inflammatory stimulus. The Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain (NOD)-like
      Receptor containing Pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3 or cryopyrin) inflammasome is a multiprotein
      complex that activates caspase 1, leading to the processing and secretion of the
      pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) via the NLRP3/caspase pathway. Τhe NLRP3
      inflammasome is activated by microbial-derived Low Molecular Weight (LMW) factors, short
      chain fatty acids (SCFAs), Pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs),
      Damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), and monosodium urate crystals.

      It is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in patients with MetS and cardiovascular
      disease. Patients will be randomized into two groups: A. those who will receive probiotic
      supplements and B. placebo-treated patients. Both groups will follow the usual clinical
      practice as far as drugs and diet concerned.

      Τhe primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of administration of the
      probiotic mix on IL-1β production by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in
      patients at high cardiovascular risk with MetS at the end of the intervention. Secondly, to
      investigate the effect of probiotics on endothelial glycocalyx thickness, on hrCRP and on
      HbA1c levels, on the components of the MetS, on the gut microbiota at the end and 4 weeks
      after the completion of the intervention.

      Time frame 12 weeks.
