      by frequent recurrences that lead to numerous invasive procedures for detection and
      treatment. The mainstay of therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which has remained
      unchanged for decades, relies on surgical resection (TUR) associated with utilization of
      intravesical immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite our best efforts, these tumors continue
      to have suboptimal rates of recurrence and require long-term follow-up with costly and
      invasive procedures. The rationale for this study is to show that the preoperative biopsy,
      taken at the time of the office cystoscopic evaluation, improves pre-TUR staging and grading
      correlation with the final pathology of the resection. Indirectly, this will suggest that the
      routine use of pre-TUR biopsy provides more accurate information for intraoperative
      decision-making that can ultimately lead to better management of these patients with
      non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
