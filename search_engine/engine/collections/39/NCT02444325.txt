      compared to traditional prenatal care, will improve glycemic control and, ultimately,
      maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with type 2 and gestational diabetes. The objective
      of this proposal is to conduct a pilot randomized trial to determine the effect of group
      prenatal care on self-care activities, which have been associated with improved glycemic
      control, in women with diabetes.
