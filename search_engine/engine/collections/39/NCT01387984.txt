      various micro- and macrovascular complications. Vascular damage and endothelium dysfunction
      in diabetes mellitus involve a chronic inflammatory process via a complicated mechanism.

      YKL-40 is a 40 kD lectin molecule. It is secreted by various cells, including macrophages,
      vascular smooth muscle cells and giant cells, and the level of YKL-40 is found elevated in
      both acute (eg. infection) and chronic (eg. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
      erythematosus or cirrhosis of the liver) inflammatory processes. The plasma concentration of
      YKL-40 is elevated in the patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with non-diabetic
      controls, and is associated with insulin resistance, fasting plasma glucose and plasma IL-6
      concentrations. Furthermore, the concentration of YKL-40 is elevated and is associated with
      the severity of albuminuria in the patients of type 1 diabetes.

      The objective of this study is to establish the relationship between plasma concentration of
      YKL-40 with various vascular complications in the patients of type 2 diabetes, and to
      evaluate its potential as a biomarker for the vascular diabetic complications in patients
      with type 2 diabetes.
