      conducted at The Steadman Clinic (TSC) and Steadman Philippon Research Institute (SPRI). The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Fisetin (FIS), a dietary
      supplement, in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Key aspects of this proposal
      include the investigator's well-developed methodologies to measure and compare systemic
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) including inflammatory biomarkers and
      senescent cells, and collect magnetic resonance images, self-reported outcomes, physical
      performance and other objective clinical data. Given the drug FIS has been empirically
      demonstrated to reduce senescent cell burden, the main objective(s) are to determine 1) the
      safety of FIS during dosing and 2) whether FIS reduces senescent cells, pro-inflammatory and
      cartilage degenerating SASP markers, and reduces OA-symptoms leading to improved joint health
      and function.
