      complications. The current routine treatment for these injuries includes the use of systemic
      IV antibiotics. However, open fracture injuries often have compromised blood supply, reducing
      the amount of antibiotic that reaches the target tissue while increasing risk of injury to
      non-target organs. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of early application of a
      topical vancomycin antibiotic powder on open fracture wounds, in combination with the usual
      treatment, in reducing the risk of infection seen in these injuries.
