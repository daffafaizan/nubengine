      malignances, with a 5-year survival rate below 25% for patients diagnosed with stage III-IV.
      Most advanced stage patients respond to cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based
      chemotherapy; however, >70% of women relapse, and platinum-resistant EOC is uniformly fatal.
      Physicians often increase the dosage of cytotoxic agents, or use single or combination
      second-line agents to overcome the drug resistance. Nevertheless, second-line chemotherapy
      sometimes may not achieve the expected cytotoxic effect and drug resistance may lead to
      cancer-specific death. Overcoming resistance is an important strategy for improving the
      therapeutic efficacy in cisplatin-containing cancer chemotherapy.

      Cu homeostasis in human cells involves the inter-regulatory circuitry composed of Cu, the
      high-affinity Cu transporter (hCtr1) and transcription factor Sp1. Human copper transporter 1
      (htr1) in humans are also involved in the import of antitumor agent cisplatin (Cp). Earlier
      the investigators also discovered that the magnitude of hCtr1 expression by Cu chelators
      depends upon the basal levels of hCtr1 expression, and that high levels of hCtr1 expression
      can be modulated through Cu deprivation in Cp-resistant (CpR) cells, providing a molecular
      basis for the development of Cu chelators as Cp resistance reversal agents in the clinical
      settings. D-penicillamine and Cp act synergistically to inhibit tumor growth. The
      investigators conduct this trial with combination agents, including LipoDox®, carboplatin and
      Trientine®, to develop the clinical application of copper chelator in conjunction with
      cytotoxic agents to conquer platinum-resistance. This trial is practical and is of
      perspective.
