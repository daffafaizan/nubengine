      One of the major and perhaps most disabling manifestations of PD is bradykinesia. It is
      particularly difficult for these patients to perform simultaneous, sequential and complex
      motor acts. Imaging studies have recently provided important information in reference to the
      brain regions associated with performance of these motor sequences in normal volunteers and
      in PD patients. These studies helped us to identify the brain regions active in association
      with task performance. It has been suggested that cortical regions, and particularly the SMA
      are less active in patients with PD than in controls in association with motor performance.

      We plan to study the effects of subthreshold rTMS delivered to SMA and primary motor cortex
      in patients with PD "on" and "off" medication. From this study, we expect to learn if
      stimulation of the scalp overlying primary motor cortex and SMA can ameliorate performance of
      simple and complex motor sequences in PD.

      Subthreshold rTMS has been proposed as a therapeutic tool in psychiatric disorders. In the
      motor domain, subthreshold rTMS delivered to primary motor cortex improves reaction times and
      motor performance in patients with Parkinson's disease. The mechanisms underlying this
      beneficial effect are not known. However, they may be related with subthreshold rTMS
      replacing the missing excitatory drive on the motor cortex.
