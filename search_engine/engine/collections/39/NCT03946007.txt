      possible, the study visit will be combined with a regular follow-up visit. Vena puncture is
      the only invasive procedure, with low risk of adverse effects. Blood will be drawn after an
      overnight fast. To minimize the duration of the visit, patients will be offered to fill out
      the questionnaires at home. Individual adverse test results will be reported to a
      participants' treating physician to enable treatment or follow-up as indicated. The results
      of the full study group will be used to guide future interventions and support for melanoma
      and NSCLC patients.
