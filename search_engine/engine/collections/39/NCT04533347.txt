      to enroll approximately 275 patients with mild to moderate infection with COVID-19. Patients
      will undergo a brief screening period before being randomized to receive either
      self-administer 200 mg tafenoquine or matching placebo for 10 days. Following the treatment
      period, patients will have a follow up visit at study Day 28 (28 days after the first dose of
      study medication). The study's primary efficacy endpoint is proportion of patients with
      clinical recovery from COVID-19 symptoms on Day 14 in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19
      disease compared with placebo.
