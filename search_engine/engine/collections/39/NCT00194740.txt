      the two drugs are used in combination such that the effect of the two together may be better
      than either alone. Clinical data suggest that the use of concurrent G-CSF with paclitaxel and
      vinorelbine permits the delivery of both agents at approximately 70% of the "full" dose for
      either, used alone without G-CSF support, with myelosuppression as the usual dose-limiting
      toxicity and no unusual or unexpected complications. Encouragingly, 8/20 (40%) patients had
      objective responses, with three complete remissions (15%) in this program of third-line
      therapy. Therefore, we now propose to combine docetaxel at about 70% of "full" dose with
      vinorelbine at 27.5 mg/m2, the "phase II" dose defined in the previous trial. Docetaxel will
      be given on day 1 followed by vinorelbine on days 8 and 15, with G-CSF to be administered on
      all days except that of docetaxel administration. The cycle is to be repeated every three
      weeks.
