      healthy, functional lives. Relapse rates for BPD are high, between 70% and 90%, with
      approximately half of those relapses occurring in the first 2 years after remission. High
      rates of relapse and no substantial improvements in illness outcomes for many patients
      despite advances in drug treatment may be related to a common problem: medication
      nonadherence. Nine in 10 individuals with BPD have seriously considered medication
      withdrawal, and one third of individuals with BDP do not take 30% or more of their prescribed
      medications. The researchers in this study will identify BPD patients who do not take their
      medications as prescribed and conduct interviews with them. By obtaining an understanding of
      subjective reasons for medication nonadherence, this study will pave the way for better
      interventions to ensure BDP patients take the medications that will help them.

      Participation in this study will consist of a single visit, lasting between 1.5 and 3 hours.
      All participants will have a history of medication nonadherence. Participants will be asked
      to fill out questionnaires and undergo a structured interview with a researcher. The
      interview will be audio recorded. The questionnaires and interview will assess BPD symptoms,
      attitudes toward medications, and to what extent patients are taking their medications.
      Researchers will also measure the number of pills used in participants' prescriptions by
      counting how many pills are left in each prescription bottle.
