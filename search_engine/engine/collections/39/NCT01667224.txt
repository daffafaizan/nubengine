      body weight and fat loss along with changes in metabolic markers based on 12 week,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

      Eighty obesity subjects with BMI > 25kg/m2 and waist-hip ratio (WHR) ≥ 0.90 for men and ≥
      0.85 for women were randomly divided into either Actiponin (n=40, 450mg/day) or placebo group
      (n=40, 450mg/day) for 12weeks.
