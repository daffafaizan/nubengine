      so stronger approaches are needed to encourage attempts to quit smoking.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether contingent reinforcement for smoking abstinence
      (CM), compared to noncontingent reinforcement (NR), increases the effectiveness of brief
      counseling and nicotine replacement on smoking abstinence of substance abusers in residential
      treatment. The proposed study will be a 2-group design in which up to 274 substance abusers
      who smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day receive brief advice (4 sessions) and nicotine
      replacement (NRT) (8 weeks), and are randomized to 19 days of CM for smoking vs. a matched NR
      condition. The brief advice is adapted slightly for sobriety settings. Point-prevalence
      abstinence will be assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after starting treatment. Secondary aims
      evaluate effects of CM on substance use outcomes and potential mediators of effects on
      outcome, including within-treatment abstinence, motivation level and tolerance for smoking
      discomfort.

      The significance is to add knowledge about the most effective ways to maximize smoking
      cessation among substance abusers, important given that no methods are known to work with
      this population.
