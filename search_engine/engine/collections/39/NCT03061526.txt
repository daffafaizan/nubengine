      into different grades. In some cases prognosis is dependent on grade of severity, especially
      in cases of retinal vein occlusion. State of the art to Diagnose the severity of retinal
      ischemia is lfuorescein angiography. However, this technique is invasive and might cause
      Problems like anaphylactic shock. Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive technique,
      but up to now there is no standardized method to quantify the grade of severity of retinal
      ischemia in such conditions like retinal vessel occlusion. The study hope to find criteria by
      which such a classification can be constructed.
