    
      BACKGROUND:

      Mtb infects one-third of the world's population and ranks seventh in terms of global
      morbidity and mortality. Patients with bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), cavitary
      disease, and persistently positive sputum smears pose a special risk for treatment failure
      and/or relapse.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Cavitary pulmonary TB will be studied and interferon-gamma will be used as the intervention.
      The outcome of this study will be the changes in mycobacteriology, chest radiography, and
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells.

      The primary outcome will be sputum conversion, which will be measured at Weeks 4 and 8.

      The key secondary outcomes of this study will include a chest computerized tomography (CT)
      scan and BAL to measure the flow of cytometry and cytokine levels. Both outcomes will be
      measured at baseline and at Month 4.
