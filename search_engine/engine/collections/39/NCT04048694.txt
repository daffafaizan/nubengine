      can be sometimes important for the patient according to the nature of the procedure.

      The estimation of the dose in the skin following a procedure of interventional cardiology is
      difficult. The knowledge of this dose allows to anticipate the appearance of determinist
      effects, and so to activate a dermatological follow-up of the exposed patient in case of
      overtaking of a dose threshold. Unfortunately, it is impossible to measure it directly and
      the thresholds of exposures are fixed from the measure of the kerma in the air accumulated at
      the exit of the tube with X-ray, what remains very indistinct.

      Since a few years the manufacturers propose tools allowing an estimation of the dose the skin
      of the patient. The DoseMap software Â® allows to consider this dose from the data of exposure
      supplied by the system. To do it, it uses a modelling simplified of the patient to feign the
      deposit of dose in the latter.

      It seems to us interesting to verify the precision of this simulation by comparing it with a
      measure of the in vivo dose.
