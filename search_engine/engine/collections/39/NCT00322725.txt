      treated with bevacizumab(with or without chemotherapy) at the University of New Mexico Cancer
      Research & Treatment Center within the last year to investigate if there is a correlation
      between bevacizumab induced hypertension and response rates. We will look at a wide variety
      of tumor types with a planned subset analysis to evaluate these correlations within
      individual tumor types. As mentioned above, Grades of bevacizumab induced hypertension is
      typically reported according to the NCI common terminology criteria for adverse events which
      will be included in our study but in addition we will also evaluate for incremental changes
      in systolic(SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean arterial blood(MAP) pressures in mmHg. Looking at
      these three variables will allow us to see if there is one component (SBP or DBP) or a
      combination of both (MAP) that may allow us to predict response. Response will be measured by
      appropriate radiographic imagine (CT scan or x-rays) and/or appropriate tumor markers. In
      addition, as VEGF appears to play a role in hypertension, we would like to look at
      pre-existing hypertension as a predictor for response and/or bevacizumab induced
      hypertension.
