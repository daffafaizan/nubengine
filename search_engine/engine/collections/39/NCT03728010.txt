      ventilation with different levels of tidal volume and PEEP.

      An extreme situation of VILI occurs in thoracic surgery, where the atelectasis of a lung is
      required, ventilating throughout the surgery only the contralateral one. This generates an
      inflammatory state, with the release of alveolar cytokines from both the non-ventilated and
      ventilated lungs, which potentiates the development of damage in the lung parenchyma. In
      addition, one lung ventilation has traditionally been performed with high tidal volume (Vt)
      values and low PEEP. In this context, the development of VILI is even more probable, so
      extreme measures of protection in this kind of ventilation are necessary.

      The electrical impedance tomography will allow the investigators to obtain a visual and
      quantitative representation of the areas of ventilation and perfusion of the lung. By
      relating the tidal volume and PEEP with the tomographic results, it is expected to define
      mechanical ventilation parameters that achieve the best ventilation/perfusion ratio for
      patients in one-lung ventilation. Specifically, analyze the distribution and deformation of
      the ventilated areas in the different lung regions and its correlation with respiratory
      mechanics and volumetric capnography. This will allow the investigators to make a better
      definition of the tidal volume and PEEP in patients undergoing one-lung ventilation.
