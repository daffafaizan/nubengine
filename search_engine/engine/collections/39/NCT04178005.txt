      designed to generate hypotheses regarding the transition to cladribine tablets after
      treatment with natalizumab in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis MS, to
      include relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and active secondary progressive
      multiple sclerosis (SPMS).

      The total duration of this interventional study will be 2 years, but patients who require
      additional time (up to 6 months) for recovery of Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) to 800
      cells/ul prior to the second treatment course will be followed for up to 6 additional months
      in order to have a full second year of follow up after initiation of the second year's
      treatment course (for a total study duration of up to 30 months in some patients). A total of
      40 study participants with relapsing forms of MS, to include RRMS and active SPMS, who meet
      the criteria for treatment with cladribine tablets as per the approved United States
      Prescribing Information (USPI) are planned to be enrolled at up to three centers in the
      United States. All study participants will receive treatment with cladribine 10 mg tablets
      during year 1 and year 2 according to the approved USPI (EMD Serono, 2019). Cladribine 10 mg
      tablets will be provided as commercial material. Treatment with cladribine tablets is
      intended to be initiated approximately 14 days after the last infusion of natalizumab (e.g.,
      a 14-day "washout"), with a maximum permissible washout period of no more than four weeks.
