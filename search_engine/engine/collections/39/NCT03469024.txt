      back pain. Patients will receive 3 weekly sessions of electroanalgesia and an exercise
      program for 8 weeks, for a total of 24 sessions. The aim is to analyze the effectiveness of a
      home rehabilitation program vs a web platform program on disability, pain, fear of movement,
      quality of life, resistance of the trunk flexors, lumbar mobility in flexion and muscular
      electrical activity.
