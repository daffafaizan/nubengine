      day 1-5. Each cycle lasts for 21 days. Oxaliplatin is given with 130 mg/m2 in the first cycle
      and in cycle 2 and 3 which are administered concomitant with radiotherapy the dose is reduced
      to 85 mg/m2.

      A loading dose of cetuximab 400 mg/m2 is given one week before the start of radiotherapy, and
      thereafter 250 mg/m2 is given weekly during the course of radiotherapy.

      Concomitant with chemotherapy radiotherapy to a total dose of 50 Gy is given (2 Gy once daily
      in 25 fractions, 5 days a week) with a photon beam linear accelerator.

      After treatment patients are followed every 6 months for three years with clinical
      examination and a CT-scan.
