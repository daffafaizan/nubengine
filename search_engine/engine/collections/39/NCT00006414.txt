      anesthesia of the proximal arm paired with practice on motor recovery after stroke. We plan
      to determine; 1) if regional anesthesia of the proximal arm (above the elbow level) paired
      with practice in chronic disabled stroke patients enhances an improvement of the hand motor
      function in addition to motor power; 2) if further enhancement of motor improvement can be
      achieved by repetitive trials of this intervention; and 3) how long this effect lasts.
