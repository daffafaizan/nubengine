      Primary

        -  To evaluate the rate of pathological complete response and clinical complete response in
           women with locally advanced breast cancer treated with pegylated doxorubicin
           hydrochloride liposome and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the overall clinical local regional response in patients treated with this
           preoperative chemotherapy regimen.

        -  To evaluate the number of patients who would have required a mastectomy upfront but who
           underwent breast conservation therapy instead after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  To assess the safety, particularly with regard to neutropenia and cardiac toxicity, of
           pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and docetaxel.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 90 minutes and
      docetaxel IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients receive pegylated filgrastim subcutaneously
      on days 2 or 3 post-chemotherapy in courses 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Within 8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo a lumpectomy or mastectomy
      to remove the tumor. Some patients may receive additional therapy after surgery, including
      hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
