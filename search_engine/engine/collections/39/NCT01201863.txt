      rehabilitation program. Eighty-eight Individuals with low Testosterone (T) levels will be
      randomized to receive either physiologic T therapy or placebo. Fifty-six Individuals with
      sufficient levels of T will be followed as a second control group. All three groups will
      undergo serial assessment of neurological function (as measured by the NIH Toolbox) and
      functional independence (FIM) to correlate with hormone levels. Hormone levels will be
      assessed through analysis of blood samples drawn from all participants at the time of study
      screening and at two week intervals for a total of 7 blood draws during the 12 week study
      period. Demographics, injury characteristics, concomitant medication usage and adverse events
      will be documented by medical record review. Statistical analysis will be performed to test
      study hypotheses. Findings will be disseminated at professional and consumer conferences and
      in peer-reviewed journals and consumer-based publications. Results will also be made
      available through the Craig Hospital website and via summary report to the Colorado TBI Trust
      Fund Research Program. If T therapy is found to be effective, findings will be used as
      preliminary data for a grant proposal for a multi-center trial.
