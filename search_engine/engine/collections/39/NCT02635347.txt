      In a recent multi-center study of 450 patients, 79% had at least one complication and 63% had
      severe (Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher) complications. The number and severity of
      complications are associated with death within 30 days, hospital length of stay, graft and
      patient survival. Infections are the most common group of complications, followed by
      pulmonary, renal and liver graft dysfunction. Interventions that decrease these complications
      after OLT are likely to improve clinical outcomes.

      Remote ischemic conditioning is an innate biological phenomenon wherein a brief single or
      repetitive ischemic stimulus in an organ or tissue such as skeletal muscle induce protection
      in remote/distant organs against ischemia and other noxious stimuli. This effect can be
      induced by inflating a pneumatic tourniquet on a leg or arm for a few minutes (usually 5-10)
      and subsequently deflating to allow reperfusion. This process is usually repeated 3-4 times
      to ensure an adequate dose of the conditioning stimulus. The conditioning stimulus could be
      applied before (Preconditioning), concurrent with (Perconditioning), or soon after the index
      noxious/ischemic insult (Postconditioning).

      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility, patient acceptance, and safety of RIC in
      liver recipients. In addition, the investigators will obtain data on posttransplant
      complications. Information obtained from this study will help guide the design of a future
      randomized, controlled trial to test the benefit of RIC in liver recipients.
