    
      The phase II of the study will assess the safety and the efficacy of a continuous intravenous
      infusion of exenatide for the management of post operative stress hyperglycemia after planned
      coronary artery graft bypass (CABG) surgery.

      A nested cohort study will concern the 24 first patients included in the study (12
      patients/group) to assess the impact of a continuous intravenous infusion of exenatide on
      post operative glycemic variability after planned CABG surgery.

      The aim of the phase III of the study will compare the efficacy of a continuous intravenous
      infusion of exenatide to the gold standard treatment, i.e the intravenous infusion of
      short-acting insulin, for the management of post operative stress hyperglycemia after planned
      CABG surgery.
