    
      Forty patients are randomized to receive either PCC and fibrinogen concentrate (PCC group) or
      FFP (and fibrinogen if needed) (FFP group), 20 patients in each group. Patients in the PCC
      group receive 15 IU/kg of PCC concentrate and 2 g of fibrinogen concentrate. Patients in the
      FFP group receive 4 units of FFP. In both groups, additional fibrinogen is administered (if
      needed) to increase the baseline FIBTEM-MCF (at 5 min) to the target of 15 mm.

      Baseline blood samples will be drawn at study inclusion when the (on-going) blood loss
      exceeds 1500 ml. The next samples will be drawn at 45 min (or immediately after the
      administration of the study drug if later). Otherwise, the management protocol strictly
      follows the local PPH guideline.

      The primary endpoint is the amount of blood loss within the first 6 and 24 hours after
      delivery. Secondary endpoints include the difference/similarity in the laboratory
      determinations (ia coagulation screen, PFA-100, CAT and ROTEM).
