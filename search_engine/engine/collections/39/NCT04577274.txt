      glucose homeostasis, insulin and lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic and obese individuals.
      We compared between a regular high protein or a high protein and low carbohydrate smoothie
      drinks with conventional diabetic enteral drinks (Glucerna). A crossover design study was
      done in 60 diabetic participants. Participants consumed 300 kilocalories of each drink at a
      time with one week wash out period between drinks and glucose response curves at baseline,
      30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes were monitored and compared. The products were
      formulated to supply 1 kilocalorie/milliliter (kcal/ml). Dietary compositions in regular
      formulas (smoothie, SM) were 30-40% carbohydrate, 20-30% protein and 30-50% fat. While in
      smoothie with low carbohydrate formulas (SMLS), they were 25-35% carbohydrate, 25-30% protein
      and 35-55% fat vs. a control formula (Glucerna).
