      health globally. No specific pharmacological treatments are available to date for
      COVID-19.Patients contracting the severe form of the disease constitute approximately 15% of
      the cases which is characterized by extensive acute inflammation. In these severe cases,
      there will be rapid respiratory system failure.

      MSCs have been employed extensively in cell therapy, which includes a plethora of preclinical
      research investigations as well as a significant number of clinical trials. Safety and
      efficacy have been shown in many clinical trials. Previous studies have shown that MSCs could
      significantly reduce inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, reduce inflammation in
      lung tissue, and significantly improve lung The structure and function of tissues protect
      lung tissue from damage.The mechanisms underlying the improvements after MSC infusion in
      COVID-19 patients also appeared to be the robust antiinflammatory activity of MSCs. Recent
      studies also showed that intravenous MSC infusion could reduce the overactivation of the
      immune system and support repair by modulating the lung microenvironment after SARS-CoV-2
      infection. MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting
      endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion
      of mesenchymal stem cells in severe patients With COVID-19.The respiratory function,
      pulmonary inflammation, clinical symptoms, pulmonary imaging, side effects, immunological
      characteristics will be evaluated.
