      cardiovascular events and the degeneration of sensory nerves in patient diagnosed with type 2
      diabetes mellitus, undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery. Diabetes mellitus and peripheral
      sensory nerve degeneration will be diagnosed via clinical evaluation. Serum levels of
      constituent neuropeptides, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), calcitonin and substance P (SP)
      and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1
      (TRPV1), a molecular nociceptor in peripheral sensory nerves will be quantitatively
      evaluated. The clinical and the biochemical consequence will be compared between the cohorts
      of diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The differences and the correlations will be analyzed.
      The results of the study may reveal whether or not the perioperative adverse cardiovascular
      events in diabetic patients are correlated with degeneration of peripheral sensory nerves and
      the alterations in the neuropeptides and TRPV1 are potentially applicable for evaluation of
      the risk of cardiovascular events in perioperative period in diabetic patients.
