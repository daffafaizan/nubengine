      admission). The information gathered will be from the standard clinical care delivered and
      include demographics, baseline function, the injuries sustained following trauma and
      prescribed analgesia with records of the most recent time and dose administered. Any scans
      done of the neck for clinical purposes will be anonymised and analysed for measurements of
      angulation. In addition to this there will be a survey on the comfort of the collar and of
      their functional ability at the current time at various points during their inpatient
      admission.
