      safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug), pharmacodynamics (study of
      what a drug does to the body), and anti-tumor activities of STM 434 (an inhibitor of activin
      A) in patients with ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors. The study will be
      conducted in 3 phases (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3). In the first part of the study (Part 1),
      which will enroll patients with multiple solid tumor types, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of STM 434 will be determined for use in the second and third parts of the study (Parts 2 and
      3). In the second part (Part 2), which will enroll patients with ovarian cancer, STM 434 will
      be administered alone, and in the third part (Part 3), which will enroll patients with
      ovarian cancer, STM 434 will be given together with a chemotherapy called liposomal
      doxorubicin. Doses of STM 434 (starting at 0.25 mg/kg up to a maximum of 4 mg/kg) will be
      taken on one of three dosing schedules to determine the MTD. Patients will continue taking
      STM 434 until their tumor progresses. Serial blood samples will be collected for
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic testing and safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.
