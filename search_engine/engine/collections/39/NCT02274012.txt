    
      Standard Procedures:

      Subjects are offered second line chemotherapy with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 intravenous infusion
      over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle until disease progression or
      intolerable toxicity.

      Experimental Procedures:

      In addition to the standard chemotherapy, afatinib 40 mg orally once daily will be
      administered starting on the first day of paclitaxel. Translational studies to assess
      circulating tumor cells at the start of therapy and then at several later time points,
      including at the time of progression. These studies will assess the correlation of
      circulating tumor cell numbers with radiographic response and pilot studies will also be
      conducted to assess HER2 expression, HER2 genomic amplification, HER2 pathway activation and
      secondary genetic changes in the HER2 coding sequence as well as other pathway components.
