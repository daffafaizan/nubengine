      • Phone call interview:

      First stage included patient reported outcomes of visual function, spectacle independence and
      satisfaction through questionnaires conducted by a phone call in all the patients implanted
      in our center with AT LISA 839MP from March 2014 to June 2015 (n=92) which accomplished
      inclusion / exclusion criteria and were able to be contacted by phone (n=62).

      The incidence of Nd-YAG capsulotomy was retrospectively evaluated through the revision of the
      medical history, in patients for which capsulotomy was conducted in our center, or a
      question, for those treated in another center.

      • Study visit:

      Second stage included the consecutive invitation of these phone interviewed patients to a
      visit in our center for a long-term visual performance assessment up to accomplish the
      required sample size (n=37).

      Corrected and uncorrected monocular visual acuities were the primary end-points for testing
      non-inferiority hypothesis in comparison to 12-month follow-up mean results reported in the
      literature. Secondary variables of assessment were contrast sensitivity defocus curve and
      light distortion analysis.
