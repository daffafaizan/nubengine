      nurses asking about their pneumococcal vaccination status and whether they would like to be
      vaccinated. We compared six month follow-up of pneumococcal vaccination in electronic medical
      records for the intervention versus control group. We tested the percent vaccinated in each
      randomization arm using chi-square tests for proportions.
