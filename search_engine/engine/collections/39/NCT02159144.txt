      white adipose was performed before and after one week cold exposure programme under local
      anesthesia. Measure the brown fat characteristics of biopsy samples. The expression levels of
      uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-r, peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor r coactivator 1 a (PGC1a) , growth factor receptor binding
      protein-10 (Grb10), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) will be determined before and after cold
      stress programme from the biopsy samples. In addition, a combination of PET and computed
      tomography (CT) - with the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) as a tracer will
      be performed for brown adipose tissue before and after cold stress programme.
