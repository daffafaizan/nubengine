      disease and arthritis, in addition to vascular complications with thrombophlebitis,
      thrombosis and rarely central nervous system involvement. IL-6 activity has been suggested in
      the pathogenesis in some studies. Tocilizumab with its unique mode of action among biologic
      agents may be a good candidate in this orphan disease.
