    
      Placebo-controlled, double-masked, multiple-dose, Phase 3 study in approximately 160
      randomized subjects with DLD (approximately 136 that are evaluable for efficacy), evaluating
      safety and efficacy of Nyxol in subjects with DLD following administration of Nyxol once
      daily (QD) at or near bedtime (at 8PM to 10PM) in both eyes (OU) for 14 days.

      Following the successful completion of screening, each subject will be stratified by iris
      color (light/dark irides) and will then be randomized to treatment (masked) 1:1, Nyxol or
      placebo (vehicle).

      Treatment (Nyxol or placebo) will be administered in both eyes (OU) by the subjects at or
      near bedtime each day.

      At the first visit subjects will be screened for study eligibility.

      Treatment visits will occur 2 times: Day 8 (+1 day)/Visit 2 and Day 15 (+1 day)/Visit 3.
      mLCVA evaluations shall be performed on each of these days.

      A follow-up visit (Visit 4) phone call will occur 1 to 3 days after Visit 3.

      At select sites OPD Scan measurements will be made using wavefront abhermettry.
