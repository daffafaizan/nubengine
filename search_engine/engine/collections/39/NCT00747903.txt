        -  To determine the safety and efficacy of intralesional photodynamic therapy using
           aminolevulinic acid and non-coherent blue light in patients with nodular basal cell
           carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo photodynamic therapy comprising intralesional injection of
      aminolevulinic acid followed by non-coherent blue light therapy over approximately 17
      minutes. Patients may undergo re-treatment with photodynamic therapy 8 weeks later.

      Patients undergo photographic assessment of their skin lesions at baseline, 8 weeks, 16
      weeks, and then at 1 and 2 years to evaluate healing time, clinical improvement, and side
      effects.

      Patients undergo biopsies of their skin lesions at 16 weeks and then at 1 and 2 years to
      confirm histological clearance.
