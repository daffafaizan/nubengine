      which induce an upgraded half-life of this two proteins.

      It's extended role involve the regulation of immune complexes and anti-tumoral immunity, some
      studies showing a direct correlation between it's expression and the tumor surface and
      prognosis.

      Recently a role in the upregulation of humoral response with a increase of the antibodies's
      diversity and a more efficient priming of lymphocyte B have been evocated.

      The lupus erythematosus is an auto-immune disease mediated by IgG and immune complexes
      characterized by a high diversity of autoantibodies and a large dysregulation of the immune
      system in all it's components.

      In this study, by analogy with the founding in anti-tumoral immunity, the investigators
      hypothesised that in an active lupus disease the expression of FcRn is upregulated in the
      white blood cells and in APC.

      This is followed by an extended half life of IgG autoantibodies and immune complexes inducing
      direct damages by their deposit in tissues and indirectly by upregulating the humoral
      response, leading to anormal production of a large panel of autoantibodies.
