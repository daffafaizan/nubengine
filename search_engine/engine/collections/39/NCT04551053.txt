      mg BID and will have been on that dose for at least the last 8 weeks prior to Day 1. At least
      3 months duration of prior ruxolitinib is required. Participants must meet Protocol-defined
      criteria for suboptimal response to ruxolitinib monotherapy. After participants have been
      determined to be eligible for the study and completed the baseline symptom diary assessment
      for 7 days, they will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups, with stratification for
      platelet count (≥ 100 × 10^9/L vs 50 to < 100 × 10^9/L inclusive) and DIPSS risk category
      (high vs intermediate-2 vs intermediate-1).

      Once a participant has completed the week 24 assessments, the participant's treatment
      assignment will then be unblinded and if found to be placebo, the participant will have the
      opportunity to crossover to begin receiving parsaclisib, together with continued ruxolitinib,
      as long as hematology parameters are adequate.
