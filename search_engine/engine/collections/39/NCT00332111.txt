        1. To determine what is the frequency of infectious complications following pancreas
           transplantation

        2. Characterize the clinical and microbiological aspects of the infectious complications
           following pancreas transplantation

        3. Identify predictors for infection following pancreas transplantation

        4. Determine the frequency of graft loss and associated mortality of infectious
           complications following pancreas transplantation
