      have iron deficiency anemia coexisting with subclinical hypothyroidism have been included in
      this study. Patients were randomly assigned to oral iron or oral iron plus levothyroxin
      therapy. The physician and the patients did not know who received oral iron only or oral iron
      plus levothyroxine treatment. Hematologic parameters as well as serum iron, ferritin and iron
      binding capacity were being measured at the beginning and 3 months after treatment in both
      groups.
