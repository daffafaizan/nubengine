      subjects with intermetatarsal neuralgia will receive subcutaneous normal saline or
      subcutaneous lidocaine or ultrasound guided cryoablation. The first follow up will take place
      4 weeks post procedure to monitor the magnitude and duration of pain relief. Subjects will
      then be crossed over. Those who had received saline or lidocaine will receive ultrasound
      guided cryoablation. Individuals, who had previously been given ultrasound guided
      cryoablation without any improvement, may opt for another denervation procedure at 4 weeks.
      All of the participants will be followed up at 3 months post procedure to determine the
      magnitude and duration of pain relief.

      Study procedures will be conducted by the principle investigator who is a Board Certified
      pain management attending physician and an expert in performing ultrasonography guided
      interventions The cryoablation device is routinely used to treat various painful pathologies
      at Mount Sinai and Beth Israel pain management offices. The device manual and instructions
      will be available at both locations. All research staff has prior experience working with
      individuals with foot and ankle injuries at Mount Sinai.
