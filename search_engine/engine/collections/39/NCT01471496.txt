      uncertain. A prophylactic injection therapy may reduce the recurrent bleeding rate at this
      group of patients having this endoscopic stigma of recent bleeding. This type of ulcers are
      named as type IIb duodenal ulcers according to Forrest's classification, They cary the risk
      of bleeding recurrence up to 36 percent and as it is reported previously there may be a 12
      fold increasement in morbidity and mortality in such cases. A prophylactic endoscopic
      injection therapy may reduce the risk of recurrent bleeding in this group of the patients.
