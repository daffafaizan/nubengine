      the use of PRO 140 as an add-on therapy to standard GVHD prophylaxis treatment for prevention
      of acute GVHD in adult patients undergoing RIC allogeneic HCT.

      In this study, up to 60 subjects will be enrolled. PRO 140 will be administered as a 525 mg
      subcutaneous injection on Day -3 or Day -2 prior to stem cell infusion, on the day of stem
      cell infusion (Day 0), and then weekly for up to 100Â±7 days. Subjects will return to the
      clinic for three Follow-up visits at 2 weeks after the last treatment visit, 30 days after
      the last treatment visit and one year after the first treatment visit.
