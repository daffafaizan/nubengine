      al.1993) and antidepressants are the cornerstone of treatment. As antidepressants usually
      require 3-6 weeks of use before a response occurs, an effective antidepressant acceleration
      strategy would reduce the time of onset for an effective antidepressant response. This has
      significant clinical implications, as it could lead to reduced symptom morbidity, potentially
      reduce health care cost (i.e. shorter hospital length of stay), and improve functional
      capacity and quality of life.

      The goal of this study is to enhance our understanding of strategies that accelerate or
      produce a more rapid treatment response in depression. This could lead to reduced symptom
      morbidity, potentially reduce health care cost (i.e. shorter hospital length of stay), and
      improve functional capacity and quality of life.

      The study goals are: 1.) To assess whether the simultaneous commencement of liothyronine or
      pindolol to an SSRI can accelerate the treatment response (i.e. faster rate of improvement),
      2.) To assess whether the simultaneous commencement of liothyronine or pindolol to an SSRI
      can augment or enhance treatment response (i.e. greater reduction in depressive symptoms at
      end of study phase), adn 3.) To assess whether gender influences the acceleration of
      augmentation response rate of liothyronine or pindolol.
