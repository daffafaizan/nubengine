    
      Study Objectives are to evaluate the proportion of patients with low-intermediate risk
      prostate cancer undergoing focal laser ablation (MRgFLA) prostate treatment who will be free
      of clinically significant Prostate Cancer (PCa), when using a > 5mm margins around the MR
      visible tumor in defining the ablation contour. The rationale of the study is to show that
      MRgFLA is a safe procedure that can significantly postpone or eliminate the need for patients
      with Low-Intermediate Risk prostate cancer to undergo a definitive treatment (i.e., Radical
      Prostatectomy or Radiation therapy) for their disease. Study population: patients with
      Low-Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer who are willing to take part in the study and meet
      study eligibility criteria. Primary Study Objective is to show that MRgFLA can significantly
      reduce the need for definitive treatment (e.g., Radical Prostatectomy, or Radiation therapy)
      and is a safe procedure for patients with Low-Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer defined in
      the current protocol as 1) Gleason score 6 and 7 (=3+4 or 4+3; No Grade 5 pattern), and 2)
      T1-T2, N0, M0.
