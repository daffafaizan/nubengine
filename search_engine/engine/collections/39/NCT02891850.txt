      riociguat may be feasible, safe and beneficial in patients not adequately responding to
      PDE5i.

      REPLACE is a randomized controlled study to confirm the potential clinical benefit of
      transition from PDE5i to riociguat. Satisfactory clinical response in patients who are on a
      stable dose of phosphodiesterase-5inhibitors (PDE-5i) with or without endothelin receptor
      antagonist (ERA), but not at treatment goal will be compared between one group of patients
      randomized to maintain current treatment and another group where the PDE5i is replaced by
      riociguat.
