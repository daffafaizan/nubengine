      thromboembolic treatment, ER vs inpatient treatment and cardiology consultation could lead to
      disparate care of patients. Therefore, there is a need for future studies to standardize
      practice leading to improved management, decreased rates of hospitalization and overall cost.
      Investigators developed a multidimensional protocol for the management of AF in the emergency
      department. Investigators aimed to assess if this new ER AF management protocol would result
      in better outcomes compared to routine care.
