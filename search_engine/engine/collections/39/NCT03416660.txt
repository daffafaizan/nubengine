      Clinic, Dermatology Department, Cairo University. Each has three post burn scars, assigned to
      monthly fractional Carbon dioxide laser sessions with a total of 3 sessions. parameters are :

      Lesion A or part A parameters: 20 W, 800-1000μs dwell time, 2 to 3 stacks according to scar
      thickness, 900µm spacing (7.4% density).

      Lesion B or part B parameters: 20 W, 800-1000μs dwell time, 2 to 3 stacks according to scar
      thickness, 600µm spacing (12.6% density).

      Lesion C or part C parameters: 20 W, 800-1000μs dwell time, 2 to 3 stacks according to scar
      thickness, 300 µm spacing (25.6% density).

      3 mm punch biopsy is taken before and one month after last session for assessment of collagen
      via (Masson's trichrome strain). In addition clinical evaluation is done via Vancouver &
      Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale .
