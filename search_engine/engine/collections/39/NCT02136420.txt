      sickness, through the Apollo exploration era, and into current planning of exploration
      missions. The proposed research program takes a new approach which could lead to an
      effective, practical and acceptable protocol for preadapting astronauts to space flight. By
      using the gravito-inertial alterations possible with centrifugation in different body
      orientations the investigators will quantify an individual's sensory adaptation capability
      and use it to predict and to minimize the consequences of movement in any other gravity
      environment - eventually including weightlessness. The investigators will also study whether
      a drug (promethazine) affects motion perception and motion sickness.
