      with increased transmission of HIV-1 to the fetus. Slowing the progression of disease,
      reducing the titer of virus in plasma, and increasing the titer of epitope-specific antibody
      are potentially attainable goals through active immunization of the mother during pregnancy.

      Pregnant women are randomized to receive an initial injection of VaxSyn or alum placebo
      between week 16 and week 24 of gestation, followed by monthly booster injections concluding
      at the end of pregnancy, for a total of five injections. Patients may have optional booster
      immunizations (vaccine or placebo) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after delivery. Mothers and
      infants are followed through 18 months after delivery.
