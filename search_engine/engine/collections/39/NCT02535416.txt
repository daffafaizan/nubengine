    
      This is a single-center, open-label, sequential cohort, single-dose study of ARC-520
      administered intravenously to healthy adult volunteers. Eligible subjects will receive a
      single intravenous injection of ARC-520. Up to 8 cohorts (a total of approximately 40
      subjects) may be enrolled. ARC-520 (4.0 mg/kg) will be administered at increasing infusion
      rates up to a bolus push in cohort 5. In addition dose levels at 5.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg will
      be evaluated at an infusion rate of 0.9 mL/min. For each subject the duration of the study
      clinic visits is approximately 6 weeks; maximum study duration is approximately 17 weeks
      including follow-up telephone calls at Days 30, 60 and 90.

      Participants will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals: medical history,
      physical examinations, bee venom allergy blood test, vital signs measurements, weight,
      adverse event monitoring, electrocardiograms (ECGs), telemetry, pregnancy test (females),
      concurrent medication, blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation, chemistry,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug screens, and urinalysis.
