      While NO is administered in some outpatient clinics for surgical abortion, its effect on pain
      has not been systematically studied in a randomized controlled trial in women undergoing
      first trimester surgical abortion under local/oral analgesia. Expanding pain management
      options for women undergoing abortion confers significant public health benefits.
