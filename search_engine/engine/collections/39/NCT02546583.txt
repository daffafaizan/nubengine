    
      This study is a minimal-risk observational open-label single center study with randomization
      between two standard of care interventions. Approximately 500 patients admitted to the
      hospital (Yale New Haven Health System) with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure will be
      enrolled in the overall study.

      Patients will undergo sampling of their blood and collection of urine at a minimum of 4
      timepoints (called "visits"), or a minimum of 5 in the interventional arm. Patients with a
      low urine sodium output (<100 mmol) on Visit 1 will be eligible for 1:1 randomization to
      either an increased dose of their Visit 1 loop diuretic or addition of IV chlorothiazide to
      their Visit 1 loop diuretic.
