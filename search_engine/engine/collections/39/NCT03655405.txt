      effects outweigh potential benefits or which are not useful anymore. Inappropriate medication
      have been linked with worse health outcomes, hospitalisations and death. Deprescribing, the
      structured process of withdrawing or tapering inappropriate medications, has been studied as
      a potential solution to this problem.

      In this study, nursing home residents living in institution which are already engaged in a
      deprescribing process will be randomly allocated to receive a medication review or usual
      care. The medication review will be performed by the nursing home pharmacist an its results
      will be discussed with the responsible physicians and nurses to create a deprescribing plan
      specifically tailored to the needs of the resident.
