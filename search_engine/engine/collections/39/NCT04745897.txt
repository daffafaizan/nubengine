    
      This is a two-arm superiority randomized controlled trial. The primary objective is to
      compare the accessibility of information between the eTB catalogue (intervention) and WHO TB
      (comparison). Secondary outcomes include understanding of the information, satisfaction of
      catalogue presentation, and preference toward the catalogue. Current and potential users of
      TB recommendations will be recruited. Data will be collected using a survey with demographic
      questions and subsequent 1:1 randomization to the intervention. Superiority will be declared
      if the mean difference in accessibility is 0.5 or greater for the intervention arm on the
      seven-point Likert scale.
