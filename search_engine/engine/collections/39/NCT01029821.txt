      costs. While prophylaxis may reduce the number of thrombi formed the exact number and
      clinical significance of these is unknown. This study seeks to answer the question of whether
      or not DVT prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) following ORIF of ankle
      fractures is warranted.
