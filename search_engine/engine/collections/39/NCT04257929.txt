    
      The study will consist of a Screening Period, an 11-week Double-Blind Treatment Phase
      (including a 3-week Titration Period and an 8-week Stable Dose Period), and an optional Open
      Label Extension (OLE) Phase. The OLE Phase will be multi-year in duration and will continue
      until either pitolisant is approved for patients with PWS or the Sponsor elects to terminate
      the study.

      Approximately 60 patients ages 6 to 65 years who meet all eligibility criteria will be
      randomized at the Baseline Visit in a 1:1:1 ratio to low dose pitolisant, high dose
      pitolisant, or matching placebo. In the Double-Blind Treatment Phase, patients will be
      titrated to their randomized stable dose of study drug during the 3-week Titration Period.

      After completion of the 3-week Titration Period, patients will continue to take study drug at
      their randomized stable dose once daily in the morning upon wakening for an additional 8
      weeks of blinded treatment (Stable Dose Period). The duration of the Double-Blind Treatment
      Phase will be 11 weeks.

      Following the 11-week Double-Blind Treatment Phase, eligible patients will be given the
      opportunity to participate in an optional OLE Phase. During the OLE Phase, all eligible
      patients will receive treatment with open-label pitolisant and will undergo titration during
      a 3-week Titration Period to a maximum target dose based on their age. At the end of the
      3-week Titration Period, patients will continue to take their target dose of pitolisant once
      daily in the morning upon wakening until the end of the study.
