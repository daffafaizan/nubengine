      complications. The technique called breath stacking consists of an instrumental feature
      composed of a unidirectional valve coupled to a face mask to promote the accumulation of
      successive inspiratory volumes. The technique is used to prevent atelectasis and improve gas
      exchange. Another therapy is called expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) that uses
      positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in spontaneously breathing patients, keeping the
      airway open during expiration. The EPAP system consists of a face mask, a one-way valve and
      the expiratory resistor, which is responsible for resistance to expiratory flow, which will
      determine the level of PEEP.
