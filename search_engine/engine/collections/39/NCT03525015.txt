      lack of cataract surgery decision aid in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of a cataract surgery decision aid for cataract patients with
      different levels of health literacy.

      We will conduct a randomized controlled trial for cataract patients aged 50-80 years. We will
      randomly assign participants to either the intervention using a decision aid booklet or the
      one using a usual cataract booklet. The primary outcome is informed choice (defined as
      adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and intentions) 2 weeks after
      intervention.
