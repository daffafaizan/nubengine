      a difficult task for clinical physicians. Grape seed proanthocyanidin extrat (GSPE) has been
      reported to exert an antiatherogenic effect by inducing regression of atherosclerotic plaques
      in animal experimental studies. In this study, the antiatherogenic effect of GSPE has been
      investigated in clinical use.
