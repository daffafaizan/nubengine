      approximately 1.8 million persons, 25% of the adult population, have hypertension.
      Hypertension is a common diagnosis in primary health care and the costs of investigating and
      treating hypertension and its consequences are considerable. We know that stress can affect
      blood pressure, but it is hard to measure and control.

      Previous studies have separately shown that yoga can reduce levels of cortisol in saliva and
      lower blood pressure. However, few studies have investigated the effects of yoga on
      hypertension and we lack information about the possibility of using yoga in primary health
      care to reduce hypertension.

      If yoga can be used to complement antihypertensive medicines, it could reduce medicine intake
      and thereby possibly reduce side effects and lower medicine costs. It is to be hoped that
      patients will also experience a higher quality of life if they perform yoga on a regular
      basis.
