    
      The study employed the Sequential Parallel Comparison Design (SPCD), a clinical study design
      which intend to increase signal detection by using two stages of treatment:

        -  Stage 1 - first 6 weeks of the 12-weeks treatment period (Visit 2/Baseline 1 to Visit
           5/Week 6)

        -  Stage 2 - last 6 weeks of the 12-weeks treatment period (Visit 5/Baseline 2 to Visit
           8/Week 12)

      In Stage 1, patients were randomized to placebo or vortioxetine 10 or 20mg. Patients on
      vortioxetine 10 or 20mg/day during Stage 1 remained on the same treatment in Stage 2.
      Responders to placebo in Stage 1 remained on Placebo in Stage 2. Patients who were placebo
      non-responders during Stage 1, defined as patients with a <30% reduction in AISRS total score
      from Baseline 1, were re-randomized to placebo or vortioxetine 10 or 20mg/day in Stage 2.
