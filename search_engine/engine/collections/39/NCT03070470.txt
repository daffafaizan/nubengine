      J-Tpeakc intervals in Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies can be used to confirm that
      "balanced ion channel" drugs do not cause J-Tpeakc prolongation and that "predominant hERG"
      drugs cause QTc prolongation. This clinical study consists of 2 parts: a 50-subject parallel
      part (Part 1) and a 10-subject crossover part (Part 2). Up to 74 healthy subjects will be
      enrolled (including 14 potential replacement subjects).

      Part 1 will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 1 period parallel design to
      assess the effect of 4 marketed drugs and 1 placebo on the QTc and J-Tpeakc intervals in 50
      healthy subjects. A parallel design similar to a single or multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD)
      Phase 1 study will be used that will result in each study drug being administered to 10
      subjects, and placebo to 10 subjects, in 1 period of 3 consecutive days to achieve low and
      high drug exposure.

      Part 2 will be a double-blind, randomized, 2-period crossover design to assess the effect of
      hERG block (dofetilide) versus calcium block (diltiazem) on the QTc and J-Tpeakc intervals in
      10 healthy subjects on Days 1, 2, and 3 (Period 1) and Days 8, 9, and 10 (Period 2).
