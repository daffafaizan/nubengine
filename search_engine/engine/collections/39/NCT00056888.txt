    
      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to determine the brain regions responsible
      during attacks for psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders using functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The secondary objective is to determine the
      neurophysiology during attacks for the same subjects compared to normal controls using
      electroencephalography (EEG) and Startle Reflex.

      Study population: Psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorder patients and a
      control group of healthy volunteers.

      Design:

      fMRI: Anatomical MRI and fMRI sequences are performed to obtain blood-oxygenation
      level-dependent (BOLD) imaging of brain activation during (1) triggered or provoked
      involuntary hyperkinetic movements and voluntary imitated movements in subjects with
      psychogenic paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders and (2) voluntary imitated movements
      and rest states in healthy volunteers.

      EEG: EEG will be recorded for jerk-locked back-averaging analysis.

      Startle Reflex: Electromyography (EMG) will be recorded during exposure to auditory stimuli.

      Outcome measures:

      fMRI: BOLD will be obtained using baseline correction.

      EEG

      Startle Reflex: The latency, mean amplitude, and habituation of EMG amplitude will be
      measured.
