    
      Participants: Six HIV-positive pre-menopausal women already undergoing therapy with
      raltegravir.

      Procedures (methods): This study will be conducted at a single site: the University of North
      Carolina at Chapel Hill. An outpatient screening visit will assess subject suitability and
      willingness to participate. During one pharmacokinetic visit women will be asked to
      self-collect cervicovaginal samples using a cervicovaginal fluid aspirator at the following
      time points: pre-dose and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after raltegravir 400mg dose
      administration. One 3mL EDTA tube will be collected at the same time points to analyze blood
      plasma. A follow-up safety visit will be completed within 30 days of the inpatient stay.
