      (baseline) and after an open endotracheal suctioning manoeuvre. Based on these changes
      patients will be divided into two groups: Group A with more than 94% of baseline FRC, and
      Group B with less than 94% of baseline FRC. Both groups will be randomized to receive an
      alveolar recruitment manoeuvre or no alveolar recruitment manoeuvre, leading to four groups.
      Oxygenation and regional ventilation with electrical impedance tomography will be studied.
