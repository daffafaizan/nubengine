      hypertonia in the elbow flexors of patients with severe acquired brain injury in their
      sub-acute rehabilitation and collect data to determine the necessary size for a definitive
      study to determine the clinimetrics of the test methods. The long-term goal is to establish a
      valid and clinically feasible method for physiotherapists to quantify muscle tone in patients
      with neurological disorders.

      The study hypotheses are:

        1. SWE, PSAD and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) measurements can be obtained for elbow
           flexion hypertonia in all patients (no missing data due to test procedure),

        2. SWE and PSAD have a moderate to good intra-day intra-tester reliability (ICC two-way
           mixed effects model with absolute agreement. ICC>0.5, Bland Altman)

        3. Passive muscle stiffness measured using the PSAD and SWE have a fair concurrent validity
           with MAS (Spearmans correlation >0.3)

        4. SWE and PSAD are responsive in measuring a reduction of the effect of routine clinical
           treatment of the hypertonic muscles with botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) (paired T-test
           or Wilcoxon test, p>0.05)
