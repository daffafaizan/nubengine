      relapsed non-small cell lung cancer who have failed first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
      II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the efficacy of this drug, in
      terms of time to death, time to disease progression, disease control, and duration of
      response, in these patients. V. Assess the therapy outcome index, in terms of disease-related
      symptom relief, of these patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to time to relapse or
      progression after completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (12 weeks or less vs
      more than 12 weeks). Patients receive ZD0473 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of each course, and then every 6
      weeks for 1 year after completion of study. Patients are followed at 30 days after study
      completion and every 6 weeks for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-73 patients (23-56 per stratum 1 and 9-17 per stratum 2)
      will be accrued for this study within approximately 9 months.
