      in high diagnostic and therapeutic costs. The overall costs associated with the care of
      patients with cardiovascular disease is projected to be $286.5 billion. Although MRI is a
      relatively expensive technology, this methodology can provide all the noninvasive diagnostic
      testing necessary to evaluate and triage patients with coronary artery disease. This "one
      stop shop" has the potential to lower overall testing on this important patient population
      and better delineate which patients require intervention. Beyond reproducing the results of
      existing diagnostic tests, MRI has unique abilities to characterize myocardial tissue adding
      information in the assessment of these patients that is not attainable by currently available
      methodologies. This study will examine the hypothesis that MRI assessment of regional LV
      function, resting myocardial perfusion, and myocardial tissue characteristics can accurately
      detect a higher fraction of patients with acute myocardial infarction than is possible with
      the ECG performed in the emergency department.
