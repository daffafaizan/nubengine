      medication and/or radiation to destroy all leukemia cells as well as other blood cells. In
      order to survive this treatment, patients will need to be given the stem cells from another
      person to replace the blood cells killed by the treatment.

      The stem cells given to the recipient will be collected from a relative. To increase the
      number of stem cells in the relative, he/she is given a growth factor to increase the number
      of stem cells prior to collection. The standard growth factor used is called
      G-CSF(Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor ). In this research study, the physician will
      give the relative either G-CSF or a combination of G-CSF and GM-CSF (Granulocyte Macrophage
      (GM)) , another type of growth factor. Whether the relative receives G-CSF or GM-CSF will be
      determined by chance. The donors will be randomized to one or the other. It is not known if
      the stem cells and white blood cells collected using one or both growth factors results in
      more cures for this disease and fewer side effects, such as graft-versus-host disease.

      The reason for doing the study is to determine if the stem cells and other white blood cells
      collected are any different when different growth factors are given, and to see how well the
      patient does. The stem cell transplant will in every other way be the same. The only
      difference is that if the recipient and donor decide to be in this study, the donor will
      either be given only G-CSF or the combination of G-CSF and GM-CSF and the recipient will
      receive the stem cells collected.
