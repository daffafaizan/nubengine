      Procedural Sedation and Analgesia (PSA) when compared to Intravenous Ketamine (IVK) in
      children with non-operative fractures. The primary aim is to determine if INK provides
      non-inferior sedation to IVK as defined by a Modified Ramsay Sedation score of â‰¥ 4 and also
      to compare the proportion of successful procedure between two treatment groups. The secondary
      aim is to compare proportion of adverse events and compare duration of sedation and length of
      emergency department (ED) stay between treatment groups.
