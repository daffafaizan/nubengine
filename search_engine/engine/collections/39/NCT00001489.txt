      gamma-vinyl-GABA (vigabatrin--GVG) an experimental antiepileptic drug, on cerebral glucose
      metabolism (LCMRglc), blood flow (CBF), and seizure frequency, in patients with uncontrolled
      complex partial (CPS) and secondary generalized seizures (GTCS). Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) will be used to measure CBF and LCMRglc.
