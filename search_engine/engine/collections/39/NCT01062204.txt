      with the new AltrazealTM flexible hydrogel nanoparticle dressing compared to the existing
      treatment standard (Aquacel Â® AG sodium carboxymethylcellulose dressing) in patients with at
      least two skin graft donor sites. 40 patients with at least 2 skin graft donor sites, ranging
      in age from 3 and 85 years, will be enrolled. Children (age 3 to 16 inclusive) will be
      included in the patient population if possible, but should not exceed 50% of all patient
      enrolled. Researchers will first identify the skin donor sites (A and B) for each patient and
      take baseline digital images and measurements immediately following surgery (Day 1). Trained
      personnel will apply the dressings provided by the Sponsor for and labeled as A or B by the
      Sponsor in a random fashion. Typical meticulous wound care and adequate analgesic medical
      coverage will be provided for the duration of the study. Both the patient and medical staff
      will be trained on instructions for use of each dressing. The patients will be monitored
      daily as part of standard procedure while they are in the in-patient setting. If and when
      patients move to the out-patient setting, they will continue to be monitored at least
      every-other-day at the study center. On each day (in-patient) or every-other-day
      (outpatient), the physician will determine whether each skin graft donor site has healed per
      standard care guidelines (i.e. > 95% re-epithelization), and pain and adverse events will be
      monitored. The last study visit will be on Day 24 or on the day when both wounds have been
      assessed as "healed", whichever comes first.
