      to neurological problems, patients with Parkinson's Disease often suffer from debilitating
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms related to delayed stomach emptying, gas/bloating, and
      constipation. GI complaints of patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease are poorly
      understood. This proposal aims to characterize GI disturbance in patients with Parkinson's
      Disease and provide deeper understanding by investigating symptoms, regional and whole gut
      transit, anorectal physiology, and the brain-gut axis. The investigator believes patients
      with Parkinson's Disease will show altered GI sensation, slower GI motility and demonstrate
      deranged regulation of the brain-gut axis correlated to severity of Parkinson's disease.
      Results from this study of GI motility and brain-gut axis will define a subset of Parkinson's
      Disease patients that can benefit from tailored treatment. This study will foster
      collaboration between Movement Disorder experts and Neurogastroenterologists to provide
      critical information and lead to innovative therapies in the future to treat GI dysfunction
      of Parkinson's Disease.
