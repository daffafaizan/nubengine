      risk of toxicity while helping to evaluate toxicity itself in the course of cancer
      chemotherapy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy causes premature aging and frailty in many cancer
      patients, so measuring and improving physical function may also limit late morbidity and
      mortality. Clinician-rated performance status (cPS; e.g., ECOG or Karnofsky PS) with or
      without concomitant organ function testing is the usual gold standard for risk
      prognostication and patient selection in most cancer settings, but cPS is subjective,
      unreliable, and relatively sensitive only for patients with significant functional
      compromise. Objective evaluations of physical function have the potential to augment or even
      replace cPS in the cancer treatment setting.
