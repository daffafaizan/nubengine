      canne has to be lifted by the patient which limited gait speed. The adjunction of small wheel
      below the 4 point of the canne (4-roll) gives the possibility to the patient to walk without
      having to lift the canne as it will roll over the ground.

      OBJECTIVE To compare the gait parameters with a 4-point canne and with a 4-roll canne METHODS
      The investigators will recruited stroke patients who necessitate 4 point-canne as walking
      aids. A 10 meters walking test, a 6 minutes walking test, an estimated energy cost and a
      patient's satisfaction will be monitored with a 4-point canne (day 1) and with a 4-roll canne
      (day 2) in a cross-over study. The first tested device will be randomized.

      PERSPECTIVE The investigators hope to demonstrate that a 4-roll canne makes possible to walk
      faster in a safe way after stroke
