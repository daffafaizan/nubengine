      intake (25% of daily caloric intake as protein; 25% as healthy fats and oils; 50% as complex,
      unrefined carbohydrates) consumed as 6 small meals during the day in combination with
      exercise training 4 times per week, over a 16 week period in 25 overweight, but healthy males
      and females (30-60 yrs old). A secondary purpose is to compare the effects of consuming two
      of the 6 small meals during the day comprised of whole food protein source servings
      20g/serving) with a matched group consuming whey protein for 2 daily protein servings
      (20g/serving). In the case of both groups, 1 serving will be consumed immediately following
      exercise [within 30 minutes] and 1 serving will be consumed 2 hours before going to bed. On
      non-exercise days, all participants will continue to consume 6 small meals per day in the
      same ratio of 25% lean protein, 25% healthy fats and oils, and 50% complex, unrefined
      carbohydrates but the groups will differ only in the composition of the last meal of the day
      consumed 2 hours before going to bed in which one group will consume protein (20g/serving) as
      whole food protein sources and the other group will consume a single serving of a whey
      protein supplement. The primary purpose of this study is to quantify changes in the following
      health outcomes at baseline and 16 weeks: total body muscle mass and fat mass (iDXA);
      abdominal fat mass (most highly related to cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk); blood
      sugar (glucose); blood lipids; insulin, aerobic fitness (assessed with a submaximal exercise
      test); and muscular strength (measured by 1 repetition maximum (RM) of the chest and leg
      press). The following additional measures will be assessed at baseline and 16 weeks: waist
      circumference; body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and hunger (Visual Analog Scales).
