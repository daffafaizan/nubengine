      for children), of blood from your arm to obtain white blood cells. These white blood cells
      will be used as a source of DNA for genetic testing. We will use the isolated DNA to try to
      identify the gene that is defective in Primary Hyperoxaluria by comparing it with the
      structure of genes in normal individuals, patients with Primary Hyperoxaluria, and family
      members of Primary Hyperoxaluria patients. In family members of primary hyperoxaluria
      patients, a 24 hour urine test may also be collected.
