      study of NP-1 and oral gabapentin in approximately 500 patients with PHN. Adult patients with
      pain resulting from PHN and meeting all other eligibility requirements will be screened for 7
      days to determine their average daily pain intensity. Qualifying patients will be randomized
      on a 2:2:1 basis to NP-1, oral gabapentin, or placebo. The treatment period will be 4-Weeks.
