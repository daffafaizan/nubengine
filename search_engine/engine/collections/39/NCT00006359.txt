        -  Determine the feasibility of androgen-suppression therapy combined with external-beam
           radiotherapy and boost brachytherapy (EBRT+BT) in patients with intermediate-risk
           localized prostate cancer.

        -  Determine the safety of EBRT+BT in these patients.

        -  Determine, in a preliminary manner, the efficacy of EBRT+BT in terms of rate of local
           recurrence at 5 years, time to prostate-specific antigen failure, and time to first
           rectal/bladder injury, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive either leuprolide intramuscularly or goserelin subcutaneously once
      every 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks. Patients also receive either oral flutamide three
      times daily or oral bicalutamide once daily for 4 weeks.

      Within 4 weeks after initiation of androgen-suppression therapy, patients undergo
      external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. At 2-4 weeks after
      completion of EBRT, patients undergo transrectal ultrasound-guided boost brachytherapy with
      implanted iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103 seeds.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
