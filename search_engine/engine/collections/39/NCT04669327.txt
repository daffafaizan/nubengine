      normal subjects and subjects with idiopathic scoliosis. The scoliosis group included a
      twenty-two-moderate idiopathic dorso-lumbar single scoliotic curve. The control group
      contained a normal twenty-two subjects. 3D motion analysis system and force plat were used
      for data collection for hip and knee abductor moment. MANOVA was used to study the difference
      between normal and scoliotic groups' hip and knee abductor moments in both lower limbs. at
      alpha level of significance of 0.05.
