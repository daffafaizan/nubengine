      indications for primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) to
      incorporate the findings from the Sudden Cardiac Death Heart Failure Trial (SCDHeFT) and the
      Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II (MADIT II). As part of this
      expansion, CMS mandated that a national registry be formed to compile data on Medicare
      patients implanted with primary prevention ICDs to confirm the appropriateness of ICD
      utilization in this patient population.

      Responding to this mandate, a collaborative effort of the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)and the
      American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), utilizing the expertise of the National
      Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR®), developed the ICD Registry™. Enrollment opened on June
      1, 2005. CMS selected the NCDR ICD Registry as the mandated national registry in October
      2005.
