    
      Purpose:

      Lymphatic dwelling parasite W. bancrofti is the most common cause of secondary lymphoedema.
      Till today, there is no effective treatment protocol for the complete clearance of W.
      bancrofti infection, in a short duration of time.

      Methods:

      The investigators conducted a double blind RCT under field conditions recruiting 146
      asymptomatic W. bancrofti infected individuals. Participants were randomly assigned one of
      the four regimens for 12 days, DEC 300 mg + Doxycycline 100 mg co-administration or DEC 300
      mg + Albendazole 400 mg co-administration or DEC 300 mg + Albendazole 400 mg sequential
      administration or control regimen DEC 300 mg. Participants were followed up at 13, 26 and 52
      weeks post-treatment for the clearance of infection.
