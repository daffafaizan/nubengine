      collapse until CPR is initiated. dispatcher assisted telephone CPR will be initiated only in
      cases where the dispatcher recognizes the cardiac arrest.

      In a previous project "Can a computer through machine learning recognise of Out-of-Hospital
      Cardiac Arrest during emergency calls" (supported by TrygFoundation), the investigators
      found, it was possible to create a Machine Learning (ML) model, which could recognise OHCA
      with higher precision than medical dispatchers at the Emergency Medical Dispatch Center
      (EMDC-Copenhagen).

      In this study the model andt is effect is to be documented in the EMDC-Copenhagen. For this
      purpose, a computer server running the ML-model are created. This server is integrated in the
      network at EMDC-Copenhagen, making it possible to push alerts to the medical dispatcher, when
      a cardiac arrest is recognised by the model.

      With aid of machine learning, the hypothesis is, that recognition of OHCA is improved, and
      happen both more frequent and faster than present.

      An instruction for the medical dispatchers is developed, which guides the medical dispatcher
      in instance of an alert from the machine.
