      of patients report side effects with allopurinol and 5% discontinue allopurinol due to side
      effects. Allopurinol can cause gastrointestinal intolerance, such as nausea and diarrhea,
      which appears to be dosedependent. Rash develops in about 2% of patients treated with
      allopurinol, and in about 20% of patients treated with allopurinol and ampicillin or
      amoxicillin. Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome remains a major concern among physicians.
      Mortality has been estimated to be up to nearly one quarter of AHS cases, with multiorgan
      system disease including hepatocellular changes and renal failure being a serious concern.
      Allopurinol is also relatively contraindicated for use in combination with 6-mercaptopurine
      and azathioprine, for which 1/4 to 1/3 lower doses must be given in order to avoid
      hematologic toxicity. Febuxostat, in clinical trials, has shown a similar AE profile to
      allopurinol. Liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia and rash were the most commonly
      reported AEs. In postmarketing experience, Stevens Johnson Syndrome and hypersensitivity
      rashes have been reported (febuxostat prescribing information). Withdrawals due to AEs were
      similar in frequency to allopurinol as well. Relative contraindications in combination with
      6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine are similar to allopurinol as well. Lesinurad may be an
      important therapeutic option for patients who either cannot tolerate or who have a
      contraindication to the use of allopurinol or febuxostat.
