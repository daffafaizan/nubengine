    
      A set of 5 digital photographs will be taken of 100 (30 male, 70 female) adult study
      participants. Prior to photography, water soluble ink will be used to mark the inferior
      aspect of the superior orbital rim above the medial and lateral canthi and in the mid
      pupillary line. Photographs taken will image patients from crown to chin and will be taken
      with eyes open and closed, brows raised, maximally contracted and at rest. A final photograph
      will be taken with the subject manually holding both brows in the position he/she finds most
      aesthetically pleasing as seen in a mirror. During all photography, a ruler will be held
      against the face for later calibration, all photographs will be taken with a camera mounted
      flash and with the patient in a Frankfort horizontal plane. All photographs will be analyzed
      with proprietary computer software.
