    
      This research study visit will occur on the same day as the participants clinically scheduled
      MRI. The clinically indicated and study-specific scanning time will not exceed 120 minutes.

      During the study visits:

        -  A study team member will review inclusion and exclusion criteria with the participant

        -  A study team member will review medical history review with the participant

        -  A safety assessment will occur prior to study procedures

        -  Study MRI scan

        -  During which the participant will use an MRI-safe machine to stimulate exercise, similar
           to pressing a gas pedal

      If eligible participants return to CHOP for future clinical imaging, we will also request a
      study-specific MRI assessment.
