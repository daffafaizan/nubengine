      effectively alleviate symptoms of pain and swell, as well as improve knee joint and general
      function. It has reached a consensus that post-TKA rehabilitation should contain muscle
      strengthening, ROM, proprioceptive, balance training and physical factor therapy, etc. This
      study intends to use observational cohort study methods with exposure factor of fast
      inpatient rehabilitation after TKA, establish a TKA exposure group and a control group of TKA
      without inpatient rehabilitation, analysis whether fast inpatient rehabilitation after TKA
      can improve knee joint or general function, and ultimately explore for effects and values of
      fast inpatient rehabilitation after TKA.
