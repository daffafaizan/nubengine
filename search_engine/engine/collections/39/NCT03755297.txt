      B-cell phenotypes and functions in 30 RA patients and 30 patients with osteoarthritis. It
      will also study the phenotypes and functions of B cells in RA patients for whom JAK / STAT
      inhibitor treatment has been prescribed by the patient's usual rheumatologist. The analysis
      will be done before the start of treatment and 3 months later. The phenotypes of B-cells will
      be assessed by flow cytometry with intra- and extra-cellular stainings. The functions of B
      cells will be assessed by their ability to differenciate na√Øve T cells in coculture.
