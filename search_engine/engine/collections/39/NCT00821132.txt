      that arrest or ameliorate symptoms of ALS, and possibly delay or prevent disease onset in
      individuals at risk for developing familial ALS (FALS). In order to do this one must
      understand how disease develops at a molecular level. Identification of genes that increase
      risk for developing all types of ALS will reveal the pathways of molecular events that are
      involved in ALS.

      The investigators are collecting blood samples, family and medical histories of patients with
      all types of ALS, (familial and sporadic, with and without frontotemporal dementia, and
      primary lateral sclerosis and particular family members. Samples are coded to maintain
      confidentiality. Travel is not necessary.

      As well as seeking to identify new genes implicated in ALS, the investigators continue our
      study of families with known genetic mutations to more fully characterize that disease
      mechanism.

      Linkage analysis and affected relative pair analysis will be used to identify causative FALS
      genes and disequilibrium analysis and association studies are being done for sporadic ALS.

      Results from these studies will provide insight into the underlying disease mechanisms of ALS
      and provide targets for therapeutic interventions.
