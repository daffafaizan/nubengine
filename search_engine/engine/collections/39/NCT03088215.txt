    
      Fibromyalgia Pain Syndrome (FPS) is a common debilitating condition which associates mainly
      generalised pain, emotional distress and cognitive symptoms. The etiology is unknown, and no
      specific treatment exists so far.

      It bears some similarities with another, more localised clinical condition : the Myofascial
      Pain Syndrome (MPS), which results in pain caused by, amongst others, muscular trigger
      points.

      Lately, FPS and MPS have both been classified as belonging to a new, larger entity : Central
      Sensitivity Syndromes (CSS), in which a strong and chronic peripheral sensitive stimulus
      (like musculoskeletal pain) is believed to induce, after some time, an enhanced response of
      the central nervous system (CNS) towards that same stimulus, with the result that the
      stimulus will be felt more powerfully (central sensitization, CS). This is secondary to
      neuroplastic changes in the CNS, which are reversible to some extent.

      Since shock-waves are effective to treat pain in MPS (by eliminating trigger points and thus
      restoring muscle and tissue function), and since MPS and FPS could be linked by a common
      pathophysiologic mechanism (CSS), the investigators hypothesize that shock waves could be
      beneficial in treating pain in FPS.

      Two groups of 20 participants will be prospectively compared over a three month's period.

      One group will receive shock-waves on painful muscular areas weekly for 12 weeks, the other
      group will not receive any shock-waves.

      The investigators intend to study if there is any difference in pain and quality of life
      after the end of the three months.
