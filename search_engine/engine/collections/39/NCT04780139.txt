      for predicting the occurrence of PSAH. Spinal anaesthesia is frequently used in daily
      clinical practice. Postspinal anaesthesia hypotension (PSAH) is a common side effect with an
      incidence of 15.3 to 33% that may result in organ hypoperfusion and ischaemic events.
      Patients' susceptibility to intraoperative hypotension can be influenced by the sensory block
      level, age, preoperative volume status , physical status, pre-operative medications and
      fasting.

      PSAH due to spinal blockade is principally a consequence of diminished systemic vascular
      resistance after blockade of preganglionic sympathetic fibres. Many attempts have been tried
      to prevent PSAH, such as intravenous volume preload or prophylactic vasopressors. However,
      fluid infusion has been proved to lower the incidence of PSAH and significantly decrease
      vasopressor requirements. At the same time, empirical volume loading carries the potential of
      volume overload, particularly in patients with cardiac disease. Consequently, the search for
      predictors of PSAH is becoming mandatory to avoid blind volume loading and reserve it only
      for patients who are expected to develop PSAH. .
