      grams at birth) infants. Efforts to promote growth and optimize nutritional support have
      included earlier initiation of parenteral nutrition and increased caloric and protein
      administration. While these advances in nutritional practices have resulted in improved
      growth, up to 50% of VLBW infants continue to experience postnatal growth failure (defined as
      discharge weight <10th percentile by Fenton growth charts) and over 25% experience severe
      postnatal growth failure (<3rd percentile). Current nutritional recommendations for sodium
      provision to preterm infants is 3-5 mEq/kg/d and fails to take into account the degree of
      renal immaturity present in extremely preterm infants. The investigators hypothesize that the
      sodium supplementation algorithm will improve in-hospital somatic growth (weight, length, and
      head circumference) between 2 weeks of postnatal age and 36 weeks postmenstrual age over
      current sodium replacement practices. The algorithm will be evaluated in a prospective,
      pragmatic, randomized trial. Infants in the sodium supplementation algorithm group will have
      a spot urine sodium concentration determined every two weeks beginning on the 14th postnatal
      day and continuing until 36 weeks postmenstrual age with sodium supplementation provided
      according to the algorithm.
