      incretin mimetics and potentiators, insulin secretagogues and insulin to identify the minimum
      episodic data set that closely mimics CGM data. Specifically, the investigators propose to
      employ blinded CGM for 2 weeks to capture the diurnal glucose patterns of individuals on
      different therapeutic regimens. The investigators propose to examine these data to determine
      whether a specific pattern of SMBG testing derived from these data would provide the same
      information (e.g., detection of hypoglycemia, measures of glycemic exposure, variability and
      stability) not possible by relying solely on current SMBG testing schedules.

      In preparation for this study the investigators developed a matrix using data collected from
      previous studies. The matrix summarizes the amount of CGM data the investigators currently
      possess and indicates where the investigators lack sufficient data to produce SMBG testing
      schedules based on CGM data. It was determined that 6 cases were needed for each therapy
      group. An underlying question is whether after the investigators fill this matrix the
      investigators can discover a common testing pattern for SMBG that would provide sufficient
      information to uncover the myriad perturbations in glucose patterns that characterize type 2
      diabetes. To assure that the investigators are collecting adequate monitoring data, the
      investigators propose to use Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) analysis of blinded CGM data.
      This novel approach will enable us to answer the question as to the optimum time and number
      of SMBG tests sufficient to guide clinical decisions.
