      decline and dementia in older adults. Optimal disease self-management may be key in the
      prevention of cognitive decline among older diabetic patients, but this may be compromised
      due to sub-clinical cognitive impairment.

      In the current study, 120 community-dwelling, non-demented participants aged 65 and over,
      with a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes will be randomly assigned either to an 8-week, home-based
      individually-tailored CCT program with adaptive difficulty level, and regular performance
      feedback, or to an 8-week, home-based active control (AC) condition, involving training on a
      generic CCT program with fixed difficulty level and without performance feedback. Both
      intervention groups also include a range of theory-informed behavior change techniques
      (BCTs), including self-efficacy management, self-monitoring and goal-setting in order to
      enhance treatment fidelity, and to maximize treatment compliance and adherence. In both
      groups, participants train approx. 30 min. per day, 3 times per-week for 8-weeks.
      Participants undergo a comprehensive evaluation of all outcomes at baseline, immediately
      after the intervention, and at a 6-month follow-up, with 1-week booster training completed 3
      months from completion of the intervention.
