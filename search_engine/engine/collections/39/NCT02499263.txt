    
      This is a prospective, single-country, multi-center study in UC patients treated with
      adalimumab. The prescription of adalimumab is at the discretion of the physician in
      accordance with clinical practice and label, is made independently from this study, and
      preceded the decision to offer the patient the opportunity to participate in this study.

      Up to 147 subjects are planned to be enrolled at approximately 20 sites. The baseline
      assessment is performed prior to the first dose of adalimumab (Visit 1). Participants are
      administered adalimumab 160 mg at Week 0, 80 mg at Week 2, and then 40 mg every other week
      per the Korean label. Study visits are conducted at Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and 56 after
      baseline in accordance with clinical practice. All participants had one Follow-up for safety
      approximately 70 days after the last dose of adalimumab.

      Clinical response is assessed at Week 8, and participants with clinical response at Week 8
      can continue on adalimumab treatment as per Korean reimbursement guidelines. Clinical
      response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the total Mayo score by at least 3 points
      and at least 30% with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of at least 1
      point or absolute rectal bleeding sub-score of 0 or 1.
