      which leads to the formation of the BCR/ABL oncogene. Ph is the most frequent cytogenetic
      abnormality in ALL characterized by poor outcome. With the BCR/ABL protein TKI, imatinib, in
      the combination chemotherapy regimes for newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL, more than 95% of patients
      can achieve complete remission(CR). Several studies have shown decreased relapse rates and
      improved disease-free survival for patients with imatinib-based treatment prior to allo-HSCT.
      However, the efficacy of maintenance therapy with imatinib after transplant for Ph+ ALL
      patients is still uncertain. In addition, acquired resistance to imatinib is frequently
      caused by point mutations in BCR/ABL that inactivate imatinib.

      Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after transplant is associated with an increased
      risk of relapse. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a sensitive
      method for detecting low-level BCR/ABL transcripts to assess MRD in Ph+ ALL. It has been
      corroborated by several reports that detection of MRD after SCT was predictive of imminent
      relapse.

      In this study, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of TKI therapy, when initiating
      treatment based on BCR-ABL transcript levels after allo-HSCT.
