      midline fascial closure in single-staged open complex ventral incisional hernia repair. It is
      designed to test the null hypothesis that the two year recurrence rate associated with the
      device is greater than or equal to 50% vs the alternative hypothesis that the two year
      recurrence rate is less than 50%.
