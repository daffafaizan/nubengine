      electrode array insertions because they did not meet audiometric criteria for short array
      devices.

      From this basis we will be able to determine if suboptimal insertion (e.g., in the scala
      vestibuli) leads to loss of low-frequency hearing in these patients. We also will look at the
      possibilities of using this data in predicting outcomes, modifying implant design, and
      perfecting surgical technique.
