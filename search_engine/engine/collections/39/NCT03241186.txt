      Ipilimumab is to be administered as an approximately 30-minute IV infusion (± 10 minutes). At
      the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal saline or 5%
      dextrose solution.

      When both study drugs are to be administered on the same day, separate infusion bags and
      filters must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab is to be administered first. The nivolumab
      infusion must be promptly followed by a saline flush to clear the line of nivolumab before
      starting the ipilimumab infusion. The second infusion will always be ipilimumab, and will
      start at least 30 minutes after completion of the nivolumab infusion.

      The dosing calculations should be based on the body weight from Cycle 1 Day 1. If the
      subject's weight on the day of dosing differs by > 5% from the weight used to calculate the
      dose, the dose should be recalculated based on the current day of treatment weight. All doses
      should be rounded to the nearest milligram. There will be no dose modifications allowed.
