      that have been deemed waste following varicose vein procedures, lower limb amputation and
      lower limb bypass surgery.

      By characterising the stress-stretch relationship of the vein vessel wall, treatment
      techniques can be better understood. Mechanical device design can be bteer informed and the
      the suitability of vein as a conduit for bypass and AVF procedures can be assessed.
