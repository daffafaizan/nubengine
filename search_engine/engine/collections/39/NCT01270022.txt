      clinical practice elaboration. It will be based in evidence medicine and it will be adapted
      based in the cardiovascular risk factors guidelines published at the present.

      The spreding and implementation of the guideline between the sanitarians, as much in primary
      medicine as in specialised area, involved in the care of the patient in cardiovascular risk,
      in the Area 2 in Madrid.

      And the evaluation of the implementation strategy, used between the primary care physicians.

      For the local adaptation, will be used a systematic review of the different guidelines in the
      Spanish and international literature, published in the last years about this topic.

      The ones with better quality criteria will be selected and doctors and nurses related from
      different specialities, involved in the cardiovascular illness, as much as members of the
      staff of the medical management an nursery, will be invited to participate in the selection
      of the recommendations of the guides and in the search of the consensus. After that, this
      guide will be given to a group of patients, who will be asked for a critical approach and
      their suggestions will be applied.

      The evaluation will be done with a clinical trial designe , testing the use of the guide and
      its results on health intermediary variables. With this objective the results with an
      implementation technique based on opinion leaders plus computer reminder, will be evaluated,
      instead of using the standard implementation.
