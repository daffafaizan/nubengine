        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of vaccine therapy comprising autologous dendritic
           cells (DC) transfected with autologous polymerase chain reaction-amplified tumor RNA in
           patients with stage IV cutaneous melanoma.

        -  Determine whether tumor RNA- or tumor antigen-specific T-cell responses are induced in
           patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Determine whether there are major differences in the immunogenicity of DC transfected at
           immature stage or at mature stage in patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Determine objective tumor response in patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Determine time to disease progression and progression-free interval in patients treated
           with this vaccine.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized study. Patients are sequentially assigned to
      receive dendritic cells (DC) transfected at either immature or mature stage.

      Approximately 2-3 weeks before leukapheresis, patients undergo surgical excision or biopsy of
      the tumor to obtain tumor tissue for RNA isolation. RNA is amplified from the tumor sample by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients then undergo leukapheresis to harvest peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells for the production of DC on day -14 . DC at immature or mature stage
      are transfected with autologous PCR-amplified tumor RNA to produce the vaccine. Patients
      receive vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and between days 71-74 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo evaluation between
      days 71-74. Patients with responding or stable disease or minor disease progression receive
      booster vaccine ID on days 99, 127, between days 162-164, on day 205, between days 253-255,
      351-354, 442-444, 533-535, 624-626, and 715-718 in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo additional leukapheresis between days 71-74,
      351-354, and 715-718. Patients with responding or stable disease may continue to undergo
      leukapheresis and receive booster vaccine ID every 12-24 weeks off study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
