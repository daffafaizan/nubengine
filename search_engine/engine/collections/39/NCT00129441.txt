    
      The goal of this study is to determine whether the short-term (4 week), double-blind
      administration of Merck L-830982 provides evidence of improvement in cognitive functioning in
      stable male subjects with schizophrenia. This initial, small sample size study (n=9 on
      L-830982 and n=6 on placebo) is restricted to males in order to reduce the variance that
      might be attributable to the well-documented sex differences in the clinical features of
      schizophrenia.
