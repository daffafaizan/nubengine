    
      Purpose: Opioid treatment of non-malignant chronic pain can result in hypoxemia, hypercarbia,
      and central sleep apnea. The aim of this study was to determine the initial efficacy of auto
      servo-ventilation (ASV) and after 3 months of home use.

      Methods: This prospective multicenter interventional study recruited chronic pain patients
      prescribed â‰¥100 morphine equivalents for at least 4 months.

      Participants: Following full-night polysomnography (PSG) to confirm the presence of
      sleep-disordered breathing, patients were randomized to three additional full-night-attended
      PSGs with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), ASV, and servo-ventilation with an
      initial mandatory pressure support of 6 cm water (H2O) ASV manual Minimum Pressure Support
      (PSmin). Following the PSGs, patients were sent home with EncoreAnywhere and ASV with or
      without mandatory pressure support.
