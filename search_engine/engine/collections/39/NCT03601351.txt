    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the association between Mu opioid receptor 1 (MOR-1) expression in patients with
      colorectal cancer stage II / III submitted to scheduled curative surgery and disease-free
      survival (DFS) five years follow up after surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the association between the MOR-1 expression in patients with colorectal cancer
      stage II / III undergoing scheduled curative surgery and overall survival (OS) five years
      follow up after surgery.

      To evaluate the association between MOR-1 expression in patients with colorectal cancer stage
      II / III submitted to scheduled curative surgery and perioperative complications until
      postoperative day 28th after surgery.

      To evaluate the association between perioperative opioids dose (morphine equivalents) and
      disease-free survival/overall survival until five years after surgery.

      To evaluate MOR-1 expression differences in paraffin samples from patients with colorectal
      cancer stage II / III submitted scheduled colorectal surgery between the tumor tissue and the
      adjacent nontumorous tissue.
