      (thioridazine HCL) is able to effectively mobilize CD34+ cells in a set of health human
      subjects. This study does not involve the use of placebos, and subjects will serve as their
      own controls for CD34+ cell mobilization. We hypothesize that a single dose of Mellaril
      (thioridazine HCL) will mobilize CD34+ progenitor cells into human peripheral blood by a
      factor of at least 10 fold, from 4 to 40 cells/microliter.
