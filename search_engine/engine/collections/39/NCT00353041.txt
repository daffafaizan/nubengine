      is proposed to compare the effectiveness of the standard topical anesthetic 5% lidocaine with
      a placebo over the time period of 2, 5 and 10 minutes after application. The topical will be
      placed on the palatal soft tissue where the perception of pain is the highest in the oral
      cavity. Both the pain of needle insertion and the pain of local anesthetic injection will be
      compared.
