      Tomography of Thorax, Abdomen and Pelvis (CT TAP) technique produces equivalent image quality
      of the lungs (hence the need to scan with both conventional technique and the
      Electrocardiograph [ECG] gated technique) and secondarily to evaluate the effectiveness of
      demonstrating the coronary arteries in this cohort of patients who have not received heart
      rate control.
