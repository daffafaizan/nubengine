      etiology that commonly presents with a slow decrease in visual acuity, reading difficulties
      and metamorphopsia in the fifth to seventh decade. Diagnosis is based on fluorescein
      angiography which typically reveals parafoveal leakage in the late phase and may show
      telangiectatic capillaries in the early phase. In a subset of patients, a proliferative stage
      with secondary neovascularizations may develop late in the disease course. In the past, there
      has been no effective treatment for the disease stages without neovascularization.

      Recent studies in a limited number of patients with nonproliferative disease have shown
      promising results after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, an antagonist targeting
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab resulted in a decrease of parafoveal
      leakage in fluorescein angiography and a decrease in retinal thickness. An increase in visual
      acuity was reported in a subset of patients.

      The RAMA-Trial is initiated in order to investigate the effect of a ranibizumab. The safety
      and tolerability of this VEGF-antagonist has been extensively studied in large cohorts of
      patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration.

      Patients with type 2 IMT will receive monthly injections over a period of one year. The above
      mentioned outcome measures will be assessed.
