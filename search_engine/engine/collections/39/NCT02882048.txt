      acupuncture technique in which five designated points in the ear are needled (+/-beads/seeds
      at points for home acupressure therapy in between treatments). The NADA Protocol is indicated
      for treatment of the following conditions: detoxification, withdrawal, emotional trauma,
      craving, stress syndromes, relapse prevention, rehabilitation & recovery maintenance. It is
      also commonly used for PTSD and addiction; however it has not been studied as an adjunct to
      outpatient opioid weaning protocols for pain.

      It is cited in the literature as yielding improvements in engagement, retention, decreased
      cravings, anxiety, and physical symptoms. Given these documented results, it seems feasible
      the outpatient opioid weaning patient would likely benefit from this procedure.
