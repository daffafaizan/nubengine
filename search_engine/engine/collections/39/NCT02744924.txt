      moderate physical activity on at least five days of the week. The importance of physical
      activity for promoting heath is complicated when considering inactive older adults and
      chronic conditions. A problematic cycle emerges where physical inactivity increases the
      likelihood for developing chronic conditions, and, in turn, many chronic conditions are
      associated with symptoms that make physical activity more difficult.

      The investigators aim to develop and implement a physical activity promotion intervention for
      older adults with or without chronic disease living in an urban environment that considers
      individual, interpersonal and environmental factors and makes use of a citizen-science
      approach and modern PA-monitoring devices.
