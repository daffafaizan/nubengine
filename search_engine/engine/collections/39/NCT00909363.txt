    
      Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome is an X-linked disease characterized by immunodeficiency, eczema and
      thrombocytopenia; a milder form of the disease known as X-Linked thrombocytopenia also
      exists. The thrombocytopenia in both WAS and XLT is characterized by: severe thrombocytopenia
      with platelet counts frequently less than 10-30,000/ul; small platelets which may be
      dysfunctional; and, as a result, a high rate of serious bleeding including intracranial
      hemorrhage.

      Because eltrombopag has been shown to be remarkably efficacious in substantially increasing
      platelet counts in a high percentage of ITP patients, this study seeks to effectively treat
      patients who exhibit similar pathologies, as well as evaluate the state of platelets in
      patients with WAS and relate it to clinical bleeding. It also aims to demonstrate whether
      eltrombopag administered daily will enhance stem cell function, increase platelet production
      and platelet count, and reduce bleeding in patients with WAS.
