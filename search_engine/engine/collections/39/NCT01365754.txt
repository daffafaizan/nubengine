      fusion versus dynamic stabilization. Up to now it is not clear whether fusion (Gold-standard)
      or the non-fusion technique is superior. Nevertheless some data are available that dynamic
      stabilization as a less invasive technique can achieve similar or better results concerning
      patient satisfaction and re-OP rate compared with fusion as the standard therapy.
