      cortical hyperactivity and causes a clinical improvement

      Aim 1: To conduct a pilot clinical trial to establish feasibility and to collect first
      effectiveness data for the use of tACS to renormalize pathological alpha oscillations in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dl-pfc) of unmedicated patients with MDD by comparing MADRS
      scores from baseline and one month follow up.

      Aim 2: Compare alpha oscillation power from resting state EEG recordings on the first and
      last day of stimulation. Collect EEG data at the one month follow up visit using this data to
      analyze alpha frequency activity as a pilot study for derivation of EEG biomarkers.
