      I. Determine the antitumor response rate (complete and partial response) in patients with
      recurrent inoperable stage III or IV melanoma treated with VEGF Trap.

      II. Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen vs historical
      controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the
      toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the impact of
      this regimen on laboratory correlates including anti-VEGF Trap antibody testing and
      pharmacokinetics in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive VEGF Trap IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for at
      least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline, prior to course 2, and 60 days after completion of
      study treatment for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Samples are analyzed by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
