      of efficacy, safety, immunogenicity; and whether the pharmacokinetics of CBT124 matches that
      of Avastin® (pharmacokinetics is nested in this study for Indian patients). To test the
      clinical equivalence in terms of efficacy and safety, a two-sided test approach based on a
      pre-specified range to test the null hypothesis that the proposed biosimilar is either (1)
      inferior to the reference product or (2) superior to the reference product based on the
      pre-specified equivalence margin will be used. The equivalence margins are chosen to enable
      detection of clinically meaningful differences in effectiveness between CBT124, candidate
      biosimilar bevacizumab and reference product (EU-sourced Avastin®) at the 95% confidence
      interval (CI). In this trial, asymmetric equivalence margins will be used, i.e., the upper
      (superiority) and the lower (inferiority) bounds of the equivalence margin are not symmetric.
      The goal is to reject the null hypothesis of non-equivalence and accept the alternative
      hypothesis that the two treatments (in this case, CBT124 and EU-sourced Avastin®) are
      equivalent (i.e., the differences between the two are not clinically and statistically
      meaningful). The hypothesis testing will be performed by determining if the difference in the
      primary end point (Objective Response Rate [ORR]) between the reference product (EUsourced
      Avastin®) and proposed biosimilar (CBT124) is within the equivalence margin at the 95% CI.
