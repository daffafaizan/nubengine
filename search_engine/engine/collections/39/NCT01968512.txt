    
      1. Assess the neurobiological aspects evidenced by the amount of brain electrical activity
           observed by the amplitude of waves through graphs in patients with ADHD, using
           quantitative electroencephalography;

        2. Study the contribution of transcranial direct current stimulation compared with sham in
           the adequacy of inhibitory control in ADHD patients through neuropsychological
           test-Go/No Go;

        3. Assessing the efficacy of tDCS in neurobiological parameters evidenced by quantitative
           EEG in patients with ADHD;

        4. Perform the Reconstruction of the Functional Brain Network of each subject based on the
           quantitative EEG data through computational and mathematical modeling;

        5. Register indicators of quality of life in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
           Disorder through the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults with ADHD (AAQoL).
