    
      Patients were enrolled in 2 sequential cohorts:

      Cohort 1: 6 patients received 3 mg/kg or Placebo (2:1 ratio) Cohort 2: 21 patients received
      10 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or Placebo (6:1:3 ratio)

      At week 24 the blind was broken to assess continuation in the trial:

        -  If a patient received VAY736 and their B cell recovery was demonstrated at Week 24, then
           patients completed the trial.

        -  If a patient received VAY736 and their B cell recovery was NOT demonstrated at Week 24,
           then patients were followed up until B cell recovery was demonstrated

        -  If a patient received placebo, they were offered the option of receiving open-label
           VAY736 (10 mg/kg) in a separate treatment arm.
