      two groups using a computer generated block randomisation scheme. The first group (pre-hab)
      will receive both nutritional supplementation and a prehabilitation program as outlined
      below. The second group (nutrition) will receive only nutritional supplementation. Both
      groups will be given a post-operative exercise program.

      Once randomized, the subjects will be called by the research co-ordinator and an appointment
      will be made for the initial assessment. After the study is explained and consent obtained,
      subjects will be tested on 6MWT, followed by a 30 minute rest period during which various
      questionnaires assessing physical activity, quality of life, fatigue and nutritional status
      will be completed with the aid of the coordinator.

      The prehabilitation program will last a minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 8 weeks.

      Surgery will be performed by one of the HPB surgeons at the McGill University Health Center.
      Surgical approach, including laparoscopic or open surgery will be at the discretion of the
      surgeon. Perioperative care will follow an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)-based
      clinical care pathway27, 28, a fast-track care plan including patient education, afferent
      neural blockade, multimodal analgesia, early oral intake and mobilization, early removal of
      catheters and drains, and a planned 6-8 day hospital admission. This pathway has already been
      implemented at the Royal Victoria Hospital as part of standard patient care.
