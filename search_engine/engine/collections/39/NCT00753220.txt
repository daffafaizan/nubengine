      prostatic cryoablation. It is speculated that antigen from the cryoablated cancer will be
      available in the vicinity of the cryoablation field immediately following the procedure.
      Autologous, immature dendritic cells are capable of internalizing antigen, migrating to the
      lymphatic system, and presenting antigenic epitopes to T lymphocytes. In this way, dendritic
      cells are capable of initiating a cell-mediated systemic immune response.

      In concept, the cancer itself should provide a specific and potentially broad spectrum of
      cancer-related antigens. Regulatory T lymphocytes, which have been implicated in dampening or
      halting cell-mediated, antigen-specific immune responses, will be selectively depleted using
      a regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide. Low-dose cyclophosphamide has been empirically shown
      to selectively deplete the number of circulating regulatory T cells.

      Using this combination of therapies, it is thought that a clinically significant anti-cancer
      immune response might be elicited.
