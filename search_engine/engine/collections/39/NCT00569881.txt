      or topoisomerase IV and therefore only require one genetic mutation for bacteria to develop
      resistance. Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones are equally effective against topoisomerase II
      and IV, which significantly expands their spectrum of action against gram-positive agents and
      atypical mycobacteria and Nocardia . This duality of action of the fourth generation
      fluoroquinolones requires that for bacteria to become resistant to these agents, the bacteria
      must undergo two genetic mutations resulting in a significantly decreased chance of an
      organism developing resistance.Minimum inhibitory concentrations determined in vitro suggest
      that fourth-generation fluoroquinolones are more effective than second- and third-generation
      fluoroquinolones against gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcal species found in
      endophthalmitis and bacterial keratitis cultures. The increased efficacy of fourth-generation
      fluoroquinolones make these antibiotics important agents to evaluate for prophylaxis against
      post-PRK infections. This was a retrospective chart review.
