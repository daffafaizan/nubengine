      Primary

        -  Compare the effect of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and erlotinib hydrochloride vs
           WBRT alone on neurological progression-free survival at 2 months in patients with
           advanced non-small cell lung cancer and multiple brain metastases.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens.

        -  Compare the response rate in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life of these patients.

        -  Compare change in performance status in these patients.

        -  Compare steroid dosing in these patients.

        -  Compare sites of progression (cranial or extracranial) in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by presence of extracranial
      metastases (yes vs no), RTOG recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) score (I vs II) and
      treatment center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) once daily for 5 days. Patients
           also receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily for up to 24 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo WBRT as in arm I. Patients also receive oral placebo once daily
           for up to 24 months.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, monthly for 12 months, and then at 18 and 24 months.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 1-2 months.
