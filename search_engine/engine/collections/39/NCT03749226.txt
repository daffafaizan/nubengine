    
      The main objectives of this study is:

      To compare the microbiological cure at day 5 of treatment and the incidence of Gram-negative
      IVAC between 7th and 10th days after last dose in patients heavily colonized by Gram-negative
      bacteria treated with nebulized AZLI vs. no treatment.

      The secundary objective of this study are:

        1. Safety and tolerability of AZLI administered during 5 days in adults patients under
           mechanical ventilation heavily colonized by Gram-negative bacteria

        2. The pharmacokinetic profile in endotracheal aspirate (EA) or bronchoalveolar lavage
           (BAL).

        3. The plasma levels of nebulized AZLI in patients under mechanical ventilation heavily
           colonized by Gram-negative bacteria.
