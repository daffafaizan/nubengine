      with clinical symptoms of neurological diseases like Parkinson's Disease. Despite the
      plethora of publications that have reported the positive effects of music interventions,
      little is known about how music improves neuronal activity and connectivity in afflicted
      patients. In this study, the investigators will use functional near-infrared spectroscopy
      (fNIRS) to measure oxygenated- (HbO2), deoxygenated- hemoglobin (HbR), and total hemoglobin
      activation in various parts of the cortex. The fNIRS measurement, in conjunction with the
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), n-back task, and the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), will be performed at baseline, week 4 (during), week 8 (post), and week 12
      (retention) of the study. The 8-week long intervention will include a daily 25-minute
      synchronous finger tapping (SFT) intervention (two sets of ten-minute sessions with a
      five-minute break in between sets) with a pre-selected well-known rhythmical song. The total
      anticipated number of participants is 150 and the participants will be split into two groups:
      an intervention group and a control group. Data collected from the two PD groups will be
      compared to baseline performances from healthy controls.
