      1)and those who had been in treatment for more than 1 year (Group 2). There were 32
      participants in group 1 and 19 in group 2. mean age for Group 1 was 41.7 and Group 2 was
      50.5. The age range for Group 1 was 21 to 66 and in Group 2 34 to 73.

      Group 1 subjects were fitted with a Luco hybrid OSA appliance (LHOA). They were followed over
      a 14 day period with adjustments made to the device as required. The second study [milestone]
      was completed at that time.

      Group 2 subjects, who had previously been in treatment with the device for and mean of 4.1
      years, had an initial study with the device and a second study following 48 hours without the
      device.

      Both groups were studied again at 60 days and results compared.
