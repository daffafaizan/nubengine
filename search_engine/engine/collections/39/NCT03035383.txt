      cm diameter created a necessity to find an alternative to the conventional technique (CT),
      which could be addressed by purse string technique (PST). A non-randomized controlled trial
      was conducted to new thyroid tumor patients at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital (RSCM) from
      October 2013 until December 2014. Thirty patients grouped into two intervention arms of
      thyroidectomy with PST and CT were assessed for post-operative scar outcomes.
