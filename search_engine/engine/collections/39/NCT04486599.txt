      foam sclerotherapy. Each procedure involves a percutaneous needle insertion. However,
      procedures remain complicated to obtain the right trajectory in order to inject the foam at
      the center of the abnormality. Electromagnetic navigation system tracks the operator's
      needle, meaning the position and progression of the needle is visualized in 3D real time on
      the ultrasound probe interface.

      The present trial evaluate the feasibility of the electromagnetic navigation system during
      the needle insertion and the improvement of needle placement accuracy.
