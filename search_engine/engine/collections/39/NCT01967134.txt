      be conducted in 25 HIV negative subjects, 17 of whom will have Latent Tuberculosis Infection
      (LTBI) and 8 of whom will not have LTBI at study enrollment. The investigational product is
      H56:IC31 (AERAS-456) at a dose of 15 ug of H56 antigen with IC31 500 nmol KLK (15/500), and a
      dose of 50 ug of H56 antigen with IC31 500 nmol KLK (50/500). The vaccine is administered by
      intramuscular (IM) injection.

      Subjects will be assigned to a study group based on LTBI status at enrollment and time of
      completion of screening. Subjects without LTBI will be assigned to Group 1. Subjects with
      LTBI will be sequentially assigned to Groups 2 and 3 based on the order in which they
      complete screening. All subjects will receive a first dose of study vaccine on Study Day 0, a
      second dose of study vaccine on Study Day 56, and a third dose of study vaccine on Study Day
      112. Enrollment of subjects into Group 2 will begin only after a review of safety data from
      the 14-day period after initial vaccination of all subjects in Group 1. Likewise, enrollment
      of subjects into Group 3 will begin only after the corresponding review of safety data from
      Group 2.

      The total duration of study follow-up for all subjects is 210 days. Study groups 1-2 will
      enroll 8 subjects each and study group 3 will enroll 9 subjects. This study is planned at a
      single clinical site in South Africa. The sizes specified for each study group were selected
      because they are judged to be adequate for preliminary safety and immunogenicity evaluations
      for a Phase I study rather than for statistical reasons.
