      Kingdom, Finland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.1, 2 The use of nitrous oxide during
      labor has undergone a resurgence in popularity recently in the United States and became
      available at Brigham and Women's hospital in August 2014.

      Inhaled nitrous oxide has a rapid onset (30-50 seconds) and clearance with a half-life of
      about 5 minutes.3 It can be used for analgesia during the first, second and third stages of
      labor, as well as during post-delivery procedures such as laceration repair, manual removal
      of the placenta, and uterine curettage. It is also commonly used to facilitate the initiation
      of epidural analgesia.4 At the Brigham and Women's Hospital, a pneumatically driven gas mixer
      is designed to deliver a 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide mixture to patients. Nitrous oxide
      passes readily across the placenta, and reaches equilibrium within a few minutes; the fetal
      maternal concentration ratio after 2 minutes of inhalation is 0.64.5 Hence, when administered
      at 50% concentration to the mother, the fetal concentration approximates at 32%.

      Despite its long track record of maternal safety reported in numerous countries, the effect
      of nitrous oxide on the fetus is less well-studied. A number of studies have published data
      on the use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia, including the effectiveness in labor
      analgesia, maternal satisfaction and maternal fetal adverse effects. Most of these studies
      have not identified adverse neonatal outcomes. However, these studies used Apgar scores or
      neonatal behavior scores as outcome measures and the quality of these studies was
      predominately poor.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in parturients who
      used nitrous oxide and neuraxial labor analgesia during labor.
