      approximately 150 subjects to evaluate the efficacy of dextromethorphan hydrobromide DXM) on
      acute cough in a pediatric population. Subjects will be otherwise healthy males and females
      aged 6-11 inclusive who are experiencing acute cough as a symptom of common cold or upper
      respiratory tract infection. Subjects must have had onset of symptoms within 3 days of
      screening and qualify based on physical exam and symptom questionnaire. Eligible subjects
      will be given a single-blind placebo, and fitted with a cough counting device for a 2 hour
      run-in period. Qualifying subjects will be stratified by age and then randomized to either
      DXM or placebo in a 1:1 ratio and fitted with the cough recording device for the first 24
      hours of treatment. Subjects will receive approximately 9 doses of investigational product
      over the course of the 4 day study and will complete patient reported outcome questions
      before the morning and afternoon doses. Subjects will return to the study site on Day 2 to
      remove the cough recorder and Day 4 (+2 days) to complete the final visit. A review of any
      reported adverse events will also be completed. Validated Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
      used in the study include morning cough assessment, afternoon cough assessment, Child Global
      Question, and Child Cold Symptom Checklist
