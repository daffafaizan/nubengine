      visual chat and electronic smart scales are added to an established 6-month online weight
      loss program. The primary aim is to assess weight change differences between subjects
      randomized to receive an Internet program alone (with text chat; INTERNET) vs. an Internet
      program with visual chat and electronic scales (VIDEO INTERNET). A secondary aim is to
      evaluate differences in social support experienced by subjects in both conditions. Overweight
      and obese adults (n=40) at two study sites (UVM and the University of South Carolina) will be
      randomly assigned to Internet (n=20) or Video Internet (n=20). All participants will receive
      the same 24 week web-based group weight control program which features synchronous
      facilitated chats and online behavioral tools. The only difference will be the delivery of
      the chat (text vs. visual) and the electronic smart scales given to the VIDEO INTERNET group.
      Assessments will be conducted at 0, 2 and 6 months and will include measures of body weight,
      treatment engagement (e.g., attendance, self-monitoring, website utilization), social support
      and treatment satisfaction.
