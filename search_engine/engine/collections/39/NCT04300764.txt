      seniors experience an admission for acute care in any given year. This is often a sentinel
      event in the overall health trajectory of older adults that is complicated by functional
      impairment, Skilled Nursing Facility placement, and reduced mobility after discharge.

      In the current paradigm, low mobility during hospitalization is largely viewed as a temporary
      inconvenience that should not affect overall functional ability or outcomes such nursing home
      placement and that patients should return to their previous activity level soon after they
      return home without lingering mobility changes. Recent research, however, suggests
      disruptions of basic activities of daily life such as mobility (getting out of bed and
      walking) may be "traumatic" or "toxic" to older adults with long-term post-hospital effects.
      What is lacked is precise data on how much immobility is noxious and how much mobility is
      needed to protect against adverse outcomes.

      The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of a gamification intervention to
      increase physical activity before hospital discharge. Investigators will explore patients'
      physical activity while in the hospital and if that differs across floors that have already
      deployed a nursing mobility protocol (Founders 10, 11, 12, 14). Investigators will also
      explore changes in patient functional status, SNF placement, and 30-day hospital readmission.
