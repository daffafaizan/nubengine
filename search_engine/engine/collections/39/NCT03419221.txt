      patient will be managed according to clinical expertise of investigators who all are experts
      in the field of infectious diseases. Consensual guidelines for antimicrobial therapy of
      patients enrolled in the study will be written before the enrolment of the first patient by
      the steering committee composed of all co-investigators These guidelines will specify the
      nature of empiric therapy as well as adapted antibiotic therapy for each specific DFI for
      methicillin-sensitive as well as for methicillin resistant S. aureus.
