      of patients prescribed opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain.

      Prescription opioid misuse is a significant current public health problem as well as a
      patient safety concern. Primary care providers are the leading prescribers of opioids for
      chronic pain, yet few providers follow standard practice guidelines regarding assessment and
      monitoring. The investigators propose a novel system change in delivery of primary care
      services to decrease misuse of and addiction to prescription opioids for patients with
      chronic pain.

      The researchers will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial, randomizing 50 primary
      care providers and their estimated 500 patients to the intervention condition (nurse care
      management, registry, electronic decision support tools, and academic detailing) or control
      condition (electronic decision support tools and educational outreach only). The primary
      outcomes, measured at twelve months, are PCP adherence to chronic opioid therapy guidelines
      and opioid misuse.
