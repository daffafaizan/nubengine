      arthroplasty.

      Methods: 60 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups (30 cases/group): group A using the
      tourniquet throughout the operation, and group B using the tourniquet starting from the
      implantation of prosthesis to the completion of the operation. Operation time, total measured
      blood loss, intraoperative transfusion volume, and complication were recorded. Hemoglobin
      level was recorded preoperatively and in postoperative 1, 3, 7 and 14 days, and the limb
      circumference, pain score, and knee joint range of motion were also recorded preoperatively
      and in postoperative 3,7 and 14 days.
