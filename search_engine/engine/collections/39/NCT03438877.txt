      to greater recognition of AKI, more exposure to various nephrotoxins and an ageing population
      with increased burden of non-infectious chronic disease. Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) or
      continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (i.e. venous-venous HD or hemofiltration) are the
      most-commonly modalities applied for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients in both developed and
      developing countries. By contrast, the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been rare. There
      are no consensus on the ideal dosage and target of adequacy for PD in AKI. Therefore, we are
      to perform a multicenter, pilot RCT study, aiming to compare intensive dosage and regular
      dosage of PD for AKI patients with indications for dialysis. If successful, this strategy is
      expected to enhance the remedy rate of AKF patients, especially in developing
      regions/countries.
