      interleukin-1-receptor antagonist, interleukin-1-receptor type I, and interleukin-1-receptor
      type II in 400 normal control and patients (chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma).
      Genotypes were tested for an association with development of chronic hepatitis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma by multivariable analysis. A second cohort of 1200 normal control
      and patients (chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma) was independently analyzed for
      the genotype associations identified in the first cohort.
