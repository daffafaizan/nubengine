    
      Multicenter, controlled, prospective randomized open study with blinded assessment of the
      primary endpoint. Two groups are set up: one experimental group with the control of the cuff
      pressure by the NostenÂ® device versus one control group with the manual monitoring of the
      cuff pressure and inflation of the balloon.

      Inclusion: All orotracheally intubated patients for an expected period > 48 hours will be
      selected. Inclusion will be decided using an algorithm adapted to each center to limit the
      number of inclusion per month without any biases.

      The total number of required insclusion is 500, or 250 / group. This calculation is based on
      the assumption that a frequency of 25% of patients having at least one VAP in the reference
      strategy, ensuring a 80% power in the detection by Chi-2 test with a difference 10%. A
      bilateral risk of first species determined at 5% was considered.
