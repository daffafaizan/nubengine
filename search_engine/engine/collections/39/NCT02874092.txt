      by comparing platelet activity, inflammation and endothelial function in baseline rheumatoid
      arthritis versus age- and sex-matched patients with osteoarthritis; and 2) to demonstrate the
      effect of ticagrelor in rheumatoid arthritis by the pre- and post- measures of clinical RA
      severity, platelet activity, inflammation and endothelial function in rheumatoid arthritis
      before and after ticagrelor therapy.
