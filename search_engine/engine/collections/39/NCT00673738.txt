      phases in this study as follows: (1) Loading Phase: This is the first week (week 1) of the
      study, when patients receive their first (loading) dose of cetuximab only, in the vein. (2)
      Concurrent Phase: During this phase patients will be treated simultaneously (concurrently)
      with radiation therapy to their chest and cetuximab. Radiation is delivered 5 days a week,
      Monday to Friday for a total of 7 weeks (weeks 2-8). Cetuximab is delivered in the vein,
      weekly, during the weeks of radiation. (3) Recovery Phase: Patients receive no treatment
      during these next 3 weeks (weeks 9-11). This phase is designed to allow patients to recover
      from side effects before they start the last phase. (4) Consolidation Phase: The last phase.
      Patients will receive 3 doses of chemotherapy with docetaxel during this phase. Docetaxel is
      given intravenously every 21 days. Patients also receive weekly cetuximab during this phase.
      Cetuximab is delivered in a similar way as it was during the concurrent (second) phase of
      this study. In total, this phase lasts 6 weeks (weeks 12-18). Once the therapy treatment is
      completed, and if the patient's cancer did not get worse, follow up visits will include
      visits to their physician every three months for 2 years, then every 4 months for 2 years or
      more, as long as their cancer doesn't get worse (at which time they will be removed from the
      study).
