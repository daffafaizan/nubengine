      been yet fully understood. It is characterized by myofascial trigger point. This trigger
      point is clinically classified as active or latent. Some studies have demonstrated the
      potential relevance of latent trigger point. In fact, its presence may cause muscle
      activation pattern alterations, increase nociceptive sensitivity and cause sympathetic
      activity alterations. Nevertheless, the vast majority of individuals, even asymptomatic, have
      latent trigger point. High prevalence of myofascial trigger points subsists at cervical and
      scapular regions.

      There is few data regarding myofascial trigger point physiopathology. Furthermore, a
      diversity of therapeutic interventions consisting of trigger point inactivation and
      interruption of the vicious cycle is suggested in literature. Nevertheless, the effectiveness
      of these different interventions in trigger points and the duration of the effects are not
      yet fully clarified.
