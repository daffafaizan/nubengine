    
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate a new gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)
      gadopiclenol in terms of lesion visualization in patients referred for contrast-enhanced MRI
      of body regions.

      This is a prospective, international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled and
      cross-over trial.

      This trial will be conducted in approximately 50 centers worldwide. During the course of the
      trial, two MRIs will be obtained from each patient: one with gadopiclenol and one with
      gadobutrol. MRI evaluations will be assessed by independent off-site blinded readers.
