      healing wounds. Major changes observed in wounds treated with low-level laser therapy(LLLT)
      include increased healthy granulation tissue formation with early epithelization, increased
      fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis.

      Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide gel and it has many properties that make it a potentially
      ideal molecule for assisting in wound healing by inducing early granulation tissue formation,
      inhibiting inflammation, providing epithelial turnover and also aiding in connective tissue
      angiogenesis.

      Hiora gel is a herbal astringent gel which helps in wound healing, reduces inflammation and
      also alleviates pain.
