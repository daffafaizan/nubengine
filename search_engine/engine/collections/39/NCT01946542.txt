      of the informed consent process followed by a screening for study eligibility. The screening
      will consist of questionnaires pertaining to detailed medical history, diet, physical
      activity, and health-related quality of life (KCCQ). Anthropometric measures and a general
      health screening (including heart rate, resting blood pressure, and small blood (<15 mL) and
      urine samples will be collected). Volunteers meeting eligibility requirements will be
      scheduled for a screening maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. Immediately prior to the
      exercise treadmill test, each subject will have a resting ECG and blood pressure to determine
      whether there are any abnormalities that would contraindicate exercise testing. Qualified
      subjects will then undergo a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) test.

      Following successful completion of the screening CPX test, volunteers meeting eligibility
      requirements will be scheduled for two testing visits, at least one week apart. At one visit,
      participants will consume a small cup of beet juice concentrate, and at the other, they will
      consume placebo. Treatment will be double-blinded and administered in random order.
