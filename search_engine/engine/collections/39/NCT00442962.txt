      recommended because it has the potential to allow drug-resistant HIV to emerge. However, to
      prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), HIV infected women who are pregnant are
      temporarily put on HAART, even if HIV treatment is not indicated at the time. It is unknown
      if such short-term therapy affects the viral response to HAART later, when permanent therapy
      is clinically indicated. The purpose of this study is to determine if HAART taken to prevent
      MTCT during pregnancy has an effect on the ability of a standard initial regimen of HAART to
      suppress HIV viral load.> >>

      >> Study follow-up will last for 48 weeks per participant. Participants will take a daily
      regimen of efavirenz and emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. There will be 8
      clinical visits in this study; visits will occur at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, 24,
      36, and 48. At each visit, a physical exam, blood and urine collection, and pregnancy tests
      will occur. At some visits, adherence, quality-of-life, and birth control interviews will be
      completed.>
