      (AHZ). We hypothesize that the development of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) strongly depends
      on two factors: 1) the severity of the initial neural injury and 2) the ability to recover
      from the initial neural injury. To test this hypothesis, we will prospectively follow 150
      patients at high risk for development of PHN. Evolution of pain and neural injury will be
      evaluated at 2-6 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and at 2 years or longer after the onset
      of AHZ by multiple measures. Assessments at 2 years or longer will be compared to those
      collected during the first 6 months after HZ in order to test whether or not sensory function
      and cutaneous innervation continues to normalize beyond 6 months in subjects who recover from
      HZ without severe PHN.

      Preliminary analysis of study data showed reduced innervation in HZ skin, mirror image skin
      and distant control skin in the acute phase of HZ that was not specific to the persistence of
      pain at 3 months. The innervation appeared to recover more fully by 6 months in distant
      control skin than in mirror-image skin and HZ skin, despite the fact that the subjects were
      continuing to experience a further reduction in their zoster-associated pain. This suggests
      that the symptoms of pain and sensory dysfunction are not due to a mere loss in overall
      innervation density. The proposed subsequent â‰¥ 2 year study visit and analysis will allow us
      to directly correlate pain resolution with resolution of sensory and innervation
      abnormalities.
