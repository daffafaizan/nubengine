      characteristic of subjects. Anthropometric measurements were done body weight in kilograms
      was measured using SECA scale. Body height in meters was predicted by knee height measurement
      using knee height caliper. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight per height square.
      Fat free mass was examined using bioelectrical impedance analyzer Tanita type SC-330.
      Independency was assessed using Barthel index. Protein intake was measured using 2x24 hour
      food recall and analyzed using a computer program Nutrisurvey 2007, data were compare to
      Recommended Dietary Allowances established for Indonesian 2018. Handgrip muscle strength was
      examined using Jamar handgrip dynamometer. Physical performance was measured using Short
      Physical Performance Battery test. Sarcopenia was diagnosed using Asian Working Group on
      Sarcopenia.

      All data collected were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS)
      version 20 for windows. Nominal data were described using frequency, n (%). Normality of data
      was tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with normal distribution (p>0.05) described using
      mean and SD while not normal distribution (p<0.05) described using median and range
      minimum-maximum. The investigators used Independent T-test analysis to investigate the
      association.
