    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify and characterize human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific
      central memory T cell (TCM) and effector memory T cell (TEM) subsets in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell (PBMC) of patients vaccinated with a HER2 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
      peptide-based vaccine.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of expanding HER2-specific effector T cells (TE) derived from
      HER2-specific TCM or TEM precursors in patients vaccinated with a HER2 CTL peptide-based
      vaccine and characterize their function.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of administering a HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine in patients who
      are receiving trastuzumab and/or lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine intradermally (ID) once monthly for 3 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
