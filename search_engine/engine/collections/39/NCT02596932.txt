      Hypothesis: Neonates born to mothers managed via the "Less Tight" intrapartum glucose
      management protocol will have lower mean glucose levels in the first 24 hours of life when
      compared to mean glucose levels among infants born to mothers managed via the "Tight"
      intrapartum glucose management protocol.

      Study Design: Randomized trial

      Population: English or Spanish speaking women with a diagnosis of GDM managed at the Diabetes
      in Pregnancy Program at Women & Infants Hospital, with a plan to deliver at Women & Infants
      Hospital

      Once enrolled, patients will then be randomized to "Tight" or "Less Tight" intrapartum
      glucose control.

      Once admitted to the labor floor for intrapartum management the appropriate power plan for
      glucose control will be initiated. The specifics of labor management will be left to the
      discretion of the provider.
