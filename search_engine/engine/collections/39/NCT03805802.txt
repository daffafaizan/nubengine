      control in type 2 diabetes. In addition, previous pilot studies have shown that a diet solely
      based on oat flakes can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose control in poorly controlled
      type 2 diabetes. Recent clinical data indicates, that early hyperglycemia can be normalized
      by a diet high in fiber. In this controlled pilot study, a food containing liquid oat bran
      high in fiber will be studied in type 2 diabetes patients with inadequate glucose control
      that are treated with oral medication or with additional once-daily insulin only against a
      reference product. 30 patients will be treated with the oat bran product or reference product
      over a period of 6 weeks in a double blinded approach, hereafter all participants will be
      switched to the oat bran product. The primary endpoint will be fasting glucose after 6 weeks.
      Secondary endpoints will be long-term glucose control as measured by HbA1c, self-documented
      glucose as well as the body weight and body mass index.
