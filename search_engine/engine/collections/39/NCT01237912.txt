      smoke constituents by evaluating selected biomarkers of exposure in smokers and non-smokers.
      This was an observational, parallel-group study to be conducted at multiple centres in the
      UK, Germany, and Switzerland. It was planned to enrol sufficient subjects such that at least
      1440 subjects complete the study.
