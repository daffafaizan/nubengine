      differences were as follows: (1) during the course of high-dose methotrexate therapy
      (HD-MTX), citrovorum folinate (CF) was used for rescue at 36 h after the administration of
      HD-MTX;(2) Pirarubicin was used instead of daunorubicin (3) Pegaspargase was used instead of
      L-asparaginase for patients.All patients received induction phase 1 and phase2, followed by
      the protocol M, reinduction phase 1 and phase2, and maintenance (mercaptopurine 50 mg/m2
      daily and methotrexate [MTX] 20 mg/m2 weekly, both orally) for up to a total therapy duration
      of 24 months. CNS-positive patients received two additional doses of intrathecal MTX at days
      18 and 27 of induction and received CRT after reinduction therapy. The dose was 18
      Gy.Patients with identifiable blasts in CSF-cytospin preparation but less than 5cells/uL in
      CSF were not considered CNS positive but received two additional doses of intrathecal MTX at
      days 18 and 27. For men with testicular involvement,orchiectomy was not performed, and
      irradiation (20 Gy) of testes was to be confined to biopsy-proven persistent infiltration of
      testis after protocol M.Response to treatment was evaluated on day 33 and at the end of
      induction in Modifed BFM-95.Sufficient response was defined as at least 70% tumor regression,
      less than 5% BM blasts, and no CNS disease on day 33 and complete remission detected by PET /
      CT at the end of induction.For patients with insufficient response at day 33 or at the end of
      induction treatment was to be intensified according to the high-risk branch of trial
      ALL-BFM95, with local radiotherapy (30 Gy) and allogeneic blood stem-cell transplantation.
