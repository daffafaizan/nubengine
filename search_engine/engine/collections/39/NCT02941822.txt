      diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD). Each patient will self-administer the study drug,
      ambroxol (60 mg per tablet) at 5 intra-dose escalations over the course of 6 months, as shown
      below:

        1. Day 1-7: 60 mg three times a day

        2. Day 8-14: 120 mg three times a day

        3. Day 15-21: 180 mg three times a day

        4. Day 22-28: 300 mg three times a day

        5. Day 29-186: 420 mg three times a day

      The study drug is licensed in the EU as an over-the-counter drug to treat respiratory
      conditions by reducing mucus production. Previous studies have shown that ambroxol can
      penetrate the brain in rodent and non-human primate models, and may have an effect in slowing
      PD. The results also indicate individuals who express the GBA mutation (increased risk of PD)
      are able to reduce the growth of cells that cause PD by stimulating an enzyme called
      glucocerebrosidase.

      The study will collect cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine samples before, during and after
      the drug has been taken over a 6 month period. In these samples the Investigators will
      measure ambroxol drug levels, assess whether the glucocerebrosidase enzyme has been
      stimulated and the levels of other substances thought to be associated with the development
      of PD and confirm whether the study drug has penetrated the cerebrospinal fluid and CNS. The
      study will administer clinical and cognitive assessments to determine if there is any
      improvement in patient's PD symptoms. If the study proves ambroxol penetrates the CNS and
      replicates our current findings in the laboratory, the Investigators shall move on to a much
      larger drug trial to test whether the study drug may be able to slow the progression of PD.
