      subjects will receive aldesleukin via IV infusion on Day 15 of the study. One course of
      aldesleukin is 12 weeks long; subjects will receive aldesleukin via IV infusion every 8 hours
      for the first five days. Subjects will be hospitalized for the 5 days that they are receiving
      aldesleukin.

      Week 1 of aldesleukin will be days 15-19 (M-F) of the 12 week cycle. Following Week 1 of
      therapy, subjects will be discharged from the hospital and only take vemurafenib at home for
      the following week. Subjects will then come in for one more week of aldesleukin during days
      29-33 of the 12 week cycle. This is referred to as Week 2 of aldesleukin.

      Subjects will continue to take vemurafenib twice daily during the course of aldesleukin.
      Their cancer will be evaluated at screening and at Week 12 following the beginning of the
      first aldesleukin course with a CT scan. After the first cycle, tumors will be evaluated
      every 8 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks for years 2 and 3, every 6 months for
      year 5, and annually thereafter.

      If scans show that the subject's cancer has improved after the first course of aldesleukin,
      subjects may be allowed to continue on to a second course. In the event of a second course of
      aldesleukin, subjects will remain on vemurafenib throughout the second course.
