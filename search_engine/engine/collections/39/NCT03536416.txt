      and young people which addresses the barriers to successful self-management, which were
      identified in an earlier study. The intervention will engage asthmatic teenagers and their
      peers, and will be delivered in two components. The first component includes a theatre
      workshop for all children aged 11-13 years in London secondary schools. The aim of this
      component is to raise awareness of asthma in schools among peers. The second component is a
      series of four self-management workshops for children with asthma. The aim of this component
      is to teach children about asthma, using interactive role plays and games. The main topics
      will include asthma general knowledge and understanding; General Practitioner (GP)
      communication; asthma triggers and symptoms; medication and emergency response; and
      self-management techniques and goal setting. The children will also receive a toolkit to take
      home with them, which will include a copy of the workbook that they have used during the day,
      containing information on what they have learnt. There will also be information on where they
      can get more help for their asthma. The toolkit will also include information about a
      smartphone gaming app, which will be about asthma knowledge.
