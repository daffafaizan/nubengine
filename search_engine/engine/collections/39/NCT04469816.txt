      program. Parents complete a comprehensive assessment, including questionnaire of the family
      environment, parenting skills, and child adjustment and health behaviors, and additional
      observation data. The FCU4Health coordinator reviews the assessment results with the parents,
      using MI strategies to engage families in making change to support child behavioral health,
      and to create tailored follow-up services which include parent training modules and referrals
      to additional support services in the community.
