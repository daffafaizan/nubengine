      treatment modality of traditional Chinese medicine, has also claimed to have favourable
      therapeutic effect on OAB. Previous study found that acupuncture at the BL-33 point was
      effective for controlling the overactive bladder. Although acupuncture has been shown to be
      effective in treating OAB, there has been no randomized controlled trial examining the
      efficacy of acupuncture on patients with post-stroke. Given the high incidence of OAB in
      post-stroke patients, potentially effective alternative treatments should be investigated.
