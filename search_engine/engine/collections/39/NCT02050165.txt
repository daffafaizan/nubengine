      appetite and calorie intake and add nutrient-dense foods to the diet. The investigators
      hypothesize that snacking on nutrient-dense, highly satiating snack foods (i.e. KIND snacks
      with almonds) as compared to snacking on nutrient-dilute, energy-dense foods (i.e.,
      conventional snack foods) will contribute to satiety, weight loss, and health improvements.
      The investigators further hypothesize that the benefits of healthful snacking are enhanced
      when portion is clearly defined and controlled by packaging. Finally, the investigators
      hypothesize that these effects will be seen even when study participants are given clear
      guidance about the calorie content of snack items, and how to make room for those calories in
      their diets.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Snacking on nutrient-dense, highly satiating snack foods (i.e. KIND snacks with almonds)
           as compared to snacking on nutrient-dilute, energy-dense foods (i.e., conventional snack
           foods) will contribute to satiety, weight loss, and health improvements.

        2. The benefits of healthful snacking are enhanced when portion size is clearly defined and
           controlled by packaging.

        3. These effects will be seen even when study participants are given clear guidance about
           the calorie content of snack items, and how to make room for those calories in their
           diets.
