    
      glioblastomas are the most common primary malignant tumours of the central nervous
      system.They represent about 2000 new cases per year in France.

      Despite active treatments including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, patient survival
      is limited without possible cure.

      Most patients with glioblastoma have impaired cognitive function, autonomy, and quality of
      life. Exploration of verbal memory in these patients shows that its deterioration is
      correlated with a more unfavourable prognosis, after adjustment with other usual prognostic
      factors.

      This clinical situation, combined with a limited life expectancy, makes the preservation of
      quality of life a major objective, in a supportive environment that respects family
      integration. This is especially true since there is an established relationship between
      health-related quality of life, as measured by questionnaires.

      The feasibility of introducing early accompaniment in GBM should be assessed in the
      diagnostic and therapeutic announcement environment. In order to measure the expected impact
      as favorable in the patient and his family, a broad survey of the classic domains of quality
      of life and more specifically dedicated to neurological symptomatology.
