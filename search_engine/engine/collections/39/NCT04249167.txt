      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of cryoablation of a primary breast tumor followed
      by PD-L1 blockade in patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast
      cancer (TNBC).

      SCONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the systemic immune response to cryoablation of a primary breast tumor and
      PD-L1 blockade.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cryoablation of the primary tumor over about 1 hour. After 2-3 weeks,
      patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15 and nab-paclitaxel IV on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-3 weeks post surgery and
      then periodically thereafter.
