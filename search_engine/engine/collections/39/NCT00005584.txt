    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the late toxicity of 6 courses of epirubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and
           prednisone (EBVP) followed by involved-field radiotherapy (IF-RT) (36 Gy) vs IF-RT (20
           Gy), vs no IF-RT (closed to accrual as of 6/2002) in patients with supradiaphragmatic
           Hodgkin's lymphoma, favorable prognosis, and complete remission (CR) or CR unconfirmed
           after completion of chemotherapy. (Favorable prognosis group [group 1] closed to accrual
           as of 4/28/04.)

        -  Compare 6 courses of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) vs 4
           courses of ABVD vs 4 courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, bleomycin,
           etoposide, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP) followed by IF-RT, with respect to
           overall survival and late treatment-related toxicity, in patients with
           supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin's lymphoma and unfavorable prognosis. (Unfavorable prognosis
           group [group 2] closed to accrual as of 9/2002.) (Favorable prognosis group [group 1]
           closed to accrual as of 4/28/04.)

        -  Maintain the failure-free survival and relapse-free survival rates that were reached in
           the previous EORTC studies (H5 to H8), with a reduction in acute and delayed side
           effects of the treatment, in particular that of severe late radiotherapy and
           chemotherapy-related toxicity.

        -  Compare the quality of life, overall survival, treatment quality control, and duration
           of treatment in patients with favorable (closed to accrual as of 4/28/04) or unfavorable
           (closed to accrual as of 9/2002) prognoses treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the efficacy of conservative therapy comprised of observation until disease
           progression (DP) and administration of IF-RT at the time of DP in patients with
           lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular subtype (nodular paragranuloma).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma are assigned to 1 of 2 randomized groups. (Group 2
      [unfavorable prognosis] closed to accrual as of 9/2002.) (Group 1 [favorable prognosis]
      closed to accrual as of 4/28/04.) Patients with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma are
      assigned to the nonrandomized group.

      Randomized groups

        -  Patients are stratified by prognosis (favorable vs unfavorable). Patients are assigned
           to 1 of 2 treatment groups based on prognosis. (Group 2 [unfavorable prognosis] closed
           to accrual as of 9/2002.) (Group 1 [favorable prognosis] closed to accrual as of
           4/28/04.)

             -  Group 1 (favorable prognosis) (closed to accrual as of 4/28/04): Patients receive
                epirubicin IV over 5 minutes, bleomycin intramuscularly (IM) (or IV if necessary),
                and vinblastine IV on day 1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5. Treatment repeats
                every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients are then assigned to 1 of 3 involved-field
                radiotherapy (IF-RT) groups based on response to chemotherapy:

                  -  Group A (complete remission (CR) or CR unconfirmed [CRu]) Patients are
                     randomized to 1 of 3 radiotherapy arms. (Arm III closed to accrual as of
                     6/2002.)

                       -  Arm I (36 Gy): Patients undergo IF-RT 5 days a week for 3.5 weeks.

                       -  Arm II (20 Gy): Patients undergo IF-RT 5 days a week for 2 weeks.

                       -  Arm III (closed to accrual as of 6/2002): Patients undergo no IF-RT.

                  -  Group B (partial remission [PR]): Patients undergo IF-RT 5 days a week for 3.5
                     weeks and boost radiotherapy.

                  -  Group C (stable disease or disease progression [DP]): Patients receive no
                     IF-RT and are taken off study.

             -  Group 2 (unfavorable prognosis) (closed to accrual as of 9/2002): Patients are
                randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

                  -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 5 minutes, bleomycin IM (or IV if
                     necessary), vinblastine IV, and dacarbazine IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1 and
                     15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses.

                  -  Arm II: Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I. Treatment repeats every 4
                     weeks for 4 courses.

                  -  Arm III: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and doxorubicin IV over 5
                     minutes on day 1, vincristine IV and bleomycin IM (or IV if necessary) on day
                     8, etoposide IV over a minimum of 30 minutes on days 1-3, oral procarbazine on
                     days 1-7, and oral prednisone on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
                     for 4 courses.

      Patients on all arms who achieve CR or CRu undergo IF-RT 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Patients
      who achieve PR undergo IF-RT 5 days a week for 3.5 weeks and boost radiotherapy.

        -  Groups 1 and 2 (group 2 closed to accrual as of 9/2002) (group 1 closed to accrual as of
           4/28/04): IF-RT begins within 3-4 weeks after completion of the last course of
           chemotherapy.

      Nonrandomized group

        -  Patients with completely resected stage I disease undergo observation until DP and
           undergo IF-RT after documentation of DP. Patients with stage II or incompletely resected
           stage I disease undergo IF-RT immediately.

      Quality of life is assessed before starting study therapy, immediately after completion of
      study, and then annually for 10 years.

      Patients are followed at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months; every 4 months for 1 year; every 6 months
      for 3 years; and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 903 patients (group 1) will be accrued for this study within
      7.7 years. A total of 723 patients (group 2) will be accrued for this study within 3.8 years.
      (Group 2 [unfavorable prognosis] closed to accrual as of 9/2002.) (Group 1 [favorable
      prognosis] closed to accrual as of 4/28/04.)
