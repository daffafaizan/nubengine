      treatment decisions for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have elevated disease activity
      scores. To do so, the investigators will be evaluating rheumatoid arthritis patients with
      moderate to high disease activity and how ultrasound scans can reveal any new information
      about the severity of their arthritis. Patients will answer questionnaires to gauge their
      disease activity as well as the depression, fatigue, and pain they experience as a result of
      their arthritis. The patients will then undergo an ultrasound examination to evaluate their
      synovitis levels, which will then be made available to their physician. Physicians will be
      asked about their disease activity assessments and treatment recommendations before and after
      ultrasounds are performed.
