      tolerability and the safety profile of the subcutaneous allergen-specific immunotherapy with
      Acarovac® in house dust mite allergic patients in routine medical care.

      During the up-dosing phase with Acarovac®, patients will receive 4 injections in 1-2 week
      intervals with increasing allergen amount up to the individual maximum tolerable dose. After
      reaching the individual maximum tolerable dose patients will receive one maintenance dose in
      a 4 - 8 week interval.

      Data on tolerability are documented by the physicians.
