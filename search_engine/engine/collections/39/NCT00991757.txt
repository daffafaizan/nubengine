    
      333369EPY3004 is the open-label extension study that follows the double-blind studies
      333369EPY3001 and 333369EPY3002 (NCT00425282 and NCT00433667, respectively). In an open label
      study such as 333369EPY3004, both the physician and the patient know the name of the assigned
      study medication. In a double blind study such as 333369EPY3001 and 333369EPY3002, neither
      the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned study medication. Patients who
      complete the double-blind treatment phase of studies 333369EPY3001 and 333369EPY3002 will be
      eligible to enter the open-label extension study 333369EPY3004 during which patients will
      transition through a blinded period to an open-label period with carisbamate (also referred
      to as RWJ-333369). There will be a blinded transition during which patients will take blinded
      study medication; after this, patients will then take unblinded, open-label study medication.
      No patients will receive placebo during the open-label extension. Safety assessments include
      the monitoring of the frequency, severity, and timing of adverse events, clinical laboratory
      test results, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, vital signs measurements, physical
      and neurologic examinations, the Physician Withdrawal Checklist for symptoms of withdrawal
      for those patients who taper and/or discontinue study drug, and pregnancy tests for females
      of childbearing potential. Seizure counts will be obtained at every visit. A Quality of Life
      in Epilepsy questionnaire will be administered during the study. There is no statistical
      testing hypothesis for this study. Detailed Description update,5 Oct 2009. The Sponsor in
      conjunction with the DSMB agreed to amend the protocol to withdraw patients who develop signs
      of a drug hypersensitivity reaction. Open-label treatment with carisbamate 400 mg/day (up to
      a maximum of 1200mg/day) given in 2 equally divided doses BID for up to 1 year; study drug
      should be swallowed whole and not be chewed, divided, crushed, or dissolved.
