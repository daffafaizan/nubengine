      kangaroo care may reduce pain、decrease the respiratory and heart rate among preterm
      infant.The recently study show it benefit to Physical Growth and Neurodevelopment.

      Respiratory failure remains a common problem in the neonatal intensive unit. As reported that
      early non-invasive ventilation is accompanied by significant improvement in subsequent lung
      development and alveolation.Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP)、nasal
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation(NIPPV) and humidified high flow via nasal
      cannulas(HHFNC) are non-invasive ventilation models.But Unfortunately, NIPPV and NCPAP
      systems are not always easily applied or tolerated in the preterm infants.So it is not
      convenient in kangaroo care.Recently A meta analysis concluded that NIPPV is more effective
      than NCPAP in preterms respiratory diseases.Maybe the investigators can reason that NIPPV is
      effective than HHFNC,but there is limited data about the comparison of NIPPV and HHFNC as
      primary respiratory support in neonate.

      The NIPPV group fail definition：1、FiO2>40%、MAP>10 centimeter water column (cm H2O),but
      SaO2<90%.2、significant abdominal distension.3、PaCO2>60 millimeter of mercury (mmHg)or partial
      pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2)<45mmHg.4、severe apnea( definition:>6 episodes requiring
      stimulation in 6 hours or requiring >1 episodes of positive-pressure ventilation) 5.potential
      of hydrogen (PH)<7.2 The HHFNC group fail definition：1、FiO2>40%、flow>8 (litre,L)/min,but
      SaO2<90%.2、significant abdominal distension.3、PaCO2>60mmHg or PaO2<45mmHg.4、severe apnea
      5.PH<7.2
