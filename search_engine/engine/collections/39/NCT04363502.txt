      COVID-19 infection manifest by pulmonary failure and a clinical picture consistent with a
      cytokine storm syndrome. This is a single-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial in which 30 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to three
      study arms that will receive clazakizumab at a dose of 25 mg or placebo.

      The primary endpoint is patient safety assessed by serious adverse events associated with
      clazakizumab or placebo.

      The secondary endpoints are: incidence of intubation, time to extubation, length of ICU stay,
      severity of AKI, need for RRT, duration of RRT, trend in C-reactive protein, and patient
      survival at 28 and 60 days.
