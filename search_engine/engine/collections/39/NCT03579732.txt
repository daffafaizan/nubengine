    
      The primary objective is to investigate the protective effect of long-term low dose use of
      aspirin on colorectal, esophageal and gastric cancer in adult subjects from Taiwan.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the protective effect by duration of low-dose aspirin
      use on colorectal cancer, the effect of discontinuation of aspirin on colorectal cancer
      prevention, the staging distribution of colorectal cancer and the description of fatal cases
      due to colorectal cancer.

      Aspirin use will be identified through Taiwanese National Health Insurance (NIH) data from
      2000 to 2015. Cancer cases and staging of the three cancer types will be ascertained through
      the Taiwan Cancer Registry, using data from 2000 to 2014. Fatal cases will be ascertained
      using Mortality database from 2000 to 2015.
