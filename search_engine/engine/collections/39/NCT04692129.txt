      undergo a baseline 15-minute measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) measured
      non-invasively on the forearm by means of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Once a baseline
      stable StO2 value is obtained, a provocative test, consisting of a transient vascular
      occlusion, will be performed. The test will allow the obtention of a local metabolic rate,
      and a StO2 recovery rate after the ischemic stimulus.

      Tissue oxygenation measurements will be performed in supine position, immediately before
      changing to prone positioning, and repeated after 20 minutes of stabilization, once in prone
      position.
