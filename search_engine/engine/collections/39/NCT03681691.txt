      estrogen in postmenopausal women, such that diabetes may interact with estrogen levels over
      time to increase risk for dementia. The mechanism for this effect is now known. However,
      animal research suggests that it may occur through estrogen's effects on cellular metabolism
      of glucose and ketone bodies. The primary aim of this study is to test whether type 2
      diabetes interacts with estradiol on brain metabolism in vivo in humans. This will be
      accomplished by imaging brain metabolism using positron emission tomography before and after
      short-term administration of transdermal 17Î²-estradiol in 10 postmenopausal women with
      diabetes and 10 non-diabetic postmenopausal women.
