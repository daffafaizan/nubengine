      before age 65, includes a high percentage of phenotypic variants. These non-familial,
      variants (vEOAD) present, not with progressive memory loss, but with language, visuospatial,
      or other cognitive difficulties. AD is now understood as a disorder that manifests with
      disturbed cognition reflecting disturbed neural networks. A multivariate analysis of
      neuropsychological tests, the "gold standard" for objectively defining neurocognitive
      impairments, coupled with structural and functional neuroimaging analysis of connectomes, can
      identify the neurocognitive-neural network profiles of vEOAD patients, compared to those with
      typical AD. This knowledge can increase our understanding of the heterogeneity of AD and how
      it causes disease.

      This study hopes to show that vEOAD constitutes a "Type 2 AD", by (1) defining the
      neuropsychological components of Type 2 AD, and (2) understanding the anatomy and atrophy of
      the brains of vEOAD patients. Together, these components can outline the
      neurocognitive-neural network profile of Type 2 AD.

      In addition to information that can help in the diagnosis and management of EOAD, this study
      can stimulate novel research into the reasons for this neurobiological heterogeneity in AD
      and could potentially lead to interventions based on alternate neurocognitive-neural network
      profiles.
