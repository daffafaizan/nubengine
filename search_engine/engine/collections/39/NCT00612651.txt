      Tegretol / phenobarbital. Stratum2-Patients on anti-convulsants other than Dilantin, Tegretol
      / phenobarbital / Patients not on any anti-convulsants. Each stratum treated & escalated
      independent of each other. Temozolomide administered orally at dose of 150mg/m2 daily for 5
      days, at bedtime, for 1st cycle & escalated to 200mg/m2 daily for 5 days, at bedtime during
      subsequent cycles if tolerated. Treatment cycles may be repeated every 4 weeks following
      doses of Temozolomide from previous cycle. SCH 66336 administered orally twice day,
      approximately every 12hrs. Initial doses will be 125mg BID for stratum 1 & 75mg for stratum
      2. Treatment cycles may be repeated every 4 weeks following dose of Temozolomide from
      previous cycle.

      Subjects are patients with malignant glioma histologically confirmed at diagnosis, who were
      treated previously with conventional external beam radiation (XRT) & with or without chemo, &
      have stable disease, recurrence/relapse at time of enrollment. Approximately 48 subjects will
      be enrolled.

      Temozolomide has been well tolerated by both adults & children with most common toxicity
      being mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential toxicities include nausea &
      vomiting, constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning sensation of skin, esophagitis,
      pain, diarrhea, lethargy, & hepatotoxicity. Hypersensitivity reactions have not yet been
      noted with Temozolomide. As is case with many anti-cancer drugs, Temozolomide may be
      carcinogenic. Rats given Temozolomide have developed breast cancer. Significance of this
      finding for humans is not presently known.

      Significant adverse events observed for SCH66336 have included vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia,
      headaches, reversible renal toxicities, & hematological toxicities. SCH 66336, although not
      genotoxic, inhibits rapidly proliferating cells & at high doses inhibits spermatogenesis in
      male rats. It is not clear that inhibition of spermatogenesis is reversible,& patients should
      be advised of possibility of irreversible sterility.
