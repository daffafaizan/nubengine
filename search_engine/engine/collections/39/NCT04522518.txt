      children with and without disabilities. The estimated participants are 160 pairs of children
      with disabilities 6-12 years of age and their caregivers and 160 age-matched peers with
      typical development and their caregivers (a total of 640 participants). The design enables
      validation of the responses of children with disabilities with various sources (i.e.
      caregivers' responses, children without disabilities, and other child-report measures).
      Findings of reliability and validity will provide a basis for reporting child-identified
      participation goals and environmental factors. The COnsensus-based Standards for the
      selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guideline is used to design a
      high-quality validation study. To characterize child-perceived participation and environment,
      the data are collected for two groups: one group of children with disabilities (the DD group)
      and one group of children without disabilities (the TD group). The design enables examination
      of how prioritized activities and frequent encountered environmental supports and barriers
      may vary given different capabilities of children with disabilities and peers with typical
      development.
