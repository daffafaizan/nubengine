    
      TIPS microspheres are manufactured from GMP grade poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) under
      Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions.

      Microspheres will be delivered into the fistula tract using the following procedure:

      i) Tract identification with special emphasis on locating the internal and external openings
      using a fistula probe.

      ii) Curettage to remove epithelium lining the tract and cleaning by irrigation with hydrogen
      peroxide and saline.

      iii) Closure of the internal opening by means of a rectoanal advancement flap. iv) Following
      device kit instructions, prepare a paste of TIPS microspheres with GranuGel.

      v) Introduction of TIPS microsphere paste by back-filling. vi) Retention of the microsphere
      paste using Comfeel adhesive hydrocolloid dressing designed to remain in place for 1 - 14
      days.

      Each subject will receive a single administration of up to 300 mg of TIPS microspheres
      implanted into the fistula tract.
