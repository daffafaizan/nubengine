           different cardiac pathologies?

        -  How do PiCCO hemodynamic variables compare to transthoracic echocardiographic parameters
           in different cardiac pathologies?

        -  How does GEDV (global enddiastolic volume) correlate with left ventricles end-diastolic
           volume (LVEDV) assessed by LV (left ventricle) ventriculography and echocardiography?

        -  How do PiCCO cardiac function variables (GEF [global ejection fraction]; CFI [cardiac
           function index]) correlate with LV dP/dt max, LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction)
           assessed by LV ventriculography and echocardiography, LVFAC (left ventricular fractional
           area of change), LV stroke work index (LVSWI) and cardiac power (CP)?

        -  How does GEDV compare to LVEDV and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) as
           assessed by the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP)?

        -  How does right ventricular function influence GEDV, GEF and CFI?
