      initiation and the progression of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, including diabetes,
      obesity and metabolic syndrome. In general, chronic diseases are related to underlying
      modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, high plasma lipids and
      glucose, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, as well as smoking habits.

      Vascular endothelial dysfunction is one of the earliest findings in the pathophysiology of
      atherosclerosis and also an important predictor of cardiovascular events. Moreover, it has
      already been demonstrated that acute oral ingestion of high loads of sugar and fat meals
      induces transient vascular endothelial dysfunction, which over time could lead to
      cardiovascular disease.

      Thus, the present study aimed at investigating the individual contributions of sugar and fat
      ingestion on systemic microvascular endothelial reactivity.
