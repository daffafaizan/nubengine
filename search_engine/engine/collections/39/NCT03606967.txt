    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the clinical response to nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab +
      neoantigen vaccine (Arm 1) versus (vs.) nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab
      (Arm 2) in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Evaluate the safety of nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab + neoantigen
      vaccine vs. nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab in patients with metastatic
      TNBC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the immune response induced by nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) +
      tremelimumab + neoantigen vaccine vs. nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab
      in patients with metastatic TNBC.

      II. Biomarkers of response to therapy will be assessed based on the research biopsies
      performed at baseline, following the chemotherapy run-in (Part A) and following
      nab-paclitaxel + durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab +/- neoantigen vaccine (Part B).

      OUTLINE:

      PART A: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning cycle 4, patients
      with progression of disease within the first 18 weeks may switch and receive nab-paclitaxel
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 for 2 cycles at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      PART B: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive personalized synthetic long peptide vaccine and poly-ICLC
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, 15, 22, 50, and 78 in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of
      cycles 1-4, durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4, durvalumab
      IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, then
      annually thereafter.
