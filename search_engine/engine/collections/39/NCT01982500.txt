      encouraging results in terms of efficacy/safety. However there is no data generated in Greek
      population with regards to safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in front line Ovarian Cancer.
      Two prior global phase III randomized trials showed that the addition of concurrent
      bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy and maintenance bevacizumab significantly increased the
      PFS in patients with advanced ovarian cancer It would be relevant to document the real life
      clinical data of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel/carboplatin) in
      Front Line Ovarian Cancer as prescribed by the medical oncologists in Greece.
