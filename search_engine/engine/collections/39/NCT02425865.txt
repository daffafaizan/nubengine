    
      NUMBER OF PATIENTS: 200 patients

      INCLUSION PERIOD: 33 months

      STUDY DURATION: 57 months

      MAIN EVALUATION Primary endpoints

      • Week 10-54: proportion of patients in CCR and with MH (endoscopic Mayo score of 0 or 1) at
      week 54

      Data base lock, data analysis and display (publication) will happen when all included
      subjects have completed the 108-week visit.

      SECONDARY EVALUATION

      For all included patients:

        -  Phase II (week 54-108): proportion of patients in CCR with MH (endoscopic Mayo score of
           0 or 1) at week 108, after discontinuation or dose de-escalation (from 100 to 50 mg) of
           golimumab treatment at year 1 in the subgroup of patients in CCR and with MH (endoscopic
           Mayo score of 0 or 1) at week 54

        -  Factors associated with treatment success (see primary endpoint)

        -  Efficacy of dose optimization in patients who loose response between week 10 and 54

        -  Clinical remission at week 54 • Clinical remission at week 108 • Partial MAYO score at
           week 54 and 108 • PRO2 (Partial Mayo minus PGA) at week 54 and 108 • CCR between study
           inclusion and week 54 and 108 • Steroid-free clinical remission at week 54 and 108 • MH
           (endoscopic score MAYO 0-1) at week 54 and 108 • Changes in faecal calprotectin levels
           from baseline to week 54 and 108 • Colectomy between W0 and W54 and 108

        -  UC-related hospitalizations throughout the trial • Histological remission9 at W54 and
           108

        -  PRO: Fatigue (FACIT), disability (IBD Disability index), QoL (SHS-IBD VAS)

        -  PK data (golimumab trough levels and antibodies against golimumab)

        -  Proportion of late responders being in Clinical Response from week 18 to week 54 and
           with MH at week 54 following treatment intensification in Maintenance Phase

      For the subgroup of patients who are primary non-responders to golimumab at week 10, we will
      assess the efficacy of treatment optimization, including the percentage of patients achieving
      continuous clinical response and endoscopic remission at one year.
