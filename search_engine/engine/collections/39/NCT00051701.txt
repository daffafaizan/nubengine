      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CAMPATH (alemtuzumab, MABCAMPATH, CAMPATH)
      administered intravenously (IV) once a week as treatment for relapsing or refractory
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The primary objective of part 2 is to determine the overall
      response rate (complete response, CR/unconfirmed , plus partial response) of weekly IV
      CAMPATH in the treatment of relapsing or refractory NHL. This is a Phase I/II study,
      open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of weekly IV CAMPATH as
      therapy for patients with relapsing or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
