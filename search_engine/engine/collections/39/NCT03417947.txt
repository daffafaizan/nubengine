      sickle cell disease (SCD). Since vitamin D deficiency and SCD share common manifestations
      including chronic pain, poor bone health and chronic systemic inflammation, it is reasonable
      to postulate that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to these complications. Thus,
      optimizing vitamin D nutrition represents an inexpensive strategy that may improve vitamin D
      status and health outcomes in SCD children. The working hypothesis is that administration of
      a single oral bolus of 300,000 IU of vitamin D3 to SCD children will result in the attainment
      of vitamin D sufficiency (25OHD levels >75 nmol/L) in 80% of participants after 3 months. The
      primary objectives are to assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety of the vitamin D3
      bolus while secondary objectives are related to the mean change in serum 25OHD from baseline
      to 3 months post-bolus and its clinical impact. Seventy-two SCD children (5-17 years, SS and
      SC genotypes) will be randomized to one bolus of 300,000 IU of vitamin D3 or identical
      placebo. Blood will be collected at baseline and 3-month post-bolus to measure serum 25OHD
      and calculate the change from baseline at 3 months (efficacy outcomes). Other outcomes
      include urinary calcium/creatinine ratio and serum calcium (safety), questionnaires
      (acceptability and musculoskeletal pain) and parameters related to growth, haematology,
      inflammation and bone health (exploratory outcomes).
