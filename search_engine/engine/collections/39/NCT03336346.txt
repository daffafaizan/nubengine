      in the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. However, despite its effectiveness in
      lowering viral load, there is also solid evidence that it decreases the effectiveness of
      etonogestrel-releasing implants. This presents a difficult clinical scenario in countries
      where the HIV burden is significant in reproductive age women.

      Following the SINGLE trial, dolutegravir has replaced efavirenz in many settings as
      first-line ART. In 2016, Botswana became the first country in Africa to adopt this as a
      guideline, however, the effect that dolutegravir has on hormonal contraceptives has not been
      widely studied. This project seeks to understand the interaction between etonogestrel levels
      in HIV-infected women who are using dolutegravir-based ART by directly measuring etonogestrel
      blood levels using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in HIV-negative and HIV-infected
      women using contraceptive implants.

      Because the implant is fairly new in Botswana, most participants will have had implants
      inserted 3-12 months prior to study. An HIV-infected, non-ART, comparison group is no longer
      permissible, practically or ethically, as countries across Africa, including Botswana, are
      moving to HIV "Test and Treat." This means that ART initiation is now occurring at time of
      HIV-diagnosis regardless of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count or disease stage;
      therefore, in this study, the comparison group will be HIV-uninfected implant users. This
      comparison will answer the key question of whether the ENG implant when used simultaneously
      with DTG provides plasma ENG levels comparable to a group in which it has established
      contraceptive efficacy (i.e. HIV-uninfected, healthy women of reproductive age).
