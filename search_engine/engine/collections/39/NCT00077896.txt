      treat patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Currently, there is no effective treatment
      for these patients. Previously, in healthy volunteers, we observed that DC polarization of
      the left prefrontal area for 20 min safely increases verbal fluency, cognitive processing
      speed (working memory and attention) and motor reaction speed. Both of these functions are
      severely impaired in FTD. Objective: We wish to see whether anodal DC polarization of the
      left prefrontal cortex in FTD patients leads to improvement in verbal fluency and working
      memory. Design: In this pilot study, we propose to treat six FTD patients for 40 min with
      anodal and sham DC polarization in a single-blind, crossover design. Outcome Measures: The
      main outcome measures will be verbal fluency and working memory. If anodal DC polarization
      produces clinically relevant improvements in these patients this will provide the impetus for
      a larger trial.
