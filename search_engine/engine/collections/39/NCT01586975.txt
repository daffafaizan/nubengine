      mainstay for the prevention of ischemic vascular events is the use of aspirin Antiplatelet
      agents are used routinely for the primary and secondary prevention of vascular events in
      patients with a prior history of stroke, TIA, or at high risk for the development of
      cerebrovascular disease. Numberous individual studies and meta-analyses have shown that
      essentially all of the oral antiplatelet agents have limited efficacy, with relative risk
      reductions in the range of 20-35%. The purpose of this study is to perform serial platelet
      function assays (PFAs) on patients with cerebrovascular disease who are taking antiplatelet
      agents and perform a pilot study to determine the feasibility of administering ASA as a dose
      adjusted medication using PFA. The long term goal of this study is to determine whether
      antiplatelet therapy will be more efficacious and/or safer if it is administered in a
      dose-adjusted manner.
