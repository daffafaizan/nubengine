      associated with infection and mortality. The aim of this study is to determine whether
      preoperative vitamin D levels affect clinical outcomes after liver transplantation.

      Methods : This was a single-center retrospective study. Between June and November 2017, a
      total of 219 patients underwent liver transplantation. The primary outcome was the
      relationship between serum 25-OH-vitamin D3 level before liver transplantation and length of
      stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Secondary outcomes included the duration of
      normalization of inflammatory marker, such as white blood cell count (WBC) & C-reactive
      protein (CRP) after liver transplantation, new infection rates, rejection rates, the length
      of hospital stay and mortality among vitamin D level.
