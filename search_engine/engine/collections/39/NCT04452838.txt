      extensively hydrolyzed by non-specific esterases to its primary active metabolite
      5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT) . Therefore characterization of the rate and extent of
      absorption of the test and reference fesoterodine formulations will be based on
      pharmacokinetic parameters of 5-HMT derived from the 5-HMT concentration-time profiles.
