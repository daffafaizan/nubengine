      survivorship booklet. GROUP II: Patients are randomly assigned to receive either 6 or 8
      weekly telephone sessions that address managing medical issues, health education, and cancer
      resources; balancing emotions and managing stress; coping skills and problem solving; family
      and social concerns; relational, intimacy, and sexual concerns; and financial and employment
      concerns. Patients also receive a survivorship booklet as in group I.
