      magnification, using a scanning laser. The laser is used to map the cornea, and will not
      damage or harm the subject's eye. Studies have shown that IVCM can be used to study cells and
      nerves within the cornea, providing a better understanding of how the cornea reacts to
      irritants. IVCM has recently been used by the investigator to assess the extent of eye
      inflammation in cases of dry eye patients.

      Current steroid therapy in dry eye disease (DED) is comprised of a 2 week duration of pulse
      therapy, administered twice daily (to avoid adverse effects associated with long-term steroid
      use). This time frame is often too short to meaningfully resolve the inflammation associated
      with DED. DED often occurs when there is a decrease in the eye's tear production or if there
      is an increase in the evaporation of the tear film (a thin layer of tears that keep the eye
      moist). Eye irritation and inflammation (swelling) is often associated with DED because the
      surface of the eye is unable to maintain a normal level of moisture.
