      Recruitment will be undertaken at two Urogynecology/Urology sites associated with the
      University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. Participants will be randomized to treatment or
      placebo arm with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients and surgeons will be blinded.

      On the day of the procedure, a urine culture will be collected preoperatively to identify
      pre-existing bacteriuria. Technique and dose of Botox injection will be at the discretion of
      the operating physician. Trigone-sparing technique with injection of 100 to 200 units of
      Botox distributed across 10 to 20 sites is generally used at our centre.

      Follow-up will occur over a six-week postoperative period. A questionnaire will be used at
      each follow-up encounter to screen patients for urinary tract infection symptoms, voiding
      dysfunction, and other adverse events potentially related to the prophylactic antibiotics.
      Urine cultures will be collected to confirm infection for patients developing postoperative
      symptoms.
