      debulked stage III or stage IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma
      treated with sequential paclitaxel, carboplatin, and topotecan with peripheral blood stem
      cell rescue. II. Determine disease free and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive mobilization with cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, followed 4 hours
      later by paclitaxel IV over 24 hours. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously
      beginning 24 hours after completion of paclitaxel and continues through stem cell harvest.
      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested and selected for CD34+ cells. High dose
      sequential chemotherapy begins 21 days after leukapheresis. Patients receive paclitaxel IV
      over 24 hours on day 1, carboplatin IV over 2 hours on day 2, and then topotecan IV over 24
      hours. G-CSF is administered subcutaneously beginning on day 3 until blood counts recover.
      PBSC are reinfused on day 4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with radiographic and
      biochemical complete response undergo second look surgery within 8 weeks of completing the
      last course of chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
