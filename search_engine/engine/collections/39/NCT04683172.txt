      are often difficult to mobilize, as tDCS can be delivered at the patient's bedside and
      possibly even at home, which is not the case with rTMS. tDCS also appears to be rapidly
      effective (after 5 sessions) in the context of cancer pain, and this effect lasts longer than
      that of rTMS.

      The proposed treatment of refractory cancer pain by tDCS in palliative care patients is a new
      treatment modality that is well adapted to hospitalised patients. Each patient will receive
      20 minutes of transcranial direct-current stimulation daily for 5 consecutive days.

      One arm will receive active stimulation and the control arm will receive sham stimulation.
      Patients and investigators will be blinded to the type of tDCS.

      By improving the patient's activities of daily living, this treatment will enable the patient
      to return home under good conditions for both the patient and the caregivers. This treatment
      can also be continued at home. This strategy is consistent with current guidelines in this
      field, in which the priorities are improvement of quality of life, return home and decreased
      workload for caregivers.
