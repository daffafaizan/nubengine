    
      Main objective. To figure out if one of the four techniques (isometric, concentric, eccentric
      contraction exercise and analytic passive stretching) is more effective for reducing post-
      needling soreness immediately, at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours.

      Objectives. To verify if there is a correlation between independent variables and
      post-needling soreness.

      Study type. Non-blinded randomized clinical trial. Intervention. Dry needling on an active
      myofascial trigger point in superior trapezius, followed by one of the following treatments
      according to the specific group: 1) concentric contraction exercise, 2) isometric contraction
      exercise, 3) eccentric contraction exercise or 4) analytic passive stretching.
