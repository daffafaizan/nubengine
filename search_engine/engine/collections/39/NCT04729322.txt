      I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab or nivolumab in conjunction with fecal
      microbiota transplant (FMT) from PD-1 responding mismatch-repair deficiency (dMMR) colorectal
      cancer (CRC) patients for treatment of PD-1 non-responding dMMR CRC patient.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive metronidazole orally (PO) every 8 hours (Q8H) on days -14 to -8 and then
      vancomycin PO every 6 hours (Q6H) and neomycin PO Q6H on days -8 to -6. Patients then undergo
      colonoscopic FMT on day -5.

      Patients are then assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Patients also receive fecal microbiota transplantation capsule PO on days 1, 8, and 15
      of cycle 1. Beginning in cycle 2, patients receive fecal microbiota transplantation capsule
      PO on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients
      also receive fecal microbiota transplantation capsule PO on days 1 and 8 of cycles 1-2.
      Beginning in cycle 4, patients receive fecal microbiota transplantation capsule PO on day 1
      of every other cycle. Cycles repeat every 14 days for up to 6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 24
      weeks for up to 3 years.
