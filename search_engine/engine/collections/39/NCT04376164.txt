      moderate mandibular crowding and an average age was 19.23 ± 3.1years.They were randomly
      divided into two parallel groups; a control group without laser intervention and a laser
      group which received LLLT. All patients followed a non-extraction approach using one category
      of fixed appliance and matching conventional NiTi archwire sequence during 3 months
      observation period. In laser group, mandibular anterior teeth were irradiated by gallium
      aluminum arsenide semiconductor laser with 635 nm wavelength, 6.5J/cm2energy density, for 10
      seconds at 10 points (0.2 J/point) on facial and lingual aspects. This protocol was started
      immediately after first wire insertion and then at days 3,7,14 of the first month and
      repeated for additional 2 months. In both groups, relief of mandibular crowding was assessed
      by Little's irregularity index (LII) after 4 weeks (T1), after 8 weeks (T2), and after 12
      weeks (T3) intervals. Changes in LII scores were evaluated through scanned 3D models via
      software. In addition, the monthly rate of OTM was calculated and compared. The level of
      significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.
