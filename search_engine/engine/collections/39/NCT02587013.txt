      within the peritoneal cavity (intraabdominal) or exteriorized temporarily from the abdomen
      for the closure of the hysterotomy incision (extraabdominal). 3 meta-analysis on the topic
      were unable to demonstrate the superiority of one technique regarding maternal morbidities.
      However, there is a paucity of studies with a standardized anesthetic protocol evaluating
      these outcomes.

      This study will evaluate the impact of the uterine repair technique on different maternal
      morbidities; focusing on intra-operative nausea and vomiting under a standardized anesthetic
      protocol.
