      substances produced by the endothelium. An imbalance in these substances limits the ability
      of the blood vessel to relax in response to a shear stress stimulus. Endothelial dysfunction
      is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

      High-sugar intakes result in postprandial hyperglycemia and endothelial dysfunction. Exercise
      may attenuate the endothelial dysfunction induced by a high-sugar meal. There are only two
      studies that have examined the effect of exercise on endothelial dysfunction induced by
      high-sugar intake. Both studies found that a bout of aerobic exercise attenuated the impaired
      flow mediated dilation induced by high-sugar ingestion. Neither study measured important
      markers of endothelial dysfunction such as blood nitric oxide, endothelin I, and angiotensin
      II concentrations, however. In addition, whether the same results apply to older
      post-menopausal women is unknown. Understanding how acute exercise affects meal-induced
      endothelial dysfunction in older women is important given that age is related to endothelial
      dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.
