      I. Successful navigation of patients being screened or treated for breast cancer through the
      continuum of their care (from visit to visit; from surgical care to radiologic care to
      oncologic care; from oncologic care to supportive care; etc).

      II. Supply individualized in-language treatment summaries and follow-up care plans to
      enrolled patients.

      III. Supply tailored in-language survivorship plan summaries to enrolled patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive treatment summaries and plan report that captures patient data through the
      use of an "intake checklist" completed during the initial consultation with the breast
      oncology team and used to guide referrals to existing services and programmed with generic
      information related to disease and treatment management plan. Additional elements, such as
      psycho-social services, exercise, and/or nutrition, identified by the patient self-report,
      will be incorporated. Patients also complete 3 questionnaires at each clinic visit.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 months or 12 months.
