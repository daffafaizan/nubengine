      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of BCX-1777 in patients with refractory T-cell or
           non-T-cell malignancies.

        -  Determine the safety and dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of single oral and single and multiple IV doses of this
           drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the oral bioavailability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

        -  Courses 1 and 2: Patients receive oral BCX-1777 on days 1 and 15* and BCX-1777 IV over
           30 minutes on days 8* and 22*.

        -  Course 3: Beginning approximately 6 days* after the completion of courses 1 and 2,
           patients receive BCX-1777 IV over 30 minutes once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 (total of
           10 doses).

      NOTE: *+/- 1 day

      Patients with stable disease or better and no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) may receive an
      additional 10-dose treatment course (as in course 3) after a 10- to 16-day drug-free
      interval.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BCX-1777 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience DLT.

      Patients are followed at 14 and 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
