      long term safety of PF 00547659. This protocol also provides the opportunity for continued
      treatment for subjects responding to treatment from the feeder study. It also provides an
      opportunity for initial treatment for subjects randomized to placebo in the feeder study.
      This is a multi center Phase 2, open label, safety extension study for feeder studies which
      evaluate PF 00546759 in subjects with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Subjects eligible
      for this study will have completed the 12 week double blind induction period in study
      A7281006 and will be stratified by responders or non responders based on change in CDAI in
      that study, without unblinding treatment assignment from study A7281006. Additionally,
      subjects who have completed study A7281008 with a clinical response, as defined by that
      protocol, will also be eligible for this study and treated as "responders". All subjects
      entering this study must have discontinued immunosuppressant therapy.

      Subjects entering this study will be given a 75 mg SC dose at baseline and then every 4 weeks
      through Week 72. After the active treatment period, the subjects will enter a 24 month follow
      up period including 6 monthly visits followed by 18 month extended contact (every 6 month
      telephone contacts). At Week 96, subjects will undergo an End of Study visit but will
      continue the every 6 month telephone contacts until Week 168.
