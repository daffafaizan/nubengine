      AU/ml. This is based on the IDEAL50 concept put forth by Turkeltaub et al, almost 3 decades
      ago. Such concentration has been shown to give large degree of false positives even in the US
      population.

      In Thailand, it was anecdotally observed that at such concentration, sizes of positive tests
      among atopic subjects were quite large and could lead to discomfort and a possible
      anaphylaxis in certain allergic individuals. Moreover, up to 40% of normal individuals could
      give positive reaction to this concentration.

      It is therefore desirable to reexamine the appropriate concentration of diagnostic reagent of
      house dust mites among the Thai population and will be the main objective of this research.
