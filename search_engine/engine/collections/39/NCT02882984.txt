      noticeable cognitive dysfunction. The EGFR TKI has reasonable control for intracranial
      disease, but the duration of EGFR TKI control disease is variable due to tendency of drug
      resistance. To maintain intracranial disease control and improve cognitive function, the
      investigators propose using hypofractionated SRS in multiple brain metastases or large brain
      lesions alone with TKI.
