      of fully understanding a neurological or psychiatric disorder. The purpose of this protocol
      is to establish a coordinating program with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in
      Washington, DC, the Virginia Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Central District, and
      Virginia the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Northern District for the donation of
      brain tissue.

      Dissected brain tissue from selected brain regions, including but not limited to the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampal formation, will be assembled from large
      cohorts of normal controls and schizophrenic subjects. The expression of mRNA and protein for
      selected molecules, chosen on the basis of their genetic association with schizophrenia, will
      be measured with a variety of assays including but not limited to qPCR and Western blots.

      Outcome measures are the statistical comparison within normal controls of mRNA and/or protein
      levels in groups segmented by genotype. Similar comparisons will be made between
      schizophrenic cohorts and normal controls, in a diagnosis by genotype analysis with an ANOVA,
      or when appropriate an ANCOVA (controlling for variables such as age, race, gender, and
      postmortem interval).
