      were followed by expiration, a pattern believed to contribute to airway protection during
      swallowing. However In healthy individuals, the occurrence of inspiration after swallows was
      increased by hypercapnia or application of an inspiratory elastic load.

      In a previous study the investigators have demonstrated that patients with neuromuscular
      disorders exhibited piecemeal deglutition leading to an increase in the time needed to
      swallow a water bolus, as well as occurrence of inspiration after nearly half the swallows.
      These abnormalities which increased with the decreasing of respiratory muscle performances
      may explain feeding difficulties. However in tracheostomized patients who could breathe
      spontaneously, piecemeal deglutition and swallowing time per bolus were diminished by the use
      of mechanical ventilation.

      In the investigators' knowledge there are no data about the impact of non invasive mechanical
      ventilation on the breathing-swallowing interaction.

      The investigators' main objective is to evaluate breathing-swallowing interaction in Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients hospitalized in intensive care unit for an
      acute exacerbation, and evaluate the impact of using non invasive mechanical ventilation
      (NIV)
