      weeks of conventional treatment (i.e. preservative-free lubricant, bandage contact lens
      (BCL), ocular lubricant ointment, eye patching). These defects are the result of the loss of
      certain lacrimal factors that maintain the integrity and homeostasis of the corneal
      epithelium and ocular surface. Normally, PED heal rapidly in the healthy eye. However,
      underlying ocular surface pathology can slow down the healing process and contribute to the
      persistence of the epithelial defect. Hematopoietic derivatives such as autologous
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may replace these missing components and eventually lead to
      complete healing in a faster and more comfortable way for the patient. The objective of this
      study is to determine if PRP combined with BCL is more effective than preservative-free
      lubricant combined with BCL or than eye patch with ocular lubricant ointment for the
      treatment of PED. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups and
      treatment will be administered until achieving complete defect closure. The effectiveness of
      each treatment will be measured in terms of days taken to achieve complete closure. Since PED
      is a complex disease that is difficult to treat, the available treatments are not very
      effective, therefore, PED might progress even to perforation regardless of the treatment. In
      this last scenario, we will provide appropriate treatment for progressive corneal thinning
      and corneal perforation
