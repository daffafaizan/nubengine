    
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of consumption of a protein beverage in
      the late evening before sleep along with the combination of resistance and high-intensity
      interval training on improving body composition, muscle strength and overall health compared
      to a carbohydrate placebo beverage in overweight and obese individuals. Specifically, we will
      be measuring heart rate, blood pressure, body composition, resting metabolism, maximal
      strength,cardiovascular function, hormones levels, blood lipid profile, appetite, mood state,
      and dietary intake. Specific aims of the study are:

      To determine if acute ingestion of a liquid ready-to-drink protein supplement (30g whey or
      casein protein per serving) consumed in the late evening before sleep will alter the
      physiological milieu to favor anabolism and alter lipolysis and fat oxidation more than the
      carbohydrate placebo (34g of maltodextrin per serving).

      To determine if 4 weeks of daily protein supplementation (same supplement as above) in the
      late evening along with 3 days of exercise training per week will improve body composition,
      blood lipid profile, strength, cardiovascular risk profile more than a placebo beverage.
