    
      We propose to investigate the efficacy of transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy with
      endoscopic biopsy in patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy and who will require a
      concurrent gastrotomy for placement of a PEG, gastrojejunostomy or gastric resection.

      We hypothesize that diagnostic endoscopic peritoneoscopy can be done safely with adequate
      visualization of the abdominal cavity to direct clinical treatment.
