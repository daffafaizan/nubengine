      acid and linolenic acid. The high PUFA content has been suggested to reduce CVD risk through
      decreasing total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, and increasing HDL-C concentrations. In
      addition, walnuts are rich in substances such as ellagic acid (a polyphenol), antioxidants,
      vitamin E, fiber, essential fatty acids, flavanoids, and phenolic acids. Polyphenolic
      compounds are believed to have multiple biological effects influencing oxidative stress,
      platelet function, inflammation, and cancer initiation and propagation. There is interest in
      identifying foods with these and other favorable compounds to test their efficacy in real
      world settings to further understand their role in the human diet. Despite positive benefits
      found in consumption of the walnuts, it is not known which specific component of the walnut
      (i.e., whole walnut, walnut skin, defatted walnut, or walnut oil) is most beneficial to
      health. The investigators hypothesize that maximum improvements in oxidative stress,
      inflammatory markers, platelet and endothelial function will be observed following
      consumption of the whole nut versus isolated walnut components, thereby leading to a
      recommendation to consume walnuts. In addition, results from the research proposed will
      provide new information about the antioxidant, inflammatory, platelet activity and
      endothelial effects of the different walnut components and the synergistic effects these
      components have in the postprandial state.
