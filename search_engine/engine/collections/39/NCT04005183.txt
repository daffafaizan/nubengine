    
      This study is an observational prospective trial where renal cell carcinoma samples are
      isolated from nephrectomy specimens in a multi-regional manner and subjected to an integrated
      genomic, pathological and radiological assessment to provide a detailed morphological and
      molecular view of the RCC microenvironment.

      The major genomics technologies used to examine tumour specimens include single cell RNA
      sequencing including nuclear (NUCseq) and epitope sequencing (CITEseq). Additionally, bulk
      RNA sequencing and targeted mutational profiling will be performed. These technologies will
      determine mutational and gene expression profiles of various heterogeneous cell populations
      within the tumour microenvironment, including cancer, immune, and supporting cells. This will
      allow identification of mutations and abnormal expression patterns within individual cells,
      that will be used to infer targetable vulnerabilities and biomarker signatures.

      In addition, ex vivo tumor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital pathology will be
      performed on a subset of cases to facilitate correlative radio -genomic and -pathological
      assessment.
