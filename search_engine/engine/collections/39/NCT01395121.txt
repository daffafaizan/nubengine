    
      NICAM has a two step consent process. Patients diagnosed with advanced acral or mucosal
      melanoma first consent for study registration and undergo screening tests including testing
      samples of melanoma tissue for the c-KIT mutation.

      Following confirmation of the c-KIT mutation, patients are asked to consent to study entry
      with continuation of screening. Eligible patients then enter the study and commence taking
      nilotinib tablets twice a day for as long as clinical benefit is maintained.
