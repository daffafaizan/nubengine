      Primary

        -  To determine the proportion of patients alive, free of disease progression, and still
           taking STA-9090 at 6 months by BRAF mutant or wild type (WT) status.

      Secondary

        -  To assess best overall response rate and six month response rate by BRAF status

        -  To evaluate the rates of one-year overall survival and progression-free survival by BRAF
           status

        -  To determine safety and tolerability of STA-9090 by BRAF status

      Exploratory

        -  To compare the rates of response and of six-month PFS between BRAF status cohorts

        -  To explore, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the relationship between change in
           expression of hsp90 client proteins (e.g., BRAF, CRAF, AKT, CDK4, KIT) with response to
           therapy and progression free survival by BRAF status

        -  To explore the relationship in biopsied melanoma metastases between changes in
           expression of hsp90 client proteins (e.g., BRAF, CRAF, AKT, CDK4, KIT) with response to
           therapy and progression-free survival

        -  To explore response rate and 6 month progression free survival, in subset of patients
           with melanoma expressing a mutation in KIT
