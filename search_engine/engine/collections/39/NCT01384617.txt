      prevents pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy (DP) compared to stapling closure of
      the pancreatic stump in a prospective randomized controlled trail.

      Various methods and technique for treating surgical stump of the remnant pancreas have been
      reported to reduce pancreatic fistula after DP. However, appropriate surgical stump closure
      after DP is still controversial.

      The primary endpoint in this trial was defined as the incidence of pancreatic fistula .
