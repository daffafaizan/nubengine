      increasing doses of CC100 or 1 dose of placebo and 2 increasing doses of CC100. Dosing will
      occur every 2 to 7 days for a study duration of 5 to 15 days from the 1st dose. Subjects are
      required to stay in the Clinic for approximately 24 hours following each dose. Subjects may
      choose to have an optional lumbar puncture following the 3rd dose of study drug.
