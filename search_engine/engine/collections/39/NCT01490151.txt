    
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a closed-loop
      "treat-to-range" (TTR) system in an inpatient clinical research center setting. The TTR
      system only effects insulin delivery when the glucose is projected to be above or below
      specified target ranges. These initial studies will assess the safety of this algorithm
      (mathematical equation) under the extreme conditions of a missed meal insulin bolus and meal
      over-insulinization. This is a "hybrid" system, which allows the research team to deliver
      insulin boluses manually with the TTR controller only becoming active when blood glucose
      levels are projected to be out of the specified range.
