    
      In the DNN group and control group, these steps are the same process.

        1. Routine exam and capture photographs of skin lesions for all eligible consecutive series
           patient.

        2. Make a clinical diagnosis (BEFORE-DX)

        3. Make a clinical diagnosis (AFTER-DX)

        4. consult to dermatologist

      In the DNN group, after making the BEFORE-DX, physicians use deep neural networks and make an
      AFTER-DX considering the results of the deep neural networks (Model Dermatology, build 2020).

      In the control group, after making the BEFORE-DX, physicians make an AFTER-DX after reviewing
      the pictures of skin lesions once more.

      Ground truth will be based on the biopsy if available, or the consensus diagnosis of the
      dermatologists.

      We will compare the accuracy between the DNN group and control group after 6 consecutive
      months study.
