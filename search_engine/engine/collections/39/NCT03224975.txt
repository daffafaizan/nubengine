      the former burned and, on the other hand, healthy volunteers. While they thought to painful
      memory or not, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will be performed. Then,
      investigators compare two functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).

      Main objective of this study is link up between brain activity by functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and acute pain memory.
