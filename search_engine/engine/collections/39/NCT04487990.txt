      Control group (n = 45): patients on continuous hemodialysis (blood flow 150 ml / min, dose of
      30 ml / kg / h) receiving anticoagulation with sodium citrate at 4 mmol / l. The dialysis
      system pressures, dialyzer patency and duration and bleeding rate will be assessed for 72
      hours;

      Intervention group (n = 45): patients on continuous hemodialysis (blood flow 150 ml / min,
      dose of 30 ml / kg / h) receiving anticoagulation with sodium citrate at 4 mmol / l
      associated with unfractionated heparin at 10U / Kg / h. The dialysis system pressures,
      dialyzer patency and duration and bleeding rate will be assessed for 72 hours.
