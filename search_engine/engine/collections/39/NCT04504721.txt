      cognitive dysfunctions, fatigue, sleep disorders, and circadian dysregulation. Light therapy
      can improve sleep quality and sleep architecture, advance sleep phases and reduce pain
      sensitivity and that the effect of light therapy on mood and cognitive function have been
      widely supported, research into the effect of light therapy for patients with fibromyalgia
      who often suffer from sleep and mood disturbance, pain, and cognitive impairments is of both
      research interest and therapeutic implications. This study will use a randomized, parallel
      group, assessor-blind, waiting-list controlled trial design. The primary outcome is symptom
      severity. The secondary outcomes include: sleep quality; depressive symptoms; psychomotor
      vigilance and attention; and sleep phase changes. The intervention will take 8 weeks with 30
      minutes exposure at awakening to blue-enriched white light. A total of 80 participants, aged
      20 to 64, with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia will be enrolled and randomly assigned into one of
      the two parallel groups: an intervention and a waiting list group. For the intervention
      group, outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately after, and 2 months after the
      8-week intervention period. For the waiting list group, outcomes will be assessed at
      baseline, immediately after the 8-week waiting period, and 2 months after the intervention
      period.
