      effects of Kate Farm Peptide 1.5 nutritional formula in patients with gastroparesis, relative
      to their pre-enrollment diet regimen.

      Patients will undergo a baseline measurement of their height, weight, symptom burden, resting
      energy expenditure, inflammation, and microbiome. After study initiation, patient will
      undergo repeat testing at 1- and 3-months post-enrollment. Including the screening and
