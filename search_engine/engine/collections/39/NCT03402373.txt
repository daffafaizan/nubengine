      attractive. In addition to structural facial features, studies have shown that skin
      appearance is highly weighed in the perception of beauty and is determined primarily by its
      coloration and surface topography. Aging is caused by two processes, intrinsic and extrinsic.
      The sun is the primary cause of extrinsic aging and has also been shown to alter the normal
      course of intrinsic or natural aging. On the molecular level, various hypotheses have been
      proposed to explain aging, with free radical theory being prominent. The free radical theory
      addresses the concept of intrinsic biological instability of living systems, in which free
      radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage biomolecules, and this damage results
      in aging of the skin (as well as other systems).

      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of an oral antioxidant supplement on skin
      aging and skin condition.
