      pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and efficacy of intravenous factor XIII treatment in patients
      with systemic sclerosis.

      Scleroderma (Systemic sclerosis) is a multisystem rheumatic disease that is characterised by
      progressive vascular damage e.g Raynaud's phenomenon and digital ulcers and organ fibrosis
      e.g. skin thickening and pulmonary fibrosis.The disease is associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality and current therapeutic options are only partially effective,
      including Cyclophosphamide for skin or lung fibrosis and Bosentan which reduces but does not
      heal digital ulcers.

      There is no cure available and there is therefore a high need for new therapeutic
      options.Administration of human Factor XIII (FXIII) concentrate in patients with scleroderma
      demonstrated promising results in the 1980s and 1990s . However these studies were not
      performed according to current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and involved
      relatively small sample sizes.

      This is a single site study, therefore all study participants will be seen at the Royal Free
      London National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust.Total study duration is 36 months and
      will involve 2 phases: an initial single dose, pharmacokinetic (PK) phase in 8 subjects over
      6 weeks and a multiple dose, active treatment phase in 18 subjects over 24 weeks. During the
      treatment phase subjects will be randomized at 2:1 ratio to either FXIII or Placebo and will
      receive biweekly injection of either factor XIII Concentrate or placebo.
