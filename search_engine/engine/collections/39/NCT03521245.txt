      Trastuzumab alone or in combinations with other regimens of chemotherapy with known clinical
      outcomes will be collected and subjected to mRNA sequencing. Expression profiles will be
      analysed using original bioinformatic platform Oncobox. Based on comparison of molecular
      pathways activation strength and clinical response to Trastuzumab and chemotherapy, this
      study aims to identify molecular markers predicting efficacy of therapy with Trastuzumab and
      the possibility of further relapse.
