    
      Hypothesis: With technical optimizations, non-contrast DWI can detect clinically and
      mammographically occult breast cancer in women with dense breasts with high sensitivity and
      low false positive rate.

      Aim 1: Improve the breast DWI technique to maximize spatial resolution, reduce distortion,
      and increase lesion contrast.

        -  Develop novel DWI acquisition to increase spatial resolution and reduce distortion
           (using reduced field of-view and/or multishot echo planar imaging techniques)

        -  Identify optimal diffusion sensitization (b-value) to maximize conspicuity of cancers in
           women with dense breasts

      Aim 2: Develop interpretation tools to optimize diagnostic performance for detecting cancer
      on DWI.

        -  Determine quantitative DWI thresholds (contrast-to-noise ratio, apparent diffusion
           coefficient [ADC]) that best differentiate benign and malignant lesions (i.e. maximize
           sensitivity and specificity)

        -  Develop computer aided assessment tools to facilitate clinical implementation and
           optimize reader accuracy

      Aim 3: Test the performance of the optimized DWI approach for detecting clinically and
      mammographically-occult cancer in women with dense breasts.

        -  Conduct a controlled reader study of non-contrast DWI alone for breast cancer detection

        -  Perform receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and determine the sensitivity
           and specificity for detection of mammographically occult cancer
