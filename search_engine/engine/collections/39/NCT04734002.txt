    
      Background: Surgical treatment in the neonatal period mostly consists of congenital
      anomalies. Due to the different characteristics of newborns, the practice of monitoring this
      group of patients by neonatal specialists in neonatal intensive care units is increasingly
      common in the world and in our country. In our hospital, neonatal surgery intensive care unit
      model has been applied for about six years.

      Objectives: This study was aimed at examining the data gathered from the neonatal surgery
      intensive care unit we created at Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital and the contribution of
      this model toward improving the health of newborns with surgical problems.

      Methods: In this study, the file records of newborns admitted to the neonatal and neonatal
      surgery intensive care units which operate on two separate floors at Ihsan Dogramaci
      Children's Hospital were retrospectively analyzed for the period January 2014 to December
      2019. The demographic, neonatal, and clinical information of the patients-including medical
      and surgical diseases and mortality rates-was recorded retrospectively for the study period
      with the information obtained from the hospital database. In addition, the gestational week,
      birth weight, gender, and length of hospital stay of the patients who were operated on in our
      unit in the last 2 years were examined.

      The data obtained from the hospital database were recorded in Microsoft Excel and SPSS 22.0
      Base, and statistical analysis was performed.

      AÄ°m: This study was aimed at examining the data gathered from the neonatal surgery intensive
      care unit we created at Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital and the contribution of this
      model toward improving the health of newborns with surgical problems.
