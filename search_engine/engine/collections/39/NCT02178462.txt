    
      "AminoIndex Technology" was developed based on high-throughput and absolute quantitative
      analysis method of amino acids and amines using UFLC-MS, and creating a clinical database to
      search for amino acid patterns across different diseases including cancer. "AminoIndex
      Technology" can evaluate certain health conditions and the possibility of diseases by
      analyzing the balance of plasma amino acids. Multicenter studies in Japan were conducted to
      develop an blood based biomarker panel for cancer.

      This study wil be conducted to evaluate the performance of AminoIndexTM (gynecological)
      biomarker based on "AminoIndex Technology" for gynecological cancers in US populations. This
      will be done by analyzing plasma metabolites including amino acids, from endometrial and
      ovarian cancer patients, from patients with benign gynecological disease, and healthy
      subjects using Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Liquid Chromatography
      - Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS).
