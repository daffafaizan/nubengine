      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity, toxicity profile, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
           of gefitinib and paclitaxel administered with radiotherapy in patients with advanced or
           recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen in patients treated at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, dose-escalation study of gefitinib and paclitaxel.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until completion
      of radiotherapy. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43
      and undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, 43-47, 50-54,
      and 57-61. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib and paclitaxel until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A cohort of 6 additional
      patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 3 months
      for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
