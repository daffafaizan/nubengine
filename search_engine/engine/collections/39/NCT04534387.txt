      non-Hispanic/Latino Whites, despite similar hearing loss prevalence rates. It has been
      suggested that a lack of culturally competent interventions contributes to poor healthcare
      delivery and outcomes for those with limited English proficiency. The objective of this
      application is to develop and evaluate Spanish-language hearing education materials for
      adults. Our hypothesis is that participants will demonstrate better understanding of their
      hearing loss and associated difficulties, and will be better able to identify options for
      self-management following delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate patient
      education materials. The rationale for the proposed research is that findings will contribute
      to the development and testing of novel interventions aimed at increasing hearing healthcare
      access and utilization in vulnerable populations in a subsequent R01 application.
