      healthcare costs intensively. Although the treatment with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is
      effective in many cases, surgical treatment remains relevant due to a large amount of PPI
      refractory GERD. Laparoscopic fundoplication (LF) is considered as standard procedure, but
      this type of surgery is linked to side effects as dysphagia, gas bloating and inability to
      belch. Especially patients with ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) are prone to
      postoperative dysphagia after LF. Lower esophageal sphincter electrical stimulation (LES-EST)
      was introduced as an alternative technique to avoid side effects of LF. Rodriquez et al. have
      bee demonstrated that LES-EST significantly raises the LES pressure and improved GERD
      symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation. The advantage of this procedure is that the
      anatomy of the esophageal-gastric junction is not altered dramatically. Notably, patients
      with severely disordered esophageal peristalsis will benefit from this low-risk profile.

      After successful implementation of this technique at the Medical University of Vienna (EK
      1149/2014), a prospective evaluation of data with the well established gastroesophageal
      reflux disease - health-related quality of life is next. Patients with esophageal motility
      disorder, who undergo LES-EST, will be investigated towards side effects such as
      gas-bloating, inability to belch, flatulence and dysphagia.
