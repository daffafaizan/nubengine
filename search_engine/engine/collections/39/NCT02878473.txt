      liver cirrhosis. iCCA is not an indication for Liver transplantation (LT) at most transplant
      centres given the historically poor rates of survival and high rates of disease recurrence. A
      recent retrospective study shows that patients found to have very early iCCA on explant after
      undergoing LT for another indication, had a 5 year survival of 65% and recurrence rate of
      13%.This suggests that LT can be a curative treatment if applied selectively and that it is
      time to reevaluate LT as a treatment option for those with very early iCCA. This study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of LT as a treatment for very early iCCA diagnosed in cirrhotic
      patients. Diagnosis of iCCA will be based upon biopsy results of a new tumor which does not
      present radiologically as an HCC. Patients fulfilling the strict study selection criteria
      will undergo a full transplant assessment and must be deemed otherwise "suitable" for liver
      transplant as per their centre's criteria. Patients will be treated with bridging therapies
      while they are on the transplant waiting list according to each center's policy. Patients
      with disease progression (tumor >3cm or development of extrahepatic disease) at any time
      prior to transplantation will be excluded. Participants will be followed for 5 years from the
      time of transplant with patient survival and disease recurrence as outcome measures.
