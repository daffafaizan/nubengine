      and life-long. The therapy of choice are local intramuscular Botulinum Toxin injections given
      every three months. Oral medication such as anticholinergics or dopamine depleting drugs are
      usually of limited efficacy or their use is limited by intolerable side-effects. About 5-10%
      of CD patients develop neutralizing antibodies against Botulinum Toxin. Two previous
      controlled multicenter trials have shown the efficacy and safety of bilateral pallidal
      stimulation in patients with primary segmental and generalized dystonia (one study was
      performed by our group).

      Following surgery, patients will be randomized 1:1 to verum or placebo stimulation for a
      period of three months. Primary outcome measure is the TWSTRS (Toronto Western Spasmodic
      Torticollis Rating Scale) - a validated and widely accepted physician-based outcome measure
      for cervical dystonia. The independent TWSTRS raters are movement disorders specialists
      unaware of the stimulation status (verum/placebo) and they compare the TWSTRS-score at
      baseline and 3-months follow-up. Our hypothesis is that stimulated patients will have a
      significantly better improvement of dystonia as compared to those without stimulation
      (placebo group).

      After the 3-months period, all patients are unblinded and receive continuous effective
      stimulation by the implanted system. Regular follow-up visits are scheduled every 12 months
      for 5 years postoperatively to assess the long-term efficacy of pallidal stimulation.
      Side-effects are assessed in a standardized way and include the assessment of surgery-induced
      as well as stimulation-induced side-effects.
