      pacing strategies which engage and take advantage of the intrinsic cardiac conduction system.
      These approaches include His bundle pacing (HBP) as well as approaches which seek to pace the
      proximal left conduction system (LCS), including left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) or
      pacing in the region of the left posterior fascicle. Left ventricular septal pacing (LVS) has
      also been proposed as another means to avoid dyssynchrony with early data suggestive of
      comparable electrical synchronization as biventricular pacing. These approaches utilize
      approved pacing systems and leads which are delivered to new targets in the His-Purkinje
      system or LV endocardial fibers. Despite the growing interest in HBP, LCS, and LVS, the
      majority of data are from disparate cohort studies and there has been a lack of uniformity in
      assembling data or analyzing and interpreting outcomes.

      The goal of the Conduction System Pacing International Registry (CONSPIRE) is to
      systematically and prospectively collect data across multiple centers of excellence on the
      early implementation of permanent conduction system pacing devices in order to characterize
      strengths and limitations of current technology. The study will evaluate patient selection,
      intraprocedural characteristics, and clinical outcomes among patients receiving conduction
      system pacing (CSP) as part of their routine clinical care.
