    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of sirolimus (rapamycin) combined with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin (GC). (Phase I)

      II. To determine the pathologic complete response rate at cystectomy in patients with
      localized, muscle invasive carcinoma of the bladder (clinical tumor [T]2-4, node [N]0 or N1).
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate to rapamycin combined with GC. (Phase I)

      II. To assess effect of rapamycin with GC on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage surrogates in
      cancer associated stroma compared to untreated and GC treated stroma. (Phase I)

      III. To assess effect of rapamycin with GC on DNA damage surrogates in cancer associated
      stroma compared to untreated and GC treated stroma. (Phase II)

      IV. To assess toxicity of the MTD dose of rapamycin with GC. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose de-escalation study of sirolimus followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) two hours before or after grapefruit juice on day -2,
      cisplatin intravenously (IV) on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo cystectomy as clinically appropriate
      after 1-4 courses of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
