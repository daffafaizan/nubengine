      increasing proportion of elderly adults underscores the population's attributable risk of
      anemia. As a potentially modifiable factor, an urgent need exists to delineate the impact of
      anemia correction in the elderly. The Partnership for Anemia: Clinical and Translational
      Trials in the Elderly (PACTTE) consortium has been created to focus on treatment strategies
      for anemia in elderly patients. The data presented in this protocol provides a compelling
      rationale to evaluate the impact of an anti-inflammatory (Salsalate) in older anemic adults
      with elevated serum iL-6 levels.

      Subjects will be 65 years or older adults with unexplained anemia and a elevated serum iL-6 â‰¥
      1.0 pg/mL.

      Subjects will receive 750mg of salsalate or matching placebo (one pill) twice a day (am and
      pm) for one month. After one month the dose will be increased to 1500mg (2 pills) twice a day
      (am and pm) if the 750mg dose was tolerated for a further 5 months (for a total of 6 months)

      The primary endpoint is to assess whether salsalate improves hemoglobin levels from baseline
      to 6 month visit.
