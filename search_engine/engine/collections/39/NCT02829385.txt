      treatment.

      Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that highly selectively binds to
      and strongly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), with a
      decrease in VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tumor microvascular
      density. A phase II trail of Apatinib has been demonstrated that Apatinib is safe to treat
      the metastatic colorectal cancer and the disease control rate can reach 50%.
