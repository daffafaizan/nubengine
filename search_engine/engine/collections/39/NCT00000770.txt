      ddI is less able to develop resistance to nevirapine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor. Thus, convergent combination therapy with these three drugs in HIV-infected
      patients may prove more effective.

      Patients are randomized to receive AZT/ddI plus either nevirapine or placebo daily for 48
      weeks, with possible extension for at least 12 weeks. At eight participating sites, ACTG 808
      and 809 will be conducted as virologic and pharmacokinetic substudies.
