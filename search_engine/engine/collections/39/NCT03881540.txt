           or conventional counselling techniques at baseline, 6 months and 12 months of
           intervention.

           fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, high sensitivity-C-Reactive Protein and blood
           pressure) in patients receiving structured lifestyle intervention based on tDNA care
           compared to usual diabetes care in addition to receiving either the motivational
