      occur, that will prevent further clinical development of the autologous cell based
      immunotherapy ALECSAT in Glioblastoma (GBM) or to establish if there are side effects or
      toxicity issues, that will suggest that the further clinical development planned, has to
      change course significantly. It is a primary objective to show safety and tolerability for
      administration of ALECSAT, thus not meeting this endpoint, may stop further clinical
      development of ALECSAT.

      The secondary objective for this study is to establish if any indications of a positive
      therapeutic or palliative effect may be observed. As this is a secondary objective, no
      observed significant positive clinical effect, will not prevent further clinical development
      or in itself, trigger changes in the further clinical development planned.

      The overall endpoint of the study is to develop a new therapeutic approach that may slow down
      or stop disease progression in late stage GBM patients.

      ALECSAT is an autologous cell based immunotherapy based on the patient's own Natural Killer
      cells and CytoToxic T cells. The cells are isolated from the patient's own blood - activated
      and expanded in number before re administering i. v.
