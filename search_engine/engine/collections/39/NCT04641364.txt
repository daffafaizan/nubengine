      recombinant human albumin injection in healthy volunteers. The safety, tolerance,
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of recombinant human albumin injection were evaluated in
      a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single dose incremental trial
      in healthy volunteers. The study was divided into two stages: the first stage was a single
      dose and dose increasing stage (including 5 dose groups with increasing dose, and each group
      was set with placebo control); the second stage was multiple administration stage (with
      positive control). The safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and other early
      clinical data of recombinant human albumin were collected and analyzed in the two stages. The
      initial dose was 1.25g. The highest dose group was set at 30g. The dose groups of 1.25, 5,
      10, 20 and 30 g / time were preset in the single dose stage (dose increasing stage). The
      dosage was 10 g / Day in multiple administration stage.
