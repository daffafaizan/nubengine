      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), high incidences of distant metastases and severe treatment
      related toxicities have become an obstacle to be overcome. Besides, a common problem in
      locally advanced NPC is the narrow gap between the tumor and critical normal structures,
      which makes dose optimization difficult. Considering that significant tumor shrinkage may
      occur during induction chemotherapy, and incidences of distant metastases may be reduced by
      adjuvant chemotherapy, this study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of
      sequential chemoradiotherapy with regimen of docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil and
      reduced target delineation and radiation doses IMRT for patients with locoregionally advanced
      NPC.
