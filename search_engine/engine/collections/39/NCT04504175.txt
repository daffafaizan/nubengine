      phase). Participants who respond or remit will continue with an additional 4 weeks of weekly
      ketamine infusions (continuation phase). Participants will be assessed at baseline, end of
      acute phase, and end of continuation phase for effectiveness, safety, and executive
      functioning. Participants will be asked to complete daily surveys of their depression
      symptoms during their participation.
