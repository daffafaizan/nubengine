      examinations of visual acuity, eye refraction and biometrics, and be assigned to two groups:
      participants in group A use myopia prediction algorithm to predict myopia development, while
      in Group B, the participants do not use myopia prediction algorithm to predict myopia
      development. The visual acuity, eye refraction and biometrics will be investigated over the
      one-year follow-up period, aiming at comparison of actual myopia development between the two
      groups.
