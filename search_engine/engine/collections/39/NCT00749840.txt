      survival of patients with HIV in the US. The effectiveness of HAART in routine care is
      determined by the success with which patients are able to follow certain crucial Steps of HIV
      Care. This 'Steps of HIV Care' framework is based on the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention's (CDC's) "Serostatus Approach to Fighting the HIV Epidemic," which has been
      overlaid with patient and process of care factors. It includes 1) access outpatient care, 2)
      utilize care and treatment services, and 3) adhere to care, including medications and
      appointments.
