      follow-up.

      Eligible subjects will be treated with intratumoral tavo-EP to the accessible lesions on Days
      1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks and with IV pembrolizumab (200 mg) on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for
      up to 17 cycles of tavo-EP and 33 cycles of pembrolizumab from baseline (approximately 2
      years) or until subsequent disease progression. For Cohort 2, subjects will be treated with
      an approved chemotherapy per standard of care, limited to nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®). All
      accessible lesions, each ≥ 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm, may be treated; except where possible, 1
      measurable lesion by RECIST (size ≥ 1.0 cm) should be selected and left untreated for the
      duration of the study.

      Long-term Follow-up: All subjects will be followed after the End of Study (EOS) visit for
      Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (through 90 days from the last dose of study drug) and
      long-term survival status for up to 1 year. EOS visit will occur 4 weeks after last study
      treatment administration.
