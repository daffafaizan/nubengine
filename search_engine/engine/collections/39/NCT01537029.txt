      study is designed to measure drug concentrations in the blood of 18 female breast cancer
      patients who require doxorubicin (30 minute infusion) and cylcophosphamide (30 minute
      infusion) as part of standard medical care. Up to a total of 40 adult female participants
      will be consented for the study at the cancer center. Eighteen of these participants are
      needed to complete the study. The others will likely be screen failures. The participants
      will have no more than 100 ml of blood drawn via a peripheral intravenous catheter just prior
      to the doxorubicin infusion, and then at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12-24, and 24-72 h after
      the beginning of the doxorubicin infusion. The 5 hour blood draw is optional. The intravenous
      catheter will be removed when the participant is discharged from the cancer center on day 1.
      The participant will be asked to return to the cancer center at 12-24 and 24-72 hours to have
      the final 2 blood draws conducted.

      The participants must be treated with Doxurubicin and Cyclophosphamide in order to
      participate in this pharmacokinetic analysis study.
