      caused to soft and bony tissue can result in considerable pain, swelling and trismus.
      Symptoms begin gradually having a peak 2 days after extraction. The use of corticosteroids
      such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone can be a valuable tool when performing moderate
      to moderately severe oral surgical procedures. No clear consensus have emerged yet regarding
      patient selection, dosage, timing and type of administration of steroid. In this light, this
      clinical trial aim to compare the effect of preemptive dexamethasone and methylprednisolone
      to prevent pain, swelling and limitation in mouth opening following third molar extraction.
