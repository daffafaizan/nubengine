    
      The observational period will be 1 year (52 weeks) from the first brolucizumab administration
      in the primary treated eye.

      However, if brolucizumab is discontinued in the primary treated eye and if the treatment is
      discontinued less than 52 weeks observation period, the observation period will be up to 90
      days after the last dose of this drug. This is set in order to collect data as much as
      possible based on the clinical effect of the drug. If 30 days after the last dose of this
      drug in a discontinued patient exceeds 52 weeks of the observation period, the patient should
      be monitored for adverse events until 30 days after the last dose of this drug
