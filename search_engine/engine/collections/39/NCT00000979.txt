      first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and in patients with advanced ARC.
      However, AZT therapy has been associated with significant toxicities. In addition, the
      effectiveness of AZT appears to decrease during the second and third years of therapy. For
      these reasons, the development of alternative therapy that would be at least as effective but
      less toxic is of great importance. The drug ddI is an antiviral agent that inhibits
      replication (reproduction) of HIV with less apparent toxicity than AZT.

      AMENDED: 9/28/90 Patients are assigned to one of 2 treatments under a double-blind, randomly
      allocated, experimental design if their duration of prior AZT therapy is 0 to 16 weeks.
      (Patients who entered with no more than 16 weeks prior AZT and who were randomized to ddI
      will continue to be dosed at that level, adjusted for weight, and followed as originally
      planned.) Patients are assigned to one of 3 treatments as explained prior to this amendment
      if their duration of prior to AZT therapy is greater than 16 weeks. Original design: Patients
      are assigned to one of three treatments under a double-blind randomly allocated experimental
      design. ddI will be administered at two dose levels.

      It is anticipated that patients will be seen as outpatients every 2 weeks for the first 4
      weeks of the study and monthly thereafter. This study continues for at least 18 months after
      the entry of the first subject.
