      cancer survivors. Many gynecological cancer survivors may experience late side effects from
      their cancer treatment. In addition, evidence is accumulating that an active lifestyle may
      increase empowerment and may positively influence well-being after cancer treatment. Through
      the LETSGO smartphone app, women treated for gynecological cancer will get access to
      individualized posttreatment information on side effects as well as tailored physical
      activity advices in order to assume more responsibility for achieving the best outcomes from
      her care. The participants will also regularly answer patient reported outcomes regarding
      possible recurrence though the app. As a first step the smart-phone application will be
      pilot-tested.
