    
      This is a multi-center, open-label effectiveness trial to identify objective indicators of
      treatment response in ADHD subjects (versus healthy controls) using cognitive and brain
      function measures, brain structure and genetic measures in subjects diagnosed with ADHD.

      At least 672 na√Øve and treatment experienced subjects with ADHD will be enrolled from
      approximately 10 primary care centers. These patients are to be outpatients.

      In addition, up to 672 healthy (non-ADHD) control subjects will be recruited who match the
      enrolled ADHD subjects in race, age, gender and years of education.
