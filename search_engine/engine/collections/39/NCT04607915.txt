      health and wellbeing, particularly adults living with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), who are at
      greater risk for mental health issues than the general population. Self-management education
      and support for healthy eating, physical activity, glucose monitoring, medication adherence
      and problem solving are vital components of diabetes care. Due to social distancing and
      limited care and resources, that are likely to persist in the post pandemic phase other
      innovative service models should be developed and adopted to improve service delivery. The
      overall goal of this research program is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care program. In this study, we examine the feasibility of
      such a program, called the Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care (TECC) for T2DM designed to
      support patients with diabetes and mental health concerns during COVID-19.
