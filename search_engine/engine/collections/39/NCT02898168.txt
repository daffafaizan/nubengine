      stroke (cerebral infarction or cerebral hemorrhage) and also observing the foot drop during
      walking.

      Some study for the patients after the onset of stroke (over several months) are reported that
      a case of the efficacy by the treatment using the FES, and another case of using FES
      indicated the equal efficacy and the higher QOL compared to using ankle-foot orthosis(AFO).

      However, these are clinical research results overseas and there are not so many studies
      targeting only for convalescent stroke patients.

      FES which recover the lost function by paralysis using electrical stimulation is recommended
      as convalescent rehabilitation by Japanese Guidelines for the Management of Stroke 2015 etc..

      The purpose of FES treatment is the electrical stimulation to peroneal nerve of patients with
      foot drop and equinus foot due to central nervous system damage and the objective efficacy is
      following:

        -  To improve the walking by dorsiflexing the foot during swing phase

        -  To prevention and suppression of disuse atrophy

        -  To increase local blood flow

        -  To re-educate muscle

        -  To maintain or increase the range of joint motion
