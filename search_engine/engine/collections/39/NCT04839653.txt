      patients will receive standard therapy. During the second period the SDD protocol will be
      implemented in addition to the standard care. The first period will end at the moment of the
      last admitted patient ICU discharge or death.

      Study population: general ICU adult patients anticipated to receive prolonged mechanical
      ventilation (more than 48 hours). Patients who are terminally ill and are anticipated to die
      in the next 24 hours will be excluded, so are patients with malignancies (except for patients
      with primary central nervous system tumors who received radical treatment) and patients
      admitted from other hospitals who received mechanical ventilation (including non-invasive
      ventilation) for more than 24 hours.

      Patients in the interventional arm will receive the following SDD protocol:

        1. Oral paste (0,5 g) containing 10 mg of polymyxin B, 10 mg of gentamycin and 150 mg of
           amphotericine B q6h

        2. In the nasogastric tube (NGT) 10 ml of suspension containing 100 mg of polymyxin B, 80
           mg of gentamycin, 350 mg of amphotericine B and 500 mg of vancomycin q6h

        3. A 3-day course of intravenous cefotaxime 1 g q6h/ceftriaxone 1 qd

      Statistical considerations and recruitment plant: VAP incidence in the ICU with high rates of
      antibacterial resistance is 16,7 event per 1000 days of MV. To reveal a 25% decrease of VAP
      events (power 80%, p < 0,05) the study should recruit 25 patients in each group. However
      because of the poor prognosis in mechanically ventilated elderly patients especially in the
      setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome the goal is to recruit in each arm at least 25
      patients younger than 65 years.
