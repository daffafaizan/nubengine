        -  Determine the objective response rate (confirmed, complete, and partial) in patients
           with advanced soft tissue sarcomas treated with sorafenib.

        -  Determine the 4-month progression-free survival rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of adverse events in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OTHER OBJECTIVES (if funding permits):

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, a decrease in standard uptake variable (SUV) of target lesions
           by positron-emission tomography scan at 4 weeks with response in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, the phosphorylation status of KIT, PDGFR, VEGFR, and the
           raf/mek/erk pathway with response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, the most common B-raf kinase mutation with response in
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histology
      (leiomyosarcoma vs liposarcoma vs angiosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, or hemangiopericytoma).

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for 2 years and annually for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-75 patients (15-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 15-38 months.
