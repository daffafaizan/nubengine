    
      Relacorilant is a small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).

      The goal of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of relacorilant when given in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) with
      glucocorticoid (GC) excess.

      Eligible patients are those with advanced ACC associated with GC excess.

      Patients will receive treatment until progressive disease (PD) (per RECIST v1.1) is
      confirmed, experience unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment discontinuation
      criteria are met. All patients will be followed for documentation of disease progression,
      survival information (i.e., date and cause of death) and subsequent treatment.
