      acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have been poorly documented in randomized controlled trials
      (RCTs). Compressive therapy is controversial in that it is currently unclear whether or not
      it might reduce the risk of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS), a chronic disorder identified in
      25-50% of patients with a previous diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. With the recent SOX
      trial deeming elastic compression stockings to be ineffective in preventing postthrombotic
      syndrome and with criticisms focused on the difficulty concerning patients' compliance with
      these devices, alternative methods such as non-elastic compression garments have been
      considered. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no trials have investigated these devices
      applied with a greater pressure than compression stockings in the context of preventing pain
      and swelling in the acute DVT phase and of late complications (postthrombotic syndrome).

      The experimental literature evaluating non-elastic compression garments is primarily focused
      on venous insufficiency rather than deep vein thrombosis. For example, previous randomized
      trial patients allocated to non-elastic compression garments presented faster healing
      rates/week for venous leg ulcers than a group receiving four-layered compression garments.
      Although this evidence is related to venous insufficiency, there are currently no RCTs
      exploring the effect of non-elastic compression in preventing postthrombotic syndrome.

      Given this gap in the literature, study aimed at conducting a Bayesian randomized trial to
      assess a non-elastic compression garment (Circaid) versus a control group in patients with
      acute DVT.
