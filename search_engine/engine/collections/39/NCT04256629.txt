    
      This study will be conducted as a single-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind, 3-period, crossover study to assess the effect on the QTcF interval of a single
      oral dose of verinurad 24 mg extended release (ER8) formulation (therapeutic exposure) or
      verinurad 40 mg immediate release (IR) formulation (supra-therapeutic exposure), each in
      combination with allopurinol 300 mg, compared to placebo in healthy subjects.

      There are 3 study treatments:

        -  Treatment A: Verinurad 24 mg ER8 formulation co-administered with 300 mg allopurinol

        -  Treatment B: Verinurad 40 mg IR formulation co-administered with 300 mg allopurinol

        -  Treatment C: Matched placebos for both verinurad and allopurinol

      All subjects will receive a single dose of all 3 treatments (A, B, and C) in a cross-over
      design with wash-out periods of at least 7 days between each study dose administration.

      Subjects will be randomised to the treatment sequence (ABC, BCA, CAB, etc.) using William's
      Latin square. The treatments will be administered in a double-blind manner after an overnight
      fast of at least 10 hours.

      The study will comprise the following periods (visits):

        -  Screening Period of maximum 28 days (Visit 1);

        -  Three treatment periods of 3 days each, during which subjects will be resident at the
           study centre from the morning of the day before administration of the study dose until
           discharge 2 days after study dose administration (Visits 2 to 4);

        -  Wash-out periods of at least 7 days between each study dose administration;

        -  Final visit within 7 to 10 days after the last study dose administration (Visit 5).

      Each subject will be involved in the study for approximately 53 days and have 5 study visits.
