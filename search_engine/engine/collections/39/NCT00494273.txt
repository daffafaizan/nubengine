      practices among Haitian American (H-A) adolescents. We replicated a Cognitive-Behavioral HIV
      transmission risk reduction (CB-HIV-TRR) intervention entitled "Becoming A Responsible Teen"
      (BART, St. Lawrence, et al, 1995; St. Lawrence, 1998). This approach, which emphasizes
      building skills and self-efficacy in the process of risk reduction, was demonstrated to be
      highly effective with African American male and female adolescents in Mississippi. In a
      meta-analysis of published CB-HIV-RR intervention outcome studies (Kalichman, et al., 1996),
      the BART intervention was shown to have produced the highest effect not only for the
      published studies with adolescents, but also for HIV prevention interventions of all other
      populations studied. Based on its promising effects, the BART intervention has been
      officially designed as one of only four HIV risk "Programs that Work" by CDC Division of
      Adolescent and School Health (DASH). CDC designates programs as such based on reviewing
      programs in the literature using rigorous criteria. The proposed work focused on delineating
      theoretically important conditions associated with HIV transmission risk reduction (HIV-TRR)
      to address issues of mechanism of action and generalizability, respectively. Specifically,
      this 5 year study evaluates the effects of a version of the BART intervention that has been
      adapted to be appropriate to Haitian adolescents in Miami) as compared to a standard care
      (SC) condition among 160 male and 160 female high risk Haitian adolescents.
