    
      Patients who undergo endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery, and may require nasoseptal flap
      placement as part of skull base reconstruction, will be informed, consented and enrolled for
      participation. If the intraoperative decision is ultimately made for harvest and placement of
      full-length nasoseptal flap by each individual surgeon, patients will then be consecutively,
      sequentially randomized to use of either:

        -  Thin Doyle silastic sheet placement alone over the resulting exposed septum
           cartilage/bone (20 randomly assigned patients)

        -  2x3 cm Biodesignâ„¢ SIS perforated mesentery graft surface placement plus overlying Doyle
           silastic sheet placement over the resulting exposed septum cartilage/bone. (20 randomly
           assigned patients)

      When used, Biodesign graft will be soaked in sterile saline out of the packaging, and placed
      as an intact single sheet over the exposed bone nasal septum bone/cartilage (without
      trimming). For uniformity and ease of future analysis, the bottom edge of the graft will be
      placed parallel to, and proximal to, the nasal floor cut edge remnant mucosal surface as
      possible. Except for a thin Doyle silastic sheet to cover the graft site, no additional
      reinforcement (suture/tissue glue) will be placed for those patients in the Biodesign graft
      arm.

      Time Points and Study Parameters:

        -  All enrolled patients will have Doyle silastic sheeting removed only at 2 weeks post-op.

        -  All patients will receive 250cc normal saline topical nasal rinses starting at 14 days
           until 120 days post-op.

        -  No topical irrigation additives (budesonide/mupirocin) will be administered over 12
           weeks.

      All patients will be assessed at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks following randomization and
      entry into this study.
