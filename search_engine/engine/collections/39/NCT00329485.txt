    
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), is a blood test commonly used to track the progress of
      congestive heart failure. CORvalen, a medical food, contains D-Ribose (ribose), a natural
      substance that has been shown to improve the amount of energy compounds at the cellular
      level. Congestive heart failure has been associated with a reduced level of high-energy
      compounds. One researcher has called them an "energy starvation" in congestive heart failure.
      This study will try to assess if increasing the amount of these energy compounds is
      sufficient to improve BNP levels. Approximately 120 symptomatic congestive heart failure
      patients will participate in this 3 month study.
