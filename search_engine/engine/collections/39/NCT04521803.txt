      Tuberculous Pericarditis

      Phase 2b Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial

      The trial will enroll 100 adult participants with pericardial TB from two research sites in
      South Africa, with no exclusions being made on the basis of sex/gender, racial or ethnic
      group.

      Consenting participants will be stratified by HIV status and PCF GX-Ultra status, then
      randomized 1:1 to receive either standard of care anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) or
      standard of care plus high dose Rifampicin (RIF), both administered orally for 2 months,
      followed by a continuation phase of 4 months' RH at standard doses.
