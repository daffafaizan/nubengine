      A against lotrafilcon B lenses over 1 month of daily wear for each study lens. Each subject
      will be randomized to wear the test lens (comfilcon A) or the control lens (lotrafilcon B)
      for one month of daily wear before repeating the schedule for the second pair without a
      washout period.
