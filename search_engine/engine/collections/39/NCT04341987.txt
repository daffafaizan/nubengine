      suggests high comorbid rates of sleep and suicide in Veterans discharged from VA mental
      health residential rehabilitation treatment programs (MHRRTP; domiciliaries). Nightmares are
      a frequent concern identified by MHRRTP patients and are a modifiable risk factor for suicide
      risk. Little is known, however, about the treatment of nightmares and subsequent impact in
      this setting. The primary aims of the present project are to investigate the efficacy and
      acceptability of delivering a 2-session intervention to reduce nightmares among Veterans
      admitted to a MHRRTP. This study will examine this intervention's impact on reducing
      nightmare distress and nightmare frequency, as well as assess treatment acceptability.
      Changes in suicide risk following intervention will also be explored. This research will be
      conducted within the Canandaigua and Bath VA domiciliary programs which currently accommodate
      ~150-175 Veterans. The study will be a randomized control trial with a hybrid design that
      uses stratification based on prescription use and randomly assigns individuals (N = 48) to
      either the treatment group or treatment as usual group (TAU). Veterans referred for the
      protocol will be screened for eligibility and then if appropriate, scheduled for a baseline
      evaluation, randomized to either the treatment group or TAU group, seen for two intervention
      sessions one week apart, and then be followed up with 4- and 8-weeks post initial treatment
      via telephone. This research has potential to highlight valuable targets for cross-cutting
      treatment in a rehabilitation setting that can be delivered in civilian and Veteran samples.
