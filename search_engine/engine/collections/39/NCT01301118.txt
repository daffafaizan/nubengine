      INTRODUCTION: Early excision and partial skin graft is state-of-the-art in burns treatment.
      Otherwise, infection is cause of increased morbidity and mortality in burn patients, and its
      control is a major challenge also for skin graft integration. Wound and soft tissue infection
      rates are higher than microbiological diagnosis rates. This difference is related to moderate
      sensibility of cultures in general. Precise bacterial diagnostic and its susceptibility to
      specific antibiotics are prerequisite for adequate treatment of burn patients and skin graft
      integration.

      PURPOSE: To evaluate partial skin graft integration in relation to microbiological analysis
      of wounds in burn patients.

      METHODS: This project was approved at Ethics Committee at Federal University of São Paulo
      (1272/10). It will be a transversal, prospective, analytical, controlled study in humans,
      conducted in a single center, at Burn Care Unit of Department of Plastic Surgery at Federal
      University of São Paulo from October, 2010 to October, 2011. Thirty patients will be included
      in this study after reading and signing a consent form. Data will be collected using an
      evaluation sheet to characterize demographic and clinical aspects, including partial skin
      graft integration, use of topical and systemic antibiotics and infection rates in all sites
      (blood, urine, skin, tracheal aspirate and bronchial lavage). Data analysis will be performed
      using Student's t-test and Friedman analysis of variance.
