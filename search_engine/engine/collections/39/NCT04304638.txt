      non-squamous cell carcinoma is 17-31%, which is relatively low. Compared to patients with
      EGFR wild type, the efficacy of radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy may be different in EGFR
      mutant patients. Some small sample studies showed, compared with patients with EGFR wild
      type, patients with EGFR mutations have a lower risk of local recurrence and a higher risk of
      distant metastasis under the standard treatment for stage III lung cancer, which demonstrate
      the strength of systemic therapy may help. Radiotherapy combined with EGFR-Tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors(TKI) is a feasible treatment strategy. In view of the low mutation frequency and
      few prospective research results, the investigators try to explore the survival differences
      of three treatment strategies used in clinical practice based on the real world data. The
      investigators will obtain a cohort of patients from multiple large cancer centers in China
      and try to unravel the efficacy of "radiotherapy combined with EGFR-TKI", which may provide
      some evidences for the further study.
