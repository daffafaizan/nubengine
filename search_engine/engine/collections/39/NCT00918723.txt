    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat that can be combined with
      fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate), cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) in patients with
      previously untreated CLL/SLL.

      II. To evaluate potential efficacy in terms of 2-year after FCR plus vorinostat induction
      followed by rituximab plus vorinostat maintenance therapy for previously untreated CLL/SLL
      patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To eliminate residual disease (documented by flow cytometry and/or polymerase chain
      reaction [PCR]) in patients who have achieved a complete response (CR) after FCR plus
      vorinostat.

      II. To estimate the rate of conversion of partial response (PR) to CR after FCR plus
      vorinostat.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by a phase II study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12;
      cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and fludarabine phosphate IV over
      30-60 minutes on days 1-3; and rituximab IV on day 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 3 months after the completion of induction therapy, patients
      receive vorinostat PO on days 1-14 and rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3
      months for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and
      then annually thereafter.
