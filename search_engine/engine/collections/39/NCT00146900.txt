    
      Consecutive civilian trauma survivors will be contacted, by phone, within five days of
      admission to Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem and asked about their early
      psychological responses to the event. A short telephone interview will be administered to
      consenting subjects, to evaluate the presence of acute stress disorder (ASD). Subjects with
      ASD (full or partial) and those who so desire will be invited to clinical assessment, which
      will take place within the next two weeks. Survivors with significant symptoms of
      post-traumatic stress disorder will be randomized to five arms of twelve-week long treatment:
      CBT, CT, SSRI/placebo and waiting list (WL) and start treatment immediately. Subjects will be
      allowed to decline one form of therapy. WL subjects will start therapy 12 weeks later. All
      subjects who had clinical interview will be interviewed again at four and seven months - and
      14 months following trauma (phone interview).
