    
      Series III Run-In is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single-blind (patient-blind),
      non-inferiority trial to be conducted at approx. 35 interventional cardiology centers in
      India, Brazil, Argentina, Thailand and Saudi Aurabia. A total of 360 will be randomized on a
      2:1 basis to either the Supralimus® (sirolimus-eluting) stent or the Xience V™
      (everolimus-eluting) stent.

      In selected sites, IVUS will also be recorded in these patients (maximum of 60 IVUS patients
      in total), at baseline (post-procedure) and at 9-month follow-up.

      All patients will be followed clinically for up to 5 years after stent implantation. Repeat
      angiography will be performed in all patients at 9 months after the index procedure.
