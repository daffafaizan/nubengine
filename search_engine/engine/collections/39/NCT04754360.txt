      cardiopulmonary patients. However, to be able to objectively interpret 6MWT of a patient with
      specific chronic condition, the distance walked in 6MWT should be compared to either a
      healthy control group or a cut-off value that was specifically determined for that
      population. Such cut-off values are present for 6MWT in several cardiopulmonary diseases
      including COPD (350 m), heart failure (200 m) and pulmonary hypertension (400 m) for
      identifying patients with high mortality, poor prognosis and/or poor functional status, but
      there is no cut-off value determined for atrial fibrillation (AF). New York Heart Association
      (NYHA) functional classification is another measure that is widely used for classifying the
      functional status of patients with various cardiac diseases including AF. While NYHA class 1
      indicates preserved functional status, NYHA class 2, 3 and 4 indicate the different degrees
      of reduction in functional status. Primary aim of this study is to determine a cut-off value
      in 6MWT for discriminating between the AF patients with preserved and reduced functional
      status according to NYHA functional classification. In addition, a cut-off value for
      30-second sit-to-stand test will be determined in these patients as well, since sit-to-stand
      tests have gained a lot of interest in the recent literature for practically evaluating
      functional status in various cardiopulmonary conditions.
