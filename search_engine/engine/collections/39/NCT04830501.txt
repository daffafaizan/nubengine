      patients who have a histological or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or
      recurrent tumors that all standard treatments have been used or are not feasible. It aims to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for
      study, evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)
      characteristics and the preliminary anti-tumor activity of TT-00434, and explore the
      relationship between the anti-tumor activity of TT-00434 and the tumor FGFR alterations.
