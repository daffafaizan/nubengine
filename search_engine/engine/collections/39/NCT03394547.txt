      study.

        -  Treatment for 2 menstrual cycles using the PSWT Allay device (BioElectronics Corp,
           Frederick USA)

        -  Treatment for 2 menstrual cycles using a placebo device

        -  No treatment. If they are allocated to a device both the participant and the clinician
           will be blinded at to weather they are using the active device or the placebo.

      Primary Outcome measures are:

        -  A reduction in dysmenorrhea as measured by the highest pain score on a 10cm visual
           analogue scale.

        -  A reduction in average pain score on a 10cm visual analogue scale

        -  A reduction in use of analgesia as recorded in a pain diary

        -  Improvement in quality of life as measured through a validated quality of life
           assessment tool (SF-36 questionnaire)

           - Improvement in menstrual symptoms as recorded through a validated questionnaire (the
           Modified Menorrhagia Multi-attribute Scale (MMAS)).

        -  Device acceptability as measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from "unacceptable"
           to "totally acceptable".

        -  Impact upon associated cyclical symptoms as recorded in a patient symptom diary
