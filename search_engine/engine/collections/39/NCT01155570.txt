    
      This study was non-interventional, open-labeled, all-cases, central registration method, post
      marketing observational study in which Humira was prescribed for patients with psoriasis
      vulgaris and/or psoriatic arthritis in routine medical practice.

      When investigators prescribed Humira to an eligible patient who provided informed consent,
      they filled out a registration form and send it to the registration center via postal mail.
      At the end of the 24-week observation period, an investigator filled out a case report form
      for each patient to describe the findings during the study period, and provided the completed
      form to medical representatives. Even if Humira treatment was for any reason discontinued,
      the investigators followed each such participant for 24 weeks after the first administration
      of Humira, and filled out a case report form for the participant at the end of the 24-week
      period.

      Some participants entered this study from study NCT00647400 (M04-702), a Phase III extension
      study of Humira (adalimumab) in Japan.
