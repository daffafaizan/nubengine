      R1/R2 stage I+II:

        -  R1: resection status: complete

        -  R2: resection status: incomplete, stage I and II

      R2 III:

      - R 2: resection status: incomplete, stage III and LDH < 2 x ULN (according to local
      reference value for adults)

      R3/R4:

        -  R3: resection status: incomplete, stage III and LDH ≥ 2 x ULN but < 4 x ULN or stage
           IV/B-AL and LDH < 4 x ULN and CNS negative

        -  R4: resection status: incomplete, Stage III and LDH ≥ 4 x ULN or stage IV/B-AL and LDH ≥
           4 x ULN and CNS negative

        -  R4 CNS +: stage IV/B-AL and CNS positive

      For patients with very limited disease (R1/R2 stage I/II), the addition of rituximab might
      allow the omission of anthracyclines without jeopardizing survival rates but reducing acute
      and long term toxicities. In this treatment arm, it is tested whether the event-free survival
      is similar to that of the historical control when all patients receive one dose of rituximab
      as monotherapeutic agent in the rituximab window R five days prior to the start of standard
      chemotherapy as a substitute for anthracyclines.

      For patients with limited disease (R2 stage III) it is tested whether the event-free survival
      can be improved by adding rituximab to the standard chemotherapy. Two different treatment
      regimens will be evaluated in a randomized design: Patients in the standard arm will receive
      the standard chemotherapy. Patients of the rituximab plus arm will receive one dose of
      rituximab as monotherapeutic agent in the rituximab window R five days prior to the start of
      standard chemotherapy.

      For patients with advanced disease (R3/R4) it is tested whether the event-free survival can
      be improved by adding rituximab to the standard chemotherapy. Two different rituximab
      regimens will be evaluated in a randomized design: Patients in the standard arm will receive
      one dose of rituximab as monotherapeutic agent in the rituximab window R five days prior to
      the start of standard chemotherapy. Patients of the rituximab plus arm will receive the
      rituximab window and additional six doses of rituximab added to the first four courses of
      chemotherapy. In addition the immune reconstitution will be analyzed comparing the effect of
      the two regimens of rituximab added to standard chemotherapy.
