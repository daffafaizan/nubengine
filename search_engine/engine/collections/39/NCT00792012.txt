      dose per fraction escalation study. A dose per fraction escalation study means that
      successive groups of patients will receive higher doses per fraction of radiation while
      keeping the total dose of radiation the same (60 Gy, Gy is a radiation unit). The radiation
      dose per fraction will be increased and the numbers of radiation treatments will be decreased
      until a fraction dose is reached at which there are unacceptable side effects compared with
      possible benefit. Which group subjects are assigned to will depend on what stage the study
      has reached at the time the subject decide to participate.

      This research is being done because with current standard radiation therapy (A total dose of
      60 Gy given 2 Gy a day over 6 weeks) the outcome is very poor. New and more effective
      radiation therapy methods are desperately needed for patients with GBM.

      In this study, radiation therapy is given together with chemotherapy of Temozolomide.

      This study is also designed to monitor the level of some of the known cytokines (specific
      proteins in the blood) before and after radiation, and in meantime to screen unknown proteins
      in patients' blood before and after radiation therapy. Hopefully, this will provide some
      clues for future study of monitoring radiation damage, and possibly new therapeutic approach
      for patients with GBM.
