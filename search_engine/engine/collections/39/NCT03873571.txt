      IDA unless there is a concurrent inflammatory condition. The lower threshold value for
      hemoglobin (Hb) in pregnant women is <11 g/dL during the 1st and 3rd trimesters, and <10.5
      g/dL during the 2nd trimester. In postpartum period a Hb concentration <10 g/dL indicates
      clinically significant anemia.

      Oral iron therapy is given as the first-line treatment for IDA. There are several direct and
      indirect methods to assess adherence to medications, each method has advantages and limits.
      Many studies have shown that pill counting is more accurate than self-reported adherence.We
      will investigate the adherence to iron supplementation in pregnant women by using a
      self-reported adherence questionnaire named SMAQ (Simplified Medication Adherence
      Questionnaire)

      Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ) Knobel H; Juega J; Carmona A; Kindelan
      JM; Ruiz I; Gonzalez J; Collazos J; Casado JL; Alonso J; Ocampo A SMAQ is used to assess
      non-adherent patients. The six-item SMAQ has been developed to assess adherence in
      HIV-infected patients, and may be applied in most clinical settings.
