    
      In Part A, MK-4166 doses will be escalated quickly in successive cohorts and based on safety
      events may progress to Part B, in which the preliminary MTD will be identified. Based on
      safety events the study may progress to Part C in which the MTD will be confirmed. In Part D,
      participants will receive escalating doses of MK-4166 plus a fixed dose of pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) 200 mg to determine the MTD for MK-4166 in combination with pembrolizumab. Based on
      safety events in Part D, the study may progress to Part E in which the MTD for MK-4166 in
      combination with pembrolizumab will be confirmed.

      With Amendments 05/06, the dose confirmation Part C will be removed and the dose confirmation
      Part E (combination of MK-4166 and pembrolizumab) will be limited to participants with
      advanced malignant melanoma.
