      recruited in this study. All participants were randomized into experimental and control
      groups through block randomization. After randomization, the participants in control group
      received routine care and the others in experimental group received Narrative Enhancement and
      Cognitive Therapy(NECT) which contains 20 times group meetings. The research tools include
      demographic data, the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Scale (ISMIS), the Discrimination
      and Stigma Scale (DISC), Rosenberg self-Esteem scale (RSES), Beck Depression Inventory
      (BDI-II) and Herth Hope Index (HHI). The questionnaires were collected for three times,
      including before the intervention, 12 weeks after intervention, and after the end of
      intervention. The collected data were analyzed by IBM SPSS 24.0 statistical software. The
      descriptive statistics include mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, frequency
      distribution, and percentages; the Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to
      explore the effect of Narrative Enhancement and Cognitive Therapy on self-stigma,
      self-esteem, depressive symptoms and hope in patients with schizophrenia after controlling
      demographic data.
