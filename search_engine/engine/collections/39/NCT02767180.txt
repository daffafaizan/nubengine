      symptoms and difficulties in all areas of everyday life. The interviews were recorded,
      transcribed, and the issues were categorized into 13 hypothesised domains.All issues were
      then rephrased into questions, with care taken to maintain only one issue per question, and
      adequate scales for frequency, intensity and duration was used. The time frame is usually the
      last month. This intensive care specific questionnaire for patient reported outcome measures
      (PROM) after critical care will be tested in a study of 650 patients recruited six months to
      three years after discharge from the ICU, and 150 controls who have not been critically ill,
      matched for age and sex. The questionnaire is sent by mail after an invitation letter
      followed by a phone call and returned in a pre-stamped envelope. It is then scanned and data
      imported digitally. Medical data from the ICU-stay can be added. Further analyses after
      comparison with the control population and item reduction will follow.
