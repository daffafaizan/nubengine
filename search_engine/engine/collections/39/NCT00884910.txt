      indwelling voice prosthesis that has been on the market since 1997. Recently a new Provox
      voice prosthesis has been developed, the Provox Vega. This prosthesis is available in 3
      different outer diameters. In this study the device with an outer diameter of 22.5 French is
      tested. The Provox Vega 22.5 is the successor of the Provox2 voice prosthesis. Both
      prostheses have an outer diameter of 22.5 French.

      Outcomes were recorded by means of patient questionnaires and device life.

      It is expected that some patients will like the new device (Provox Vega 22.5) better than the
      old one (Provox2) because the airflow resistance for speaking of the new prosthesis is lower
      when measured in a laboratory.
