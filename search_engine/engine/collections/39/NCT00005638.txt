        -  Determine the dose limiting toxicity of irinotecan when given weekly with cisplatin and
           concurrent external beam multifield radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced
           carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of irinotecan in
           this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the complete response rate in these patients to one course of induction
           chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy with cisplatin IV over 30 minutes followed by
      irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Following 2 weeks of rest, patients
      begin chemoradiation. Patients receive cisplatin and irinotecan as above on days 1, 8, 22,
      and 29 and radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
