      disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Together with psychosis and other behavioral
      abnormalities they contribute to the stress, anxiety and cognitive decline of patients,
      caregiver burnout and depression, as well as health care provider frustration. The mechanisms
      of the sleep disturbances in these conditions are still poorly understood and no rational or
      effective treatments have been proposed. Recent data from a study of ramelteon in the elderly
      showed a striking ability of this compound to improve quality of sleep disturbances in
      Parkinson's disease.

      Objectives of this study are:

        -  To examine the effects of ramelteon on the quality of sleep using sleep evaluation
           instruments (SDQ-Sleep Disorder Questionnaire and Neuropsychiatric Inventory with
           Caregiver Distress (NPI-D) Sleep Behavior Subscale administered to the patient and/or
           their bed partner.

        -  To examine the effects of ramelteon on daytime sleepiness and memory using Epworth
           Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT).

        -  To examine the effects of ramelteon on the sleep/wake cycle and day/night activity
           patterns over a prolonged period of time (1 week) using a motion logger (continuous
           motor activity recording device) and computerized data analysis.

        -  To examine the effects of ramelteon on sleep architecture in a sample of patients with
           confirmed sleep disturbance, before and after ramelteon treatment by using
           polysomnography.
