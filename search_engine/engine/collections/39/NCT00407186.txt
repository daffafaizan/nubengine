      most patients in the Western world present with advanced stages long term survival is found
      in about 25%, with local recurrences as part of treatment failure in up to 80% of cases.
      Studies examining the role of more extended lymph node dissections (D1 vs. D2), adjuvant
      radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy did not result in a clinical relevant improvement of
      survival. In 2001 results of a South West Oncology group (SWOG) trial that randomized between
      surgery and surgery with chemoradiotherapy were published. This trial, that was hampered by
      suboptimal surgery (less than D1 in majority of patients) and radiotherapy (2D radiotherapy;
      35% protocol deviations) showed an absolute increase in median survival of 9 months. More
      recently results of the MAGIC study, which randomized between surgery and surgery plus 6
      perioperative courses of ECF chemotherapy, were presented. This regimen resulted in an
      absolute 5-year survival benefit of 13% and in a 10% higher resectability rate.

      This phase III prospectively randomized study investigates whether chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy
      in 5 weeks with daily cisplatin and capecitabine) after preoperative chemotherapy (3x ECC
      (epirubicin, cisplatin, capecitabine)) and adequate (D1+) surgery leads to improved survival
      in comparison with postoperative chemotherapy (3x ECC). Furthermore, toxicity of both
      treatment regimens will be explored.
