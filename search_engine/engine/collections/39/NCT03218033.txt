      adolescents and young adults with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Non-adherence with
      medications in patients with systemic lupus has been noted to be as poor as 40%. Success in
      disease control can be significantly impacted by such non-adherence. Poor medication
      compliance is associated with higher SLE disease activity scores and higher SLE disease
      activity in turn has been demonstrated to be significantly associated with a decline in
      quality of life. Much attention has been paid to how to improve self-management skills in
      adults, but less is known about how to target adolescents, an age group with a complex set of
      emotional and developmental needs.

      The goal of this study was to examine the effect of an online educational program with and
      without a social media experience.The primary goal of this study was to determine whether
      medication adherence would be improved by having adolescents and young adults with SLE
      participate in an online educational website, with or without a social media experience. The
      secondary goal was to determine whether secondary outcomes such as quality of life, stress,
      and self-efficacy improved in this model, and whether these changes were associated with
      improvements in medication management.
