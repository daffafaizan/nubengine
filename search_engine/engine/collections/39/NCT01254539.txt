      due to the continued loss of motoneurons that leads them to death in less than 5 years. No
      treatment has changed its natural history. Intraspinal injections of bone marrow mononuclear
      cells (MNC) have been able to ameliorate the course of ALS in murine models, acting as pumps
      of trophic factors that keep the motoneurons functional. Moreover, the clinical trial (Study
      NCT00855400 on www.ClinicalTrials.gov) conducted by our research group to determine the
      safety and efficacy of Autologous Stem Cell transplantation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
      in humans, found that this procedure is feasible and safe. Continuing with that study, we
      have designed a phase I/II clinical trial to check the feasibility of the intraspinal and
      intrathecal infusion of autologous bone marrow stem cells.
