      age-related cataract and/or myopia), were consecutively included from April to May 2019. All
      participants underwent visual acuity, dry and wet refraction, anterior and posterior segment
      examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), and axial length (AL) using IOL-Master 700 (Carl
      Zeiss Meditec AG). Investigators recruited children under 18 years old at a refraction
      outpatient clinic, who were prescribed cyclopentolate hydrochloride eyedrops (S.A.
      Alcon-Couvreur N.V., Belguim) for cycloplegic refraction. For adults, they were prescribed
      compound tropicamide eyedrops (Mydrin-P, Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan),
      consisting of 0.5% tropicamide mixed with 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride, for pupillary
      dilation in order to perform fundus examination at an outpatient clinic. Exclusion criteria
      were as follow:ocular diseases other than cataracts; history of eye surgeries or injuries;
      shallow anterior chamber with a risk of angle closure. The data from right eye was selected
      for analysis.
