      IGC-AD1 in subjects with AD. Twelve subjects will be enrolled. Three different ascending
      doses of the study product will be given: low, medium and high doses. Each dose will be given
      for 2 weeks, followed by a washout period of 4 days. Given the vulnerability of the
      population, a safety cohort of 3 patients (2 active, 1 placebo) will start every dose one day
      ahead of the rest of the patients and will be followed for 24 hours for the development of
      Adverse Events (AEs). Objective criteria will be set after the safety cohort is evaluated.
