      be assessed in five municipalities of Paraná State - Maringá, Foz de Iguaçu, Londrina,
      Sarandi and Paranaguá. Any health service located in each of the five municipalities may
      report a suspected dengue case. However, in all five municipalities, there is a large public
      emergency service, the UPA. There are currently three UPA in Londrina, two in Maringá and Foz
      do Iguaҫu and one each in Paranaguá and Sarandi. These facilities are responsible for
      reporting the majority of suspected dengue cases. In Londrina and Maringá, the private health
      sector also provides emergency care. The implementation of the study protocol adds a
      collection of a blood sample for PCR to the existing protocol for addressing suspected dengue
      cases among individuals within the target vaccination age groups.

      The study will count on the activities already carried out by teams of epidemiological
      surveillance of dengue intensifying the identification of the serotype through the laboratory
      method RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) in real time. In addition,
      the investigators will identify hospitals and health units that attend dengue cases for
      sample collection, to perform real-time RT-PCR and initial processing of the blood samples
      collected from the controls.
