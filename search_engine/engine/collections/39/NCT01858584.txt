      population of infants within one year of life, suffering from gastroesophageal reflux (GER)
      the effectiveness of magnesium alginate. The clinical improvement of the patient will be
      evaluated based on the negativity of the symptom score (4.3.1), assessed using a validated
      questionnaire on symptoms of GER (I-GERQ Annex A).

      Secondary outcomes To compare the efficacy of Magnesium Alginate on GER in infants compared
      with those of thickened feeding and reassurance, basing on questionnaire results.
