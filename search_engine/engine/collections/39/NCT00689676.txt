      problems, including learning difficulties, attention deficits and hyperactivity, as well as
      neuromotor deficits. Moreover, they are reported to have a high risk of speech and language
      impairments up to school age, even in cases where major neurological abnormalities are
      excluded. Impairments have been reported both in receptive and expressive language and, more
      specifically, in morphosyntax and naming.
