      553 patients with claudication at 50 sites in Canada and the United States. The mean (±SD)
      patient age was 67±10 years; 72% were males. The duration of claudication was 6.0±6.1 years
      at entry; 91% had a history of smoking and 34% were current smokers; 36.5% had diabetes.
      Resting ABI was 0.59+0.14; baseline ICD was 132±104 and ACD 307±209 meters. Results showed
      that there was no increase in ACD or ICD at 26 weeks with immune modulation therapy (IMT
      using the Celacade™ system, Vasogen Inc.) compared to placebo and no measurable improvement
      in quality of life with IMT compared to placebo. However, there was a significant decrease in
      CRP (high sensitivity assay) in) in the IMT group compared to the placebo group. Conclusion:
      Immune modulation therapy did not improve walking distance in patients with symptomatic
      peripheral arterial disease but the decrease in CRP suggests a biologic effect of IMT and
      will warrant further study.
