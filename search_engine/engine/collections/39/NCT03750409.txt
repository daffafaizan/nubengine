      parts of the brain] plays an important role in dementia. Infrared and near infrared light
      frequency has been shown to increase the activity of brain cells and provide support for the
      cell's ability to repair and protect themselves against further damage. This study will
      evaluate the effects of repeated brief exposure to near infrared light stimulation twice a
      day on subjects that have problems such as attention span, working memory, strategies of
      learning and remembering, planning, organizing, self-monitoring, inhibition and flexible
      thinking for an 8 week period.
