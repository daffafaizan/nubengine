      delivery of speech treatment services to remote delivery via telepractice. This study will
      compare the efficacy of visual-acoustic biofeedback treatment versus non-biofeedback
      treatment in this setting. Specifically, participants will receive both visual-acoustic
      biofeedback treatment and non-biofeedback treatment via telepractice (Zoom call with
      screen-sharing) in a single-case randomization design. The hypothesis of interest is that
      sessions featuring visual-acoustic biofeedback will be associated with larger short-term
      gains than sessions featuring non-biofeedback treatment. To test this hypothesis, the study
      team will recruit up to 8 participants who will receive an initial treatment orientation
      followed by an equal dose of both types of treatment (10 sessions of visual-acoustic
      biofeedback and 10 sessions of non-biofeedback treatment). Participants will complete
      approximately two sessions per week via telepractice; each week will feature one session of
      each type, randomly ordered. They will also complete 4 pre-treatment baseline sessions and 3
      post-treatment maintenance sessions to evaluate the overall magnitude of change over the
      course of treatment.
