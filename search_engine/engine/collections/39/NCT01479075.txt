      has an effect on the hepatic glucose production, lipid metabolism in the mouse model.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether central insulin influences the human
      peripheral insulin sensitivity of liver and muscle and energy metabolism. Intranasal insulin
      can be used in humans to deliver insulin to the brain and studies have shown that intranasal
      insulin might reduce food intake, lower body weight and modulate muscle glucose and adipose
      tissue lipid metabolism in himans. These effects are likely mediated by the vagus nerve as
      skeletal muscle insulin sensitization after intranasal insulin relates to parasympathetic
      tone activity (Heni et al. Diabetes 2014). Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation
      (taVNS) activates non-invasively the sensory branches of the vagus nerve and is applied in
      humans as adjuvant treatment in drug-resistant epilepsy (Frangos et al. 2015). Thereby it can
      be used to examine whether the vagus nerve indeed mediates brain insulin signals to the
      periphery.

      Here we aim to investigate the effects of intranasal insulin on hepatic glucose, lipid and
      energy metabolism. We further aim to test whether taVNS can mimick intranasal insulin effects
      on peripheral metabolism in humans.
