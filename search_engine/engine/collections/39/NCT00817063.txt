      dermatologists. CHE leads to considerable work-absenteeism, disability and exclusion from
      labour market. Conventional treatments, including highly potent topical steroids, yield often
      unsatisfactory results. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of oral alitretinoin,
      a retinoid, in patients who have not responded to avoidance of causative factors, such as
      contact allergens and skin irritants, non-medicated skin care and highly potent topical
      steroids. Eligible patients are randomly assigned to receive alitretinoin or a placebo.
