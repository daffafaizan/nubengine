      somatosensory stimulation (MP+SS) and somatosensory stimulation alone (SS) may be associated
      with functional changes that are greater than those associated with skill-based training
      alone (MP). These studies are significant in that they advance the field of rehabilitation
      science as it relates to the goal of improving skilled hand use in individuals with SCI;
      there are few goals that have more important implications for function, independence and
      quality of life in these individuals.
