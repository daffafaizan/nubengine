      has received an increasing amount of attention in the past few years (1, 2). Opioids, despite
      their side effects, are still the main cornerstone in managing acute postoperative pain (3).
      Preemptive analgesia refers to the administration of effective analgesia prior to surgical
      trauma. The main mechanism of preemptive analgesia is desensitization of the central nervous
      system and prevention of pain before its onset. (3). Non-opioid preemptive analgesics are
      commonly used to increase analgesic efficacy and patient satisfaction as well as to reduce
      opioid consumption and side effects. Saddle anesthesia is a selective spinal anesthesia that
      is commonly used for perianal surgeries (4-7).

      Investigators previously performed a prospective up-down sequential allocation study to
      evaluate the minimum effective dose of hyperbaric bupivacaine that is needed for inducing a
      satisfactory and reliable saddle block for perianal surgeries that was restricted to the most
      caudal spinal nerve roots (S4-coccygeal) that supply the perianal region (8). Although the
      block produced no motor block in the lower limbs (thus allowing early ambulation), rapid
      sensory recovery resulted in early request of analgesia and increased opioid consumption. In
      this prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial,
      Investigators hypothesize that a single dose of IM diclofenac administered before spinal
      anesthesia, will decrease postoperative pain, and delay and reduce postoperative analgesic
      requirement in patients undergoing minor perianal surgeries under minimal effective-dose
      bupivacaine saddle block
