    
      Current module of the study will consist of 2 cohorts as follows:

      Cohort A (Advanced Solid Tumours [AST]): A total of ~25 molecularly eligible and centrally
      confirmed participants will be enrolled into this cohort (ensuring at least 60% of
      participants with ATM Immunohistochemistry [IHC] ≤ 5%).

      Cohort B (Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]): A total of ~27
      molecularly eligible and centrally confirmed participants will be enrolled into Cohort B
      (ensuring at least 60% of participants with ATM IHC ≤ 5%). Unfavourable circulating tumour
      cells (CTC) count requirement may be introduced for all participants to ensure an adequate
      (approximately ≥ 50%) number of participants with CTC count ≥ 5/7.5 mL blood.

      The screening will have 2 parts, Part 1 and Part 2, which apply for both Cohort A and Cohort
      B.
