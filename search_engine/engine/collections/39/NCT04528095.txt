    
      This trial is a sequential multiple-assignment RCT design of antipsychotic drugs, planning to
      recruit 162 people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia followed for 12 months. The study
      includes three treatment phases and a naturalistic follow-up phase. Participants who meet the
      response criteria remain on that treatment for the duration of 12-month treatment. If the
      participants fail the treatment or can't tolerant the side effects, the patient moves to the
      next phase of the study to receive a new treatment.
