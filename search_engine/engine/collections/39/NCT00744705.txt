      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness is crucial in detecting early glaucomatous changes, its
      normal range is also important. Even though the normal range of RNFL thickness might be
      different according to race, the recently developed imaging device such as the Cirrus HD OCT
      includes only the Caucasian data. In the present study, we want to measure the RNFL thickness
      using the Cirrus HD OCT in normal Asian eyes and to determine its normal range in Asians.
