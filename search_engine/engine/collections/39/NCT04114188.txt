      completers accounting for drop-outs and non-compliances with the protocol. If up to 27 out of
      the 68 completers experience efficacy failure, a progression into a larger trial will be
      considered justifiable. If the number of patients experiencing efficacy failure is between 28
      and 34 out of 68, the merits of a larger non-inferiority design will be considered depending
      on the risk/benefit assessment. If more than 34 out of the 68 completers experience efficacy
      failure, a progression into a larger trial would be considered unjustifiable. 1st kidney
      transplant recipients (low risk: PRA/cPRA < 20%, no DSA) will receive short rATG induction
      (2x1.5 mg/kg) given perioperatively and on first postoperative day. All patients will receive
      one shot Infliximab mAb at day 2. Since POD1, maintenance IS consists of Tac and tapered
      steroids therapy. All patients will be followed up for one year.

      At the POD 0 the first rATG dose (1.5mg/kg) will be given according to the local practice and
      Methyprednisolon 500mg will be given before reperfusion. At the POD 1 patients will receive
      methylprednisolon 500mg i.v. followed by second rATG dose (1.5mg/kg). Infliximab 5mg/kg b.w.
      will be given in slow infusion on POD2. Tacrolimus will be given the first dose before
      surgery at dose 0.1 mg/kg and next from POD1 at 0.2mg/kg/day and doses adjusted according to
      blood trough levels (10-15 ng/mL, POD1-POD13, 5-8ng/mL POD 14-90, 4-6ng/mL POD >90. Prednison
      (or appropriate dose of methylprednisolone) will be initiated POD 2 at a dose of 20mg/day and
      slowly tapered down to 5 mg at the POD 7 (POD2: 20mg, POD3: 15mg, POD4-5: 10mg, POD6-7:
      7,5mg, > POD7: 5mg).
