    
      1. Primary Endpoints Target lesion revascularization after one year

        2. Secondary Endpoints Secondary endpoints be evaluated in terms of safety and efficacy.

      2-1 Safety

        1. Major complications associated with procedure (death, QMI, CABG)

        2. Major complications at follow-up (within 9 months) (death, QMI, CABG)

        3. Target vessel revascularization (TVR) performed within 9 months 2-2 Efficacy
