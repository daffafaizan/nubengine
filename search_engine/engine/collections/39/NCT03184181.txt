    
      Eccentric exercises of the supraspinatus muscle were performed in 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
      Participants were asked to perform the exercise program on an individual basis twice every
      day for 4 weeks. The eccentric program consisted of 3 exercises, focusing on the
      supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and scapular muscles. Participants were asked to do a normal
      abduction (concentric phase) and a slow return to the initial position (eccentric phase)
      included first the concentric phase, and the eccentric phase was slowly conducted. The
      exercise program was taught by a physiotherapist in the first session and monitored in the
      subsequent sessions.
