    
      The proposed study is a two by two factorial, randomized controlled intervention trial.
      Following informed written consent of eligible subject's blood and urine samples will be
      taken for measurements of vitamin D, markers of bone turnover and related biochemical
      variables. Patients who have evidence of vitamin D deficiency will then be randomly assigned
      to receive daily vitamin D(3) (2000 IU), calcium (1000 mg), both, or a placebo for 6 months.
      All subjects will have a calcium and vitamin D rich food and other lifestyle modification
      advises during the study period. Patients will otherwise be managed according to standard
      practice. Clinical assessment that includes general and self-rated health, bone density,
      muscle strength, physical activity and dietary intakes will be performed at baseline, and
      repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months post-randomisation.

      Information on other important variables likely to influence vitamin D status including age,
      reproductive & menopausal history, smoking, medications, adiposity, exposure to sunlight,
      dietary intake including supplements, skin pigmentation, chronic illness and medications will
      be collected and adjusted for during the analysis
