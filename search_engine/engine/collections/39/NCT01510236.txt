      of life than a healthy reference group from eighteen months up to four years after diagnosis.
      However, a significant minority of adolescents struck by cancer reports a clinically relevant
      level of emotional distress from shortly after diagnosis up to four years after diagnosis.
      The provided self-help program is designed to promote psychological health.

      150 adolescents recently diagnosed with cancer will be randomized to either of two
      conditions: (1) Early program and (2) Later program. In both conditions an internet-based
      self-help program is provided. Adolescents randomized to Early program start the program
      directly after randomization i.e. 4 weeks after diagnosis whereas adolescents randomized to
      Later program start the program sixty-two weeks after diagnosis. The larger part of data are
      collected at seven assessments, Observations 1-7. Observation 1 takes place 4 weeks after
      diagnosis (DI); Observation 2: 28 weeks after DI; Observation 3: 38 weeks after DI;
      Observation 4: 62 weeks after DI; Observation 5: 86 weeks after DI; Observation 6: 96 weeks
      after DI and Observation 7: 120 weeks after DI. The main research question is to investigate
      whether the program is superior to standard care in preventing development and maintenance of
      anxiety and depression at 38 weeks after diagnosis among adolescents with cancer.
