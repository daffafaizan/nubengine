      supported by venovenous or venoarterial ECMO in a multicenter registry.

      The secondary objectives are to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients who have
      received ECMO support, to identify the risk factors associated with hospital mortality, to
      analyze the outcomes after ECMO weaning including survival at day 28 and day 90, and to
      analyze the utility of a circulatory support mobile unit in a severe pandemic

      Inclusions are both prospective and retrospective in order to collect data over the whole
      pandemic
