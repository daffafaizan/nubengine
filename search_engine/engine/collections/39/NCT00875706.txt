      The study explored the feasibility of an educational intervention to strengthen
      workplace-learning systems in four VA Community Living Centers (CLCs).

      Objectives:

      Specific aims were to 1) conduct a feasibility study to assess whether the educational
      intervention is practical to implement as designed and 2) conduct a pilot study to validate
      the methodology proposed for assessing outcomes of this educational intervention.

      Methods:

      A multi-level intervention targeting the translation of workplace learning into practice was
      implemented. The Direct Care Worker (DCW) intervention targeted both clinical knowledge and
      effective communication. The Coaching Supervision training addressed management and
      supervision practices for nurses, combined with effective communication. Four CLCs received
      both interventions, administered by the Paraprofessional Health Institute (PHI), using a
      train-the-trainer approach over the course of four 3-day sessions. Quantitative and
      qualitative data were collected to assess factors influencing effectiveness of implementation
      and to understand the impact of the trainings on participants.

      Status:

      The study has been completed with educational interventions implemented and qualitative and
      quantitative data collected.
