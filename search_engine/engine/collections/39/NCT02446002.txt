    
      Subjects will be confined to an inpatient facility for a total of 14 nights and 15 days.
      Subjects who successfully complete screening will report to the inpatient facility (Day -1).
      At Day 1 all subjects will receive the first single, oral dose of 0.4 mg lofexidine HCl (two
      0.2 mg tablets) dosed with 240 mL of water (no food). The lofexidine dose will be followed by
      a 74-hour interval before beginning naltrexone daily dosing on Day 4 .The first naltrexone
      administration on Day 4 will be at a dose of approximately 25 mg QD, with subsequent doses on
      Days 5 to 13 at 50 mg QD. On Day 11, the second single dose of lofexidine (0.4 mg) will be
      administered and followed by the daily administration of the naltrexone dose (50 mg). The
      daily administration of naltrexone dose (50 mg) will continue on Day 12 and Day 13.After each
      administration of lofexidine on Day 1 and Day 11, fingerstick blood samples will be collected
      for lofexidine pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis before dosing and after dosing at multiple time
      points.Safety will be assessed by recording adverse events (AEs), measuring vital signs
      (blood pressure and pulse rate) and clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and
      urinalysis), recording 12-lead safety and Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs), and performing
      physical exams.
