      Primary

        -  Determine the median progression-free survival, in terms of stable disease, of patients
           with newly diagnosed or recurrent/refractory angiosarcoma treated with bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the treatment effect of bevacizumab on the objective response rate as assessed
           by modified RECIST criteria in patients with angiosarcoma.

        -  Evaluate the duration of response.

        -  Assess the treatment effect of bevacizumab on duration of overall survival.

        -  Explore the objective response by target tumor density changes on CT scan.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab in patients with angiosarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 to 4 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31 patients will be accrued for this study.
