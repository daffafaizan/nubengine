      genetic, environmental and immunological factors. From a clinical stand point, there is great
      interest in determining if manipulation of the gut microbiota may be a viable therapeutic
      strategy in IBD patients. One such strategy involves the use of prebiotic. Prebiotics are
      oligosaccharides that cannot be enzymatically hydrolyzed in the small intestine, however
      serve as substrates for fermentation by commensal bacteria in the colon.

      Investigators propose to evaluate the modulatory effects of the prebiotic inulin on the
      composition and function of the microbiota of children with IBD and determine the efficacy of
      this dietary intervention in reducing disease activity.
