    
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, single arm, multicenter, safety and dose finding study of
      DTX301 in adults with late-onset OTC deficiency. The primary objective of the study is to
      determine the safety of single IV doses of DTX301.

      Eligible subjects will receive a single IV infusion of DTX301. Dose escalation will be
      conducted according to a model that uses the collected data to predict the safety profile of
      the dose in order to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD). The decision to proceed to
      the next dose cohort will be made after the data monitoring committee (DMC) has evaluated the
      safety data for all subjects in a dosing cohort.

      Subjects will be followed for 52 weeks after dosing. After completion of this study, subjects
      will be asked to enroll in a 4-year extension study to evaluate the long term (a total of 5
      years) safety and efficacy of DTX301.

      This study was previously posted by Dimension Therapeutics, which has been acquired by
      Ultragenyx.
