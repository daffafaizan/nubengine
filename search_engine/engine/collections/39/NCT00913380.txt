      an established first-line diagnostic test in patients suspected of having acute appendicitis.
      Since many individuals suspected of having acute appendicitis are young, with a mean age of
      30 years, CT radiation is of particular concern.

      The estimated lifetime attributable risk of death from cancer due to the radiation exposure
      of a single abdomen CT study is 2-7/10,000 for average adults ranging 20-40 years in age.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low-dose CT is not inferior to
      standard-dose CT in the negative appendectomy rate.
