      identified potential biomarkers for MDD using resting state imaging. Second, investigators
      will conduct an exploratory, whole brain analysis combining EEG and imaging techniques to
      identify new potential biomarkers for MDD and treatment response as participants complete a
      course of TMS treatment. It is the hope to shed new light on the mechanisms underlying
      depression and relapse, which may allow for a more effective, personalized selection of
      treatment course.

      Participants will complete initial screening and baseline evaluation, along with
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
      and electroencephalography (EEG) scans prior to the initial TMS treatment. Participants will
      complete 30-36 TMS sessions and a post-treatment evaluation, along with mid- and
      post-treatment fMRI, DTI and EEG scans.

      It is anticipated that participants with MDD have a specific set of neural features that can
      classify with high precision patients with MDD from those who do not, and that align with
      clinical diagnoses. This set of neural features will change across the course of treatment.
      Further, investigators expect that improvement as rated by a common MDD measure is modulated
      by time of treatment.
