      idealized fitness lifestyle. The lifestyle is characterized by selective and restrictive
      eating behavior, strength training and use of supplements. The athletes emphasize the value
      of staying lean, muscular and defined, and motivates and inspires followers through social
      media. This study will recruit and observe a group of competitive female fitness athletes
      over their typical 3 month dieting period when preparing for contest. Before their contest
      diet is initiated, the athletes will be screened on selected aspects of psychological and
      physical health. The screening is repeated two weeks prior to their first seasonal contest,
      and then finally one month post-contest season. During the diet period of 3 months, the
      athletes answers brief questionnaires by email on eating- and training behavior and on mood,
      while also reporting dietary intake by telephone interview.

      Recreational physically females, not planning to do any fitness contest, will be recruited to
      serve as a parallel control group. They will perform the same physical and psychological
      screening, and answer the same questionnaires throughout the fitness contest diet period.
