      inflammatory diseases with remissions and exacerbations. CD and UC are associated with a
      variety of systemic (extra-intestinal) manifestations. In some studies, clinical and
      subclinical pulmonary abnormalities are described in active IBD as well as in the stable
      situation.

      Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator of inflammation in several pathological
      conditions.Patients with lung diseases, like asthma, have higher levels of the Fraction of
      exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) in active disease in comparison with healthy volunteers. One
      study in adult IBD patients showed increase in FeNO levels in those patients, with positive
      correlation with the disease activity and negative correlation between the disease activity
      and pulmonary functions.

      We hypothesised that respiratory tract inflammation as expressed by FeNO and spirometry in
      pediatric IBD patients will correlate to the activity of the primary disease.

      Methods: FeNO levels and spirometry will be assess for 40 patients with CD or UC (age 4-18
      years) during remissions and exacerbations, calculated by the Pediatrics Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index (PCDAI) and the Pediatrics Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI),
      respectively.

      Two aged matched groups, the first of healthy children and the second of chronic abdominal
      pain will serve a controls.
