      related to oral health of tooth whitening techniques in young individuals. It will be a
      randomized, parallel and single blind. Participants are divided into three groups (n = 30)
      according to bleaching technique to be performed (G1 = Office / hydrogen peroxide 6%; G2 =
      Office / hydrogen peroxide 15%; G3 = Home / carbamide peroxide 10%). The color of the teeth
      will be evaluated in seven different times, using the color scale Vita Master Classic 3D and
      spectrophotometer Vita Easy Shade Advance. IGM (1986) - the presence of tooth sensitivity by
      visual analogue scale and gingival security through modified gingival index will be
      evaluated. The impact of bleaching quality of life will be assessed using the Brazilian
      version of the oral impact on daily performance (OIDP). The instrument will be applied in
      interview form at two different times at baseline (T0) and thirty days after the first
      evaluation (T4). Statistical analysis include descriptive analysis and testing to compare the
      two bleaching techniques as the color change, sensitivity, gum irritation and impact on
      quality of life.
