      NSSI. Assessments will take place over the course of three years, with three visits per year
      - a total of nine visits.

      The first visit will take place at the Ambulatory Research Center (ARC) at the Fairview
      Riverside hospital complex. This visit will include a number of questionnaires designed to
      gather information about the participant's physical and psychological health. Additionally,
      measures of intelligence quotient (IQ) and demographics will be assessed.

      The second visit will again take place at the ARC. For this visit, participants will be asked
      to partake in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) in which they prepare a short, five-minute
      speech and deliver the speech to an audience with an additional task to follow. The TSST will
      be videotaped. Following the completion of this task, the participant will complete computer
      tests in order to measure things like attention and memory. During the second visit, five
      saliva samples will be collected to measure levels of the hormone Cortisol. The participant
      will need to collect additional saliva samples at home.

      The third visit will take place at the University of Minnesota Center for Magnetic Resonance
      Research (CMRR) and will involve a brain MRI. Before the MRI the participant will be asked to
      provide a urine sample and complete a drug and pregnancy test. During the MRI, the
      participant will be asked to lie quietly in the scanner. The participant will do activities
      such as resting, listening to music, and playing games using a button box while in the
      scanner.

      The participant will need to come in to complete these assessments twice more at one and two
      years following the completion of the first set of visits - a total of nine visits overall.
