      neurodegenerative disorder, with a high cancer risk, that also affects the immune and
      respiratory system. Therapy for A-T is restricted to symptomatic treatment including
      rehabilitation care, combined with infection prevention and treatment, and screening for
      pulmonary dysfunction and malignancies. A-T is caused by mutations in the ATM gene. The ATM
      protein plays a pivotal role in more than 100 different biochemical processes, among which
      cellular energy metabolism, cell signaling, and DNA repair. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      (NAD+) is an essential molecule in many of these processes and studies have shown that NAD+
      deficiency plays a role in disease mechanisms underlying DNA repair disorders such as A-T.
      NAD+ is available in food, but can also be synthesized in the body from its precursors
      nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide riboside (NR), as a group called "vitamin B3".
      Treatment of experimental A-T animal models with NR showed beneficial effects. The aim of
      this study is to investigate whether treatment with NR during a period of six months may have
      positive effects on the disease course of patients with A-T.

      Objective: To investigate the effects of NR on the disease course of patients with ataxia
      telangiectasia.

      Study design: Single center, interventional, explorative, open-label proof of concept study.

      Study population: Patients with A-T (age >2 years).

      Intervention (if applicable): Patients will be treated with nicotinamide riboside
      (25mg/kg/day), during four consecutive months, followed by a washout period of two months.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Ataxia, dysarthria, quality of life, laboratory parameters.
