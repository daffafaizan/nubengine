      finding better chemotherapeutic options for recurrent ovarian cancer using individual
      patients' gene-expression signatures of chemosensitivity. The utility of the COXEN technique
      has been validated and found to accurately predict 1) the chemosensitivity of an independent
      panel of 40 bladder cancer cell lines; 2) activity of each of the >45K candidate compounds in
      the NCI-60 drug screening database, which resulted in the identification of a
      highly-effective novel compound for bladder cancer and patients' responses and survival on 12
      historical clinical trials of combination chemotherapy. In particular, the GEMs of breast
      cancer can be used to stratify both clinical response and overall patient survival with a
      striking difference between the predicted responders vs. predicted non-responders in 5
      independent chemotherapeutic trials of breast cancer. The next step is to test the prediction
      model in recurrent ovarian cancer.
