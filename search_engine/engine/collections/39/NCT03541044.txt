    
      This study will be a single center, randomized, open label, single dose, two-way crossover in
      healthy smokers that smoke their first cigarette more than 30 minutes of waking. This study
      will consist of following Visits: Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Study Period 1), followed by
      a Washout period and Visit 3 (Study Period 2). Each participant will be treated with a single
      dose of the two study treatments (test and reference) in a randomized sequence. Participants
      will be confined in the study facility for approximately 60 hours during each study session
      (for 36 hours pre-dosing and for 24 hours post dosing) during which pharmacokinetic (PK)
      blood samples will be obtained. Participants are to abstain from smoking during the
      confinement periods and be subject to random measurements of expired carbon monoxide (CO) to
      confirm abstinence. The CO levels must be â‰¤10 parts per million (ppm) throughout the study
      session. There will be at least 5-day and not more than 7-day clinical furlough period
      between treatment periods. For each treatment period, the clinical confinement period with
      restriction of smoking is at least 36 hours prior to dosing.
