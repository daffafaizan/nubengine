      aggressive leukemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma not responding to standard chemotherapy
      treatment. The drugs being used in this study include drugs frequently used in treating such
      diseases (mitoxantrone and etoposide) as well as a newer drug that has also been shown to be
      effective (topotecan).
