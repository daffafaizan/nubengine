      necessary in high doses, and may be associated with significant side effects. Such side
      effects may include urinary retention, altered mental status, depressed respiratory drive,
      and constipation, and may lead to reduced nutritional intake in the postoperative period.
      Importantly, post-operative nutrition may impact the incidence of complications following
      spine surgery.1 Alvimopan is a peripheral-acting opiate antagonist designed to decrease the
      gastrointestinal complications of perioperative systemic opioid administration.

      Pain control following major spine surgery is difficult to achieve. Opiates are often
      necessary in high doses, and may be associated with significant side effects including
      constipation. Alvimopan is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is
      used to help the bowel recover more quickly in patients who are having bowel surgery, so that
      they can eat solid foods and have regular bowel movements. Alvimopan is in a class of
      medications called peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists. It works by protecting
      the bowel from the constipation effects of opioid (narcotic) medications that are used to
      treat pain after surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of alvimopan in major spine surgery
      reduces the time to first bowel movement. By assessing the use of alvimopan in reconstructive
      spinal surgery patients, researchers hope to give the scientific community insight into the
      broader use of this drug in other surgical populations, as well as gathering information on
      the impact of hospital charges and overall post-operative patient satisfaction.
