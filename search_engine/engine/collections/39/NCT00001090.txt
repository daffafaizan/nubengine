      recipients in some protocols. Depending on the HIV-1 gene products expressed by the
      particular ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccine, volunteers have generated anti-Envelope (vCP125,
      vCP205, and vCP300), anti-Gag (vCP205 and vCP300), and anti-Nef (vCP300) CTL activity.
      Although 3 to 4 immunizations with the different ALVAC-HIV experimental vaccines induce
      anti-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies in a portion, often the majority, of volunteers, the
      geometric mean titers of these antibodies are modest, usually less than 50. This study will
      determine whether there is an increase in the anti-HIV antibody titers when GM-CSF is used as
      an adjuvant with ALVAC-HIV vCP205 and will also examine the kinetics and magnitude of the
      HIV-specific CTL response.

      In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study volunteers receive ALVAC-HIV
      vCP205 at 10^6.3 TCID50 or placebo and GM-CSF or placebo by intramuscular injection at Months
      0, 1, 3, and 6 as follows:

      Group A: vCP205 plus GM-CSF placebo (10 volunteers) Group B: vCP205 plus 80 microg GM-CSF (10
      volunteers) Group C: vCP205 plus 250 microg GM-CSF (10 volunteers) Group D: vcP205 placebo
      plus GM-CSF placebo (6 volunteers). [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/30/99: Boosting with APL-400-047
      HIV-1 gag/pol DNA is added for volunteers who have received all scheduled immunization in the
      original protocol. Volunteers in Groups A, B, and C will receive booster intramuscular
      injections of DNA vaccine at Months 0 and 1, those in Group D will receive DNA control
      (bupivacaine carrier alone) at Months 0 and 1].
