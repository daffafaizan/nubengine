      The objective of this study is to examine respiratory/physiological and subjective responding
      as well as genetic transmission among offspring of parents with a history of or current panic
      disorder (PD) diagnosis. Our goal is to determine whether diagnoses/symptoms, endophenotypes,
      or genetic profiles in offspring is differentially related to parent PD subtypes (i.e.,
      respiratory and non-respiratory panic).

      Study population:

      Approximately 80 offspring between the ages of 9 and 20 years of age who have a parent with a
      current or past history of PD will be recruited. Approximately 40 offspring will be enrolled
      at NIH/NIMH and the remainder at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.

      Design:

      Offspring(s) between the ages of 9 to 20 who have a parent with a history of PD will be
      recruited. A complete psychiatric history will be obtained on all child participants. Child
      participants also will complete questionnaire measures, provide a sample of DNA, and
      participate in a carbon dioxide CO(2) lab challenge. The CO(2) lab challenge is the primary
      outcome measure.

      Outcome measures:

      Our primary outcome measures include physiological recordings of respiratory, cardiac, and
      electrodermal responding during a 10 minute baseline followed by 15 minutes of 5% carbon
      dioxide enriched air (CO(2). Research participants also will complete parent and child
      self-report measures and provide a DNA sample using a saliva protocol. A full listing of
      self-reports is provided in the Outcome Measures Section.
