      I. To evaluate whether symptom management and communication are improved in patients who are
      chemotherapy naive who receive a Sarcoma Treatment Guide as compared to those that have not.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether patients who have previously undergone chemotherapy benefit from a
      Sarcoma Treatment Guide (STG) in regard to symptom management and have improved communication
      between patient and providers.

      II. To assess patient satisfaction with using the STG at the end of the trial.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive the STG before completing 4 courses of standard of care chemotherapy.

      ARM B: Patients complete 2 courses of standard of care chemotherapy and then receive the STG
      before completing 2 additional courses of standard of care chemotherapy.
