        1. number of lesions localized by confocal endoscopy compared to navigational bronchoscopy

        2. Positive and negative predictive values of confocal signs before and after IV
           fluorophore injection for the diagnosis of cancer.

      In this this study, positive diagnostic criteria for the localization of peripheral nodule
      using confocal imaging is a solid pattern as opposed to the usual loose fibered network
      pattern of the normal alveolar duct. According to this criteria, the confocal imaging
      procedure will be considered as valid if the number of lesions localized by confocal is not
      inferior to 90 % of those localized by navigational bronchoscopy. Therefore, probe based
      confocal laser endo-microscopy will prove valid if it can recognize at least 70 subjects out
      of the 78 / 120 subjects for which the navigational bronchoscopy is forecasted to localize
      the peripheral lesion (Cohen concordance Kappa value of 0,74 between confocal and
      navigational bronchoscopy).

      A secondary objective will be to describe specific signs of cancer using confocal endoscopy .
      This will be assessed on the first 30 patients using confocal imaging obtained before and
      after fluorophore IV injection, in comparison to histology, and confirmed on the following 48
      patients.
