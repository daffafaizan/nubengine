      immunotherapy. Through this study, we hope to explore the optimal population for the use of
      carelizumab combined with regorafenib in the second-line treatment of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC), as well as the efficacy and safety.

      This research is a single-center trials phase II second-line, single arm, explore the
      clinical outcome of treatment.
