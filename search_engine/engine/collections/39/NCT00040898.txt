        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma
           treated with Sho-saiko-to after ablation therapy with embolization vs historical control
           patients.

        -  Compare the liver function and alpha fetoprotein levels in patients treated with this
           drug vs historical control patients.

        -  Compare the intervention-free survival in patients treated with this drug vs historical
           control patients.

      OUTLINE: Beginning within 1 week after the first course of ablation therapy with
      embolization, patients receive oral Sho-saiko-to three times daily. Treatment with
      Sho-saiko-to continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24 months.
