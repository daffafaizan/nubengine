      approaches to macular edema include FDA approved interventions such as laser and better
      underlying control of the disease and co morbid conditions. 'Off label' interventions include
      intravitreal triamcinolone and bevacizumab, both of which have been demonstrated to be
      efficacious; at least in the short term (weeks) but carry significant risks. Surgical
      approaches are still controversial and have not shown long term benefits. Unfortunately,
      there are subsets of patients resistant to any of the above therapies. Intravitreal therapies
      utilizing methotrexate 400 ug (MTX) have been used for other ophthalmologic conditions
      associated with inflammation driven macular edema. bevacizumab an anti VEGF agent has been
      utilized in diseases other than macular degeneration with a favorable effect. It is known
      that certain similar inflammatory mediators play a role in diabetic macular edema. It would
      be logical to evaluate the efficacy of MTX an anti inflammatory anti metabolite at low
      concentrations in diabetic patients with macular edema who have failed conventional FDA
      approved and well studied off label therapies that involve laser and/or intravitreal drugs.
