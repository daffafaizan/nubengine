      run-in period (14 to 21 days) to determine eligibility for treatment with study medication
      based on daily eDiary data collection. Qualified subjects will receive study medication on
      Day 1 for up to twelve months for the treatment of migraine headaches. Migraines will be
      treated with a single dose, consisting of two patches, but subjects can treat multiple
      migraine attacks throughout the 12 months. Using the eDiary to confirm they are experiencing
      a qualified migraine, subjects will self-administer the patches and continue to respond to
      questions in the eDiary for 48 hours post treatment administration.
