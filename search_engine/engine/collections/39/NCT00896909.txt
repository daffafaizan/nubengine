        -  Correlate clinical response to trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) with the presence of mutation in
           the HER-2 kinase domain in tumor samples from patients with advanced non-small cell lung
           cancer treated on protocol ECOG-2598.

        -  Correlate mutations with time to progression and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Tissue specimens are analyzed by polymerase chain reaction to assess mutations in the HER-2
      gene. Laboratory/biomarker analysis data is correlated with clinical data from protocol
      ECOG-2598.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-44 patients will be accrued for this study.
