      hospitalized for longer periods of time due to accompanying diseases or iatrogenic causes.
      This disease is called "Chronic Critical Illness" (CCI). CCI is associated with prolonged
      acute mechanical ventilation, but there is no definition in the literature for newborns.
      Pediatric CCI is estimated to be similar to adults. In the United States, the number of CCI
      is around 250,000, which is estimated to have doubled in the last 10 years. 50% of patients
      die in one year and much less than 12% recover. The estimated annual cost for the CCI in the
      United States is over $ 20 billion. The prevalence of Pediatric CCI in Turkey is unknown. In
      this study, it was aimed to investigate risk factors, mortality and cost of children with
      chronic critically ill and newborn patients in intensive care units in Turkey.
