      study evaluating 4 once-weekly doses of IV XmAb7195 or SC XmAb7195 in healthy subjects. Each
      of 5 treatment groups will consist of 6 subjects. Part B will commence following the
      completion of Part A and will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD study
      evaluating 4 once weekly doses of SC XmAb7195 in healthy subjects and/or subjects with atopic
      disease. Each treatment group will consist of 8 subjects randomized 3:1 to XmAb7195:placebo
      Subjects in both parts of the study will be followed for at least 28 days after their last
      dose.
