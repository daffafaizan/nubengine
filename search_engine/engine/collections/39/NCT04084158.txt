    
      This was a randomized, open label and multi-center phase II clinical study, which aimed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab injection (JS001) induction immunotherapy,
      plus concurrent chemoradiation, and successive Toripalimab injection (JS001) maintenance
      immunotherapy relative to those of standardized concurrent chemoradiation for locally
      advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma patients that could not receive surgical treatment or
      refuse surgery. All patients conforming to the inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned
      as the experimental arm and control arm at the ratio of 1:1 through the stratified block
      randomization method. Prior to concurrent chemoradiation, the experimental arm was given
      anti-PD-1 antibody Toripalimab injection (JS001) for 2 cycles, concurrent chemoradiation was
      initiated within 4 weeks after the induction immunotherapy, then patients were evaluated
      within 4 weeks after the completion of concurrent chemoradiation. Those who had not achieved
      PD were given 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, and Toripalimab injection (JS001) was
      continued to at most 1 year or to identified disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or
      the subjects asked to withdraw initiatively, or researchers judged that the subjects should
      withdraw from the study. The control arm was given concurrent chemoradiation alone, with
      sequential consolidation chemotherapy for 2 cycles. The primary endpoint is progression-free
      survival (PFS), Secondary end points include objective response rate (ORR), overall survival
      (OS), duration of response (DoR), time to distant metastasis (TTDM).
