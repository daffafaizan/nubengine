      I. Determine the effect of genistein on the proliferation of breast epithelial cells obtained
      by fine needle aspiration (FNA), as measured by Ki-67 labeling index, in women who are at
      high risk for breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the effect of this drug on cellular and molecular parameters using epithelial
      cells obtained by FNA, nipple aspirate fluid, and blood from these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to menopausal status (premenopausal vs postmenopausal) and history of
      breast cancer (no history of breast cancer vs history of estrogen receptor [ER] positive
      breast cancer vs history of ER negative breast cancer). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral genistein once daily.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily.

      In both arms, treatment continues for up to 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30-37 days.
