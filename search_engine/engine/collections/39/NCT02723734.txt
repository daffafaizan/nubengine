    
      This is a multisite, prospective validation trial. Based on a population consisting of 25%
      AAM and 75% NAAM, investigators will actively recruit participants and aim to achieve a 1:1
      enrollment ratio of AAM to NAAM. To achieve this, low risk AAM will be accrued first and then
      matching NAAM will be enrolled. NAAM men will be matched to AAM on prostate specific antigen
      (PSA) at diagnosis.

      There will be no treatment intervention beyond standard of care (SOC), and therefore
      participants will be allowed to choose their definitive treatment option. The intent is to
      enroll low risk and high volume disease (burden) patients to limit the accrual of patients
      that would select active surveillance (AS).
