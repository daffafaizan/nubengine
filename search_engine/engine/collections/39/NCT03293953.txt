    
      Primary Endpoint: Verify if Transient Elastography, Shear Wave Elastography, Magnetic
      Resonance Elastography (MRE) get comparable results in the measurement of liver fibrosis
      Secondary Endpoint: To evaluate if the level of liver iron overload and steatosis may act as
      a confounding factor in stiffness measurements by MRE.

      Tertiary Endpoint: to provide information about the prevalence and grade of steatosis in a
      consecutive cohort of patients with chronic viral C hepatitis, and to verify if the presence
      and grade of parenchymal steatosis may affect the correlation between the different
      non-invasive stiffness imaging modalities.

      Subject: consecutive 100 patients affected by chronic viral C hepatitis or co-infected by
      HCV+ Human Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
