      I. Determine if the dose concentration of 0.5 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate is feasible and
      well tolerated as measured by the proportion of subjects with first evidence of adherence
      failure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if the dose concentration of 0.5 g/kg/day sodium bicarbonate is safe for long
      term consumption (90 days) as measured by blood pressure, resting pulse rate, and basic
      metabolic panels to assess metabolic alkalosis.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I (RUN-IN/ADJUSTMENT): Patients receive sodium bicarbonate orally (PO) dissolved in
      water thrice daily (TID) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-10. The dose may be adjusted as
      necessary.

      PHASE II (LONG TERM): Patients continue to receive sodium bicarbonate PO TID or BID for a
      total of 90 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
