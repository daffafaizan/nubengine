    
      Glioblastoma multiforme also known by the feared three letter acronym or abbreviation, GBM,
      is the most common, aggressive and deadly type of brain tumor, which is standardly treated
      with a combination of radiation and temozolomide (TMZ), an FDA approved chemotherapy agent,
      followed by temozolomide alone. One of the reasons why glioblastoma is so aggressive and
      deadly has to do with poor blood flow: it turns out that GBM has multiple inefficient and
      leaky blood vessels, which leads to ineffective and irregular delivery of nutrients and
      oxygen to the tumor.

      As illogical as it may sound at first, depriving cancer cells of the oxygen and vital
      nutrients that they need to grow actually makes them more (not less as might be expected)
      aggressive and harder to treat.

      Here's why: for radiation to have an effect on the tumor oxygen is required since the
      combination of oxygen and radiation produces unstable and highly reactive free radicals;
      these microscopic free radicals are the equivalent of a spray of bullets, which ricochet or
      bounce around violently inside the tumor producing catastrophic damage.

      Likewise, for chemotherapy such as TMZ to work it has to reach the tumor and when blood
      vessels are so abnormal that the blood practically ceases to flow the TMZ, for example, may
      either never actually get there or may arrive in such small quantities that it is
      ineffective.

      The expression "survival of the fittest" also applies: under the poorly oxygenated harsh
      conditions, which result from this sluggish blood flow only the toughest and most resistant
      cancer cells survive, making the tumor that much harder to eliminate with traditional
      therapies.

      Think of the blood flow to the tumor as a swamp or a marsh where the rotten water seeps and
      pools rather than flows and where only the hardiest organisms can compete for scarce
      resources and low oxygen, which partly explains why this GBM tumor type in particular is
      often so hard to treat.

      This clinical trial, called G-FORCE-1, tests the safety, tolerability and activity of
      RRx-001, an experimental anticancer agent, with standard radiation and temozolomide followed
      by temozolomide + RRx-001 in newly diagnosed GBM. Evidence in animals and in human patients
      with brain metastases, that is cancer cells, which have metastasized or spread to the brain
      from different locations in the body, has shown that RRx-001, which has many anticancer
      mechanisms and is generally very well tolerated both alone and in combination with radiation
      in other clinical trials, increases blood flow to tumors.

      The increased blood flow has three possible beneficial consequences: 1) more oxygen is
      delivered to the tumor, which has the potential to increase the activity of radiation 2) more
      TMZ makes it to the tumor, which has the potential to increase the activity of TMZ and 3) as
      conditions in the tumor gradually improve from intolerable or barely tolerable to more
      acceptable, treatment sensitive cancer cells may start to reappear.

      RRx-001 is also thought to work by stimulating the immune system to attack the tumor; tumor
      biopsies or samples from patients in other RRx-001 trials have demonstrated the infiltration
      or penetration of a particular kind of white cell called T-cells. As a fourth potentially
      beneficial consequence of the increased blood flow from RRx-001, these immune T-cells may
      have better access to the tumor, which may, in turn, increase killing of the cancer cells.

      G-FORCE-1 is a Phase 1 trial, which means that the main endpoint is to test the safety and
      tolerability of RRx-001 in combination with radiation and temozolomide and not its activity;
      however patients will be followed for responses to treatment and overall survival
