           based on EIT were developed to quantify the tidal volume distribution within the lung.
           The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of optimizing PEEP with respect to
           ventilation homogeneity using the GI index and regional compliance.

        2. To titrate PEEP with the Protective Ventilation Tool by G5(MV). The new generation of
           ventilator will deliver an optimal PEEP on ARDS patients based on their status
           automatically.
