      reciprocating single-file system or a continuous rotational single-file system. (Reciproc
      Blue reciprocating single-file system vs OneShape rotational single-file system). The root
      canals will be completed in single-visit. The patients will record their postoperative pain
      during the follow-up period using a VAS scale.
