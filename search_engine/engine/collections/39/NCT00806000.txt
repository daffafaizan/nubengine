    
      prospective, cohort study of the prevalence of asthma in select athletic teams at a large,
      collegiate athletic program as documented by self-report versus lung function testing.
      Athletes from men's and women's ice hockey, soccer, and lacrosse will be studied. Each
      athlete will indicate via self-report on questionnaires whether they have asthma, and then
      subsequently will be tested utilizing specialized lung function testing. These teams were
      chosen, because it will allow for gender-matching across teams and they had subjectively
      reported asthma prevalence rates based on prior pilot data.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Varsity athlete on athletic team of interest here at The Ohio State University

        2. 18 years of age or older

        3. No short-acting bronchodilator use for 6 hours prior to testing

        4. No long-acting bronchodilator use for 36 hours prior to testing

        5. No inhaled corticosteroids or leukotriene modifiers for 72 hours prior to testing

        6. Non-smoker for 6 months or longer

        7. Less than 10 pack year (number of packs per day (x) years of smoking=pack years) smoking
           history, as smoking causes chronic changes in the profile of inflammatory cells of lungs
           and also makes airways more likely to spasm. This is true even for non-smokers.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. pregnancy

        2. recent upper respiratory tract infection (within 2 weeks of study enrollment)

        3. Objective evidence of severe lung impairment on pulmonary testing performed at the
           beginning of the study.

        4. Participation in another interventional research trial

        5. Unable to provide consent

        6. Asthma exacerbation within the last 4 weeks
