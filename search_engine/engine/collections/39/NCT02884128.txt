      increments of 20 mg/m2 between dose levels. 5-FU and LV was given as 24-hour infusion via an
      implanted central venous catheter, with dose fixed at 2000 mg/m2 and 200 mg/m2, respectively.
      PEP02 was administered on Day 1; 5-FU/LV was started after the end of PEP02 infusion on Day 1
      and also on Day 8. Treatment repeated every 3 weeks and it was regarded as one cycle of
      treatment.
