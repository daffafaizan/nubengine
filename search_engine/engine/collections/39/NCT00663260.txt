      period prior to randomization. All arms may include the addition of open label medication
      described (as needed for rescue based on protocol specific criteria). Rescue medication is
      defined as the addition of an approved, appropriate antihyperglycemic agent, except
      metformin, used according to conventional standards of care, to treat hyperglycemia, which
      may therefore allow the subject to remain in the trial
