      acceptability of Zarin during the first year of use after the method has been approved for
      public use in Madagascar. It will be implemented by Marie Stopes Madagascar with technical
      support from Marie Stopes International and FHI. 300 women of reproductive age who selected
      Zarin as their primary method of contraception will be enrolled in the study at the MSM
      outreach sites and static clinics.
