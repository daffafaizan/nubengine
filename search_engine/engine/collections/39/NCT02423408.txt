    
      The study will be conducted in 4 periods (the Screening Period, the Run-In Period, the
      Double-Blind Treatment Period and the Follow-up Period) and 4 visits (the Screening Visit,
      Enrollment Visit, Randomization Visit and End-of-Study Visit).

      Screening Period- Eligible subjects who provide written informed consent to participate will
      have study assessments performed at the Screening.

      Run-In Period- The Run-In Period will last for at least 28 days. During the Run-In period,
      subjects will be assessed for frequency of headache, study compliance and to ensure they meet
      all required study criteria for randomization.

      Double-Blind Treatment Period- The Double-Blind Treatment Period (Treatment Period) will last
      up to 4 weeks or until a qualifying headache episode has occurred and been treated using the
      study drug, whichever occurs first.

      Follow-up Period- All subjects will return to the investigational site for this visit,
      regardless of whether they have treated a qualifying TTH with study medication. Subjects who
      have not treated a qualifying TTH with study drug during the Treatment Period will be asked
      to return study materials and undergo safety evaluations at the End-of-Study Visit and will
      be discharged from the study. Subjects who have treated a qualifying TTH with study drug
      during the Treatment Period will ingest a 140 mg dose of open-label TNX-201 at this visit and
      undergo urine and blood sample collection for 3 hours post-dose to characterize each
      subject's genetic metabolism and PK profile.
