      the United Kingdom, projected to increase to 4 million by 2030. Around 25% of these survivors
      require treatment for clinical levels of emotional distress. Current pharmacological
      treatments are not very effective and are not well tolerated by patients, who prefer
      psychological treatments. However, meta-analyses of well-controlled studies of psychological
      treatments indicate that these achieve only small effect sizes. Reflecting this limited
      efficacy in the face of the need for psychological treatment, the National Cancer
      Survivorship Research Initiative highlighted development and evaluation of practically
      feasible interventions for depression and anxiety in cancer survivors as an urgent research
      priority. It is recognised that current influential psychotherapeutic approaches need to be
      modified to meet the specific needs associated with cancer. However modifications have been
      pragmatic rather than theory-driven and have not improved efficacy.

      The study addresses the stages of 'development' and 'piloting and feasibility' in Medical
      Research Council guidance on intervention development, albeit with a relatively well-defined
      starting point given existing evidence for efficacy of metacognitive therapy (MCT) in other
      settings and promising preliminary evidence of applicability in cancer. The investigators
      will conduct a phase I open trial to test the potential efficacy of group MCT in cancer
      survivors and the hypothesised causal metacognitive mechanisms underpinning treatment
      response.
