      high concentration of citrate, and moderate amount of potassium, magnesium and antioxidants.
      LPR was tested and verified to be very less toxic in cell culture and animal models. The
      clinical trial phase II showed that LPR reduced urinary metabolic abnormalities that enhance
      stone formation, such as hypocitraturia, hypokaliuria and acidified urine. Adverse effect of
      LPR was very low.
