      ketofol group versus 5.38±0.87 in fenofol group so the sample will be 56 patients, 28
      patients in each group using OPENEPI at power 80 and CI 95 A computer-generated randomization
      table divided patients into 2 equal groups.

        -  Group (K) (n=28): patients will receive IV ketofol (0.5 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg
           propofol) as bolus injection over 5 minutes in the same syringe then infusion of 0.05
           mg/kg/min propofol increased or decreased rate of infusion according to achieve sedation
           response by modified Ramasy sedation score of ≤ 4.

        -  Group (F) (n=28): patients will receive IV fenofol (1 µg/kg fentanyl and 1 mg/kg
           propofol) as bolus injection over 5 minutes in the same syringe then infusion of 0.05
           mg/kg/min propofol increased or decreased rate of infusion according to achieve sedation
           response by modified Ramasy sedation score of ≤ 4.

      The depth of sedation will be assessed by modified Ramsay sedation
