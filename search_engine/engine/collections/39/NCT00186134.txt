      transportation (walking and bicycling) is one aspect of children's physical activity that has
      received little attention but may provide a means of increasing children's activity levels.
      Traveling to school is a common activity for most children in the United States. Due to this
      regularity, active transportation to school provides a possible way to incorporate an
      increase in children's moderate-to-vigorous physical activity into a routine activity.

      Several "walk to school" programs have been implemented but it is not known if the physical
      activity levels of children walking to school are greater than those that get chauffeured or
      bused. Theoretically, moderate intensity activity should be greater in the walkers compared
      to others. This difference should be in proportion to the duration of the walk to and from
      school; determined by how far the child lives from the school. However, more activity in the
      morning may have an impact on activity levels later in the day. Therefore, differences in
      daily activity patterns in addition to total activity need to be considered.

      Comparison(s): Following a baseline week, the physical activity of students randomized to a
      Walk to School group will be compared to those randomized to a Control group, who will
      continue to be driven to school.
