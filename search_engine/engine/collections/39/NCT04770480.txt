      and hypervigilance predict poor surgical outcomes and long-term opioid use. Surgery can
      exacerbate catastrophic thinking, especially if patients have unrealistic recovery
      expectations that go unmet. Physical therapy (PT) can improve chronic LBP (low back pain)
      outcomes, with effects mediated through changes in pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy.
      Mindfulness techniques help patients disentangle an experience (e.g., pain) from associated
      emotions and appraisals. Mindfulness can enhance emotion regulation and raise un-conscious
      behavioral responses (e.g., opioid use) to conscious consideration. The benefits of
      mindfulness for chronic pain are mediated by changes in hypervigilance and self-efficacy.
      Physical therapy and mindfulness can disrupt the self-reinforcing cycle of pain, catastrophic
      appraisal and unconscious behavioral response including opioid use. Our project examines an
      innovative strategy to integrate mindfulness and PT into an enriched surgical management
      pathway for individuals undergoing lumbar spine surgery.

      Patients at 3 different military hospitals will be randomized prior to surgery to two
      different treatment groups and followed for a period of 6 months, including the
      post-operative intervention phase.
