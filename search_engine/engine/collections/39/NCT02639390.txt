      elicited improvements in arm function that can potentially supplement conventional methods to
      improve outcomes. However, the robot has a very large inertia and friction, and only gross
      grasp patterns are available. Therefore, improvements in movement speed and fine grasp were
      limited after robotic training. In development work, the investigators will significantly
      modify the ARMin and HandSOME to deliver a state-of-the-art lightweight robotic exoskeleton
      capable of retraining a wide range of functional activities. The investigators will reduce
      the inertia and friction of the robot to 1/4 of current values, incorporate an adaptive
      algorithm to automatically adjust assistance levels and extend the range of grasp patterns to
      include power grasp, thumb-index finger pinch and key pinch. Using the improved device from
      the development activities, the investigators will perform a clinical trial to compare the
      effectiveness of robotic training to conventional therapy from an occupational therapist. To
      take advantage of the facilitatory effect of robot therapy on subsequent conventional
      therapy, the experimental treatment will be 12 hours of robot therapy followed by 12 hours of
      conventional therapy. Chronic stroke subjects (N=38) will be randomly assigned to receive
      this experimental treatment or 24 hours of conventional therapy from an occupational
      therapist.
