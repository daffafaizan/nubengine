      controversy results from the low level of evidence of the early literature and the evaluation
      of all AC joint injuries with a type I through III classification system.

      There are no prospective randomized controlled long-term studies on the treatment of Tossy
      type 3 AC dislocation using primary repair and minimal pin fixation.

      In this study, the non-surgical treatment consisted of immobilisation of the injured AC-joint
      in a Kenny-Howard-type splint for four weeks. The surgical treatment consisted of an open
      reduction and fixation of the AC joint with two smooth Kirschner wires (2 mm in diameter)
      across the AC-joint. The K-wires were bent at the proximal ends, with suturing of the
      superior AC ligament.
