      strategy to link that group to ambulatory care involves extending contact with psychiatric
      emergency services beyond the initial hospital-based visit. The "window of opportunity" to
      promote successful treatment linkage is brief. This is a study of a novel treatment format
      that seeks to expand the concept of the emergency contact, the study patients method of
      entering the mental health system of care, and by doing this, enhance retention in prescribed
      outpatient care. The effects of the intervention on patient symptoms and mental health
      service use will be examined.
