      postoperative analgesia following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has a limited evidence base.
      Although there is increasing support in the literature for its use in peripheral nerve
      blockade, there have only been a handful of studies assessing its applicability in
      periarticular LIA. Moreover, the evidence from peripheral nerve blocks suggests that one of
      the key benefits of dexamethasone is a prolongation of nerve blockade. Additionally,
      dexamethasone has been shown to prolong the local analgesic effect of bupivacaine
      microcapsules.

      With respect to total hip arthroplasty (THA), there have only been two small studies that
      included corticosteroids in the LIA mixture; there was analgesic benefit and better early
      rehabilitation outcomes when compared to placebo. However, there is limited high-quality
      evidence for either THA or TKA demonstrating an improvement in functional outcomes when
      dexamethasone is used in an LIA mixture. This study will evaluate if the addition of
      dexamethasone to a local infiltration analgesia mixture will improve functional outcomes
      following total hip and knee arthroplasty.
