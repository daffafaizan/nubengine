      debilitating for some children with a risk of paralysis and death. The most susceptible age
      group is the 1 to 5 year olds, and the disease is spread via the oral-fecal route. Currently,
      there is no antiviral therapy nor there is a vaccine available to prevent HFMD. In this
      study, an inactivated vaccine (INV21) based on the EV71 antigen will be evaluated in terms of
      safety and immune response that is generated after two doses of the vaccine are given to
      healthy adults. Safety assessments include the frequency and severity of systemic adverse
      events as well as local reactions. Immune response will be assessed by measurement of EV71
      neutralizing antibody levels at specified time points throughout the study.
