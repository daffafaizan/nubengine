      that can be used as an early predictor of pathological complete or partial response in women
      with locally advanced breast cancer receiving treatment with chemotherapy or combined
      modality chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A secondary objective is to perform an inter-user
      variability comparison by comparing second site data analysis outcomes with central
      co-coordinating site data analysis. The overarching goal of this research is to transform the
      delivery of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using quantitative ultrasound, which is non-invasive,
      inexpensive and portable to assess breast cancer therapies through functional imaging, in
      which tumour cell death is detected. By detecting cell death early in a treatment on the
      order of hours to days, rather than traditional anatomical assessments that take place weeks
      to months after the completion of therapy, ineffective therapies could be switched to more
      efficacious treatments or aggressive salvage therapy which has shown to already benefit
      patients. This has the potential of improving survival in addition to sparing patients
      unnecessary side effects of treatments that may span weeks to months. The investigators will
      use these quantitative methods to evaluate treatments with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women
      with locally advanced breast cancer. This investigation will track the spatio-temporal
      changes in quantitative ultrasound surrogates of treatment response during neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy of locally advanced breast cancer and use these parameters to adapt clinical
      treatment. The study specifically will expand on single- institution research underway and
      involve a second clinical site. Data will be independently collected and analysis carried out
      at that site and at the co-ordinating site for comparison evaluating technology-use
      feasibility and reproducibility of results.
