      open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension and normal controls and to evaluate the value of
      corneal thickness in the diagnosis and management of glaucoma. Prospective study in progress.
      Randomly selected patients undergo a comprehensive ophthalmic exam which includes 2 separate
      pachymetry measurements in 2 different examinations at the same time of the day (10:00 am)
      with 3 different pachymeters. The values obtained are correlated with a number of other
      glaucoma parameters. A thinner cornea may represent a specific attribute and an additional
      risk factor for patients with exfoliation. Evaluation of corneal thickness is an important
      exam in the management of patients with exfoliation.
