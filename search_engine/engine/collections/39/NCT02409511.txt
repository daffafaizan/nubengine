      selected populations seems an appropriate approach by which to explore this issue. In
      addition, a driven hypothesis in the same groups of patients based on a sensitive marker of
      kidney injury also seems appropriate.

      Urinary levels of KIM-1(Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ) have been found elevated in experimental
      diabetic nephropathy even before that MA . In addition, urinary levels of KIM-1 were found
      significantly elevated in type 1 diabetic patients with MA, in comparison with diabetics with
      normoalbuminuria and non-diabetic healthy controls. Moreover, low urinary KIM-1 levels at
      baseline were associated with the regression of MA during a follow-up of 2 years . Therefore,
      it could be hypothesized that the presence of MA + KIM-1 in urine samples would indicate
      renal injury rather than endothelial dysfunction.
