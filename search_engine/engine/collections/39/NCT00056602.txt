      the statistical significance of treatment differences but also the clinical importance of
      such differences. Efforts to define criteria for important improvement in rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) activity have thus far not considered the patient's perspective. The aim of
      this project is to determine if criteria for important improvement in arthritis activity
      measures can be defined. This will be done by assessing the agreement among patients of
      judgments of important changes in arthritis activity. We will also determine if preference
      measures, which are a group of measures of the desirability of a particular state of health,
      can be used to assess when patients experience an important change in their arthritis.

      This prospective longitudinal observational study will measure changes in 12 arthritis
      activity measures, changes in preference measures, and judgments of the importance of changes
      in arthritis activity over one to four months in 300 patients with active RA. Consensus among
      patients regarding the degree of change considered important would allow group criteria for
      important improvement to be defined that were based on patients' evaluations.
