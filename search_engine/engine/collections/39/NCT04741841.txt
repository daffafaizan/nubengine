      different symptoms such as fatigue. Symptoms get worse by physical or mental exertion which
      usually persists for more than 24 hours (post-exertional malaise, PEM). ME/CFS is often
      characterized by reduced functional capacity, worsening social relationships and reduced
      ability to cope with work or study.

      The exact cause of the ME/CFS is presently unknown however a history of viral infection is
      common among ME/CFS patients. Prolonged post viral fatigue can develop into a chronic illness
      and ME/CFS. Current research strongly suggests involvement of gastrointestinal tract and gut
      microflora disturbances in the pathogenesis with strong evidence supporting the role of
      imbalance of gut microflora, damaged gut barrier functions and dysfunctional immune
      responses. There are some features shared with gastrointestinal conditions like irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS). GutMagnific™ is an evidence-based probiotic food supplement,
      scientifically designed to be effective in correcting imbalances of the gut microflora,
      repairing a damaged gut barrier and reducing inflammation. The strain combination in
      GutMagnific™ has been carefully designed for its efficacy in IBS and therefore it can be
      reasonably expected to be also effective in ME/CFS.
