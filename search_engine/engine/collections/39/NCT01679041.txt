    
      Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by loss of myelin and
      axonal damage, having typical contrast-enhanced MRI foci as an imaging counterpart. MS shows
      three main patterns of clinical course: relapsing/remitting, primary progressive and
      secondary progressive.Concerning disease pattern, secondary progressive is the standard
      indication, to avoid overtreatment in relapsing/remitting patients or ineffectual treatment
      in primary relapsing patients.

      Currently, MS is the most common autoimmune disease that have been treated with autologous
      HPC transplants (Fagius et al, 2009; Burt et al, 2009; Saccardi et al, 2006). More than 350
      consecutive cases have been reported by the EBMT over the last decade. Most patients who
      underwent autologous HPC transplant for MS in the early studies had secondary progressive MS,
      and relatively fewer had relapsing remitting disease, with a Kurtzke Expanded Disability
      Status Scale (EDSS) of 3.0-9.5 at the time of transplant. Significant objective and
      subjective improvements have been reported in up to 70% of these patients.

      The following conditioning regimens will be used, with Alemtuzumab, Fludarabine, and
      Cyclophosphamide will be used for all patients. Prophylaxis of Acyclovir, Levaquin, and
      Fluconazole will be given to prevent infections. The autologous HPC will be infused within
      48-72 hours of completing the chemotherapy. The patients will receive additional supportive
      care medications and treatments as necessary. Neutrophil engraftment will be defined as the
      day on which the ANC rises to > 500 cells/ml for two consecutive days. Platelet engraftment
      will be defined as the first day on which the platelet count rises to > 20,000/ml over a
      7-day interval without transfusion support.
