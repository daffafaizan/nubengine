    
      Specific aims are proposed to achieve in this study:

        1. To compare graft and patient survival rate, incidence of treatment-related adverse
           effects between different patterns of immunosuppression combination among patients
           received post-liver transplant care in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (KCGMH),
           Taiwan.

        2. To quantify the long-term health impacts of immunosuppressive regimens on
           quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), the loss-of-QALE relating to immunosuppression
           therapy, and types of transplantation.
