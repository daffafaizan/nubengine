      app for real-time data logging to identify factors causing glycemic variability, as well as
      use of a web-based nutrition education program. The investigators postulate that the
      interactive nutrition education curriculum - which will provide feedback to patients about
      the inter-relationship between their food intake and postprandial glucose profiles, as well
      as practical guidance for improvements - will lead to a change in food choices and improved
      post-prandial glucose control.
