      after this drug and then have limited options. Abraxane has shown efficacy in a number of
      cancers, putatively through intratumor concentration by SPARC (secreted protein acidic and
      rich in cysteine). (Taxanes have shown a modest activity in myeloma. Interestingly, Revlimid
      can upregulate the levels of SPARC. Thus, investigators will test the toxicity and efficacy
      of a combination of Revlimid and Abraxane in relapsed/refractory myeloma.

      Investigators will perform a phase I/II trial of Revlimid daily for 21 days and Abraxane
      weekly for 3 weeks in patients who have failed Revlimid but have adequate blood counts and
      renal function and minimal neuropathy. For study purposes, 1 cycle is considered to be 4
      weeks (20 days). Subjects will get Abraxane for three weeks and will be off of this treatment
      for 1 week. There are 10 visits per cycle. Accrual will be on standard 3 patient cohorts.
      Once the maximum tolerated dose is reached, the level below will be expanded to 25 patients
      for a pilot phase II trial. All treatments will be performed until progression. Assessments
      will be made at least at the 2, 4, and 6 month timepoints and monthly thereafter until
      progression.

      Since both drugs can cause myelosuppression, investigators will start with doses below their
      standard doses as single agents. Investigators will use 100 mg/m2 of Abraxane weekly for 3
      weeks and 10 mg Revlimid daily for 21 days, with a dose escalation for Revlimid to 15 mg and
      to 25 mg. Dose de-escalations will also be performed for both drugs as necessary.
      Investigators will explore whether SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine)
      expression is altered by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry.
