      survival and is currently considered an effective first line therapy applicable to the
      majority of patients with multiple myeloma. However disease relapse is inevitable and remains
      the primary cause of mortality in this cohort.

      The purpose of this study is to estimate the proportion of subjects with plasma cell
      contamination of harvested stem cell product in standard and treatment arms. The study will
      explore whether or not in-vivo purging of malignant tumor plasma cells will improve
      progression free survival (PFS) for patients.

      The study will consist of two groups:

      Group A: Standard of Care (SOC) stem cell collection without in-vivo purging with bortezomib.
      Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and Mozobil used if needed.

      Group B: Bortezomib 1.3mg/m^2 will be given subcutaneously (SQ) on days -11 and -8 followed
      by Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on days -4 through -1 prior to stem cell
      harvest (day 0).
