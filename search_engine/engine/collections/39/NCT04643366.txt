    
      This trial involves 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy followed by short-course RT with
      concurrent 5-FU neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and subsequent consolidation with 4
      cycles of systemic chemotherapy prior to surgery or, for those who achieve cCR, the option of
      non-operative active surveillance.Three-year disease free survival (DFS) defined as the
      percentage of patients alive without recurrence of disease at 3 years measured from the date
      of clinical complete response (cCR) or date of total mesorectal excision (TME) at surgery
      (whichever is earlier).
