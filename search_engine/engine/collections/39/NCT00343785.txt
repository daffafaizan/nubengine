      I. Minimize the incidence of chronic GVHD by restricting the transplanted marrow dose to
      2.0-2.5 x 10^8 nucleated cells/kg.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Engraftment and overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -5 to -2
      and anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-10 hours on days -4 to -2.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and cyclosporine
      IV over 1 hour or orally (PO) twice daily on days -1 to 50, followed by a taper until 6
      months after grafting.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at on day 180, 1 year, 1.5
      years, 2 years, 3 years, and yearly thereafter.
