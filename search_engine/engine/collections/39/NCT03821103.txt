    
      Philadelphia is experiencing a significant opioid crisis. Through this novel pilot study,
      critical training about opioid use disorder and medication-assisted treatment with
      buprenorphine-naloxone will be provided to emergency providers and changes in clinical
      practice will be incentivized in order to optimize treatment engagement for patients with
      opioid use disorder in the Emergency Department.

      Participants will be invited to participate in a brief in-person training session, will
      receive a pre- and post-session knowledge and attitude assessment, and will be invited to
      self-report first-time buprenorphine-naloxone Emergency Department administration within the
      3 month study period.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two arms: standard training arm and behavioral
      economic enhanced arm. The standard training arm will receive the aforementioned
      intervention. The behavioral economic enhanced arm will additionally receive an opt-out
      invitation, loss-framed incentivization, and weekly tailored text message-based reminders.

      Endpoints of interest include retained knowledge and change in provider attitudes regarding
      Emergency department buprenorphine-naloxone administration and treatment following training
      and again at 3 months, and first-time Emergency department administration of
      buprenorphine-naloxone.
