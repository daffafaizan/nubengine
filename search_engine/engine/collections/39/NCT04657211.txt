    
      COPD is a disabling respiratory disease characterized by airflow obstruction and associated
      symptoms, including breathing difficulties caused by shortness of breath and wheezing, airway
      hyperactivity, chronic cough, sputum production, exercise intolerance, and poor quality of
      life. In accordance with the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease)
      recommendations, it is important to assess the characteristics and treatment patterns of
      participants prior to triple therapy initiation, in order to determine adherence to these
      guidelines and understand how participants progress to triple therapy. Despite a clearly
      defined guidance from GOLD treatment recommendations for the initiation and maintenance of
      triple therapy, treatment changes in Germany, including de-escalation, are often seen in
      treatment reality. This study is intended to gain a better understanding of what influences
      the treatment decision of German physicians in primary and secondary care under real life
      conditions, to elicit the reasons for treatment changes and to describe long-term outcomes
      with participants initiated on triple therapy over a period of two years. This study will
      also describe the temporal dynamics of treatment pattern and to unravel potentially complex
      participant's journeys in different German regions and also to identify and follow-up a
      variety of 'treatable traits' in COPD participants, which when modified may lead to improved
      health outcomes.
