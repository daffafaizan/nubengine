      previously published that acute stress elicits a pressor response that is accompanied by an
      increase in 8 isoprostane and endothelin-1. However, the pressor response is suppressed by
      endothelin A/B receptor antagonism. Moreover, the investigators have identified that the
      increase in 8-isoprostane occurs downstream of endothelin receptor activation. These data
      indicate that endothelin receptor activation is a main player In the pressor response to
      acute stress in pre-hypertensive animals; however, this phenomenon has yet to be elucidated
      in humans.
