      have residual Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA after curative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.
      All patients will receive apatinib. The purpose is to evaluate the disease free-survival
      (DFS) in these patients treated with apatinib. In the phase IIb part, patients will be
      randomized to apatinib or placebo in a ratio of 1:1. The estimated sample size is 78 in phase
      IIb. However, the final sample size in phase IIb will be determined based on results of the
      phase IIa part.
