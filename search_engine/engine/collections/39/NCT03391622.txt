      calibrated automated thrombogram and cardiac catheterization results in active ischemic heart
      disease patients.

      In total 340 patients are planned for inclusion in this trial. After signing an informed
      consent a blood sample will be obtained from each participant. the investigators will measure
      the thrombin generation over time in plasma assessed by the calibrated automated thrombogram
      (CAT). In addition information about the course and results of cardiac catheterization will
      be collected.
