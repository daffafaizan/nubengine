      to the vaccine, more about the potential side effects of the vaccine and the effects of
      giving an additional booster vaccination on the immune system.

      Approximately 18 patients with EBV positive nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) will be recruited to
      the trial. Patients will receive up to four vaccinations with the MVA-EBNA1/LMP2 vaccine. The
      first three vaccines will be given at 3 weekly intervals, followed by a fourth vaccine 12
      weeks later. The vaccine will be given by intradermal injection with the dose divided across
      multiple injection sites on the arm, or on the thigh.

      Patients will participate in the study for approximately 12 months from first vaccination and
      attend hospital approximately 11 times during this period. Standard safety assessments will
      be performed throughout the trial and at each clinic visit patients will be asked to provide
      research blood samples. These samples will be used to monitor the effects of the vaccine on
      the patient's immune system.
