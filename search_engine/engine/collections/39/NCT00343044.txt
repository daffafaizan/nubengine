    
      This study is designed as a Phase 2 study. There are no published data on the toxicity of the
      combination of bevacizumab and topotecan therapy. Based on data combining bevacizumab with
      other chemotherapy agents in non-gynecologic solid tumors, it is not likely that the toxicity
      of the combination of the two drugs will be greater than the individual toxicities of each
      drug. The toxicities of each of these agents is quite different. Specifically the toxicity of
      this combination will be studied using the dose of bevacizumab used in previous phase II
      studies of ovarian cancer, e.g. an equivalent of 5 mg/kg weekly with treatments given at
      least every 3 weeks. In our study, since topotecan will be given weeks 1,2 and 3 of an every
      4 week cycle, it is convenient to give bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV every other week.
