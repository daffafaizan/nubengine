      inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) treated at several
      Italian centres will be retrospectively assessed for inclusion.

      Those treated below the age of 35 years between 2000 and 2020 will be included. The study
      aims to obtain information on female fertility, pregnancy and delivery, and to identify
      factors associated with infertility and problems to conclude the pregnancy.
