    
      This is a prospective study over 4 months, open, nonrandomized. 45 overweight or obese male
      subjects will complete 3 experimental sessions (0700-1400h) before and after 3 months of
      supervised physical training. During a first session, subjects will remain inactive and
      fasted (basal conditions). During the second session a standardized meal will be offered
      (postprandial response to a standardized meal). The third session will consist in the
      realization of an exercise bout (60min at 60%VO2 max) followed by a standardized meal (same
      meal that the previous day).

      Several blood (catheter), salivary and urinary samples will be collected during the 3
      sessions, throughout the experimental day.
