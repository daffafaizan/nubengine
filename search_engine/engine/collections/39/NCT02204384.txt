      fiber from guar gum supplement - HFS and usual amount of fiber -UF), isocaloric and similar
      distribution of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, the order of breakfasts randomly
      determined. Meals HFD and HFS have the same amount of fiber from different sources, origin in
      food and supplement respectively. Meal UF consist of the same foods meal HFS, but without the
      use of soluble fiber supplement and white bread instead of rye bread (low fiber content in
      relation to meals HFD and HFS). The supplement (Sachet 5g - Fiber Mais Â®: 60% guar gum and
      40% inulin) will be added to the plain water to meal HFD.
