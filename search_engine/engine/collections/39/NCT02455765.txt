      and three time points along with white rice as control. The combinations were either low or
      high levels of amino acid mixtures. This was consumed together or 15 min, 30 min before
      consumption of white rice. Postprandial blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations were
      measured at fasting and every 15 min after consumption of treatment meal until 60 min after
      the consumption of white rice. Subsequent blood sample were taken at 30 min interval until
      210min. The glucose and insulin in the blood will be analysed.
