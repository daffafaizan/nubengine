        -  Determine the anticancer activity of exatecan mesylate, in terms of objective response
           and duration of response, in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histological
      diagnosis (leiomyosarcoma vs other histologies).

      Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression. After disease progression,
      patients are followed every 12 weeks for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-50 patients (16-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
