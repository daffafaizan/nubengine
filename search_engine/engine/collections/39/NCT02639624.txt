      patients blood pH (Hydrogen ion concentration) relatively unchanged then switch to a normal
      bicarbonate bath during the second half of dialysis so that they attain the pH (Hydrogen ion
      concentration) they normally would. Investigators will use these measurements to test test
      the hypothesis that Indoxyl Sulfate (IS) binds to proteins with greater affinity under basic
      conditions and further to test the hypothesis that it is possible to remove a greater amount
      of Indoxyl Sulfate (IS) when patients are maintained relatively acidotic during dialysis for
      a longer period of time due to the greater availability of free IS that can pass through the
      dialyzer.
