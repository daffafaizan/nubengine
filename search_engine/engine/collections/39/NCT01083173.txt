      follow-up visit took place 1-2 weeks after treatment initiation, and subsequent visits
      occurred at the discretion of the investigators, typically occurring every 3 months.
      Clinical/immunological/virological/laboratory status, Kaletra-containing regimen/concomitant
      medication information, and adverse event information were obtained at follow-up visits.
