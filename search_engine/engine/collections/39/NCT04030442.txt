      with each session day separated by at least one week. Each session day will last
      approximately 6-7 hours.

      In the morning of each of the three study sessions participants will be asked to answer
      questions about how they feel and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation,
      and temperature) will be measured using a non-invasive (external) vitals monitor.

      Participants will be asked to take an oral morphine capsule.

      Participants will participant in 3 smoking sessions where they will be asked to smoke
      cigarettes containing either cannabidiol or placebo (a blank).

      Participant's response to different intensities of thermal (heat and cold) stimulation will
      be administered to test pain sensitivity.

      Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and have vital signs (blood pressure,
      heart rate) monitored.

      After completing the third round of smoking and assessment battery, participants will be
      provided with lunch and can relax, watch television, listen to music or read.

      Once vital signs and questionnaire ratings have returned to baseline levels, participants can
      leave the laboratory.
