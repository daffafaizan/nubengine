      trial. Approximately sixty pancreatic insufficient (PI) subjects with CF who are â‰¥ 2 and < 11
      years of age, will be enrolled to receive either L-Glutathione Reduced (GSH) or placebo given
      orally (tid) for 24 weeks. Each subject will be seen for four study visits: Visit 1
      (Screening), Visit 2 (Baseline/Randomization, Day 0), Visit 3 (Week 12) and Visit 4 (Week
      24). At Visit 2, subjects will be randomized to receive either active treatment or placebo.
      Visit 1 and 2 may be combined if subject meets eligibility requirements and a fecal specimen
      is collected prior to dosing. Safety and clinical outcomes will be assessed throughout the
      study. Assessment of inflammatory and other bio-markers in blood and fecal specimens will be
      performed at Visits 2 and 4
