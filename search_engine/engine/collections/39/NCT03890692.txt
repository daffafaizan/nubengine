      direct visualization of the postnasal space. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated
      that adenoid size, as determined by rhinoscopy, was well correlated with clinical symptoms
      such as nasal obstruction and snoring.

      The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of lateral neck radiography and video
      rhinoscopy in assessing adenoid size .

      Assessment of the reproducability of these modalities to associated symptoms and, thus, the
      severity of the disease.
