    
      40 septic shock patients requiring norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure between
      65 and 75 mmHg despite adequate volume resuscitation will be enrolled in the study. After an
      initial hemodynamic resuscitation aimed at achieve a mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75
      mmHg and a mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) ≥ 65%, patients will be randomly allocated
      to be treated with either a) intravenous administration of levosimendan 0.2 µg∙kg-1∙min-1 for
      24 hrs, b)intravenous administration of dobutamine 5 µg∙kg-1∙min-1 for 36 hrs(control; each n
      = 20). At the end of the first 24 hrs of the study period, both groups will receive inhaled
      nitric oxide at the concentration of 35 ppm for further 12 hrs. In all patients
      norepinephrine was titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg. Data
      from right heart catheterization and sublingual microvascular network will be obtained just
      before randomization (baseline) and then after 24 and 36 hours.

      The sublingual microvascular network will be studied using the sidestream dark field (SDF)
      imaging. The device will be applied on the lateral side of the tongue, in an area
      approximately 2-4 cm from the tip of the tongue. Sequences of 10 secs from eight adjacent
      areas will be recorded on disk using a personal computer. These sequences will be later
      analyzed by an investigator blinded to the patient's diagnosis and therapy.
