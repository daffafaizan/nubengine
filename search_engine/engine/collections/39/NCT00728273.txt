      deficiencies not only lead to anemia, impair growth, increase susceptibility to infection,
      impair work capacity, but also impair cognitive development and impair learning ability. The
      risk of micronutrient deficiencies and anemia increases when individuals are exposed to
      intestinal helminth infections. Schoolchildren are a neglected group with regard to
      micronutrient interventions, and school programs afford an excellent opportunity to improve
      health of these groups. Food fortification with multi-micronutrients is a cost-effective and
      sustainable strategy, but is not yet implemented on a large scale in Vietnam. Furthermore,
      little is known about whether high prevalence of intestinal helminthic infection in
      schoolchildren limits the effect of fortification when this is not combined with regular
      de-worming.
