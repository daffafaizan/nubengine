      the addition of epinephrine. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate OA flow by echo-Doppler before
      and after peribulbar block with lidocaine in presence or absence of epinephrine.

      Fifty-six patients that were eligible for cataract phacoemulsification surgery were selected.
      Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 - Peribulbar block with lidocaine and
      1/200.000 epinephrine; group 2 - Peribulbar block with lidocaine in the absence of
      epinephrine. The resistance index (RI) of OA was evaluated using echo-Doppler before and 10
      min after the peribulbar block.
