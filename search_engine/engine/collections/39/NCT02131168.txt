      web registration investigators intend to form a new prospective, uniformly diagnosed,
      population-based inception cohort of patients with IBD. Physicians, gastroenterologists,
      family doctors, surgeons and pathologists in our study area will be notified repeatedly about
      the study by letter, telephone, internet, personal visit of the investigators, and encouraged
      to inform investigators of every possible new case of IBD (persistent or relapsing diarrhoea,
      blood and/or mucus in the stools for more than three weeks, or abdominal pain and weight
      loss). Endoscopic, pathology and radiology records will be canvassed repeatedly for likely
      cases, both electronically and manually. By these methods investigators intend to capture
      over 90% of possible cases. New patients will be included during a five-year period,
      01.04.2011 - 31.03.2016, followed by a five year follow-up period until 31.03.2021. All
      patients are required to meet the diagnostic criteria for IBD on the basis of clinical
      symptoms, endoscopic or radiological evidence or mucosal biopsies. Infectious
      gastroenteritis, tuberculosis, entamoeba and cancer have to be ruled out. The web-based
      Database application will be used for online registration of the various registration forms
      and questionnaires (see list of additional materials), and the database is located on a
      central secured server.
