      diagnosed by the Coma recovery scale-revised (CRS-R).An objective index,the ratio of
      pupillary constriction (pupil diameter change after a stimulus presentation divided by the
      resting state pupil diameter) will be used as the measure of PNR's presence (positive results
      indicate the presence of PNR,whereas negative results indicate the absence of PNR).According
      to the presence of PNR,patients will be divided into 2 groups,one includes patients who show
      PNR during the PNR assessment (PNR+),the other includes patients who fail to show PNR during
      the PNR assessment(PNR-).3 months later,a follow-up will be conducted to obtain their
      prognosis in the form of another CRS-R assessment.Patients diagnosed as Minimally Conscious
      State (MCS) will be considered as favourable prognosis,patients diagnosed as UWS will be
      considered as unfavourable prognosis.Their prognosis difference will then be compared to see
      PNR's effect on their prognosis (consciousness recovery). And for they couldn't show
      conscious visual behaviors (visual behaviors in CRS-R which indicate MCS) in the first
      CRS-R,their difference between visual prognosis (difference between each group's proportion
      of patients showing conscious visual behavior diagnosed by CRS-R in the follow up) will be
      compared to see PNR's capability to predict prognosis in patients without voluntary eye
      movements (conscious visual behaviors in CRS-R require voluntary eye movements).

      Researchers expect to see the PNR+ group have better prognosis in both comparison.
