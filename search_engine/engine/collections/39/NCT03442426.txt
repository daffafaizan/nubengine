      to enhance primary health care for older adults, working collaboratively with study sites,
      older adults, and other stakeholders to develop a scalable and sustainable model. The
      investigators aim to develop the capacity of primary health care teams to identify, assess,
      and support older adults (70+) who are frail, and to delay or prevent decline for those at
      lower risk. The project will support patient/caregiver engagement, and stronger care
      coordination and integration with other health and social services. The primary research
      question is: compared to usual care in primary care settings, does the proposed model improve
      health, social and economic outcomes for frail and at-risk older Canadians (aged 70+)? The
      investigators hypothesize that older adults will benefit from screening, active engagement in
      care planning, and appropriate referrals to services earlier in their care trajectories. In
      addition to improving health outcomes and quality of life for patients, more proactive
      interventions can reduce costly emergency department visits and unplanned hospital
      admissions.
