      study. After informed consent is obtained, patients will be given an opioid knowledge
      questionnaire to complete before the education. They will then be given an educational
      pamphlet to review. After they have reviewed the educational pamphlet, they will complete the
      same opioid knowledge questionnaire. They will also complete a questionnaire evaluating the
      patient educational pamphlet. The pamphlet will be modified based on the feedback from the
      patients in the pilot study.
