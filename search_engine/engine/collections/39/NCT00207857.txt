      randomized in to one of two groups. The group assignment will be chosen by chance, similar to
      flipping a coin. If you are assigned to group one you will first have your regularly
      scheduled PFT in the morning. You will be asked to complete a second PFT that afternoon as
      least 4 hours after the first PFT. You will then be asked to come back to the clinic in two
      weeks and repeat these PFT's, once in the morning and once in the afternoon at least 4 hours
      apart. Each PFT will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. If you are assigned to group two,
      you will have your regularly scheduled PFT in the morning and then a second test in the
      afternoon at least four hours after the first test. After the second PFT you will receive
      training from a Respiratory Therapist. You will receive teaching handouts to take home and an
      incentive spirometer and peak flow meter to practice with. You will be asked to practice
      these tests 2 times a day and record your results. You will then be asked to come back to the
      clinic in two weeks to repeat 2 PFT's, once in the morning and again at least 4 hours later.
      All participants will be asked how they feel at the time of testing.
