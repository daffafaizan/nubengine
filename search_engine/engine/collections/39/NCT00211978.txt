      which leads to elevated levels of serum phosphorus. Elevated serum phosphorus leads to
      increased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and is associated with bone disease and other
      adverse consequences such as soft-tissue and vascular calcification, and increased morbidity
      and mortality. It is therefore important to prevent hyperphosphatemia and maintain serum
      phosphorus levels within the range recommended by K/DOQI. In patients on dialysis, phosphate
      binders are routinely used to control serum phosphorus by absorbing dietary phosphate during
      the transit through the intestine. However, the use of phosphate binders for non-dialyzed
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not an FDA approved indication, although some
      physicians treat patients prior to dialysis based on clinical judgment. The goal of this
      study is to demonstrate the efficacy of calcium acetate (PhosLo) in controlling serum
      phosphorus in patients with moderate to severe decrease in kidney function.
