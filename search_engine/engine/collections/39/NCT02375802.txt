      six weeks or longer and cost upwards of $40,000 to treat. Past studies have shown that
      adipose tissue contains progenitor cells or regenerative cells that can release multiple
      angiogenic growth factors and cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). A current
      literature review revealed that there is research related to use of stem cells to enhance
      wound healing, in particular with ischemic or radiation-induced ulcers. However, there is
      limited research completed on use of stem cells or ASCs with pressure ulcers. The goal is to
      heal pressure ulcers faster and prevent further complications using the patient's own natural
      ASCs.
