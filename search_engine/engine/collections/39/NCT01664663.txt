      to 84 Gy due to normal tissue dose constraints combined with standard concurrent chemotherapy
      (cisplatin-vinorelbine) compared to standard dose radiotherapy (68 Gy) combined with the same
      chemotherapy. There are restrictions due to lung function, performance status and
      pre-treatment weight loss. The main endpoint is progression free survival and additional
      endpoints are local control, overall survival, toxicity quality of life and relapse pattern.
