      for the treatment of anemia in non-dialysis dependent, chronic renal failure patients
      receiving or not receiving erythropoietin. After an extensive enrollment period, patients
      were randomized to receive oral iron (ferrous sulfate, 325mg three times daily (TID) for 56
      days) or IV iron sucrose (total 1000mg, 500mg X 2 OR 200mg X 5 within two weeks).
      Erythropoietin schedule was to remain unchanged during the 56 day study.
