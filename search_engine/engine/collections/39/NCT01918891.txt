      current systolic blood pressure (BP) above JNC7 recommended range (>=140 mmHg) who recently
      entered home care service. The NP only program will provide a 30 day intervention while the
      NP/HC team will provide 3 months of support via in-home and telephone encounters for patients
      randomized to one of these groups. In the first 30 days post-enrollment the NP will focus on
      medical case management and coordination with primary care providers and specialists, provide
      self-management coaching, and intervene if gaps in care are identified - all with a focus on
      BP reduction and preparing the patient for ongoing BP maintenance. As applicable, the HC will
      pick up the case after 30 days and follow up with the plan of care jointly established by the
      patient, NP and HC. The focus will be on ongoing self-management coaching, providing
      preparation support for physician visits, and linking patient to additional community
      resources, as needed.
