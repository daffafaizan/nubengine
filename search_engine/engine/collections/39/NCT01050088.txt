      Ponseti method. This procedure is done in an outpatient clinic setup. The procedure is
      painless but may cause some discomfort to the patient. This study will examine the use of 5
      CC Sucrose solution as a comforting agent for the babies. The control group will consist of
      patients who will get 5cc saline pre cast application, while the study group will be given
      5cc of Sucrose solution. Patients and physicians are blinded to the treatment they get.
      Outcome measures will include pulse rate and oxygenation as an accepted measure of
      discomfort.
