      Covid-19 has impacted all aspects of society. In hospitals around the world focus has been on
      treating the deadly virus, and elective orthopedic surgical procedures has been postponed in
      Denmark, causing a stop for most arthroscopic procedures for months. It is established that
      certain conditions leading to arthroscopic orthopedic intervention has fluctuating symptoms
      symptoms and can have a favorable outcome on conservative treatment. Amongst these conditions
      who are also treated with non-surgical methods are subacromial decompression
      impingement[1][1], degenerative knee disease [2] and anterior cruciate ligament injuries[3].
      An issue with further understanding the non-surgical effect on this patient group has
      beencould be reluctance to undergo conservative non-surgical treatment and opt for a surgical
      treatment. procedure. Because all elective surgery has been postponed in Denmark, and the
      following longer waiting period for surgery, this has created a unique opportunity to further
      investigate this patient category.

      Aim of study: Investigate the impact of time on waiting list for surgery under COVID-19
      pandemic on the preference for surgery in patients planned for arthroscopic surgery.

      Discussion The current study will provide information on the change of preferences forto
      arthroscopic surgery in a patient population who are forced to wait for surgery for a longer
      period of time, with no possibility of seeking treatment in other hospitals.
