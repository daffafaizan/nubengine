      follow-up. The medical device consists in Telemonitoring, Telenotification and Telecoaching.
      It aims to both increase patient autonomy, with regard to management of his/her pathologies,
      and facilitate coordination between health professionals.

      By providing patients with tools enabling early detection of clinical worsening combined with
      an appropriate management, the medium and long-term objectives are to reduce hospitalizations
      and improve health status and quality of life of these patients at home.

      In the first instance, the only objective of the present study is to evaluate the performance
      and feasibility of implementation of the device. This evaluation is based on a comparison
      between the telenotifications generated by the software and those calculated from the raw
      data captured by the software.
