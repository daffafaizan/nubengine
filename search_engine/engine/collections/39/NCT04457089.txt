      reduce disease progression in 20 patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer at
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. This study will focus on patients with recurrent platinum
      sensitive ovarian cancer to increase the likelihood that this population will experience
      recurrent disease during the 6-month intervention and follow-up. In addition, this population
      of patients has a narrow range of standard of care carboplatin doublet combinations that are
      prescribed, enabling the investigators to create a more homogenous study population. Given
      their high risk of developing recurrent disease, women with platinum sensitive ovarian
      cancer, have the potential to derive the maximum benefit from an intervention that could
      delay disease progression and enhance survival.
