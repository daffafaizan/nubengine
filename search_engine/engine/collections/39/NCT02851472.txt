      weeks postnatal age. 3) Anemia with Hct less than 28 % 4) >50 % total daily fluids is enteral
      5) History of at least 1 prior PRBC transfusion ELGANs admitted to the neonatal intensive
      care unit (NICU) will be screened for the study. If patients meet the selection criteria,
      parents will be approached to obtain informed consent. Then the patient will be randomized to
      either iNO or placebo group before treatment. The treating physician will make the decision
      regarding timing of the PRBC transfusion to treat anemia for the subject.

      During the period of observation, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring will be
      performed on all enrolled subjects during which a non-invasive probe will be attached to the
      skin at 3 sites simultaneously- on abdomen below umbilicus, flank/back, and forehead for
      calculation of fractional tissue oxygen extraction ( FTOE) in conjunction with concurrent
      pulse oximetry recordings.

      Conventional vital signs, blood gas, lactate, haptoglobin and cytokines will be measured
      before and after the PRBC transfusion
