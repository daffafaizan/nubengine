      performance of the procedures will participate in the study. These individuals will be
      randomly divided into an experimental group that will perform the motor training of a
      sequential task of fingers simultaneously to the anodic tDCS on the contralateral motor
      cortex the trained hand and a control group that will perform the same training
      simultaneously the stimulation placebo (simulated in the same region of the experimental
      group). The training will consist of 8 blocks with 300 repetitions of sequential finger
      movements performed with only the right upper limb. The speed and accuracy of sequential
      movements will be used as a measure of performance. These measures will be performed prior to
      training, immediately after, 48 hours, 7 days, and 28 days after trained hand training (TH)
      for assessment of short and long term learning. In addition, performance evaluations (1) of
      the reverse-trained sequence in TH will be performed to evaluate the generalization; (2) of
      the trained sequence in left hand (non-trained) to evaluate the intermanual transfer; and (3)
      trained sequence in TH in double-task condition to evaluate automaticity. Appropriate
      statistical methods will be used to identify inter- and intra-group differences.
