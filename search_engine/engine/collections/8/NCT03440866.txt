      pregnancy(8). According to the original protocol ,the administration of oral Mifepristone 600
      mg is followed by oral Misoprostol 400 mcg in an interval of 36 to 48 hours. Shortening this
      time interval may convince patients to avoid surgical termination of pregnancy, enhance
      patient's compliance to treatment and even be more economically.

      The current protocol in the investigators unit includes oral administration of Mifepristone
      600 mg and oral Misoprostol 400 mcg in a time interval of 48 hours. The patients are
      recommended to have an ultrasound examination after 2 to 3 weeks. There is little data to
      compare the efficacy of concomitant administration of both drugs according to the dosage of
      this protocol and different time intervals.

      This study evaluates the success rate and side effects of medical termination of pregnancy
      while both drugs are administrated concomitantly in comparison to interval of 48 hours
      between the drugs.

      Participants in the study group will be given both drugs at the same time while participants
      in the control group will be given Mifepristone and Misoprostol in an interval of 48 hours.

      The investigators hypothesis is that administration of both drugs concomitantly will not
      change significantly the success rate of the procedure and will not enhance the side effects.
