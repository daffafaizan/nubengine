      I. To determine single oral doses of 3,3' di-indolylmethane (DIM) (diindolylmethane) that are
      safe and well- tolerated.

      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of these single oral doses of DIM.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive a single dose of diindolylmethane orally (PO) on day 1.

      ARM II: Participants receive a single dose of placebo orally (PO) on day 1.
