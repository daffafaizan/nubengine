      for hepatocellular carcinoma, and guidelines recommend TACE as the treatment of choice. Given
      that combination therapies such as immunotherapy in combination with targeted therapy and
      immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy have achieved good efficacy in systemic
      therapy for liver cancer, this study is intended to explore the efficacy of TACE.

      In this study, we propose to explore the use of kareliozumab in combination with apatinib and
      oxaliplatin for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

      In this study, we propose to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy with
      kalilizumab in combination with apatinib and oxaliplatin in patients with potentially
      resectable hepatocellular liver cancer.
