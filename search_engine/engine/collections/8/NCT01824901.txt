      I. Determination of a recommended phase II dose for the combination of docetaxel and AZD4547
      (FGFR inhibitor AZD4547). (Phase I) II. Estimation and comparison of progression-free
      survival (PFS) of each treatment arm. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of docetaxel with or without concomitant AZD4547.
      Pharmacokinetic evaluation of AZD4547 with concomitant docetaxel. (Phase I) II. Safety
      assessment and toxicity characterization of the combination. (Phase I) III. Initial
      assessment of clinical activity of the combination. (Phase I) IV. Response rate. (Phase II)
      V. Overall survival. (Phase II) VI. Estimation of response to single agent AZD4547 among
      patients who crossover from single agent docetaxel. (Phase II) VII. Further safety assessment
      and toxicity characterization of AZD4547 alone and in combination with docetaxel. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 followed by a
      randomized phase II study.

      PHASE I:

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 and FGFR inhibitor
      AZD4547 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 2-15 of course 1 and days 1-14 of all
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II, STEP I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who experience progressive disease may then receive FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 PO BID on
      days 1-14.

      ARM II: Patients receive docetaxel IV as in Arm I and FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 PO BID on days
      1-14.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II, STEP II:

      Patients receive FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 PO BID on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.

      This study opened to accrual on September 19, 2013 and was suspended to accrual on January
      29, 2014 after each of the first two patients had been registered to the first dose level of
      the phase I and experienced dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during week 1 of cycle 1. The
      study was subsequently terminated on April 17, 2014 after having met the predefined criteria
      for closure per the phase I study design.
