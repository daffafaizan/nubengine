      France, except in case of refusal.

      Maternal clinical, biological and therapeutic data before and during pregnancy are collected
      at delivery. The children are examined clinically and biologically at birth, 1, 3, 6, 12 and
      24 months. An infant is considered as non infected if two virologic tests are negative beyond
      the prophylactic treatment or serology is negative after 18 months. An infant is considered
      as infected if HIV1 is detected by virologic tests on two occasions (polymerase chain
      reactions, viral culture or p24 antigenemia) and if anti-HIV1 antibodies (ELISA and Western
      blot) persist after 18 months of age. Follow up is stopped at 24 months for uninfected
      infants whereas infected infants are enrolled in the CO10 EPF paediatric cohort. No specific
      recommendation for HIV treatment and obstetrical care are made for women and children
      included in the cohort, although national guidelines for prevention of MTCT are regularly
      published and updated. Frozen maternal samples blood and plasma are stored in a centralized
      laboratory. A research of patients patients lost to follow-up (last visit <24 months) and
      monitoring is performed regularly in all sites.
