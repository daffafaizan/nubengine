      feasibility and short term efficacy of the Ultrasept Left Atrial Appendage Closure Device.
      Patients who present or are referred for participation in the study will be evaluated against
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those meeting the criteria will be given the
      opportunity to participate. All patients will have protocol-required evaluations at each
      scheduled follow-up.
