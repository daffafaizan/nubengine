      or light headedness but to deficits in attention, visual, and verbal memory. Would a
      successful treatment of OH which includes physiotherapy significantly improve OH and these
      cognitive deficits? By means of a randomized cross-over trial, we want to measure and compare
      the effects of OH therapy on orthostatic tolerance, as well as on attention, visuo-spatial
      working memory, and verbal memory in patients with PD. If confirmed, therapy of orthostatic
      hypotension would provide a sound and simple approach to improve those cognitive deficits
      originating from orthostatic hypotension.
