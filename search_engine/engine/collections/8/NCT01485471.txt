      harmless to the tissues and sends them into the ear canal to measure the tissue optical
      properties including the absorption of the laser signal and the amount of signal that will be
      backscattered by the ear drum. These measurements will then be analyzed using a
      microprocessor to determine presence of fluid or inflammation of the eardrum.

      Diffuse optical spectroscopy an imaging method use near- infrared light to measure absolute
      tissue concentrations of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, water, and lipids, as well as subtle
      changes in water and protein binding states
