    
      GSK Biologicals has developed a meningococcal conjugate vaccine (GSK134612). This candidate
      vaccine has been shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in subjects as of 12 months of
      age.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody persistence at approximately 1 year, 3
      years and 5 years post-administration of one dose of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals'
      meningococcal vaccine GSK134612 as compared to Menactra® (meningococcal serogroups A, C,
      W-135 and Y-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine, sanofi pasteur) when given to healthy
      adolescents/ adults 11 to 25 years of age In addition, the safety and immunogenicity of a
      booster dose of GSK134612 administered to all eligible subjects at 5 years after the primary
      vaccination will be evaluated.

      Another cohort of subjects (naïve control group) 15 to <31 years of age will be offered a
      dose of MenACWY-TT vaccine at the same time to allow for evaluation of a primary (naïve
      control group) and booster dose within the same study.
