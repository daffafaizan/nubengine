      same consequences investigators see in victims of weight stigma. Participants were randomly
      assigned to either manipulate their weight through wearing a fat suit prosthesis or to a
      control condition where they wore the same clothing that was on the fat suit but in their own
      size. Outcome variables were cortisol reactivity, psychological well-being, and food and
      drink consumption. Additionally, this study tested whether wearing the fat suit might serve
      as an effective weight stigma reduction effort.
