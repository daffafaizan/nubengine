      without cell salvage and RAP (control group, CG), followed by 200 patients with cell salvage
      and RAP (study group, SG). Both groups are defined by elective surgery and hemodynamically
      stable patients prior to the onset of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Based on our own data
      and current data from the literature, the investigators assume that the use of MAT in
      combination with RAP leads to at least an intraoperative reduction of the erythrocyte
      consumption of 15%. Consequently, the investigators calculated a case number of approximately
      200 patients per group.

      The study is set up with a control group under previous standard therapy. The data is
      recorded and analyzed descriptively. Qualitative comparisons will be made in the discussion
      of previously published data.
