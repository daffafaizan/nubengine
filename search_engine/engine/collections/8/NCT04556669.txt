      peripheral blood or from the tumor tissue. The CAR-T/CAR-TILs cells contains a anti-CD22 CAR
      structure and also carries a scFv fragment of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. After
      autologous SL22P CAR-T/CAR-TILs cells were transplanted back into patients, CAR-T would
      target CD22+B cells in the blood. This will promote the activation and amplification of CAR+
      cells, and secrete anti-PD-L1 scFv outside the cells to regulate the immunity and enhance
      anti-tumor activity. The CAR-TILs may reduce the severity of the adverse reactions than
      conventional TILs, which result from the combination of high dose IL-2 infusion.
