      clinically significant decrements in bone mineral density in the hip and spine, rendering
      more than 40% at present risk for osteoporotic fracture. Recent pharmacologic advances
      provide the opportunity to ameliorate or reverse this clinically significant loss of bone
      mineral density. Available agents such as bisphosphonates or growth hormone are each
      preferentially effective in the contexts of increased and decreased bone turnover,
      respectively. It is currently not known whether the decrease in bone mineral density in
      depression is associated with increased or decreased bone turnover because the many endocrine
      changes associated with depression of possible relevance to decreased bone mineral density
      have disparate effects on bone turnover dynamics. At present, the only definitive way to
      determine the status of bone turnover in humans is via bone biopsy and histomorphometric
      evaluation. In addition, bone marrow routinely obtained during standard bone biopsy would
      provide the opportunity to culture osteoblast and osteoclast progenitor cells to determine
      possible abnormalities in differentiation and function as a means of exploring the cellular
      and molecular mechanisms of decreased bone mineral density in depression. In light of the
      high incidence of depression in women, decreased bone mineral density in patients with past
      or current depression has considerable public health implications.
