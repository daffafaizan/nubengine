    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate, through clinical, microbiological and
      immunological tests, the changes during the experimental gingivitis and mucositis model,
      between teeth and implants, and between patients with a history of aggressive periodontitis
      and healthy individuals. 20 patients will be include, 10 healthy and 10 with a history of
      aggressive periodontitis. All patients must present the same type of implant and abutments,
      with prostheses in function for more than 6 months. They should also have a tooth located in
      the contralateral hemi-arch in a similar position, allowing a comparison with the implant.
      They will be submitted to the plaque-induced inflammation by suspension of oral hygiene only
      in the tested areas (tooth / implant), protected by a personalized stent made of plastic,
      according to the experimental gingivitis and mucositis model of 21 days of duration.
