      exposure to the virus and global personal protective equipment shortages. Preventing the
      infection of healthcare workers is critical the current epidemic situation when healthcare
      systems are under extreme pressure. There is a lack of evidence surrounding potential
      preventive strategies to decrease the incidence of COVID-19 among healthcare workers.

      Melatonin, an endogenous hormone involved in circadian rhythm control, is an inexpensive and
      safe product that has shown protective effects in bacterial and viral infections likely due
      to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects.

      SARS-CoV 2 seems to relatively spare younger children and those who are infected develop the
      severe forms of the disease very rarely. Peak melatonin serum levels are higher in younger
      children and decrease with age. These levels are also higher in women, specially during
      pregnancy, who also seem to be less affected by the virus when compared to men.

      The investigators hypothesize that elevating peak melatonin levels to a range similar to that
      of children by administering 2 mg of melatonin daily might prevent the infection with
      SARS-CoV 2 among exposed healthcare workers. The investigators also hypothesize that among
      those who develop the disease melatonin might prevent the more severe forms.
