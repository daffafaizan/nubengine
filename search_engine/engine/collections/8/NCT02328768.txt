      bowel syndrome and intestinal failure. Many common neonatal surgical diseases including
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intestinal atresias, and gastroschisis can cause intestinal
      failure. The recovery from these illnesses often involves prolonged periods of parenteral
      nutrition. Intestinal Failure Associated Liver Disease (IFALD) is the most prevalent
      complication of long term parenteral nutrition in children, affecting up to 2/3 of children
      with short bowel syndrome. Parenteral lipids are an important source of calories in children,
      and provide essential fatty acids. Development of IFALD is a multifactorial process.
      Phytosterols contained in soybean based lipid emulsions have been shown to predispose animals
      to IFALD. Previous studies in children have shown that dosing the soybean based parenteral
      lipid emulsion at doses greater than 1g/kg/day may contribute to the development of IFALD. It
      is currently our practice to limit the lipid dose in children at risk of development of IFALD
      to 1g/kg/day. Despite this, some patients will still develop biochemical evidence of
      cholestasis and IFALD. Previous studies in humans have shown that children with IFALD who
      were administered the intravenous fish oil lipid emulsion Omegaven® reduced their serum
      direct bilirubin levels. This may be due to a reduction in the amount of arachidonic acide
      derived inflammatory mediators. The investigators hypothesize that administering Omegaven® in
      place of conventional soybean fat emulsions may reverse or prevent the progression of PN
      associated cholestasis and thus allow the patient to be maintained on adequate PN until
      he/she is able to ingest adequate nutrition enterally.
