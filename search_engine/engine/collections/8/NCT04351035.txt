      following leukemia in children. The annual age-standardized incidence rate per 1,000,000
      person-years (ASR) of CNS tumour in international children's cancer incidence study is 20-30.
      In Asia, ASR of paediatric CNS tumours is around 15.0-24.9 in Japan, Korea, Singapore. For
      Chinese races including mainland of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, ASRs of paediatric CNS
      tumour are 15.0, 17.4 and 23.8.

      In 2017 in Shanghai, Children's Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was found in 5th CSPN (Chinese
      Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery) / 9th CPNF (China Pediatric Neurosurgery Forum)
      conference, with 35 founding member institutions and 30 founding observation member
      institutions in mainland of China. Based on this progress, national wide registry
      (CNOG-MC001) was settled to obtain basic information about CNS tumour cases, combined with
      available epidemiology data from publications to assess current medical situation on
      paediatric CNS tumours in China. The protocol of CNOG-MC001 was aligned by CSPN and CNOG
      member institutions in CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and the study ofiicially started right
      after the meeting on 20181027.

      The first step of this study is a national wide pre-survey to all 35 CNOG member institutions
      and other 22 CSPN members. The pre-survey data sheet included number of annual surgically
      treated paediatric CNS tumour cases (age ranging from 0 to 18 years old, classified by WHO
      Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System 2016 version), to assess the proper
      sites to be involved in this study. After retrieving the pre-survey results, large-scale,
      detailed case data sheets will be sent to participating institutions as members of CNOG-MC001
      collaborative group.
