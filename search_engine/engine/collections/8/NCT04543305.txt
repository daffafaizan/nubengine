    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation Phase 1 study of PRT1419, a MCL1
      inhibitor, evaluating patients in two cohorts as part of a 28-day treatment cycle in adult
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or
      MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap syndrome. Cohort A will evaluate PRT1419
      administered as monotherapy in patients with either AML, CMML and/or high-risk MDS or MDS/MPN
      overlap. Cohort B will evaluate PRT1419 administered as monotherapy in patients with NHL or
      MM. The study will employ a "3+3" dose escalation design. The dose may be escalated until a
      dose limiting toxicity is identified.
