      salt-substitute is a feasible means of lowering blood pressure in high-risk individuals in
      rural China. The randomised design and the large size (n=600) will ensure that the results
      are reliable and precise. The 12-month duration will address the long-term practicability of
      the intervention strategy. The study is being conducted because salt-substitute-based blood
      pressure lowering may be particularly appropriate for rural populations in low- and
      middle-income countries. First, sodium intake is often very high. Second, the salt-substitute
      can be easily incorporated into the diet because most food is prepared and eaten at home.
      Third, the intervention can be provided at very low cost.

      Comparisions: Low sodium high potassium salt (65% sodium chloride, 25% potassium chloride,
      10% magnesium sulphate) compared to normal salt (100% sodium chloride).
