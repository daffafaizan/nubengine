           intervention arm (NAC) or controlled arm (supportive therapy: prophylactic platelet
           transfusion was given when platelet count <20000/ul.)

        2. Response will be evaluated at day 90. Response was defined as platelet recovery to >=
           20000/ul for 7 consecutive days without transfusion support during the enrollment
           period. All the other patients not achieved above criteria was defined as no response.

        3. For those without response in both arms, patients will received NAC plus recombinant
           human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) for an additional 30 days. rhTPO was given at 300IU/kg/d
           for 28 consecutive days or platelet > 50000/ul independent of platelet transfusion.
