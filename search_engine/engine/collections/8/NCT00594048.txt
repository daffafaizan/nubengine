      Lowering blood pressure leads to a reduced risk of developing these complications. To treat
      hypertension effectively you can use blood pressure lowering drugs, but it is also important
      to use proven and safe non-pharmacological interventions. It is suggested that Breathing Rate
      and Systolic Blood Pressure can be linked directly together by the baroreflex. With the use
      of the Resperate, people will lower their breathing rate by breathing similar to music
      patterns which could theoretically lead, through the described link, to blood pressure
      reduction. Patients will be randomize into two groups: one will get a discman with freely
      chosen music and the other the Resperate. Patients are instructed to use the breathing device
      or discman for 15 minutes at about the same time every day during the 9 week study period,
      except for the first week.
