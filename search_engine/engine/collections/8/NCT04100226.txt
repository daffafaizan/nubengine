      to damage induced by a variety of agents such as viral infection and radiotherapy or
      environmental toxins.it is characterized by accumulation of myofibroblasts and excessive
      deposition of the extracellular matrix.Epithelial cells undergoes epithelial mesenchymal
      transition (EMT).

      Supplementation with vitamin D or its analogs suppresses lung fibrosis via triggering
      anti-fibrotic effect through attenuation of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B).vitamin D
      can reduce TGF-B expression and attenuate TGF-B induced epithelial mesenchymal transition in
      lung fibroblast and epithelial cells.
