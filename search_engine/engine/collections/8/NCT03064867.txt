      Establishment of safety of V+RICE in order to identify the recommended Phase II dose (RPD2)

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) of V+RICE relative to historical controls of
           RICE alone in r/r DLBCL.

        2. Determine the proportion of patients who proceed to autologous stem cell transplantation
           after V+RICE relative to historical controls.

        3. Describe the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients
           treated with V + RICE who do and do not proceed to auto-Stem Cell Transplant, relative
           to historical controls.

        4. Measure total number of peripheral blood stem cells collected in patients treated with V
           + RICE who proceed to stem cell mobilization/harvesting, compared to historical
           controls.
