      individual's self-reported respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, coughing and perceived
      mucus clearance through beneficial effects on lung function and airway clearance.
      Furthermore, the investigators expect a lower rate of hospitalization and use of antibiotics
      in the intervention group as compared to the control group.

      Finally, potential subgroup effects by gender, age, comorbidity and BMI at study entry will
      be explored for all outcomes.

      Based upon a sample size estimation the investigators assess that inclusion of 200
      participants in each intervention arm will be an adequate number. Based on the present
      testing strategy and COVID-19 incidence, current expectations are that two months should be
      enough to recruit 400 patients. The investigators will allow for recruitment to the end of
      December 2020, but will terminate enrolment at n = 400.

      Link to detailed protocol paper will be added once published.
