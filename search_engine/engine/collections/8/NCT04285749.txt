      subjects will receive the study drug, fluvastatin, for 2 weeks.

      The primary objective of this study to determine whether administration of fluvastatin
      changes the melanoma transcriptome

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether administration of fluvastatin
      changes the gene expression profile of Class 2 melanoma to Class 1 melanoma.
