      Oxaliplatin and will be administered in single doses of 1.8 Gy once daily and five times a
      week for 5 weeks.

      In the sixth treatment week a boost of 3 further radiations with 1.8 Gy will be applied.

      Simultaneous chemotherapy:

      Initially, in part A of the study the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) for the simultaneous
      chemotherapy will be identified with a 3-step dose escalation scheme:

      Level 1: Docetaxel: 20 mg/m2 Oxaliplatin 40 mg/m2 i.v., Level 2: Docetaxel: 20 mg/m2
      Oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2 i.v., Level 3: Docetaxel: 25 mg/m2 Oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2 i.v.,

      The treatment starts with 3 patients in level 1. If no dose limiting toxicities appear, it
      will be switched to dose level 2. The same applies for the switch from level 2 to level 3. If
      a DLT appears on one level, a further 3 patients will be treated within this dose level.

      If in one level at least 2 of 6 patients show DLT, the subjacent level will be defined as the
      maximum tolerable dose (MTD).
