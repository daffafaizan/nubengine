      Group 1: This group was randomized into a single-dose, 2-way crossover design. These
      participants received single administrations (day 1 dosing only) of Zegerid OTC Capsules, and
      Prilosec OTC Tablets (both at a 20 mg omeprazole dose), in a 2-way randomized order, with a
      minimum of a 2-week washout period between treatment legs. This group underwent a 24-hour
      intragastric pH study on each of the 2 dosing occasions.

      Group 2: This group was randomized into a 2-way crossover design in which they received 7
      days administration of Zegerid OTC Capsules and Prilosec OTC Tablets, respectively. As with
      the prior group, there was a minimum of a 2-week washout period between treatment legs.
      Participants assigned to this treatment group underwent 24-hour intragastric pH recordings on
      the days which they received their 1st and last (7th) dose of the two treatment drugs.

      In addition to the above detailed procedures, all participants (both groups) underwent a
      24-hour baseline intragastric pH study prior to starting their randomized treatments. This
      study design enabled all 60 participants to be evaluated for effects of the first dose of
      Prilosec OTC Tablets and Zegerid OTC Capsules on change in intragastric pH during the
      subsequent 24-hour period following the first dose.
