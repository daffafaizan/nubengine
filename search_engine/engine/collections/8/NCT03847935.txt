      inflammation, stiffness or snapping during movement. This can be very debilitating. Current
      treatment includes local steroid injection, oral NSAIDS, resting orthoses, physical or
      occupational therapy and surgical intervention. The aim of this prospective study with an
      observational design was to determine the outcome between surgical, hand therapy
      rehabilitation, and corticosteroid injection interventions for trigger finger. There were 6
      treatment groups: surgery, corticosteroid injection, 1 visit of hand therapy for orthosis
      fabrication and therapeutic exercise, hand therapy in combination with cortisone injection,
      Modality hand therapy alone (ongoing visits) or with corticosteroid injections.
