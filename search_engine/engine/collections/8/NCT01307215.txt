      use of the TAP block has been shown to reduce pain scores, opioid consumption and sedation
      scores. Also, there is a trend towards a reduction of post-operative nausea and vomiting. The
      aim of the block is to reach the distal nerve endings of the abdominal wall from T6 to L1
      dermatomes using ultrasound guidance with a single shot of ropivacaine at different volumes.
      Currently, there is consensus about optimal procedure-specific volumes and local anesthetic
      concentrations for lumbar TAP blocks. This is a pilot study and the purpose being is it
      feasible to do a large scale clinical study to determine the influence of increasing the
      local anesthetic volume.
