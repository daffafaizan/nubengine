      immobility. Whereas monitoring of depth of hypnosis, and muscle relaxation can be regarded as
      accepted, determination of the nociception is based on clinical signs like somatic or
      autonomic responses.

      Recently, the multivariate surgical stress index (SSI)has been demonstrated to correlate with
      surgical stress intensity. Thus, SSI might be a useful variable to adjust analgesic drug
      administration in individual patients.

      We want to investigate whether SSI is able to indicate nociception following standardized
      noxious stimulation during balanced sevoflurane - remifentanil anesthesia.
