      levels and diabetes there are also acute factors potentially triggering acute coronary
      events. The impact of air temperature (changes) or humidity are of potential relevance. In
      addition, exercise and the associated increase in oxygen demand of the myocardium and blood
      pressure is another trigger for plaque rupture and the acute onset of myocardial infarction.
      Male patients as well as patients with previous coronary heart disease or little regular
      exercise are at increased risk.

      Possible additional mechanisms of exercise induced myocardial infarction are vasospasm and
      changes in blood clotting.

      Changes in the ambient temperature (warm to cold) can also induce vasospasm which might
      result in reduced perfusion and plaque rupture. It seems that male patients are more involved
      than female patients.

      Taking the exercise and the ambient temperature changes into consideration, heavy snowfall
      with consecutive snow shoveling is an augmented risk for acute myocardial infarction.

      The rationale of the study is to test if the above mentioned constellation of environmental
      factors as well as potential increased exercise have a significant and independent impact on
      the incidence of myocardial infarctions
