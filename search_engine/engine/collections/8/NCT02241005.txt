      wipes, or the standard bath wipes, beginning on the day of admission, and to be used once
      daily for a period of 60 days post-HSCT. In the first 12 patients randomized to the
      experimental wipes, if no patient has grade IV skin toxicity that is attributable to the
      experimental wipes, then the trial will continue until a total of 250 evaluable participants
      have been enrolled. Assessment of skin colonization will be performed before admission, at
      the time of discharge, and post-HSCT.

      Randomization will take place at the time the participant is enrolled and will be performed
      by staff within the Nursing Research Department. Participants will be assigned to either
      experimental or standard bath wipes in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization may be stratified for
      nature of transplant (autologous vs. allogeneic); and in the case of allogeneic transplant
      stratified for total body irradiation vs. no total body irradiation. The investigators,
      practicing clinician and the clinical research staff will remain blinded to the treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the safety of the experimental bath wipes in 12 patients.

        -  Assess the skin colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci in patients using the
           experimental wipes compared to standard bath wipes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess skin colonization with bacterial pathogens.

        -  Compare the skin colonization with multi-drug resistant organisms (MRDO) and central
           line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates.
