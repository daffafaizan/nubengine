      Cardiology Intensive Care Units .

      The study is observational, multicentre, national and involves the collection of clinical
      data, both retrospectively and prospectively, using a web-based system. In conducting the
      study, no drugs are tested, nor are diagnostic tests or non-pharmacological therapies
      performed other than those that each participating cardiologist decides to perform following
      the rules of normal clinical practice. Diagnostic procedures and pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological therapies habitually prescribed for cardiovascular pathologies, which are
      the object of hospitalization, and those used in the event of a COVID-19 infection, will be
      recorded in the database.
