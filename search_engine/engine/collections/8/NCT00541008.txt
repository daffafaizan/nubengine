      Primary

        -  To determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with locally advanced or
           metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib malate.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  To determine time-to-event variables of overall survival, time to disease progression,
           time to response, and duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once a day on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then periodically
      thereafter.
