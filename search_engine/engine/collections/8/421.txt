974. extracorporeal hypothermia without thoracotomy.  an ex-perimental study in the use of cold for neurosurgery andcancericidal perfusionsthis paper includes minor clinical noteson open heart surgery and cancer perfusionbut contains no experimental informationon neurosurgery or cancer perfusions.  amethod of closed-chest hypothermic perfusionin 30 dogs is reported.  the authorsutilize drainage of superior and inferior cavaeby gravity.  the volume of venousdrainage sometimes enhanced by transfusionsor 12.5% low molecular weight dex-tran determined the flow rate.  cooling wasmaintained for quite variable periodsapparently generally to an unspecifiedesophageal temperature.  perfusion time va-ried from 30 min. to 4 hr.  animals withlow flows were perfused longer, had a high-er incidence of ventricular fibrillation,and a very low survival rate.  eleven ani-mals survived.  all had pre-cooling flowrates above 40 ml./kg./min., good flowrates during the perfusion, and only 3 hadventricular fibrillation.  flow rates andsurvival were increased in animals receivinglow molecular weight dextran.  four-teen of 15 animals with ventricular fibrillationwere defibrillated electrically, 8 re-gained 'adequate' cardiac function, but only 3survived.  some interesting data onregional cooling of the lower half of the bodyis presented.  the authors concludewithout sufficient evidence that the mostimportant factor in the mortality in hypo-thermic perfusion is the ability to maintain'a flow rate approaching the estimatednormothermic cardiac output of the animal'
