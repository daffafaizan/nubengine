      were included. Changes in visual acuity, metamorphopsia score (M-score) using M-chart, and
      parafoveal thickness of each retinal layer were evaluated preoperatively and at 2-month and
      6-month postoperative follow-up visits. Factors associated with visual acuity and M-score
      were investigated.
