    
      This trial is an open label, multi center single arm study to evaluate twice daily oral
      midostaurin with standard induction, consolidation chemotherapy with sequential midostaurin
      therapy for 5 treatment blocks (2 induction blocks, 3 consolidation blocks, followed by
      single agent midostaurin post consolidation therapy for 12 cycles.

      the total maximum planned duration on treatment is 17 cycles ( 5 blocks and 12 cycles). a
      block is defined as the time from start of study treatment to the time of hematopoietic
      recovery, at the latest at Day (D) 42, or determination of persistent disease, which occur
      first.

      patient will receive the firs course of induction chemotherapy according to local standard
      and duration is from 8 to 12 days. Upon FLT3 mutation is confirmed, patient will receive
      midostaurin for 14 days. After determination of remission and hematopoietic recovery, patient
      will receive Block 2.

      Block 2 FLADx treatment duration is D1 to D6, and midostaurin from D8 to D21. patient who
      achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of block 2 will
      receive block 3.

      Block3 consolidation HAM treatment duration is D1 to D4, followed by midostaurin D8 to D21
      .patient who achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of block
      3 will receive block 4.

      Block 4 HA3E treatment duration is D1 to D5 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patient who
      achieve hematopoietic recovery at the latest at D42 from the first day of block 4will receive
      block 5.

      Block 5 HiDAC treatment duration is D1 to D3 followed by midostaurin D8 to D21. Patient in
      continuous remission with hematopoietic recovery will receive continuous post consolidation
      therapy of midostaurin, during 12 cycles ( 28 days per cycle).

      in Part 1 of the study, patients in cohort of 3 will receive sequential midostaurin
      administered at 30mg/m2bid. if the 30mg/m2 bid is well tolerated as measured by the Dose
      Limited Toxicity ( DLT) rate during block 1, additional patients in cohort of 3 will be
      treated with sequential midostaurin at 60mg/m2 bid.

      when the recommended 2 dose (RP2D) is confirmed, subsequent patients will be treated in the
      part 2 of the study at the RP2D.
