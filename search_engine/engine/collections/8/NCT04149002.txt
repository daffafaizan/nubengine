      pregnant NHB women will be recruited who have a history of singleton preterm birth and are
      currently pregnant with a singleton gestation. Consenting participants will be randomized to
      the intervention or an active control. The intervention includes: 1) an informational
      narrated powerpoint presentation that reviews the logistical details of the IP3, 2)
      structured encouragement via text messages and 3) employment law education sheet. The
      powerpoints will also be available for review on our you-tube channel for intervention
      patients. The active control arm includes: 1) a narrated powerpoint describing the Duke
      Prematurity Prevention Program and 2) text messages with general pregnancy information (i.e.
      it is safe to take Tylenol in pregnancy). At study intake, we will collect demographic data
      (age, self-described race, pregnancy history, social history, pregnancy-related anxiety
      scale, interpersonal processes of care and maternal social support index.

      The team will collect feedback on the intervention based on an intake questionnaire and an
      exit interview.

      Information will also be collected on adherence to the IP3 based on review of the
      participant's medical record. The primary aim of the study is to evaluation feasibility and
      acceptability. These endpoints will be measured via enrollment and participant feedback
      during the exit interview.
