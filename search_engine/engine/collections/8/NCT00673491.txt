      patients. Prompt identification of symptoms, organised timely and efficient transportation
      towards appropriate facilities, has become essential part of effective treatment, as well as
      organized rehabilitation. The importance of organized stroke care in facilitating recovery
      has been recognized for the last 10 years, but it is still unclear how organized care
      contributes to improved outcomes. Since clinical pathways aim to promote evidence- and
      guideline-based care, improve the organisation and efficiency of care, and reduce cost, their
      implementation may be a method for achieving the organizational standards required to grant
      appropriate care in stroke. Even though in the past decade, care pathways have been
      increasingly implemented as a tool in acute stroke care and stroke rehabilitation the
      evidence supports partially the use of clinical pathways in stroke because very little
      prospective controlled data demonstrated their effectiveness through the continuum of the
      care. Our study was designed in order to conduct a rigorous evaluation of clinical pathways
      for treatment of acute stroke patients in different types of organized stroke care.
