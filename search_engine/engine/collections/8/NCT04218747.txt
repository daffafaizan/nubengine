      schools into food hubs and providing nutrition education to parents.

      Target Population: Elementary (n=30), middle (n=6), and high schools (n=2) in rural and urban
      VA. All schools had low academic performance and at least 50 percent of children eligible for
      free and reduced-price (FRP) meals.

      Intervention: Schools were randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Children
      in treatment schools received: (1) three meals during the school day and food packages for
      weekends and school breaks; (2) $60 monthly Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) benefits during
      summer months if they were eligible for FRP meals; and (3) nutrition education for their
      parents. The control group operated under "business as usual." Note that the $60 monthly
      benefit was not included in the evaluation of the demonstration.
