      and societal expenditure. While most bone injuries are not severe and are capable of healing
      through bone regeneration by natural callus formation with standard treatments, severe bone
      injuries may not heal, becoming an important unmet clinical need.

      Non-unions, or pseudarthrosis, may occur in 5% to 20% of long-bone fractures that fail to
      heal properly after more than 6 months, with morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and
      increased expenses. The most commonly accepted standard augmentation to procure fracture and
      non-union healing consists of autologous bone grafting, obtained from the same patient in a
      different surgical site and transplanted to the reconstruction site. However, autologous bone
      grafting has some drawbacks (such as persistent pain, scar, late recovery, limited amount of
      bone, etc) and a limited regeneration efficacy (success rate of about 74%) and high societal
      cost. Culture-expanded autologous MSCs combined with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP)
      biomaterial granules have been claimed as a solid regenerative medicine alternative to
      autologous bone grafting in non-unions, although current data are limited. In this context,
      the ORTHOUNION initiative focuses on the opportunity to test the hypothesis of superiority of
      MSC, the investigational ATMP, versus the currently accepted standard therapy, iliac crest
      bone autograft to biologically augment surgical treatment of long-bone non-unions.
