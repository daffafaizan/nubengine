    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To correlate in vitro drug sensitivity testing with clinical response by determining the
      rate of in vitro drug sensitivity to panobinostat, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone singly and
      in combination, doublets and triplets.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To monitor response rates (partial response [PR], very good partial response [VGPR], and
      complete response) using the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria
      for Multiple Myeloma.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Progression free survival and overall survival will be assessed for up to 3 years after
      last dose.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panobinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, and 19. Patients also
      receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo collection of blood and/or bone marrow samples
      for testing via in vitro chemosensitivity assay.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 3
      years.
