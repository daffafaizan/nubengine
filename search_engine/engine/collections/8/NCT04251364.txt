      populations of highlanders being found in South America (Andean), central Asia (Tibetan and
      Sherpa) and East Africa (Ethiopian). Despite unique adaptations to hypoxia in these
      populations, chronic mountain sickness (CMS) is a clinical syndrome which is observed in
      5-33% of individuals residing permanently at high altitude.Several pharmacological approaches
      have been proposed in the treatment of EE and CMS. However, few studies show sufficient
      clinical evidence for safety and efficacy in CMS treatment and most highlanders with CMS
      remain untreated. The present project aims to better characterize chronic hypoxic responses
      in highlanders and to evaluate the interest of acetazolamide and statins as potential
      treatments for chronic mountain sickness.
