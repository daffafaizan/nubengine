      have exclusively ingested amnesic substances to a subject control group that has made IMV
      with non-amnesic substances such as paracetamol. The purpose of this comparison is to ensure
      that memory problems are not related to the context of the suicidal crisis.

      The second step will be able to relate the memory score of the predictor variables. To
      achieve this, it will perform a multivariate linear regression in each group in order to
      confirm the results of the pilot study and to be able to regress in the control group which
      was not possible in the pilot study because of the lack of effective.

      Finally, this study will try to establish, using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
      curves, thresholds for cognitive scores and begin to develop a tool for clinical practice.
