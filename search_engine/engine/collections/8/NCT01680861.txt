    
      A. Primary Objectives:

        1. The percentage of patients who develop chronic allograft injury (CAI) progression during
           the first 12 months post-transplant protocol biopsy (i.e., higher grade of IF/TA at
           either the 6 or 12 month protocol biopsy in comparison with the baseline biopsy).

        2. The incidence rate of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) during the first 12 months
           post-transplant.

      B. Secondary Objectives:

        1. Adverse events including graft loss (death-censored and death-uncensored), and death at
           12 months post-transplant.

        2. Incidence rate and severity (severity of CAI at 12 months as well), based upon careful
           review of all clinically indicated and protocol biopsies.

        3. Renal function as determined by serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration
           rate (eGFR) (calculated using the abbreviated MDRD formula) at 12, months
           post-transplant. Use of multivariable analysis to compare renal function as well as BPAR
           and CAI progression will also be performed (particularly, after adjusting for the
           significant effects of donor age, recipient age, race/ethnicity, and any other
           predictors).

      5. Adverse events including withholding (for â‰¥ 28 days) or discontinuance of study
      medications (and reasons why), new onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT),
      infections requiring hospitalization, and requirement of anti-lipid medication at 12 months
      post-transplant.

      6. Avoidance of the requirement for maintenance corticosteroid therapy after renal
      transplantation.

      7. Allowance of reduced maintenance tacrolimus dosing (rTd).
