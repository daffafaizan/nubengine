      undergo exercise under a supervised setting for a total duration of 12 weeks. Patients will
      perform endurance (treadmill or cycle ergometer), strength (weight resistance) and
      flexibility training twice a week for a period of an hour per session. Exercises will be
      supervised by physiotherapists or exercise physiologists. Compliance and performance will be
      monitored by the trainer. They will receive a pedometer for home use. The Home based program
      group will perform REST for 10 minutes daily, increasing to 20 minutes daily, after the
      second week, in their home environment. The total duration of the intervention will be 12
      weeks. Patients will be provided with pedometers, REST video and binder, with instructions on
      how to perform exercises, and resistance bands.
