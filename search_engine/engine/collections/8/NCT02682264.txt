    
      This was a multicenter, open label, long-term extension study for CB-03-01 cream, 1% focused
      on safety in male and female participants, 9 years or older who completed one of the Phase 3
      pivotal studies [CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26]. Participants applies the active medication
      (CB-03-01 cream, 1%) twice daily to the entire face and, if designated by investigator AND
      desired by the participant, truncal acne for nine additional months of treatment. Thus,
      overall participants were exposed to CB-03-01 cream, 1% for a total treatment of up to 12
      months (0 or 3 months in the Phase 3 pivotal study and an additional nine months in this
      long-term safety study).

      Participants treated facial acne per protocol for nine months. Treatment of truncal acne was
      discussed by the investigator and participant. Treatment on the face and/or trunk was
      discontinued if/when acne clears and re-started if/when acne worsens, according to the
      assessment of the investigator for each respective treatment area (i.e., face and trunk).

      Participants were rolled over from the Phase 3 pivotal studies [CB-03-01/25 and CB-03-01/26]
      into this long-term, safety study in order to achieve at least 300 participants on-study at 6
      months and 100 participants on-study at 12 months.
