    
      This study consists of two parts (Part 1: Safety; and Part 2: Expansion). First, the subjects
      will be enrolled in Safety Part with IMAB362 dose-1/2 (Arm A). Then the safety and
      tolerability of Arm A will be evaluated at Tolerability Evaluation Meeting (TEM). If there
      are no safety and tolerability concerns, enrollment for the Safety Part with IMAB362 dose-3
      (Arm B) and the Expansion Part with IMAB362 dose-1/2 will be opened. For each part,
      participants who continue to derive clinical benefit and do not have intolerable toxicity
      from study treatment will be allowed to remain on treatment until treatment discontinuation
      criterion is met.
