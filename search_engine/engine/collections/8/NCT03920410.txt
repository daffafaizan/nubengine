      40) and healthy controls (n = 20) will perform an emotional and the arithmetic task and
      receive visceral stimuli (by using a barostat) while placed in a functional magnetic
      resonance imaging scanner respectively during two different states, a) after oral
      administration of 10 mg Escitalopram, a well-known drug classified as Selective Serotonin
      Reuptake Inhibitor, packed in a coloured hydroxypropylmethylcellulose capsule, and b) during
      oral administration of a placebo, in a double-blinded randomized cross-over fashion.
      Background characteristics will be collected.
