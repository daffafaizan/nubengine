      patients who are going to undergo thoracoscopic lung surgery were selected according to the
      criteria of admission and exclusion. The risk and benefit were informed and the informed
      consent of the subjects was signed. The patients were numbered and randomly divided into two
      groups: group A with vagus nerve preservation during minimally invasive surgery and group B
      with traditional minimally invasive surgery for early lung cancer. The incidence of pulmonary
      complications within 5 weeks after operation (see the evaluation criteria for details),
      operation time, intraoperative bleeding volume, postoperative drainage volume, postoperative
      mortality, incidence of cardiovascular complications, rate of re-tracheal intubation, rate of
      re-admission to ICU, duration of stay in ICU, hospitalization costs were observed.
      Statistical analysis and evaluation of the safety of preserving pulmonary branches of vagus
      nerve in minimally invasive surgery and the effectiveness of preventing or reducing pulmonary
      complications after minimally invasive surgery.
