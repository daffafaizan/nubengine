      polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the relative cell adhesion response of PMNs, and the
      leukocyte population in tear samples collected from contact lens wearers and non-contact lens
      wearers. Tear samples were collected via a binocular eye-wash. The samples were processed,
      and a cell count was performed using a hemacytometer. Flow cytometry was used to determine
      the expression of different PMN cell markers before and after stimulation with bacterial
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
