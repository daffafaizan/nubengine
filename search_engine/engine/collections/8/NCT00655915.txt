      nerve in the wrist. Symptoms usually are pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist,
      radiating up the arm. Corticosteroid injections have been utilized in the conservative
      management of carpal tunnel syndrome for several decades. They have been shown to be
      relatively safe with a very low reported complication rate. Recent efforts in the literature
      have shown they are efficacious for a majority of patients although their effects are usually
      transient. Several studies have attempted to show a predictive value of corticosteroid
      injection with regard to who will ultimately benefit from carpal tunnel release. There is a
      trend towards positive predictability with several retrospective studies showing that
      patients who have a clinical benefit from steroid injection are more likely to have a
      successful outcome from carpal tunnel release. Carpal tunnel release remains the definitive
      treatment option for carpal tunnel syndrome, and a clinical test which could give the
      practitioner and patient additional information regarding likelihood of successful outcome of
      surgery would be a valuable prognostic tool.
