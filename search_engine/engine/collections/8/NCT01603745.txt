    
      PCOS is the most common female endocrinopathy in reproductive age. This syndrome is a
      heterogeneous condition characterized by several symptoms and clinical signs related to
      reproductive, cardiometabolic and psychological disorders.We recently demonstrated that young
      PCOS women show an expansion of an unusual T-cell population with proinflammatory functions,
      identified by CD4+CD28null T lymphocytes . Of note, this T subpopulation has been found to be
      expanded in patients with unstable angina, type 2 diabetes (DM2), in absence of clinical
      evidence of CVD 12, and has been recently associated to recurrent coronary instability .Based
      on the above mentioned evidences, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of
      DRPS/EE alone versus metformin alone versus DRPS/EE plus metformin on the CD4+CD28null T
      cells frequency and on endocrino-metabolic parameters, in hyperinsulinemic PCOS patientsTo
      evaluate long-term effects of drospirenone (DRSP)/ethinylestradiol (EE) and NOMAC-valerate
      estardiol on some cardiovascular risk factors in PCOS patients.
