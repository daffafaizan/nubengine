      and translation of clinical practice, as the same devices are already used in this setting,
      and operators have familiarity with the equipment. Incorporating another additional method to
      generate contrast for determining malignant tissue from normal based on biomechanical
      properties with the same probe would have benefit as an additional diagnostic modality.
