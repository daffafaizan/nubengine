      women can improve post abortion person-centered care, perceived social support, post-abortion
      family planning, and reduce perceptions of social stigma and stress. Women were randomized to
      one of three study arms: personalized communication with a peer counselor or nurse who
      received person-centered care (PCC) training, or a control arm where participants received
      the standard of care.
