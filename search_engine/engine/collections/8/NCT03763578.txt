      The present clinical trial will be conducted to reject or accept the null hypothesis that
      using Licorice extract mouth wash in addition to standard preventive measures will not differ
      from using standard preventive measures alone in preventing incidence of new carious lesions.

      PICOTS:

      P: Population with high caries risk patients

      I: Use of licorice.

      I2: Use of chlorhexidine

      C: Use of standard preventive measures (tooth brushing, tooth paste, interdental cleaning).

      O.1: Primary outcome is incidence of new carious lesions

      T: Time for measurement is 12 months

      S: A Randomized controlled clinical trial (Parallel study)
