      insulin injections (MDI). If glucose toxicity resolves, the regimen may potentially be
      simplified, but there are no specific guidelines regarding this and a lot of patients are
      left on MDI.

      The Investigators aimed to examine prospectively the safety and efficacy of switching from
      MDI to once daily IDegLira, a fixed-ratio combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide, in
      relatively well controlled (HbA1c<7.5%) subjects with type 2 diabetes using low total daily
      insulin dose (TDD).

      The investigators hypothesize that in everyday clinical practice switching from low dose MDI
      to IDegLira in patients of different ages with well-controlled (or overcontrolled) type 2
      diabetes is safe, may induce weight loss and result in similar or better glycemic control.
