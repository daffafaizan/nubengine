      therefore percussor palm cups facilitate caregivers and physiotherapists. The palm cup mimics
      the air compressed through cupped hands and can be used in conjunction with other
      physiotherapy techniques and has been shown to have a positive impact on symptoms. Engineers
      at McMaster University have developed 3D-printed prototypes to use with percussor cups that
      are made with material similar in consistency and flexibility to the no longer manufactured,
      standard cup. These cups will be tested in infants and children with cystic fibrosis
      recruited from the Cystic Fibrosis Clinic at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton,
      Ontario.

      Patients/guardians/caregivers will be given 3 percussor palm cups to use over the course of 6
      days (one standard cup and two 3D-printed). Each cup will be trialed for 2 days, allowing for
      equal time dedicated to each. Demographic data and characteristics will be collected at
      baseline, and measures of safety and usability will be completed at the end of the week of
      use. Overall satisfaction will be recorded at the end of the questionnaire. Participants will
      be asked to rate percussion palm cups from least preferred to most preferred and an
      open-ended question to explain their reasoning on the experience.

      Thus, the purpose of the study is to examine the safety, usability and user experience of
      newly designed percussion palm cups using 3-D printing. The results of this study will have
      important implication to the management of infants and children with CF given the percussion
      palm cup shortage.
