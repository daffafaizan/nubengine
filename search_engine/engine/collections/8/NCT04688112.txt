      travels through biological tissues, it is absorbed by bones, skin pigments and both venous
      and arterial blood. However, as light is more strongly absorbed by blood than the surrounding
      tissues, the changes in blood flow can be detected by PPG sensors as changes in the intensity
      of light.

      The signal from PPG is proportional to the quantity of blood flowing through the blood
      vessels and even small changes in blood volume can be detected using this method. Analysis of
      the waveform can provide information on a range of physiological measurements affecting the
      cardiovascular and respiratory systems. PPG is widely used in medicine in the form of pulse
      oximeters using sensors applied to peripheral digits.

      Recently, it has been shown that PPG data can be obtained using images acquired from videos
      taken using the camera on smartphones and there is now a significant and growing body of
      published literature to support this.

      perfexia Health Technologies has developed a system of obtaining these data using a 15 second
      video selfie.

      At this time, the technology has been shown to be reasonably accurate when compared to home
      devices in healthy subjects. However, to make the technology more widely useful, the results
      obtained by video selfies need to be formally validated.

      The aim of the study therefore is to compare measurements obtained from video selfies with
      measurements taken using already validated machines in the same patients.
