264. fluorescent antibodies to human cancer-specific dna andnuclear proteinsspecific antigens have been demonstratedin certain cancers.  in this study they wereobtained from an adenocarcinoma of thecolon and an ewing's sarcoma.  homogenateswere prepared and male rabbits wereimmunized.  the animals were bled to death10 days after the last injection.  testingincluded fluorescent antibody methods andagar-gel horizontal double-diffusion precipitintest.  the pattern of reaction of theseantibodies against various cancers seems tobe dependent upon the source of thecancerous dna-bound proteins and the saltconcentration used in their isolation.human cancer-specific cross nuclear antigensseem to be cross reacting ratherthan identical in structure.  the cancer-specificantibodies could be removed onlywith absorption of the immune globulins withcancerous tissues.  salt-soluble humandna-bound proteins from an adenocarcinomaof the colon and an ewing's sarcomainduced the formation of cancer specificantibodies which showed positive fta re-actions (to a maximum titer of 1/128) against95% of the cancerous tissues studied.these cancer-specific antibodies gavesimilar fta reactions with cell nuclei ofnormal appearing liver parenchymaadjacent to metastatic carcinoma of colon, nor-mal appearing colon near to metastaticcarcinoma of the colon, normal appearingcolon near to carcinoma of the colon,and a long-standing case of chronic ulcerativecolitis.  evidence is shown that this findingpossibly may represent a serologicaldetection of an early or latent cancerouschange in morphologically normal cells.these cancer-specific antigens have beenidentified as rounded, intranuclear dna-bodies and nuclear proteins which can bespecifically destroyed by dnase trypsin.
