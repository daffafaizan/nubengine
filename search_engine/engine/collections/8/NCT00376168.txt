      assess the safety and efficacy of prGCD in 30 untreated patients with Gaucher disease.
      Patients will receive IV infusion of prGCD every two weeks at the selected medical center.
      The duration of the study will be nine months. At the end of the 9-month treatment period (20
      visits, 38 weeks) eligible patients will be offered enrollment in an open-label extension
      study.

      There will be two treatment groups, 15 patients in each treatment group.

      Treatment Group I: 30 units/kg every 2 weeks. Treatment Group II: 60 units/kg every 2 weeks.

      All patients will have pharmacokinetic data collected over approximately 3 hours with
      frequent blood samples following the first and final doses of prGCD.
