    
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) are a heterogeneous group of malignant clonal diseases of
      the blood system originating from precursor cells of hematopoiesis, predominantly of lymphoid
      differentiation.

      More than 7,200 new cases of ALL are diagnosed annually in the European Union (EU), with
      approximately 40% (approximately 3,000 cases) occurring in adults The main reason for the
      failure of treatment of acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) is the primary
      refractoriness to chemical exposure and relapses of the disease, which actually occur in
      40-50% of adult patients with ALL. The prognosis in these cases is regarded as extremely
      unfavorable. Escalation of the chemotherapeutic approach is associated with the development
      of severe toxic infectious and hemorrhagic complications.

      The active substance of the preparation GNR-084 is a bispecific antibody to CD19 / CD3 in the
      BiMS format (bispecific IgG-like molecules).
