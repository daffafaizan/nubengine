      associated with a deterioration of disease self-management and poor health outcomes.
      Effective interventions are needed to prepare youth for transition to adulthood and adult
      care. To prospectively assess the impact of an education program based on motivational
      interviewing on self-management skills and glycemic control in youth with Type 1 diabetes
      (T1D).

      Methods: After parental consent and youth assent, investigators prospectively randomized 66
      adolescents 13-18 years old with type 1 diabetes to either usual care (regular medical
      consultation) or usual care supplemented by sessions with a nurse educator using a
      motivational interviewing (MI) approach and goal setting based on responses to the Transition
      Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) and T1D specific self-management skills. Primary
      outcomes were TRAQ change scores and HbA1c levels between baseline and 6 months.
