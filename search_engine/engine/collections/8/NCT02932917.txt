      events, and even in relapse events. It follows that providing individual smokers with
      spatially explicit and temporally dynamic intervention messages may support smoking cessation
      attempts.

      The investigators have built a mobile phone application-MayMySmoke-that allows individuals to
      capture each smoking event at the times and places they occur, and tag the events with
      qualitative metadata. The app also allows individuals to document and describe craving
      events. The goal of the app is first to understand an individual's smoking profile, and
      second to support them with dynamic text messages.

      The investigators are deploying the app in a clinical setting-the United Kingdom's National
      Health Service, within the Fife region of Scotland. Using two feasibility studies of
      increasing size, the investigators are attempting first to get initial feedback on the app,
      and then to improve the app and deploy it across a broader community of smokers.

      Though the app is targeted to smoking behavior, it is possible to extend it to include other
      negative health behaviors that may have a spatial component.
