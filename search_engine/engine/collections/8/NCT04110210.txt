      in 2016 as a regional block for the treatment of thoracic neuropathic pain. This has shown
      promise as an alternative to neuraxial blockade for a variety of surgeries with good effect.
      In addition, the block has a reduced risk of epidural hematoma, direct spinal cord injury,
      and central infection .

      The proposed mechanism of action of the ESPB is via blockade of the dorsal and ventral rami
      of the spinal nerves and sympathetic nerve fibers. Radiographic evidence suggests that local
      anesthetic injected into at the ESP spreads both cranially and caudally as the plane is
      continuous along the vertebral column . ESPB reportshave demonstrated analgesia at cervical,
      thoracic, and lumbar levels for procedures such aspyeloplasty, lipoma excision, breast
      reconstruction,malignant mesothelioma, inguinal hernia repairs, and hip reconstructions
