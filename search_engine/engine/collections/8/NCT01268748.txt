      transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy with conventional 4-port laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. 120 patients are included with a 1:1 randomization. Three centers
      participate in the trial.

      Inclusion criteria: Female patients, ASA I-III, age between 18 and 75 years, elective
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of biliary pain or recent uncomplicated biliary
      pancreatitis.

      Exclusion criteria: Expected poor compliance, history of cholecystitis or severe
      pancreatitis, previous open upper abdominal surgery, pregnancy or lactation, preoperative
      chronic pain or conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery.

      Pain and nausea is measured on VAS before the operation and 3 hrs, 1 day, 2 days and 3 days
      after the operation.

      Cosmesis is evaluated after 28 days.

      Patients are telephone-interviewed after 12 months and asked about port hernia formation. If
      hernia is suspected patients are called in for an abdominal ultrasonography.
