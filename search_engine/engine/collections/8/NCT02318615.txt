      as many as 50% of patients undergoing lymph node dissection go on to develop lymphedema, with
      significantly decreased quality of life with frequent infections, decreased range of motion,
      and a cosmetic deformity. The treatment of lymphedema was be frustrated by technical
      difficulties and gave rise to a heavy budget burden. Some retrospective studies revealed that
      immediate and delayed breast reconstruction with lattismus dorsi flap brought unexpected
      relief to the upper limb lymphedema. The current study was composed to assess whether
      transferring a pedicled partial latissimus dorsi muscle flap to the axilla would prevent the
      occurrence of post-mastectomy lymphedema.

      This prospectively designed cohort study have two parallel arms. Patients undergoing axillary
      dissection would be recruited to one of the two groups, according their own preference.
