        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate in combination with
           sunitinib malate in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

        -  To determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the antitumor activity in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-14 in course 1 and on days 1-42
      in all subsequent courses. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive oral imatinib
      mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected on day 15 and day 43 for pharmacokinetics.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.
