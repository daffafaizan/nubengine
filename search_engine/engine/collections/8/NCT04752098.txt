      bone assessment has become especially vital with the recognition of metabolic bone disease
      (MBD) of prematurity. Bone assessment became especially vital during last decades with the
      growing emphasis on metabolic bone disease of prematurity and low-birth-weight infants.
      Statistics shows that up to 50% of low birth weight and preterm newborns are likely to
      develop metabolic bone disease. Currently, no screening test has been shown to provide both
      sensitive and specific evidence of developing MBD over the first several weeks of life in the
      premature infants. Therefore, there is a need for a non-invasive tool for evaluation of
      infant bone health. This study will be conducted on premature infants at risk for MBD at
      multiple time points during their growth, with full term infants as controls. vibro-acoustic
      analysis (VAA) measurements will be done on the tibia. VAA measurements for the premature
      infants will be compared to those of full term infants. Performance of VAA in identifying
      osteopenia and its ability to monitor the response to treatment will be evaluated. The
      investigators will use an ultrasound system that has been used in the pilot study and employ
      a transducer with a smaller footprint for pediatric application.
