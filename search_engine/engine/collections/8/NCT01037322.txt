      incidence. Treatment includes various immunocompromising agents including corticosteroids,
      immunomodulators and biologic agents. Current treatment is not always effective and has many
      side effect.

      Cannabinoids have been known to have anti inflammatory effect, probably via the CB2 receptor.
      There are many anecdotal reports of cannabinoids in inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid
      arthritis, and the impression is that cannabinoids do have an ameliorating effect on IBD and
      that side effects are negligible. However, there are no placebo controled trials in human
      subjects.

      The cannabis plant contains about 600 ingredients, and it is not known which are the active
      ingredients affecting IBD. The most effective anti inflammatory compound known today is
      cannabidiol. Cannabidiol can be extracted from the cannabis plant, it has no central effect
      and is fat soluble so it can be given as drops in oil. Doses of up to 500mg did not cause any
      side effects.

      The aim of the proposed study is to examine in a double blind placebo controlled fashion the
      effect of cannabidiol on disease activity in patients with IBD.
