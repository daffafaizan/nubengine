      reached during renal replacement therapy. Drug producing companies are not able to come
      forward with appropriate dosing recommendation in patients needing renal replacement therapy.

      To achieve our study goal we plan:

        1. To measure serum-concentrations of antiinfective drugs applied to the patients

        2. To measure concentrations of antiinfective drugs in hemofiltration fluids.

        3. To compare the actual measured concentrations with concentration predicted in known
           calculation tools.

        4. To modify these calculation tools if necessary for better prediction.
