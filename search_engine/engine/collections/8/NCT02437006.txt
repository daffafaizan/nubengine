      recruited, and they are assessed and recorded with sympathetic nerve testing, anthropometry,
      and twice symptom-limit exercise capacity tests.The second stage would recruited 90 subjects
      with stroke (onset>2 weeks), and they are randomized to one of three groups. The control
      group undergoes traditional rehabilitation only, The low-intensity exercise group receives a
      low-intensity four-week cycle ergometry and traditional rehabilitation. The The
      high-intensity exercise group gets a high-intensity four-week cycle ergometry and traditional
      rehabilitation. They are evaluated by sympathetic tests, anthropometry, functional scales and
      activity questionnaires, and symptom-limit exercise capacity tests before and after the
      four-week training.
