      Lactobacillus reuteri-containing probiotic suspension as an adjunct to scaling and root
      planing (SRP).

      Material and Methods: Twenty sites from twelve chronic periodontitis patients were recruited
      and monitored clinically and microbiologically at baseline, three, and six months after
      therapy for plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PPD) and
      clinical attachment level (CAL) and microbiologically or Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.
      gingivalis) load. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were scheduled within one week for
      two sessions of SRP performed using ultrasonic scalers and hand instrumentation. After SRP,
      oral hygiene measures were reassured and then sites were randomly allocated to one of the two
      groups 10 sites each. group I (SRP only) and group II (SRP + probiotic). Group II received
      SRP and sub-gingival delivery of 1ml of probiotic L. reuteri suspension at baseline
      (immediately after SRP), one, two and four weeks using blunt syringe. Periodontal dressing
      was applied after placement of the drug.
