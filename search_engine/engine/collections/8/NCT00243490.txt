      Photosan® (2mg/kg) during 15~30 minutes, 48 hours prior to a standard craniotomy. Precautions
      are taken not to expose the patient in the operating room to direct room or operating light
      and to shield the skin of the flap during operation. Steroids are withdrawn 2-3 days prior to
      sensitization. After maximal resection, the surface of the tumor bed will be calculated and
      the generated cavity kept with a balloon containing intralipid (0.1%) or saline and/or
      artificial spinal fluid in it. A fiber with a spherical diffuser will be centered in the
      cavity and the surface irradiated with red (625~635nm) Halogen light. The dose of light
      irradiation depends on individual condition of the patient, usually with an energy density of
      100 J/cm2 at a power density of 500 mW/cm2 to 600 mW/cm2.
