      the usual way. If lymphoma is confirmed the patient will undergo a full staging evaluation
      and entry into either part A or B of the study will then be considered as follows:

        -  clinico-pathological (part A) for patients with MALT lymphoma of the ocular adnexae
           (MLOA) and eligible for treatment with Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks ; or

        -  pathology only (part B) for patients with other types of ocular lymphoma, inflammatory
           lesions or those ineligible/unwilling for treatment with doxycycline.
