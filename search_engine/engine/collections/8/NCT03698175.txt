    
      Background and objective:

      Previous research indicates that various physiological treatments for depression (especially
      antidepressant drugs) can induce positive biases in emotional information processing and it
      has been suggested that this might be a crucial common mechanism through which they exert
      their clinical effects. This study aims to investigate whether similar positive biases can
      also be induced by a brief mental exercise (developed and widely used within the field of
      positive psychology) that has previously been shown to have antidepressant and/or
      happiness-enhancing effects.

      Methods:

      Using a double-blind, parallel-group design, 100 healthy volunteers (male and female) are
      randomly allocated to a 7-day mental exercise practice conducting either the widely reported
      Three Good Things (TGT) exercise or a previously established placebo condition (unspecific
      childhood memory recall). After 7 days of practice, all participants undergo testing with the
      Oxford Emotional Test Battery in order to assess emotional information processing in
      different cognitive domains. This battery consists of a facial expression recognition task,
      an emotional categorization task, an emotional dot probe task, an emotional recall task and
      an emotional recognition task. In addition, prior to and immediately after the 7-day practice
      period salivary cortisol awakening response and subjective state (using various
      questionnaires) is assessed.

      Hypotheses:

      The working hypothesis of the study is that, similar to physiological antidepressant
      interventions, the TGT exercise (as compared to the placebo exercise) might induce biases
      towards positive stimuli in multiple cognitive domains.

      Implications of the study:

      This study will show whether engaging in a simple mental exercise can alter emotional
      information processing in a similar way as previously observed for antidepressant drugs and
      other physiological interventions.
