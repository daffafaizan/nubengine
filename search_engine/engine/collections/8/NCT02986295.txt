    
      A prospective, open, multicenter, and observational study will register and compare Xience®
      groups treated in institutions such as the BioMime ™, Ultimaster® group prospectively
      registered from June 2016.

      The Xience® group has already been registered in the previous study (SMARTDESK-BX), so
      BioMimeTM and Ultimaster® only need to be registered. Follow-up will be conducted until
      December 2019, and e-CRF will be completed by April 2020.
