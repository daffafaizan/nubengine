    
      This is a single ascending dose study of ARCT-810 in which approximately 30 subjects are
      planned to be enrolled. The length of each study participant is approximately 8 weeks from
      screening to last study visit.

      Study participants will be allocated to one of the five different study groups (also called
      cohorts), to test different doses of ARCT-810. There will be 6 participants in each group.
      Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive ARCT-810 or placebo as an IV
      infusion.
