      immediately before surgery and works by killing or preventing the growth or spread of
      bacteria. Data exists in both the orthopedic and cardiac literature to show that an
      additional preoperative use of chlorhexidine further reduces the risk of post procedure
      infections. Limited data exists regarding the use of a preoperative use of chlorhexidine in
      patients undergoing Obstetric or Gynecologic procedures and there is no wash or cloth used
      prior to cesarean section as a standard of care. The hope for this study is to identify if an
      additional preoperative chlorhexidine wash will further decrease or prevent infection in
      women who deliver their babies via cesarean section.

      All patients with a scheduled cesarean section surgery will be approached for enrollment
      during their pre-admission testing visit on the labor floor 2 days before the scheduled
      cesarean section, a visit that is standard procedure for this surgery. Once a patient is
      consented, she will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 arms of the study: the eligible
      women will be randomized to use of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) cloths or placebo cloths
      (a fragrance free cleansing cloths) on the body the night before and the morning of their
      scheduled procedure. Participants will be blinded to the arm in which they have been
      assigned.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of 2% chlorhexidine gluconate cloths
      prior to cesarean section reduces the rate of surgical site wound infection and/or postpartum
      endometritis, which is an infection or inflammation of the endometrium (the inner lining of
      the uterus).
