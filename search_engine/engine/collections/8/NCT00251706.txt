      randomized to receive oral amiodarone (10 mg/kg/day) or its matching placebo from six days
      before surgery through 6 days after surgery. The major outcome tracked was the incidence of
      more than 5 minutes of an atrial tachyarrhythmia that prompted therapy by the sixth
      post-operative day. Safety was assessed by the incidence of dosage reduction of blinded
      therapy, non-fatal post-operative complications, and in-hospital mortality. The randomization
      scheme was stratified to permit separate analysis of patients less than versus more than or
      equal to 65 years of age, patients having coronary artery bypass surgery alone versus those
      having valve surgery with or without concomitant bypass surgery, and patients also receiving
      versus not also receiving concomitant therapy with a beta-blocker medication.
