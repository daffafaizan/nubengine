      exposure. Current treatments include surgery, curettage/desiccation and some topical
      pharmaceutical therapies, which are often cosmetically disfiguring. Non-invasive alternative
      therapy for treatment of SCC lesions is thus being researched. Sap from the plant Euphorbia
      peplus has been used for many years in Australia as a "folk" remedy to treat a number of skin
      conditions. The active component of Euphorbia peplus has been isolated and made into a gel
      applied directly to the skin by Peplin Ltd. To date, three well-controlled studies with
      PEP005 gel in humans have been completed. In the first and second completed studies, sixteen
      (1st study) and sixty-four (2nd study) patients received one or two applications of PEP005
      0.0025% or 0.01% or 0.05% or vehicle gel to actinic keratoses. In the third completed study,
      sixty patients received two applications of PEP005 0.0025% or 0.01% or 0.05% or vehicle gel
      to superficial basal cell carcinomas. Results from all studies show good tolerance and
      evidence of activity.

      The current study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two applications of
      0.05% PEP005 gel in patients with SCCIS on the extremities, trunk or face. Approximately 24
      patients are planned to be included from multiple Australian centers. Patients will have two
      visits for treatment application and will return for check-up visits the day after the first
      application and several times thereafter for 2-3 months.
