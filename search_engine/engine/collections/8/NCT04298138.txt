      Human Challenge (DENV-3-LVHC) in a dose ranging study. Subjects will be closely monitored for
      the first 28 days with continued follow up through 6 months. Clinical and laboratory
      parameters, viremia and antibody levels will be assessed. The goal is to determine the dose
      that produces uncomplicated dengue-like illness.
