      living in poverty and being reared by a depressed parent can be detrimental to an infant's
      development. Effective interventions to reduce maternal depression and strengthen the
      mother-infant relationships are needed.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 mothers will receive
      16 weekly sessions of interpersonal psychotherapy (IP) designed to directly treat maternal
      depression. Group 1 participants will have monthly follow-up visits for 1 year. Participants
      in Group 2 will receive 16 weekly sessions of IP followed by 1 year of in-home, infant-parent
      psychotherapy, an intervention addressing relationship difficulties between depressed mothers
      and their infants. Group 3 mothers will be invited to attend informational meetings as well
      as be referred to local services available to people with depression.

      All mother-child pairs will be evaluated when the child is 12, 16, 24, and 36 months of age.
      Evaluations will involve questionnaires, diagnostic interviews, developmental assessments,
      and video- and audio-taped measures.
