      considered relevant by most plastic surgeons.

      In patients whose CAP should be mobilized through large distances in order to correct breast
      ptosis, or in cases of dense breasts where noted little slip of skin over the breast
      parenchyma, the periareolar dermis causes limitation on the mobility of the NAC.

      In clinical practice, there is a greater mobilization of NAC when making a careful section of
      the dermis after decortication. In contrast, the appearance of partial necrosis in these
      cases has become a rarity, as no case of total necrosis was observed.

      Given the technical benefit observed due to greater mobilization, there is no report in the
      literature about how behaves the sensitivity of the NAC in these cases.

      To evaluate the sensitivity of the NAC will be used Semmes-Weisnstein's monofilament. Each
      point will be obtained five measurements. The largest will be scorned and the lowest value.
      The final value of each point corresponds to an arithmetic mean of the three remaining
      values.
