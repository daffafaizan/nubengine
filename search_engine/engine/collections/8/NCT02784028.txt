      carcinomatosis is common in the evolution of this type of cancer, as well as increased levels
      of ACE. This peritoneal carcinomatosis is often underestimated, this being due to low
      sensitivity detection means.

      In recent years, it has been shown that peritoneal carcinomatosis surgery as complete as
      possible associated with an intraperitoneal chemotherapy gave better results but still
      failures associated with the presence of microscopic residual tumors.

      SGM -101 (developped by SURGIMAB SAS) is a fluorescent antibody that binds to ACE which is
      overespressed at the surface of tumor cells. The use of this fluorescent molecule allows
      surgeons to detect tumor nodules of small size very easily, in real-time, during surgery
      (shown in animals).
