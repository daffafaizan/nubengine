      memory clinic and 12 healthy controls from the community. The anxiety level was assessed both
      by self-reports (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Visual Analogue Scale of Anxiety) and by
      objective measurements related to autonomic nervous system activities (heart rate variability
      and electrodermal activity). The participants underwent a memory task to induce anxiety.
      Next, preferred music and white noise were provided in random order. The anxiety level and
      the effects of music intervention between SCD and healthy controls will be further compared.
