      activity and improvement in physical function, quantified using changes in 6-minute walk test
      (6MWT) results over the course of the 12-week program. An association is hypothesized to
      exist between the two variables even when adjusted for weeks into treatment. The goal of the
      6MWT is to cover as much distance as possible in six minutes, using as many breaks s
      necessary. The test is often performed using a 20-meter hallway but requires no specific
      equipment. A recent study reported that the result of the 6MWT could be used as a measure of
      the major components of global health in women with breast cancer, making its use in our
      research especially relevant. Aside from physical functions, baseline characteristics will
      also be used to determine what characteristics, if any, are associated with health and
      psychosocial outcomes such as quality of life, social connectedness/support, and mental
      well-being. The data collected is certain to fill a gap in the literature, and will therefore
      be likely published in an important journal in the field.
