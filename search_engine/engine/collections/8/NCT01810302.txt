      Americans per year. Poor outcome from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurs in 50
      to 75% of patients, and this is attributed to secondary ischemia in approximately 30% of
      patients. This delayed cerebral ischemia has been attributed to the anatomic narrowing of
      arteries in the cerebral vasculature which occurs following SAH.

      Because of this relationship between cerebral vasospasm, cerebral ischemia, and poor outcome,
      there has been significant effort to establish treatments that decrease the incidence of
      vasospasm after SAH. Currently, medications and hemodynamic maneuvers are used as standard of
      care for the treatment of vasospasm and to improve outcome after SAH.

      The calcium channel blocker, nimodipine, is one of the few treatments for vasospasm that has
      been shown to be of proven benefit. Nicardipine is another calcium channel blocker that has
      been evaluated in several studies via an intravenous administration route. These studies did
      show significant improvements in symptomatic and angiographic vasospasm, although a benefit
      in outcome was not seen. However, the intravenous administration of nicardipine was
      associated with significant systemic side effects that may have affected outcome including
      hypotension, pulmonary edema, and azotemia.

      The administration of nicardipine via an intrathecal route avoids the systemic complications
      associated with intravenous dosing since the direct cerebrospinal fluid dosing is much lower.
      The result is that the systemic concentration will remain low avoiding systemic side effects,
      and central nervous system concentration will remain high. We propose that this difference
      may improve outcomes while minimizing complication related effects on patient outcomes.
