      content and short term outcomes. Potential study participants were recruited between June
      2015 and October 2016, and were considered eligible for participation if they were first time
      mothers between the ages of 14 and 19, English or Spanish speakers, had not enrolled in the
      program in the previous six mounts, and were not enrolled in the Nurse Family Partnership
      program. Potential participants who were eligible and who consented to participate were
      randomly assigned to (1) a treatment group that was eligible for Healthy Families Healthy
      Futures (HFHF) services or (2) a control group that was not eligible for HFHF. Random
      assignment was conducted within two blocks determined by whether study participants were
      pregnant at the time of random assignment or were parenting at the time of random assignment.
      The study draws on data from HFHF administrative records on service receipt, a baseline
      survey administered prior to random assignment, and a follow-up survey administered
      approximately 12 months after random assignment.
