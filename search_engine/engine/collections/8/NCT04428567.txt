      in individuals with Parkinson's Disease, traumatic brain injury or chronic stroke survivors.
      However, to the investigator's knowledge, no studies have explored the effect of treadmill
      training with or without a cognitive dual Task on gait, balance and cognition in Fragile X -
      Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), which is characterized by action tremor,
      cerebellar gait ataxia, parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive deficits, all of
      which increase the risk for falls and progressive disability. There are presently no
      medications or treatment interventions that have been shown to effectively manage the
      symptoms of FXTAS or delay disease progression, and it is currently not clear whether either
      the ST or Dual-Task treadmill training paradigms would be feasible or effective in FXTAS.

      A total of 10 individuals with FXTAS will recruited from the Rush University Movement
      Disorders Clinic or the FXTAS Clinic Database at Rush University. The subjects will be
      assigned to either 6 weeks of dual-task treadmill exercise training combined with a cognitive
      task (intervention group) occurring 3 times weekly, or control group. The primary outcome
      measures will be feasibility, safety and patient adherence. The assessments will occur at
      baseline, week 3, week 6, 1 month & 6 month post-training.
