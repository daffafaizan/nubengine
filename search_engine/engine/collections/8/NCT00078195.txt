      range from mild to seriously debilitating, may affect quality of life. Left untreated,
      allergic rhinitis can exacerbate or trigger more serious conditions, such as asthma and sinus
      inflammation.

      Individuals with allergies react to harmless particles such as dust or pollen. Proteins in
      the blood called IgE antibodies treat the harmless particles as invaders and trigger an
      immune system response. The immune response results in harmful inflammation of healthy
      tissues. In ragweed allergy, inflammation occurs in the airways and causes familiar allergy
      symptoms like sneezing, coughing, and general discomfort.

      Omalizumab is an investigational drug that has been shown to block the effects of IgE
      antibodies. The blocking effect of omalizumab is temporary, but giving the drug to people
      before their regular allergy shots may make the shots more effective.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive injections of omalizumab or a
      placebo before an accelerated course of allergy shots (given over 12 weeks). The participants
      will return for follow-up for up to one year, and they may have as many as 27 study visits.
