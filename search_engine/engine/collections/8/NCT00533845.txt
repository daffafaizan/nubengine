      invasive surgeries (laparoscopic cholecystectomies and laparoscopic Lap-Banding procedures)
      to one of two groups. Both groups will have the standard surgical procedure performed and
      then at the completion will have the on-Q system placed in a subdiaphragmatic (within the
      abdomen) location. Half of the study group will have bupivicaine, a numbing medicine in the
      pump while the other half will have sterile saline in their pump. Neither the patient nor the
      surgeon will be aware of which group any particular patient is in, this is a process known as
      "blinding" and improves the reliability of the results. All patients will receive the
      standard locally infiltrated trocar site local anesthetic and either a prescription for
      Vicodin for ambulatory patients or morphine injected into their vein for patients staying in
      the hospital.

      All patients will then be asked at preset intervals their level of pain the presence of
      nausea and their need for Vicodin or morphine. Ambulatory patients will be reached by phone
      for answers to these questions. All patients will have their pain controlled in the usual and
      standard way at all times. The On-Q pump will be removed at 48hours.

      The results will then be statistically reviewed to see if the On-Q pumps were of benefit.
