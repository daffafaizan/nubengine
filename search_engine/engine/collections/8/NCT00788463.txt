      previously in patients with nasal polyps and it is unknown whether one is superior.

      This objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal beclomethasone by two
      different delivery systems, aerosol and aqueous spray in patients with nasal polyps. Primary
      endpoint is the difference in the overall quality of life as measured by the Rhinitis Quality
      of Life Questionnaire. The secondary endpoint is the change in Nasal Airflow Resistance as
      measured by rhinomanometry.
