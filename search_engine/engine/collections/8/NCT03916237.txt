    
      Students enrolled in the MetroHealth School Health Program (signed parental consent on file
      in electronic health record) and have a diagnosis of asthma on active problem list, or were
      seen in Emergency Department or Express Care in past 12 months for asthma related diagnosis,
      or have a rescue or controller inhaled medication on current medication list, will be
      considered for inclusion. Research staff will call families who meet inclusion criteria to
      discuss the study, determine interest in inclusion and obtain consent. Once enrolled baseline
      measures will be obtained, including level of asthma control and responses on the
      Environmental Screening Tool (EST) and the Community Advocacy Program Home Asthma Screening
      Tool (CAPHAST) (see CREST phone screening tool). Participants will then be randomized into
      two groups. The first group will receive regular care. The second group will receive the
      Asthma Home Assessment Intervention. Based on results of the screening tool and home
      assessments, participants will be placed into one of four groups (see CREST study design):
      GROUP A (no referral) GROUP B (home assessment only) GROUP C (home assessment and
      remediation) and GROUP D (medical legal partnership referral only) Participants randomized to
      regular care will be assessed for outcome measures at 3 and 6 months after randomization.
      Those randomized to the intervention arm will be assessed at 3 and 6 months after completion
      of intervention.
