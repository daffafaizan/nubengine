      to evaluate efficacy and safety of two doses of AUR101 in patients with moderate-to-severe
      psoriasis.

      Approximately 90 patients with chronic moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (defined as
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ≥12 and Body Surface Area (BSA) involved ≥10%) will
      be randomized to the 2 dose groups of AUR101 and placebo in the ratio of 1:1:1.

      The patients in each arm will receive AUR101 of 400 mg twice daily or AUR101 600 mg twice
      daily or matching placebo twice daily for 12 weeks in a double blind, double dummy fashion.

      Every patient will receive 12 weeks of treatment. All the patients will be followed up for 14
      ± 2 days of their last dose for safety assessment.

      A subset of approximately 25 patients, who consent, will be asked to come for plasma PK
      assessment in week 4 of dosing.

      Efficacy evaluation will be done by PASI, DLQI and BSA assessment. Safety assessment will be
      done by AEs and regular lab assessment.
