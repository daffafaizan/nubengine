      the subject of the design, 1. patients met the inclusion criteria, were randomized to
      traditional fracture tibial fixation or balloon assisted arthroscopic reduction under
      angioplasty, through follow-up, statistical evaluation after operation were compared between
      the two techniques for clinical curative effect the difference of tibial plateau articular
      surface reduction and recovery of joint function. 2., through the clinical practice,
      operation and experience summary, found that the new technology in the operation of the
      existing deficiencies, in order to improve the technology. 3 guide clinical diagnosis and
      treatment through results feedback and analysis.The investigators use existing resources to
      carry out this new technology, in accord with the standard of the patients, were randomized
      to traditional fracture balloon tibia fixation or arthroscopic reduction under angioplasty,
      the original data and data acquisition in a certain period of time corresponding to the
      patient, through statistical and epidemiological analysis and comparison of the method of
      professional data analysis discussion and experience according to the analysis results, the
      balloon angioplasty tibial arthroscopy and traditional open reduction and internal fixation
      for the clinical differences between postoperative recovery of tibial plateau articular
      surface reduction and joint function, and feedback the results to guide the clinical
      diagnosis and treatment.
