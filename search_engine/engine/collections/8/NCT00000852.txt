      peripheral blood of HLA-matched HIV-1 seronegative siblings of patients with AIDS can, in
      some instances, restore the number of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes. However, more controlled
      studies are needed to better quantitate the immunologic reconstitution seen with this type of
      therapy.

      Lymphocytes obtained by leukapheresis from a healthy, HIV-negative parent, sibling, or adult
      offspring of the HIV-infected patient are infused at day 0 and at weeks 4 and 8. A small
      portion of the lymphocytes obtained at day 0 will be radiolabeled prior to infusion, and two
      total body scans will be performed. Patients also undergo two tonsillar biopsies. Patients
      are followed weekly for 16 weeks, then by telephone periodically for 3 years (at 1 year, 2
      years, 2.5 years, and 3 years).
