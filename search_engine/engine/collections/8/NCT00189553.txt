      ovarian or fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer with liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx)
      combined with carboplatin will control the tumor growth at least as well as standard
      treatment of paclitaxel and carboplatin. And it is hoped that substituting paclitaxel with
      Caelyx in combination with carboplatin will improve the tolerance of the treatment program
      with at least the same efficacy and fewer side effects.
