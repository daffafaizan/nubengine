    
      Single site observational study of alarms and workflow on the general care floor where
      continuous surveillance monitoring (SM) with capnography and pulse oximetry is the standard
      of care before and after the Integrated Pulmonary Index is enabled within the context of a
      historical review of frequency of escalation of care as a function of the frequency and
      method of monitoring respiratory status. Observation of alarms will be electronically
      recorded on a Clinical Observation Tool (COT or iPad) that will have a virtual view of the
      CS20p measurements and alarm alerts for 24 hours on several patients at the same time.
      Patients will only be enrolled for 24 hours of observation of alarm status with associated
      patient activity and clinical interventions. Observation data with IPI disabled prior to
      implementation of IPI/IPI alarms will be used to evaluate optimal alarm alert settings
      including an IPI alert when enabled. Observation will continue with IPI enabled and alarms
      adjusted to study clinical utility of IPI on the GCF.
