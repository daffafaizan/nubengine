      function known as post-operative cognitive decline (POCD). These individuals often stay in
      the hospital longer, have more complications, and are more likely to die. Recent clinical
      studies have shown the potential benefit of enhancing the cholinergic system among patients
      with both Alzheimer's disease and / or vascular dementia. Donepezil is currently being used
      to treat memory loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

      This study will recruit 30 cognitively impaired adults aged 65 or older who are scheduled to
      have elective hip or knee replacement surgery at University Hospital. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either a three to six week supply of Donepezil or a matching placebo
      approximately 4 weeks prior to surgery. This study will evaluate the effect of Donepezil on
      delirium incidence and severity during hospitalization, global cognitive function, length of
      hospitalization, site of discharge, and adverse drug effects.

      All material to be collected will be from interviews, questionnaires, and medical chart
      review. Some will be at baseline, during hospitalization, and 12 weeks post hospitalization
      and others will be daily during hospitalization. The International Study of Post-Operative
      Cognitive Decline battery of tests will be used in assessment, as will the CogHealth
      computerized battery.
