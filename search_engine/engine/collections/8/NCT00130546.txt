      A total of 110 patients with at least two de novo native coronary artery lesions (lesion A,
      lesion B) ≤ 30 mm in length and ≥ 2.25 mm to < 3.0 mm in diameter by visual estimate will be
      enrolled. Patients will be randomized for implantation of the sirolimus eluting Cypher
      Select(TM) Balloon-Expandable Stent or to the TAXUS(TM) Paclitaxel-eluting stent for lesion A
      and B.
