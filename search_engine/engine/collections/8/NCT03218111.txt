      contrast (Magnevist, Gd-DTPA) in healthy adult male and female subjects. Subjects will be
      divided into two groups (20-50 years old and 51-80 years old) both of which will receive
      intrathecal injection of the drug Magnevist (Gd-DTPA), followed by serial MR imaging over the
      course of 10-12 hours. The purpose of the study is determine the transport kinetics of
      Central Nervous System (CNS) exposure to gadolinium contrast injected into the lumbar
      intrathecal space (lower back) and evaluate changes with age. This will allow investigators
      to evaluate the brain parenchymal penetration of gadolinium as an illustrative imaging marker
      that mirrors the glymphatic system. Investigators hypothesize the exposure and penetration
      patterns of the neuraxis to neurotherapeutic drugs can be modeled using gadolinium
      intrathecal contrast administered in the lumbar intrathecal space.
