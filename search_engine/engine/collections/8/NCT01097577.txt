      including active duty and DoD (Department of Defense) beneficiaries. Prior to being
      approached for the study, all patients will have had a previous desire for surgery and had a
      pre-operative evaluation indicating healthy ocular status.

      Patients scheduled for PRK surgery will be briefed on the purpose of the study and invited to
      participate at the preoperative appointment. After the consent process, patients will be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either oral pregabalin 75mg twice daily or placebo for
      pain control, in addition to the standard care treatment of as needed Percocet and tetracaine
      ophthalmic drops. Subjects will be evaluated daily for 4 days post-operatively for subjective
      pain assessment, adverse drug events and compliance, use of concomitant medications as well
      as monitoring of healing time. Quality of life will be measured at baseline and post-op day 2
      when the peak of pain is anticipated. Analysis will be performed to detect an approximate 10%
      improvement in pain scores. Secondary outcomes will include measuring healing time, quality
      of life and use of rescue medications.
