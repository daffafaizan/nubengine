      onset of overweight and obesity in 7-9 year old children. The recreation center site
      intervention emphasizes changes in quantity and quality of physical activity and
      nutrition-related offerings within the centers. The home site intervention targets the home
      environment and household rule setting delivered via Family Health Coaches and tailored to
      the needs of the family. Five hundred forty one (541) families were recruited to participate
      in this project. Participants were selected in part based on residence in proximity to
      participating recreation centers. Eighteen (18) families living up to 3 miles from each of
      the 30 recreation centers involved in the project were be recruited to participate. For each
      family, one child was recruited between the ages of 5 and 8 years old and this child's
      primary caregiver was enrolled in the study. The study's primary outcome is Body Mass Index
      (kg/m2).
