      participant will complete 4 sessions in this two-factor (2x2) combinatorial design: 1Hz
      medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) vs. sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      X pharmacological stressor (yohimbine 54mg + hydrocortisone 20mg) vs. placebo, with each
      session separated by at least 1 week. Participants will be asked not to use alcohol or drugs
      for 24-hr before arriving at the lab. We expect to complete screen at least 20 individuals to
      complete 12 individuals in this study. Candidates will first undergo psychiatric and medical
      screening to rule out contraindications to participation. Once enrolled, each participant
      will complete, in randomized order, the 4 conditions above. Periodic measures will be
      collected before and after the rTMS/sham and stress/placebo interventions. These measures
      will include subjective, behavioral and physiological assessments, as well as saliva and
      blood samples.
