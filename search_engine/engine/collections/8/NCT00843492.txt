      mg in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 50 mL/min) once daily versus
      Low-Molecular Weight Heparin (nadroparin 2850 anti-Xa IU, 0.3 mL, once daily), with respect
      to the occurrence of venous thromboembolism, death and bleeding complications in patients
      requiring rigid or semi-rigid immobilization for at least 21 days and up to 45 days because
      of isolated nonsurgical below-knee injury. Treatment will be continued up to complete
      mobilization, e.g. plaster cast or brace removal, for a maximum of 45 days. The study will be
      a European, multicentre, randomized, open-label, controlled, two-parallel-group, phase III
      study in 1350 male and female patients 18 years of age or older, presenting with at least one
      additional major risk factor for VTE. After randomization (Day 1), subjects will receive
      subcutaneously, once daily, either fondaparinux or nadroparin up to complete mobilization.
      After cast or brace removal, a systematic, bilateral compression ultrasound will be done in
      all patients. Patients will be contacted five weeks (Â± one week) after complete mobilization.
      All suspected venous thromboembolic events, including asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis, all
      deaths, and all bleeding events (with the exception of certain types of minor bleeding events
      defined in the protocol) will be reviewed by an independent adjudication committee blind to
      treatment assignment.
