      study. Prior to lenvatinib treatment, patients will undergo I-124 PET/CT to quantify RAI
      uptake and retention at baseline. The first half of the intended sample size (cohort 1) will
      be treated with lenvatinib for a total of 12 weeks. After 6- and 12-week treatment, patients
      will undergo I-124 PET/CT dosimetry to evaluate the redifferentiation effect, assess expected
      absorbed lesion doses and maximum tolerable activity. Results between 6- and 12-week
      lenvatinib treatment will be compared to select the lenvatinib treatment duration that leads
      to highest extent of redifferentiation. The next patients (cohort 2) will then receive
      lenvatinib for either 6 or 12 weeks.

      Patients will undergo subsequent I-131 therapy if a clinically meaningful lesion dose is
      expected and toxicity is deemed acceptable. For all patients eligible for I-131 therapy,
      lenvatinib is discontinued prior to administration of I-131 and intra-therapeutic I-131 SPECT
      dosimetry will be performed for dose verification. Patients who are not eligible for I-131
      therapy, will continue lenvatinib treatment at the discretion of the treating physician.

      Biopsies are performed at baseline and after 6-week lenvatinib treatment to evaluate
      alterations at the transcriptional and translational level in biopted tumor lesions. Patients
      will be followed up according to current guidelines for a total of 9 months after initiating
      lenvatinib treatment. Metabolic and biochemical response will be assessed using F-18 FDG
      PET/CT and Tg levels, respectively.
