    
      The purpose of this study is to assess how effective a new device is in increasing range of
      motion and reducing stiffness in the foot and ankle of patients with acquired flatfoot,
      patients with plantar fasciitis, and those suffering from stiffness after cast removal or
      other lengthy immobilization.

      Project will utilize a physical therapist to measure range of motion and stiffness when
      patients are consented. Patients will be re-measured at six weeks following use of the device
      to assist in stretching ankle and foot muscles, and again at 10 weeks for final stiffness and
      range of motion assessment.
