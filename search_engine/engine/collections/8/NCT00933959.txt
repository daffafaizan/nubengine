      (SH) group. The interventions will last two weeks in which participants will attend 2 classes
      1-1.5 hr each over two consecutive weeks. Assessment of the effects of the treatments will be
      based on self-report outcome measures; participants will complete five questionnaires
      approximately one week prior to the start of the interventions (pre-treatment) and one week
      after the second session (post-treatment). The sleep quality assessment questionnaire will be
      additionally completed after the first session (Week 1).
