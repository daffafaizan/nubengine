      the attack. Recent expert opinion from the American College of Rheumatology Guidelines is
      that allopurinol may be started during an acute, treated gout attack. This study is designed
      to test the hypothesis that allopurinol does not prolong an acute, treated gout attack.
      Patients will either take allopurinol capsules or and identical capsule containing no
      allopurinol (placebo) over 28 days, starting within 72 hours of a gout attack that is being
      treated with other standard measures. During the study, neither the patient nor the examiner
      will know what pills are being taken. The time to resolution of the attack is the primary
      outcome measure. Pain level, serum uric acid level, and complications of therapy will also be
      monitored. A minimum of 32 patients completing the study are needed for a meaningful
      conclusion.
