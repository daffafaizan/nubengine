      protein, PLVAP, was shown to be present on the blood vessels of HCC but not on the blood
      vessels of normal liver. An antibody, CSR02, was made that recognizes PLVAP and then the Fab
      portion of that antibody was combined with tissue factor, a normal human protein that
      initiates the clotting cascade. The result is a manufactured (recombinant) protein called
      CSR02-Fab-TF. Preclinical studies in a mouse model showed that infusion of an equivalent
      mouse protein resulted in the necrosis (death) of a transplanted human HCC. The current study
      is designed first, to identify a safe and optimal dose of CSR02-Fab-TF in patients , and then
      second, to determine the response rate of HCC tumors to the IA administration of
      CSR02-Fab-TF.
