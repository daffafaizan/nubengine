      while using ketamine during procedural sedation will reduce the number of emergence reactions
      and impacts pre and post procedural anxiety. After informed consent has been established and
      the subject is determined to meet eligibility criteria, participants will be randomized into
      2 groups. The interventional group will undergo positive imagery therapy during sedation and
      the control will not. The duration of subject participation will be from the onset of
      sedation beginning until the patient is recovered.
