      forms, be randomly assigned to either start immediately on Vitamin D for three months or to
      start after a delay of three months. Those with levels below 7gn/ml will start immediately.
      All will be evaluated monthly with blood tests, PANSS, movement disorder ratings and
      information on health and progress from the clinical chart.
