      efficacy (response, joint erosion, damage, and treatment adherence) study aimed at collecting
      prospective safety, tolerability, efficacy, and treatment adherence information on JIA
      subjects exposed to any biologic agents and MTX, according to local standard of practice.

      This is a non-interventional study, where the medicinal products are prescribed as per the
      investigator's decision. The assignment of the subject to a particular therapeutic strategy
      is not decided in advance by the study protocol, but falls within current practice and the
      prescription of the medicine is clearly separated from the decision to include the subject in
      the study. No additional diagnostic or monitoring procedures shall be applied to the subjects
      and epidemiological methods will be used for the analysis of collected data.

      Duration and treatment will be as per investigator's decision. The nature and frequency of
      subjects' visits to the investigator's site will be determined only by the investigator,
      according to his/her judgment on the basis of the clinical evolution of the subject.

      The duration of the study is expected to be at least 3 years from initiation of the first
      site and may be continued beyond if adequate funding is be available.
