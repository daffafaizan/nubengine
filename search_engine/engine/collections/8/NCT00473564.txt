      of the da VinciÂ® Robotic Surgical System. This study will evaluate the use of the daVinci
      Robotic System for better visibility and access of head and neck lesions and decreased amount
      of surgery time. This is a robotic system used by surgeons to perform surgery in a less
      invasive manner.
