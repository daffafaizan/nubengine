      substantial global health burden. Surgery is the only possible way to cure gastric cancer,
      however, more than 80% of the Chinese patients are diagnosed at advanced stages. Locally
      advanced esophagogastric junction and gastric cancer (cT3-4aNxM0 or cT2N2-3M0) could be cured
      by multi-disciplinary therapies including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy can downstage T and N stage, treated distant micrometastases early before local
      therapy has begun, and finally improve the long-term survival. However, the therapeutic
      effects remain unsatisfactory. PD-1 antibody has demonstrated its efficacy in metastatic
      gastric cancer and has been proved to be effective in neoadjuvant setting in lung cancer and
      melanoma. Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced
      esophagogastric junction and gastric cancer could be a novel therapy to increase response
      rate and reduce recurrence rate. JS001 in this study is a Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal
      antibody for injection which has been approved for melanoma. This study is a multi-center,
      open-label, randomized phase II clinical trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of JS001 in
      combination with perioperative chemotherapy in locally advanced esophagogastric junction and
      gastric cancer. Differences in gut microbiome and tumor immune microenvironment were detected
      to screen people who were more sensitive to immunotherapy.
