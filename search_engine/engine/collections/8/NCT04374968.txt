      therapy both before and after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) following a
      tear. BFR has been proposed to work by restricting arterial inflow leading to an oxygen
      depleted environment and the ability to induce muscle adaption at lower maximum repetition
      via reactive hyperemia. Muscle atrophy occurs following ACL tear and reconstruction. Thus,
      physical therapy is used in the peri-operative period to regain strength with the ultimate
      goal of returning to activity.

      The goal of this investigation is to determine if using BFR during perioperative therapy
      would lead to increased and expedited strength gains. Additionally we would like to determine
      if BFR helps patients to pass the standard rehabilitative functional tests and return to play
      sooner. We will also look at patient reported outcomes metrics and pain scores to determine
      if BFR has a significant impact on the patient experience surrounding ACL tear and
      reconstruction.
