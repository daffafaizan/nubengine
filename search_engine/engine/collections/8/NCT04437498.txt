      neurobiology and cognition in combat Veterans with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) and
      co-morbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the performance of stressful tasks
      (traumatic scripts, mental arithmetic) and verbal declarative memory tasks using measurement
      of memory performance, peripheral inflammatory markers in blood (IL6) and cardiovascular
      responses using wearable gated sensing devices and electro- and seismocardiography, as well
      as brain response (anterior cingulate, hippocampus) measured with High Resolution Positron
      Emission Tomography (HR-PET) and radiolabelled water (15O[H2O]). The investigators
      hypothesize that nVNS but not sham control will result in enhanced memory, and hippocampal
      activation with memory encoding, and reduced cardiovascular, sympathetic, and inflammatory
      responses to stress. The investigators will also assess the effects of nVNS and sham on
      memory retention when applied to the encoding phase of a declarative memory learning task
      repeated daily over a four day period and on ratings of PTSD and pain in Veterans with mTBI
      and co-morbid PTSD and repeat assessments after three months of twice daily treatments.
