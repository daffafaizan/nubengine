    
      A number of variables including clinical, biochemical, and enzymatic have been evaluated to
      see if they add to conventional "risk-reduction" models such as Framingham and if so, to
      understand if they may be used in routine clinical practice.

      The aim of this study is to assess several known and a few novel risk-factors (heart rate
      variability, pulse wave analysis, high-sensitivity CRP and BNP) prior to planned elective
      coronary angiography (cross-sectional analysis) and in a prospective cohort of high and
      low-risk patients.
