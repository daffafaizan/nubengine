      random number. Physicians supervising the hyperbaric treatments and the treating technicians,
      the evaluating neurologist, and the interpreter of the MRIs will be blinded regarding patient
      treatment status. All patients who receive placebo will be offered treatment with hyperbaric
      oxygen.
