      recommendations by areas of the country

      Phase II: Prescribing data analysis (using OpenPrescribing) comprising:

        1. t-test to compare the chemoprevention prescribing rate in general practices where
           chemoprevention is recommended versus not recommended;

        2. interrupted times series analysis to assess the change in the chemoprevention
           prescribing after recommendation from specialist compared with changes occurring in
           practices where chemoprevention is not recommended and

        3. panel regression across all practices, in order to distinguish the relative impacts of
           national versus local recommendation, and the change over time.
