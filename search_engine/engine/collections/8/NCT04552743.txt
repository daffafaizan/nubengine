    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S)

      1. To assess the efficacy of MGTA-145 in combination with plerixafor in mobilizing adequate
      number of hematopoietic stem cells (> 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) in patients with multiple
      myeloma (MM) in preparation for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). SECONDARY
      OBJECTIVE(S)

        1. To assess the efficacy of MGTA-145 and plerixafor in mobilizing different Hematopoietic
           stem cells (HSCs) target goals in patients with MM in preparation for ASCT.

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of MGTA-145 and plerixafor for mobilizing HSCs in
           patients with MM.

        3. To assess the engraftment rate and time to engraftment following ASCT after HSC
           mobilization with MGTA-145 and plerixafor in patients with MM undergoing upfront ASCT.

        4. To assess rate of ongoing engraftment at day 30 and 100 after stem cell infusion in
           patients with MM who are mobilized with MGTA-145 and plerixafor undergoing upfront ASCT.

        5. To assess transplant and disease-related outcomes after mobilization of HSCs with MGTA-
           145 and plerixafor in patients with MM undergoing upfront ASCT.
