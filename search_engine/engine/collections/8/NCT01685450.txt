      activity (cochlear microphonic potential, CMP), with a non invasive method, during invasive
      ICP monitoring. The data analysis will determine relationship between ICP variations and CMP
      variations.

      Patients, from the neurosurgery department, investigated for 'normal pressure' chronic
      hydrocephalus are involved in CSF dynamic test. This complex protocol, including infusion
      test and invasive CSF monitoring, is needed in order to confirm the diagnosis. CSF dynamic
      tests, a socalled 'perfusion test', are performed in an operating theater, the patient had to
      be awake but sedated. During perfusion test, electrophysiological cochlear activities are
      measured with a gold tiptrode (Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, Ill) gently inserted
      into the ear canal.

      Electrophysiological cochlear activities, so called electrocochleography (ECochG), are a non
      invasive and totally passive method used in routine in ENT department. The response measured
      in ECochG is the cochlear microphonic potential (CMP), generated by the outer hair cells
      following by presenting tone burst at 1kHz. CMP is recorded with the help of an EchodiaÂ®
      hand-held equipment.

      Previously animal studies have shown that the phase of CM is sensitive to ICP changes and CM
      phase shifts exhibit the same time course as those of otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs).

      The phase changes of CM can indeed be used as a non-invasive tool for monitoring
      intralabyrinthine and intracranial pressures.
