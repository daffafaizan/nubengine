      after birth. The goal of oxygen therapy is to achieve adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues
      without causing oxygen toxicity and oxidative stress. At present, this goal is elusive in
      very immature infants. Although it is standard practice in modern neonatal intensive care
      units to monitor arterial oxygen saturations via pulse oximetry, there is insufficient
      evidence to guide the choice of the upper and lower alarm limits. A rigorous trial with
      long-term follow up is urgently needed and long overdue to determine whether oxygen exposure
      can be reduced safely in extremely preterm infants without increasing the risk of hypoxic
      death or disability.
