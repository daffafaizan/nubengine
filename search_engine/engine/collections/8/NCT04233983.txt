      (assisted reproductive technology) centre nursery. All patients will sign a consent form
      about procedure.

      Patients diagnosed with endometrioma (larger than 3 cm diameter) and ERROR (endometrioma
      related reduction in ovarian reserve - Antimullerian Hormon < 1.2 ng/ml, Antral follicle
      count < 7 , Day3 Follicle Stimulating Hormone > 10 IU/dl, Low response to ovarian hyper
      stimulation < 3 oocytes) will be enrolled in study. Patients with age >40, with male factor,
      with undefined adnexal mass, malignity suspicion will be excluded from study.

      The study group consists of patients who will undergo laparoscopic endometriosis surgery
      after ICSI procedure with freezing all embryos. The patients will wait about 6 months for
      spontaneous conception, if there is no pregnancy during this period, frozen embryo transfer
      will be performed. The control group consists of patients who will be performed IVF&ICSI
      procedure with fresh embryo transfer without surgery. If there is no pregnancy, patients will
      be operated then.

      As the primary; result positive b-hCG rates will be compared between groups.

      In conclusion we will find out whether laparoscopic endometriosis operation improves or
      worsens the pregnancy results in patients with ERROR.
