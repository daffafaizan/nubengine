        -  MESCC is defined as both an evidence of cord compression by radiologic evaluation and a
           manifestation of clinical feature at the level of cord compression.

        -  A cord compression by radiologic evaluation is defined as < 3mm gap between epidural
           mass and true spinal cord or indentation of thecal sac at the level of clinical feature
           by MRI.

        -  Clinical features include any or all of the followings: pain (local or radicular) or
           motor weakness or sensory change or incontinence.

      Simulation -A Computed tomography (CT) scan will be acquired with the use of intravenous
      contrast and planning MRI will be also performed on the same day of simulation.

      Spine SBRT

      - One to four sessions of SBRT will be performed.

      Follow-up

        -  Patients need to be assessed at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months after the completion of
           SBRT and will be followed up at 3 month intervals thereafter.

        -  Pain score, neurologic examination, adverse events and simple X-ray of involved spine
           should be evaluated at every follow-up visit.

        -  MRI of involved spine will be performed at 3 months after the completion of SBRT.

      Up to 43 patients will be enrolled in this study in Samsung Medical Center, Seoul National
      University Hospital, and Gachon University Gil Medical Center.
