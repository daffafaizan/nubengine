      capillary endothelium prevents chemotherapeutic agents from attaining therapeutic
      concentrations at the target site. RMP-7 is a synthetic bradykinin analog which specifically
      binds to B2 receptors expressed on the brain capillary endothelial cells and preferentially
      increases capillary permeability within CNS tumors. Carboplatin is an anticancer agent with
      preclinical and clinical antitumor activity against a variety of brain tumors. A pediatric
      phase I trial of the combination of RMP-7 and carboplatin will be conducted to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose of RMP-7 in children with refractory brain tumors.
