    
      25 patients with confirmed PA who are keen for a surgical cure if unilateral PA is confirmed,
      will undergo conventional tests, CT, AVS, as well as 11C-metomidate PET/CT.

      Results will be reviewed and discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting, and patients with
      unilateral PA will be offered surgery. Patients will be reviewed 6 months post surgery to
      assess for cure of PA.
