      Dexamethasone therapy in comparison to prior standard therapy. Each subject provides his own
      baseline data. There is no control group. Patients with CAH who meet inclusion criteria will
      be admitted to the clinical research center for two 24 hour hospitalizations. Adrenal hormone
      profiles will be measured during each hospitalization. The patient will take his or her
      baseline hydrocortisone regimen during one hospitalization and a new regimen consisting of a
      single daily nocturnal dose of Dexamethasone during the second hospitalization.
