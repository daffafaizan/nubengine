    
      Phase III, open label, randomized, controlled study in subjects with advanced or metastatic
      soft tissue sarcoma. In the study, 102 patients will be enrolled and parallel assigned in a
      1:1 fashion to one of two different arms, as follows:

        -  ARM 1: Patients will receive 75 mg/m2 doxorubicin once every 3 weeks (reference
           treatment).

        -  ARM 2: Patients will receive 13 Âµg/kg L19TNF on days 1, 3 and 5 every 3 weeks in
           combination with 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin (once every 3 weeks).

      Anti-cancer activity will be assessed every 6 weeks during therapy and every 12 weeks
      thereafter. Median PFS, PFS rates at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months, mOS, OS rate at 12 and 18
      months and ORR will be calculated.

      Safety assessment will be performed on an ongoing basis during study participation, including
      standard laboratory assessments. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by severity in all
      patients with at least one study drug intake.
