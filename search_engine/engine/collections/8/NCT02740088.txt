      early-stage calcification. Although valve calcification could be visualized either by
      echocardiography or coronary computed tomography, they only reflect the current burden of
      calcium deposit not the activity of calcium deposit. Limited studies exist regarding the
      usefulness of 18F-NaF uptake at aortic valve for prediction of stenosis progression.

      Patients with moderate aortic stenosis - diagnosed by echocardiography - will be enrolled.
      Enrolled participants will undergo baseline 18F-NaF PET/CT within 6 weeks of baseline
      echocardiography and followed up for 1 year. After 1 year, all the participants are required
      to evaluate the aortic stenosis progression by performing echocardiography.

      The objective of the study is to test whether baseline 18F-NaF uptake activity predict AS
      progression.
