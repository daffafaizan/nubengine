    
      This is a first-in-human, dose escalation trial of an anti-CD47 antibody. The major aims of
      the study are to define the safety profile of this new drug, and to determine a recommended
      dose and schedule for potential additional trials. This study is composed of 3 stages: Part 1
      dose escalation without priming dose, and Part 2 dose escalation with priming dose. Part 3
      pharmacodynamic (PD)/ dose expansion cohort will open after the completion of Part 1 and 2.
