      (paclitaxel and Cremophor EL). Paclitaxel is a drug currently used for treating a broad range
      of cancers. Paclitaxel is thought to prevent cells from dividing and growing, resulting in
      cell death. This new formulation consists of paclitaxel associated with liposomes, which are
      microscopic membrane-like structures created from lipids (fats). It is believed that LEP-ETU
      will maintain or enhance the anti-tumor properties of paclitaxel, while offering advantages
      to the patient of a shorter infusion time, routine premedication not required, fewer side
      effects at similar doses, and possibly greater effectiveness, especially if higher doses can
      be delivered without an increase in side effects.

      This study is designed to determine the following:

        -  The highest dose of LEP-ETU that can be given safely to patients.

        -  The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel following intravenous infusion with LEP-ETU.

        -  Any anti-tumor effects of LEP-ETU.

      Up to 8 dose levels will be studied. LEP-ETU will be given to patients by intravenous
      infusion over 90 minutes, once every 21 days, until their disease progresses or side effects
      occur requiring the treatments to end. Patients will be evaluated for safety and how well
      they tolerate the treatments.
