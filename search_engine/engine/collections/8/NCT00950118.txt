    
      Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect that occurs when the diaphragm (thin
      sheet of muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest) does not form properly. When an
      opening is present in the diaphragm, organs that are normally in the abdomen can be pushed
      (herniated) through the opening and be present in the chest. Currently little is known about
      why this birth defect occurs.

      Through this study ""Molecular Genetic Analysis of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia" the
      investigators hope to learn more about whether certain genes contribute to CDH. Genes are the
      instructions or blueprints for our bodies. They tell our bodies how to grow and develop.
      Sometimes when a mistake occurs in one or more of our genes our body does not develop
      properly and this can lead to a CDH. The investigators hope that the information gained
      through studying the genes of children with CDH and their parents, will lead to significant
      advances in the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of this disease.
