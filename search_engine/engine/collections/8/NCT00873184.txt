      contribution here is expected to determine whether massage therapy is safe and helps to
      improve patient QoL. This contribution is significant because it is expected to provide pilot
      data on effect sizes so that we may design an adequately powered study to develop massage
      therapy programs and interventions for patients with brain tumors. In addition to benefiting
      brain tumor patients, the information from this study may be applied to improving the QoL of
      other cancer patients.
