    
      Wide surgical removal of the tumor with the addition of a systemic treatment based on the
      antineoplastic drugs active against osteosarcoma (Adriamycin, Cisplatin, Ifosfamide,
      Methotrexate). The use of radiation therapy will be given to patients with unresectable
      tumors. It is recommended in patients who underwent inadequate surgical removal of the tumor.
      The addition of radiation therapy can not compensate for an adequate surgical treatment.

      All the patients eligible for the study will receive the planned systemic treatment.
      Depending on clinical features, and feasibility of adequate surgical removal of the tumor,
      patients may receive primary chemotherapy followed by a postoperative chemotherapy treatment
      or only an adjuvant chemotherapy. In case of immediate surgery, patients will receive an
      adjuvant treatment with the 3-drug regimen (Cisplatin-Adriamycin-Ifosfamide).
