      healing, leading to a reduction in immobilization time. Chrysalin, also known as TP508, is a
      synthetic peptide (protein) that is an exact copy of part of the human protein thrombin,
      which is a protein that occurs naturally in the body. Chrysalin can be used to mimic part of
      the thrombin response after injury without stimulating any of the events associated with
      blood clotting, and can therefore accelerate the normal process of healing.
