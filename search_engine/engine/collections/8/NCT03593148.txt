      treatment process have a better effect on weight loss and health-related quality of life than
      a previous treatment. Investigators also want to investigate whether patients with good
      physical capacity (maximal oxygen uptake) and bone strength (maximum bone strength) before
      initiating treatment and / or after 3 and 6 months intensive training may have greater weight
      loss 1 and 2 years after treatment than patients with lower physical capacity and bone
      strength.
