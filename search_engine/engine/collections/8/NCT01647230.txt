    
      Patients aged 70 years old with hip fracture presenting for surgical repair under intrathecal
      anaesthesia performed with bupivacaine or L bupivacaine (dose 7 - 9 mg). Preoperative
      haemoglobin and drugs consumption are registered. All patients receive supplemental oxygen
      during surgery. Cerebral oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen arterial saturation
      are measured. Level and duration of sensory and motor block are registered. The study
      observes if there is any correlation between cerebral oximetry and these hemodynamic
      parameters.

      The investigators also observe if there is any correlation between cerebral oximetry and
      cognitive function evaluated pre and postoperatively by SPMSQ test.

      Postoperative SPMSQ test will be performed on the 5th postoperative day and the complications
      registered.Patients will be followed for the duration of acute hospital stay.
