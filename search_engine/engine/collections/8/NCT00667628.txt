      locoregional therapies such as hepatic artery hemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation
      (RFA) which are effective in controlling localized tumors. Transcatheter arterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) is the most commonly performed procedure in the treatment of
      unresectable liver tumors for selected patients. The TACE procedure delivers highly
      concentrated drugs to the tumor itself and arrests blood flow. Most patients will have
      intrahepatic recurrence of their tumors following TACE. Studies of TAC-101, a synthetic
      retinoid, indicate that although TAC-101 may not induce tumor regression, it appears to have
      a stabilizing effect, prolonging survival over what was expected historically. This study is
      designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 study in
      patients with advanced HCC who have undergone a TACE procedure, which will be conducted at
      multiple sites in Japan, to determine if administration of TAC-101 will enhance the benefits
      of the TACE procedure.
