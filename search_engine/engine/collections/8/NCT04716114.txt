    
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SKLB1028 or salvage
      chemotherapy. Subjects will enter the screening period up to 14 days before the start of
      treatment. Prior to randomization, a salvage chemotherapy regimen will be pre-selected for
      each subject. Options will include low-dose cytarabine (LoDAC), azacitidine,
      homoharringtonine (HHT), cytarabine and aclarubicin (HAA) or fludarabine, cytarabine and
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG). The randomization will be stratified by
      indications and intensity of pre-selected salvage chemotherapy.

      Subjects will be orally administrated SKLB1028 twice daily over continuous 28-day cycles .
      Subjects in the salvage chemotherapy group will receive chemotherapy as required by the
      guidelines. Subjects receiving SKLB1028, LoDAC, or azacytidine will continue to receive the
      treatment until a treatment discontinuation criterion is met. Subjects receiving HAA or FLAG
      will take 1 cycle of therapy and will be assessed for response after the 1st cycle. After the
      efficacy evaluation, the subject may receive a second cycle of chemotherapy at the
      investigator's discretion. will receive the second cycle of chemotherapy.

      Subjects who have a donor identified and with complete remission after treatment may undergo
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) without leaving the study. Subjects in the salvage
      chemotherapy group who withdrew due to non-response to treatment or disease progression,
      could switch to SKLB1028 if SKLB1028 will likely benefit the patient at the investigator's
      discretion.
