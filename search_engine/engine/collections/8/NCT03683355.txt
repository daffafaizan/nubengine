      guidelines recommend the use of the modified Duke criteria, based on clinical,
      echocardiographic and biological findings, as well as the results of blood cultures and
      serologies. Advances in imaging techniques have resulted in an improvement in the
      identification of endocardial involvements and extracardiac complications of IE. Thus, recent
      works have demonstrated that 18F-FDG PET/CT and radiolabeled leucocyte SPECT/CT may improve
      the detection of silent endocardial lesions. The sites of radiotracer accumulation show
      regions of a high metabolic activity due to an inflammation or infection process. It is well
      known that, in surgical prosthetic valves, a mild radiotracer uptake in the perivalvular area
      may occur in the absence of infection and could therefore be considered as a normal pattern,
      particularly early after valve replacement. However, evidence of this phenomenon is lacking
      regarding transcatheter heart valves and the factors used to distinguish between normal and
      abnormal patterns of radiolabeled tracer are not standardized. The hypothesis is that
      patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) show a radiolabeled tracer
      (18F-FDG) uptake around the prosthesis despite the absence of IE. Moreover, the uptake
      pattern might vary between different platforms.

      Therefore, the objective of the study is to characterize the pattern of radiolabeled tracer
      uptake in noninfected transcatheter heart valves in early follow-up after TAVR.

      This will be a pilot study including 30 patients after TAVR procedure.
