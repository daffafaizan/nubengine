      mild or moderate myocardial dysfunction according to the American consensus echocardiography
      and the classical indication for pacemaker by Brazilian Guidelines for Cardiac Implantable
      Electronic Devices Guidelines and the American Heart Association. Primary goal: Assess
      whether resynchronization achieved by bifocal right ventricle pacing has influence on serum
      levels of natriuretic peptides and whether this could be used as a measure of success.
      Secondary goal: To compare clinical parameters,compare electrocardiographic parameters (QRS
      complex stimulated) in ventricular apical position and ventricular bifocal position, assess
      quality of life by questionnaire Minnesota Living With Heart Failure. Will be implanted
      pacemaker endocardial bifocal, with placement of a ventricular endocardial electrode in the
      septal region and another in right ventricle apical, as adopted in the conduct of Pacemaker
      sector under local anesthesia and sedation. After pacemaker implantation, patients will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to apical or bifocal stimulation. Patients remained in this mode of
      stimulation for two months, after which they will be subjected to the following sequence of
      reviews: Clinical assessment (functional classification of heart failure);assessment of
      quality of life by the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, 12-lead
      electrocardiogram at rest, with measurements of stimulated QRS duration, evaluation of the
      parameters of the pacemaker, serum level of peptides. At the end of this period of
      evaluation, patients will undergo cross-over groups, those in apical ventricular pacing will
      be allocated in the bifocal group and the last one will be allocated to apical ventricular
      pace. Patients will be retained in the new pacing mode for two months, and at the end of this
      period will be submitted to clinical, laboratory and assessment of pacemaker evaluation as
      well. At the end of the study, all patients will be kept in bifocal ventricular pacing, as
      advocated in the conduct of Pacemaker sector.
