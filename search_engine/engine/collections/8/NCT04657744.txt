    
      Open-label, randomized, single dose, two-sequence, two-way crossover study, separated by 49
      days washout interval from the first study drug administration.

      Healthy volunteers, 18-55 years of age, selected from the Egyptian population fulfilling the
      selection criteria. 30 subjects will participate in the study. All dosed subject samples will
      be analyzed and their data will be included in the final study report.

      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ Secondary Pharmacokinetic
      Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for transformed (with the
      90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ and for
      untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e.

      The confidence intervals of logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax,
      AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within 80.00-125.00%.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
