      emergency department (ED). Diagnosis of pneumonia is challenging as symptoms are often weak
      and nonspecific and the current methods for focal and etiological diagnosis have low
      sensitivity and specificity and often deliver results after the antibiotic treatment decision
      has been made.

      The abundant and restricted expression of surfactant protein D (SP-D) within the lung makes
      this protein a specific marker for lung disease. Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is expressed
      in the lung and is a diagnostic and prognostic marker of interstitial lung disease. The
      inflammatory glycoprotein Chitinase-3-like protein 1 commonly known as YKL-40 is associated
      with severity of interstitial lung disease. The value of these lung injury markers for
      diagnosing pneumonia needs further investigation.

      The investigators hypothesize that surfactant protein D, Krebs von den Lungen (KL-6), and
      Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) have an impact on diagnosing, prognosis, and treatment of
      patients with verified CAP.

      The objectives of the study are:

        -  To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of surfactant protein D, Krebs von den Lungen
           (KL-6), and Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) in the diagnosis of CAP

        -  To identify the prognostic value surfactant protein D, Krebs von den Lungen (KL-6), and
           Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40) in relation to adverse events in patients with
           verified CAP
