      better it is for the control of their blood glucose levels and long-term complications.

      People get type 1 diabetes because their immune system, the part of the body, which helps
      fight infections, mistakenly attacks and destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that produce
      insulin. As the immune system destroys these insulin-producing cells, the body's own ability
      to produce insulin decreases and diabetes develops.

      At diagnosis, there are usually a small number of beta cells (10-20%) left in the pancreas,
      which still produce small amounts of insulin. This is called 'beta cell function' and it is
      assessed by measuring C-peptide, which is a protein made by the pancreas when insulin is
      produced. Most people with type 1 diabetes eventually stop producing insulin themselves, this
      may occur rapidly in a few months, or more slowly over several years.

      New treatments preserving insulin production could improve management of diabetes. This could
      be done by using drugs acting on cells of the immune system. In type 1 diabetes, there is an
      imbalance between cells of the immune system, and there is evidence that one protein produced
      by our body, called Interleukin-2, could help in resetting the balance between those cells.
      It is important to start this treatment soon after diagnosis because this when there is the
      best chance of saving the beta cells still left in the pancreas.
