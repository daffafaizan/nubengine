    
      A phase II study design to investigate the use of any CPI on an intermittent dosing schedule.
      Patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC) who treatment refractory or cisplatin
      ineligible will receive CPI of choice as per standard dosing. Patients who have initial
      >/=10% tumor burden reduction will discontinue the CPI until they experience a >/=20% disease
      progression following 24 weeks +/- 4 weeks of immunotherapy, at which time CPI therapy will
      be restarted.

      All patients who do not meet criteria for the CPI intermittent phase of the study will be
      treated until unacceptable toxicity or RECIST-defined PD. Patients with RECIST-defined PD may
      continue CPI therapy at the discretion of the treating MD. These patients will continue with
      normal imaging every 12 weeks. In cases where a patient is continued on therapy after PD and
      develops subsequent PD (> 20% increase in sum of target lesions compared to the initial PD
      tumor measurements, the patient will come off study).

      Patients who meet criteria for the intermittent phase (i.e., have >/=10% tumor burden
      reduction) will not receive CPI therapy. Imaging will continue per protocol (every 12 weeks
      from the initial date they stopped CPI therapy). Patients who have RECIST defined PD on the
      intermittent phase should reinitiate CPI therapy. Patients who have a subsequent decrease in
      tumor burden >/=10% can then restart CPI therapy as per protocol.
