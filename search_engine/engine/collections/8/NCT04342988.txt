      time, the accuracy of pre-operative biometry and corneal surface HOAs will improve
      significantly after four weeks of Cequa treatment.

      Primary Outcome Measure: Spherical equivalent prediction error of pre-Cequa vs post-Cequa
      ocular biometry performed for cataract surgery.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      The impact of Cequa treatment on corneal higher order aberrations measured in the central 6
      mm of the cornea.

      The difference in SPEED questionnaire scores before and 4 weeks after Cequa treatment.

      The difference in corneal staining and tear breakup time (TBUT) before and after treatment
      with Cequa.
