      of intake and variety) of the Mealtime PREP intervention, as compared to, and in combination
      with nutrition education programming being offered in underserved neighborhoods of the
      greater Pittsburgh area. This project will examine the effects of Mealtime PREP groups as
      compared with established nutrition education groups, Cooking Matters for Parents. More
      importantly, this study will determine if offering these interventions in combination offers
      greater benefits than each in isolation. There are two specific aims of this pilot trial.

        1. To examine the effects of a combined program (Cooking Matters + Mealtime PREP) in
           comparison to offering each of these programs (Cooking Matters vs. Mealtime PREP) in
           isolation on child nutrition over time.

        2. To explore the effects of each of these programs (Cooking Matters vs. Mealtime PREP) and
           the combined program (Cooking Matters + Mealtime PREP) on parental stress and
           parent/child interaction over time.

      The investigators predict that children in all three arms (Cooking Matters, Mealtime PREP,
      and Cooking Matters + Mealtime PREP) will demonstrate improved nutrition. The investigators
      also predict that participants who receive the Mealtime PREP intervention will demonstrate
      better stability of gains over time.
