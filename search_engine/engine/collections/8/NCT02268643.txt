      States and several European countries for decades. It is effective in reducing the mortality
      of breast cancer and improving the postoperative quality of life of patients. Mammography has
      been the standard imaging method for the screening, however, our previous study has shown
      that ultrasound is more sensitive and less expensive than mammography. In the present study,
      the investigators will screen breast cancer of the Chinese women based on ultrasound and aim
      to evaluate the risk model (PUMCH model) which was established by our previous work.
