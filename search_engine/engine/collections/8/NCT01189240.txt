    
      Phase I

      Primary Objective:

        1. To assess the safety profile of R04929097 in combination with bevacizumab and to
           determine a recommended Phase II dose of R04929097 in combination with bevacizumab in
           patients with recurrent malignant glioma

           Secondary Objectives:

        2. To describe the toxicity associated with this combination regimen

        3. To assess pharmacokinetics of R04929097 in combination with bevacizumab

      Phase II I. Assess the safety profile and the recommended phase II dose of gamma-secretase
      inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) in combination with bevacizumab in patients with recurrent
      malignant glioma.

      II. Assess the progression-free survival at 6 months of patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Compare the overall survival of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with
      RO4929097 and bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the toxicity associated with this regimen in these patients. II. Assess the
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. III. Estimate the proportion of patients
      alive and progression-free survival at 6 months in patients treated with RO4929097 and
      bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone.

      IV. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of these regimens in these patients. V. Explore
      potential prognostic biomarkers from glioma tissue at baseline and potential association with
      Notch pathway inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase inhibitor
      RO4929097 (RO4929097) followed by a randomized phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive oral RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24, and bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 (days 2 or 3 and 15 of course 1 only). Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized* to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24, and bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      ARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *If phase II single-arm study demonstrates effectiveness, it will proceed to the phase
      II randomized study.

      Some patients undergo blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic studies. Archived tumor
      tissue samples are analyzed for potential biomarkers and Notch pathway inhibition.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months.
