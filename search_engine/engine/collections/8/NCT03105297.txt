      phase, 28 days Active phase (1 month in home treatment usage period with sleep laboratory
      nights after 7 (Night 8) and 28 days (Night 29) of treatment) followed by a two-night
      cross-over Nasal resistance phase. Screened participants were evaluated for sleep disordered
      breathing and PSG variables with sleep laboratory nights at Baseline, after 7 and 28 days of
      in house use of nasal dilator strip (Night 8 and 29 of Active phase), and at Day 30 and 31
      (Night 30 and 31 of Nasal resistance phase). Participants wore the Nasal dilator strip during
      Active phase. Participants then entered the Nasal resistance phase of the study, which
      consisted of two sleep laboratory nights at Day 30 and 31 (Night 30 and 31) where they were
      randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or 'no strip'/'strip" as per
      there randomization schedule.
