      hyperplasia (BPH).

      BPH is a common problem for older men. With BPH, the prostate grows larger. Over time, this
      growth can cause bothersome urinary symptoms. These symptoms can include frequent and/or
      urgent urination during the day or at night. Men with BPH can also have a weak urine stream,
      a stream that stops and starts, a feeling of not emptying the bladder all the way, and/or a
      need to strain to get urination started. BPH is NOT the same as prostate cancer.

      A number of natural products (extracts of different plants) seem to be able to reduce the
      bothersome symptoms of BPH with very few side effects over a few months. One of the plant
      extracts comes from the dwarf palm tree (Saw palmetto). The investigators do not know whether
      these plant extracts will reduce the symptoms of BPH over a longer period of treatment.
