      pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy, have been used to help people with insomnia. Because
      both treatments have advantages and disadvantages, a combination of these treatments may be a
      good way to treat insomnia.

      During the first 2 weeks of the study, participants keep a sleep log, wear an actigraph (a
      device that resembles a wristwatch and records activity to help determine when participants
      are asleep or awake), and complete questionnaires.

      Participants are then randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of behavioral therapy plus
      zolpidem tartrate (Ambien), behavioral therapy plus placebo, or behavioral therapy alone.
      During treatment, participants return to the clinic once a week to turn in their sleep logs,
      download their actigraph, and complete questionnaires.

      After 6 weeks, participants enter the post-treatment phase of the study, which lasts 2 weeks
      and is identical to the 2-week assessment at the beginning of the study.

      After the post-treatment phase, participants enter the follow-up period and are contacted at
      3 months, 6 months, and 1 year to complete another 2-week assessment with sleep logs,
      actigraphy, and questionnaires.
