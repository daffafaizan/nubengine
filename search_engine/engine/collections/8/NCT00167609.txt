      characterize by muscular dystrophy, myotonia, cardiac disorders, cognitive function
      impairment, hypersomnia, hair loss, endocrine disorders. Recent small studies suggested that
      DHEA treatment may improve muscle strength in adults with myotonic dystrophy. Thus, the
      current study aims at investigating the safety and efficacy of a prolonged treatment with
      DHEA in adults with myotonic dystrophy.
