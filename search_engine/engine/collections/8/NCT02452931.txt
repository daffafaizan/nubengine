    
      Leuprolide acetate is a GnRH agonist that inhibits pituitary gonadotropin secretion by
      binding to the GnRH receptors and blocking downstream hormone synthesis. The steady decrease
      in hormone synthesis (LH and FSH) leads to a suppression of testicular and ovarian
      steroidogenesis. In children with CPP, this steady decrease in hormone synthesis disrupts the
      progression of puberty.
