      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of warm ischemia during partial nephrectomy on long-term renal
           function in patients with solitary stage I renal cortical tumor and normal contralateral
           kidney.

      Secondary

        -  Determine to what degree the contralateral kidney compensates for the damage inflicted
           on the operated kidney during surgery.

        -  Determine the 1-year disease-specific and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo warm ischemia followed by partial nephrectomy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo cold ischemia followed by partial nephrectomy. Blood and urine
           samples are collected periodically after nephrectomy to assess renal function.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 9 , and 12 months after nephrectomy.
