      The usual treatment for these pain crises, intravenous fluids and pain medicines such as
      morphine, has changed little over the past three decades. In a pilot study, the addition of
      intravenous magnesium to standard therapy decreased length of stay; however, this study was
      not randomized, not blinded, not placebo-controlled, and not adequately powered to assess
      safety.

      We will conduct a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of about
      208 children, ages 4-21 years. Patients will be randomized to receive intravenous magnesium
      sulfate or placebo every 8 hours for a total of 6 doses, or until discharge. Patients will
      return for a routine clinic visit up to 3 months after discharge for a baseline assessment.
      Patients will also complete health-related quality of life measures at 4 timepoints
      throughout the study.
