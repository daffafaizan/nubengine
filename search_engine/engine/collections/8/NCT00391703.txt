      protein gene. The CFTR protein transports chloride ions (Cl-) across cell membranes in the
      lungs, pancreas, digestive tract, reproductive tract, and skin.

      CFTR mutation mainly leads to a dysfunction of the pulmonary system and pancreas exocrine
      function.

      Several studies showed that cystic fibrosis commonly induces a reduction of effort tolerance,
      peripheral muscular strength and work capacity.

      Patients suffering from cystic fibrosis with a high endurance capacity have a lower risk of
      poor prognosis. Those with a severe dyspnea have a higher benefit with a force training or a
      combined force and endurance training than with endurance training alone.

      We propose to study the effect of a quadriceps electrostimulation program, performed prior to
      an endurance retraining program using a cycloergometer, in patients with cystic fibrosis
      associated with severe pulmonary dysfunction, to enhance their muscular performance and
      increase their adherence to the cycloergometer retraining program.

      This is a randomized trial with two groups:

      Group A: experimental group, twenty patients. Six weeks with electrostimulation program
      followed by six weeks under a cycloergometer program.

      Group B: control group, twenty patients. Six weeks with their usual physical activity
      followed by six weeks with a cycloergometer program.

      The Randomization is stratified on expiratory volume per second. The size of randomization
      blocks is random because of the open design.
