    
      This study is being done to test the safety and effectiveness of the combination of
      intravenous (IV) romidepsin and/or oral CC - 486 with IV MK-3475 in people with
      microsatellite stable advanced colorectal cancer.

      The use of CC - 486 in this research study is investigational. The word "investigational"
      means that the oral form of CC - 486 is not approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA). Oral CC - 486 has only been given to a very small number of people so
      far, and this combination has never before been given together to people.

      Romidepsin has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (blood
      cancer). It is not approved by the FDA for use in other cancers.

      MK-3475 is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that the immune system uses to fight
      infection. Researchers have designed MK-3475 to block PD-1. PD-1 is a molecule that can shut
      down an immune response to infection or a cancer cell. An antibody to PD-1 can stop it from
      turning off an immune response and may be able to boost the immune system against the cancer.

      People with advanced colorectal tumors that are microsatellite stable (MSS) may join this
      study. Tumors that are MSS positive are not deficient in repair of DNA.

      This is a pilot study that will look at different ways of making MSS colorectal tumors
      sensitive to MK-3475 by giving 14 or 21 days of an epigenetic agent (oral CC - 486 and/or
      romidepsin).

      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like drawing numbers from a hat) to one of
      three study drug combinations:

      A. Oral CC - 486 taken daily for 21 days (and later shortened to 14 days if there are side
      effects) and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks.

      B. IV romidepsin given once weekly for 3 weeks and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks C. Oral CC
      - 486 taken daily for 21 days (and later shortened to 14 days if there side effects) and IV
      romidepsin given every 2 weeks and IV MK-3475 given every 2 weeks.

      Each arm is repeated every 28 days and will continue until the point that the study drug are
      no longer working. It will not be possible to cross over onto another arm if a participant's
      disease does not respond to the study drugs.

      In this study investigators are looking for the following information:

        -  What effects, good and/or bad, the combination of oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin in
           combination with MK-3475 has on participants' cancer; and

        -  If the genetic and chemical make-up of participants' blood and tumor cells play a role
           in a response to oral CC - 486 and/or romidepsin in combination with MK-3475.
