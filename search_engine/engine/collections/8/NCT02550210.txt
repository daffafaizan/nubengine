      the edges of the tumor. Twenty patients with palpable invasive breast cancer will undergo
      preoperative supine MRI, the creation of a BCL, and breast-conserving surgery using the BCL
      as an adjunct to palpation-guided tumor resection. Participants will also have the tumor
      position on their skin localized with the supine MR/optical scan/tracker method. The primary
      objective is to measure the distance from the center of the spots made by the BCL to the
      cancer edges.
