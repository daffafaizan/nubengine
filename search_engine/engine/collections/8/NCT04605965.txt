      photoplethysmography (PPG) waveforms and collects important indicators of heart and mental
      health, including heart rate, heart rate variability, pulse points, oxygen saturation and
      sleep patterns. Biometric data will be collected and participants will be alerted if any
      measurements are outside their normal range.

      Researchers are recruiting 100 participants who were diagnosed with COVID-19.
