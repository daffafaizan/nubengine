    
      This is a study which include 300 pregnant women who will deliver their babies in PUMCH.

        1. Obtain vaginal and rectal swab for Group B Strep (GBS) culture and Quantitative
           Fluorescence Polymerase Chain Reaction (QF-PCR) test between 35-37 weeks.

        2. Obtain intrauterine swabs of the woman whose vaginal-rectal GBS test is positive,for
           both GBS culture and GBS QF-PCR.

        3. Obtain rectal and pharynx swabs of the newborns of the woman whose vaginal-rectal GBS
           test is positive,for both GBS culture and GBS QF-PCR.

        4. Blood test for GBS culture and GBS QF-PCR will be carried out to all the babies
           transferred to neonatal intensive care unit(NICU).

        5. For all the samples that GBS culture result was not consistent with QF-PCR, We will do
           gene sequencing for verification.

        6. Pregnant outcome will be followed such as Apgar score,neonatal pneumonia, urinary tract
           infection, chorioamnionitis, endometritis,sepsis, and bacteremia,It also can cause focal
           infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, and endocarditis.

      Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Preexisting morbidity: Immunocompromised status (HIV +; malignancy; history of organ
           transplant; chronic steroid therapy; autoimmune disease requiring treatment during
