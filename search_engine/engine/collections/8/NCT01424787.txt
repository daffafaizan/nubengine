      calcium, phosphorus, calcium x phosphorus product and intact parathyroid hormone. One of the
      reasons is the still difficult and insufficient therapy with phosphate binders. Even though
      calcium containing phosphate binders have been proven to be effective, they are reported to
      lead in certain patients to hypercalcaemia. This observational study therefore not only
      evaluates the efficacy of the phosphate binder OsvaRenÂ® (containing calcium acetate and
      magnesium carbonate) but also the frequency of untoward events in daily practice as well as
      to the state of hyper-/ hypoparathyroidism as represented by serum iPTH values and the
      practice patterns used to adjust to and to fully exploit the qualities of the different
      available phosphate binders. In addition, the compensatory actions of the physicians, such as
      adaptation of the dialysate calcium or the combination with non-calcium containing phosphate
      binders, are going to be monitored. In order to receive additional safety data in the context
      of daily practice, the frequency of untoward events related to the treatment will be
      documented and analysed.
