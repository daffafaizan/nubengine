    
      The 76 week treatment period is followed by a 12 week reversibility phase which can be
      extended by up to another 12 weeks in order to allow participants who have completed their
      week 88 visit to continue in the study until the Extension study is ready to be implemented.

      In the optional extension, participants will be assigned to the same treatment arm to which
      they were assigned in the base study. The total duration of the extension study will be up to
      116 weeks; which will include a 2 year treatment period, followed by a 12 week reversal
      phase. A post-extension study follow-up phone call will be completed 12 weeks after
      discontinuation or completion of study treatment. Participants previously treated with
      anacetrapib or placebo will be invited in a 4:1 ratio in an optional extended reversal phase.
      The total duration of the extended reversal phase will be 1 year.

      Participants previously treated with anacetrapib in the DEFINE study will be followed
      periodically for up to 4 years to determine plasma levels of anacetrapib. Participants will
      also be invited to participate in a sub-study consisting of one clinic visit to measure
      anacetrapib levels in the plasma and the subcutaneous adipose tissue.
