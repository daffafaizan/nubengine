    
      MTN-023/IPM 030 is a Phase 2a, two-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-site,
      randomized trial of dapivirine vaginal ring (VR) versus placebo VR. The clinical trial is
      designed to assess the safety of dapivirine (25 mg) administered via a silicone vaginal ring
      (primary objective) and evaluate the acceptability of the dapivirine or placebo VR in
      sexually experienced, HIV-uninfected adolescent females, when inserted once every 4 weeks
      during 12 weeks of study product use.

      Approximately 96 participants will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either a silicone
      elastomer vaginal ring containing 25 mg of dapivirine or a placebo VR. The ring will be
      replaced every 4 weeks during the 12 week study product use period.

      Use of a VR to provide sustained delivery of microbicides is a novel investigational method
      for prevention of heterosexual transmission of HIV in women. This drug delivery method may
      circumvent potential difficulties related to adherence to daily or coitally-dependent uses of
      microbicide regimens.
