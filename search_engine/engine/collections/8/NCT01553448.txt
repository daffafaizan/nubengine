        -  Determine whether TβRIII expression and TGF-β signaling decrease in advanced-stage
           neuroblastoma (NBL) and whether these changes are confined to the Schwannian stroma.

        -  Determine whether sTβRIII levels and TGF-β signaling correlate with NBL stage, tumor
           stroma content, surface TβRIII expression, and TGF-β signaling.

      OUTLINE: Archived paraffin-embedded tissue and plasma samples are analyzed for TβRIII
      expression, TGF-β signaling, and SMAD3 expression and phosphorylation by
      immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and other assays. Surface
      expression of TβRIII in the neuroblastic and stromal tumor components are correlated with
      matched circulating levels of soluble TβRIII. Results are then correlated with each patient's
      outcome data, including stage.
