      on cognitive performance of pacemaker patients will be analysed. Accelerometer sensor will be
      compared with Closed Loop Stimulation over 2 years. The cognitive performance will be
      measured by means of a standardized psychometric test. The occurrence of atrial fibrillation
      and serious adverse events, patient self-assessment and quality of life will be evaluated. An
      analysis of the telemonitored (Home Monitoring) data will be performed in order to identify
      predictors of changes or differences in cognitive performance.
