      system, opportunistic infections and death. The immunity obtained by the infection itself can
      only partially contain the HIV infection. The purpose with a targeted therapeutic vaccination
      is therefore in addition to the existing immunity to induce a broader, more powerful and more
      rationally or better directed immunity than the one induced by the "natural" HIV-1 infection.
      This would potentially lower the viral load in the blood making it more difficult to spread
      the virus to others and prolong the time to AIDS disease and medical treatment. There is a
      need for new rational vaccination possibilities, able to prevent (HIV) disease, postpone the
      need for antiretroviral medical treatment, prolong the life, and limit spread of HIV-1 in the
      population. The present protocol seak to introduce such a new immune treatment principle for
      HIV-1 infected individuals. In this study, individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection will be
      vaccinated with selected synthetic HIV immune-peptides representing new discovered conserved
      targetÂ´s on the virus. The vaccine should induce new immunity against several epitope targets
      on their HIV, whereby the HIV infection may be controlled for a longer time by the immune
      system. The purpose of the study is primarily to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the
      vaccine and secondary to evaluate the immunological and antiviral response in the vaccinated
      individuals.
