      epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer treated with bevacizumab and low-dose
      cyclophosphamide.

      Secondary I. Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine
      the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine molecular correlates for
      response and outcomes in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 for the first course
      and on days 1 and 15 for all subsequent courses. Patients also receive low-dose oral
      cyclophosphamide on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
