      obtained from the Institutional Review Board. This study will be completed with 30 patients
      with ectopic pregnancy. An intervenous cannula will be centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1000 g
      within 30 minutes of collection. Aliquots of plasma will be added to eppendorf tubes and
      stored at -20Â°C.

      Plasma Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor levels will be measured using a Human VEGF-A
      Platinum ELISA kit (bioscience company, Catalog No: 00122, Santa Clara, California, USA). All
      assays will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The test kit
      sensitivity is 2.5 pg/ml. Intracycle variability is %4-6, intercycle variability is %8-10.
