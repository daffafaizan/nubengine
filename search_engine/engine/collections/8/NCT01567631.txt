      treated by surgical liver resection. The development of minimal invasive techniques opened up
      a new situation for hepatectomy. Intrahepatic Glisson's approach and the classical procedure
      are the two major operation procedures used in laparoscopic hepatectomy. The intrahepatic
      Glisson's approach has the advantages of less intraoperative bleeding and shorter operation
      time in our experience and as previous studies. The investigators expect further comparison
      of the safety and efficacy through this prospective controlled study by using two kinds of
      operation procedures.

      Intervention: Classical procedure versus intrahepatic Glisson's approach: a prospective
      randomized study. Eighty patients with liver disease need undergo hepatectomy were selected
      and divided into intrahepatic Glisson's group and classical procedure group randomly, each
      group contains 40 cases. Total laparoscopic hepatectomy were performed, with the intrahepatic
      Glisson's approach or classical procedure respectively.

      Results:

        1. Clinical data include: operation time, intraoperative blood loss, volume of blood
           transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function,long-term
           curative effect were collected and analysed.

        2. Statistical method: groups t-test univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression
           analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis were used.
