      and to evaluate if there will be similar effectiveness (efficacy+adherence) between PAP and
      MAS treatment for patients with mild to severe OSA. The secondary aim is to assess if patient
      preference does correlate to the final treatment adherence. An exploratory aim is to assess
      if the strategy of patients having both treatments available to use interchangeably could
      further improve treatment adherence, sleepiness, quality of life and fatigue. Having a better
      insight into patient adherence will improve the cost-effectiveness of treatment and will
      improve the health and quality of life for many Canadians who suffer from sleep apnea.

      The proposed trial is a randomized open-label, two-treatment, two-period cross-over trial
      followed by an observational trial. Sixty OSA patients (10≤AHI≤50) will receive both PAP and
      MAS. As a recent innovation, we have adherence monitors for MAS that can give a new and
      comprehensive comparative analysis of the effectiveness between MAS and PAP. In the
      randomized trial phase the two treatments will be used separately for 1 month each (after
      treatment adaptation/titration of 1-2 months for each device). Treatment efficacy and daily
      treatment use data will be assessed together with changes in symptoms (quality of life,
      sleepiness and fatigue). Patient initial preference will be determined by using a patient
      decision aid. This will be followed by the observational trial phase, where all patients will
      have access to both interventions at home for 6 months and be allowed to choose on a daily
      basis the intervention to use. The intervention duration of 6 months is to allow for a
      sustained response in long-term adherence and to observe changes in quality of life.
