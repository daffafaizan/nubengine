      often respond poorly to treatment with antidepressants. It is important, therefore, to find
      effective alternative therapies to treat these symptoms.

      Patients are randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions (1 session/week for 12 weeks) of either
      PST or BST. Following treatment, patients are followed for 6 months to determine functional
      and clinical outcomes. Depression scales, disability scales, and scales that measure problem
      solving skills are used to assess patients.
