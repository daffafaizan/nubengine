      to achieve a satisfactory balance between maximizing efficacy and minimizing dose-related
      toxicity. The pharmacokinetic profile of Tacrolimus is characterized by a high degree of
      inter- and intraindividual variability. Although it is rapidly absorbed, the bioavailability
      of Tacrolimus in the twice-daily capsule formulation is low and variable, ranging from 17 to
      23%. This could be due to poor water solubility, extensive first pass metabolism,
      p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux and the ingestion of food. Tacrolimus twice-daily capsules are
      also associated with a characteristic high peak following dosing, which may be associated
      with increased toxicity.

      Furthermore, transplanted recipients have to remain to a very demanding medication regimen
      for a long time. The burden of pills required is associated with decreased adherence, and
      lack of adherence can lead to rejection and possibly graft loss.

      The development of once-daily Tacrolimus forms without any change of the form of dissolving
      has already been shown to increase patients' adherence, while little difference has been
      demonstrated in the Tacrolimus pharmacokinetic profile. The pharmacokinetic profile of
      Tacrolimus is characterized by flatter kinetics (i.e., less fluctuation and swing) compared
      to twice-daily Tacrolimus providing for a balanced concentration-time consistency over 24
      hours which can also lead to reduced incidence and/or intensity of drug toxicity-related
      adverse events. Since the development of LCP-Tacrolimus once-daily tablets, with the use of
      MeltDoseÂ® technology, clinical data have shown lower peak and reduced peak-to-tough
      fluctuations.
