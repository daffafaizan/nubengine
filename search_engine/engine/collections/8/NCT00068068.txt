    
      Patients that provide Informed Consent and satisfy the Eligibility Criteria will undergo CT
      or ultrasound guided percutaneous placement of a single, two, three, or four light infusion
      devices depending on their tumor characteristics. No more than 4 light sources will be used
      at a single treatment. The light infusion devices may be used in a single lesion or in
      multiple lesions.

      Following radiographic confirmation of light infusion device placement, patients will receive
      an intravenous dose of LS11 at 40 mg/mÂ². One hour following completion of LS11
      administration, delivery of 200 J/cm light energy will begin. The light infusion device will
      then be manually removed and the patients will be observed for acute complication of light
      infusion device removal. Precautions for protection from external light exposure should be
      instituted beginning with the LS11 administration and be maintained as defined throughout the
      study period. On day 30+5 the patient will undergo clinical assessment and the tumor mass
      will be imaged using contrast enhanced spiral CT for determination of volume and radius of
      the tumor size, as well as tumor necrosis. The patient may then receive 5-FU and/or
      leucovorin + either irinotecan or oxaliplatin standard chemotherapy at day 30 visit. All
      patients, with or without chemotherapy at day 30, will undergo final clinical assessment and
      final tumor imaging evaluation using contrast CT at day 60+5 of Litx treatment.
