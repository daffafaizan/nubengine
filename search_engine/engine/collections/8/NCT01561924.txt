    
      The TEG parameters are: R time (Reaction Time), K time (K Time (arbitrary measurement)), a (a
      angle), MA (Maximum Amplitude) and LY30 (Lysis 30 min after MA) while the ROTEM parameters
      are: CT (Clotting Time), CFT (Clot Formation Time), a (a angle), MCF (Maximum Clot Firmness)
      and LI60 (Lysis index 60 min after CT)
