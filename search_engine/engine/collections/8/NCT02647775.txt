      then, the safety and efficacy of thoracoscopy for diagnosing and treating pleural, pulmonary,
      and mediastinal disease has been demonstrated with similar oncological results, which were
      confirmed by multiple clinical studies. Although VATS for thoracic surgery is practical, has
      been shown to reduce postoperative discomfort, and has improved cosmetic results when compare
      to open thoracotomy, unfortunately chronic thoracic wound discomfort and postoperative
      neuralgia were found in a significant portion of patients .

      Recently, a minimally invasive approach that is different from the conventional multiport
      thoracoscopic technique is gradually becoming of great interest in the diagnosis and
      treatment of thoracic surgical disease. Single-port VATS is one of the most promising
      emerging surgical techniques which allows the surgeon to perform a majority of thoracic
      surgeries and with similar perioperative outcomes that are comparable with the conventional
      multiport technique. However, a very limited number of clinical studies have demonstrated the
      advantages of single port VATS in postoperative pain reduction, when comparing to the
      traditional multiport thoracoscopic approach.

      To clarify the physiologic and immunologic effects of different approaches for minimally
      invasive thoracic surgery, investigators aim to compare the perioperative physiological
      changes, immunological responses, and postoperative pain between standard (multi-port)
      transthoracic thoracoscopic and single-port transthoracic thoracoscopic surgery for thoracic
      disease.
