      adherence. Almost all Americans own a mobile phone and 97% of mobile phone owners use text
      messaging. Digital health approaches can capitalize on the ubiquity of mobile technologies
      and allow investigators to reach affected populations with highly personalized content at low
      cost. Despite this ubiquity, interventions using text messaging for hypertension
      self-management primarily rely on reminders for tracking and medication adherence without
      diet and physical activity behaviors or feedback. As such, they are less effective.
      Investigators will establish the feasibility of a novel digital health-based approach for
      disseminating the DASH diet using the Amazon Alexa personal assistant. The data from this
      pilot feasibility trial will set the foundation for a larger, fully-powered R01 grant to
      examine whether DASH Cloud using Alexa can improve health outcomes. The primary aim of this
      proposal is to test the feasibility of the DASH Cloud intervention using Amazon Alexa.
