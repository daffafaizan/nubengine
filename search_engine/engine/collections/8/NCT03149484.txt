      unilateral conductive hearing loss who are treated with bone conductive devices and their
      outcomes with remote microphone technology. It has been shown that the use of intervention
      (hearing aids, cochlear implants, bone conduction devices) alone does not alleviate the
      difficulties children with hearing loss encounter in noisy environments such as a classroom
      or restaurant. One of the most common methods to help children hear better in these types of
      environments is the use of a personal remote microphone (RM) system. This study will evaluate
      how much benefit children are getting from their bone conduction device alone compared to the
      bone conduction device with a personal RM system.
