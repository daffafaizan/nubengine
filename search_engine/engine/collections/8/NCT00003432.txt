        -  Evaluate the ability of active immunotherapy with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) RNA
           pulsed dendritic cells to induce CEA specific T cells in patients with metastatic breast
           cancer in complete remission following peripheral blood stem cell transplant.

        -  Determine the clinical efficacy in terms of overall and recurrence free survival of
           immunotherapy with CEA RNA pulsed dendritic cells in this patients population.

      OUTLINE: Dendritic cells are taken from the leukapheresis product obtained during the
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant procedure performed prior to treatment on this study.
      The dendritic cells are pulsed with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) RNA. Approximately 60-90
      days after the peripheral blood stem cell transplant, patients receive CEA RNA pulsed
      dendritic cells IV every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses. Patients undergo a second
      leukopheresis after the last dose of immunotherapy to obtain specimens for immunologic tests.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-26 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
