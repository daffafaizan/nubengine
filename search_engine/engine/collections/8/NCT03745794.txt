    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To use a phase II randomized controlled trial to compare the intervention of a second
      regional anesthetic block (quadratus lumborum [QL] block) versus usual care (single
      intraoperative QL block) to increase the proportion of opioid-free pancreatic cancer
      survivors at discharge after potentially curative surgery.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients undergo QL block before surgery and receive standard of care multimodal pain
      control after surgery.

      ARM 2: Patients undergo QL block before surgery and receive multimodal pain control. Patients
      then undergo a second QL block on day 4 after surgery and continue to receive standard of
      care.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months,
      and 1 year after surgery.
