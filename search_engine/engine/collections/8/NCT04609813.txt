      of its extremely aggressive nature and poor survival rate. In 2018, the incidence rate and
      mortality rate of esophageal cancer were 6.3/100000 and 5.5/100000. There are clear
      differences between the risk factors of both histological types that affect their incidence
      and distribution worldwide.There are areas of high incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (some
      areas in China) that meet the requirements for cost-effectiveness of endoscopy for early
      diagnosis in the general population of those areas. The gold standard to detect and diagnose
      esophageal cancer is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy. However, China is a
      country with large population, which makes it difficult to perform screening endoscopy in the
      whole crowd. There are several researches showing that there is a low detecting rate of
      esophageal cancer if only perform screening endoscopy in high risk area. This multicenter
      study aims to propose a table, including Risk factors for esophageal cancer.

      Besides, esophageal cytology is essential to detect and diagnose esophageal. Now there are
      improved esophageal cell collector（CytospongeTM、EsophaCapTM）which adopt an inflatable sponge
      capsule design to increase the contact area with the esophageal mucosa. Our study aims to
      evaluate the function and value of new type esophageal cell collector to China's esophageal
      cancer screening.
