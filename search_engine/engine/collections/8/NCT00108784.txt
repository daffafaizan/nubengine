      same amount of energy, a larger volume (weight) of food can be consumed if the food or diet
      is low in energy density than if the food or diet is high in energy density. The two
      nutrients that have the largest impact on energy density are fat and water. Foods high in fat
      and low in water content are typically high in energy density, whereas foods low in fat and
      high in water content, such as fruits and vegetables, are low in energy density. This study
      will examine whether there are increased benefits for weight loss and weight maintenance when
      the ad libitum consumption of water-rich foods is added to a reduced-fat diet, thus making it
      even lower in energy density.
