      oral immunotherapy and a 2 year maintenance phase. Subjects will be recruited to determine
      the immune response during the administration of peanut OIT after the development of disease.
      Cohort will include children age 5-16 years who have peanut allergy. The study will require
      approximately 36 visits with 3 phases: screening phase (~ 2 months); build-up phase (weeks 1
      year), followed by the maintenance phase (2 years).

      The primary objective of the OIT protocol is to desensitize subjects to peanut and this
      occurs over the first 12 months of the study (build-up phase). The first dose will be based
      on the amount at which the subject reacted during a double blind placebo controlled food
      challenge (DBPCFC). Thereafter, dose escalation would continue as outlined in the protocol
      for approximately 50 weeks until the maintenance dose of peanut protein (3900 mg) is reached.

      The maintenance phase will continue from the end of the build-up phase until approximately 24
      months. During this phase, the subject will switch to a peanut equivalent dose for the
      maintenance phase. At the conclusion of the maintenance phase a DBPCFC will be done. Negative
      challenges will be confirmed by open challenge. DBPCFC will be done.
