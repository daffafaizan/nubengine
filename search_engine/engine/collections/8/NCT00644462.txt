      as a 'Chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements
      play a role. The asthma guideline states that inflammation causes recurrent episodes of
      wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness that are associated with widespread but variable
      airflow obstruction.

      Wheeze quantification by lung sounds analysis methods is objective, non invasive and has been
      shown to correlate with clinical status in asthma and bronchiolitis. The recording procedure
      is simple, requiring only the attachment of 4 ECG-size sensors to the chest wall. A 30-second
      recording is often adequate to obtain good quality data, where wheezes are detected and
      counted with high degree of accuracy.

      Karmel Sonix Ltd has developed the PulmoTrack® 2010 with WIM-PC™ Technologies device,
      indicated for acoustic pulmonary function measurement that quantifies the presence of
      wheezing. This study was designed in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using the
      PulmoTrack® 2010 with WIM-PC™ Technologies device for wheeze detection during dynamic
      bronchial situations in asthmatic adults.
