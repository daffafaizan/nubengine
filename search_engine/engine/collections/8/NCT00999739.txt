    
      Randomised study comparing two pneumococcal vaccination strategies in HIV-infected adults
      with moderate immunossupression (CD4 between 200 and 500 cells/uL and viral load under
      5logs), one with conjugated heptavalent vaccine(Prevenar, Wyeth-Lederle) followed by
      polysaccharide vaccine 4 weeks after (Aventis-Pasteur), and two with one dose of
      polysaccharide vaccine. A sample of 220 HIV-infected adults will be randomised to receive twe
      strategy one(110 patients) one dose of heptavalent conjugated vaccine at day 0 and one dose
      of polysaccharide vaccine at week 4 (in deltoid muscle); or strategy two (110 patients) one
      dose of polysaccharide vaccine at day 0. Secondary effects to the vaccines will be evaluated
      by phone interview 3 days after vaccinations.

      Blood samples will be taken at day 0(before the first vaccine), at week 4 before the
      polysaccharide in the group one, and 4 weeks after the polysaccharide in the group two) and
      at week 8 in the group one, and at weeks 48 and 96 in both groups Antibody concentration ,
      avidity, and opsonophagocytic killing activity will be measured in all the samples for
      serotypes 4,14,19F,23F,6B,18C,9V.

      Antibody concentration , avidity, and opsonophagocytic killing activity will be compared
      between both vaccine groups, and between prevaccination and at 4,8, 48 and 96 weeks of
      vaccination. Risk factors associated to good antibody response (antibody duplication and
      antibody duplication plus achieve a level above 1ug/ml)will be measured at 8, 48 and96 weeks.
