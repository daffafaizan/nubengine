    
      -  The clinical and functional aspects will be evaluated using a visual analogue scale
           (VAS) for pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) and Lequesne
           questionnaires of quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis and testing of
           six-minute walk (6MWT).

        -  Biomechanical analysis of gait will be performed by infrared cameras and a force
           platform. From the data of kinematics and kinetics, will be calculated moments of the
           knee joint strength by inverse dynamics.

      The process (steps) will be divided as follows:

        -  step 1, in this step there will be sorting and initial assessment of potential
           participants; pain will be evaluated through VAS, function and quality of life by means
           of questionnaires WOMAC and Lequesne and the 6MWT, and by evaluating the biomechanics of
           gait.

        -  step 2,(3 month follow-up), both groups will be evaluated again by the VAS and WOMAC and
           Lequesne questionnaires.

        -  step 3, after 6 months of starting the monitoring process, both groups will be
           reevaluated through the VAS, WOMAC, Lequesne, 6MWT and biomechanical analysis of gait.
           This step is the final evaluation, characterizing the end of intervention.
