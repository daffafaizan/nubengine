      Disorder (BSD) who are prescribed second generation anti psychotics (SGAs) from at least 24
      public and private mental health practices in the Greater Cincinnati and New York City
      regions, (approximately 900 each from ~12 Cincinnati region and ~12 Long Island/New York
      mental health treatment sites) to participate in the proposed patient-centered large
      pragmatic trial examining the effectiveness of MET and LIFE vs. LIFE alone. Patients will be
      eligible if they are ages 8-17 years old, inclusive, overweight or obese (BMI > 85%),
      continuing or starting treatment with at least one SGA (i.e., olanzapine, clozapine,
      risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, iloperidone, lurasidone, paliperidone, or
      asenapine) and have a clinical diagnosis of BSD (bipolar I or II disorder, cyclothymia, or
      bipolar or mood disorder not otherwise specified [or by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
      Mental Disorders V (DSM-5), other specified bipolar or mood disorder). The enrollment rate
      will be 2-3 patients/month/site for a recruitment time of 30 months.
