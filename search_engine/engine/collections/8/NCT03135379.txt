      team as part of standard of care. At that time, an investigator will obtain verbal consent
      from the patient and provide an information sheet to help explain study details/answer any
      questions. The patient will then be randomized to either warmed gel or room temperature gel.
      Investigators will handle the gel using a heat-resistant glove (ULine Terry Cloth Glove) to
      maintain blinding to the gel temperature. A bedside ultrasound study will then be performed
      by emergency physicians not otherwise involved in the study using the study gel. Immediately
      upon ultrasound completion, the patients will complete a satisfaction survey. The images from
      the study will be saved and subsequently reviewed by an emergency physician with fellowship
      training in ultrasound to score image quality from 1 (low) to 5 (high).
