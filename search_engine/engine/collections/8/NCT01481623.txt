    
      In the first phase of the study the investigators will recruit patients and families, with a
      strong bias for "extreme" forms of diabetes (very early onset and/or syndromic diabetes) and
      familial context suggestive of monogenic inheritance (e.g. consanguinity, multiplicity of
      diabetic siblings) and perform genetic studies on these to identify the genes. After
      obtaining informed consent, the investigators will collect clinical information on diabetes
      and other associated diseases and features, family information on diabetes, and collect blood
      samples for DNA, RNA, serum and cell lines. The investigators will then perform genetic
      studies to identify the genes responsible for these monogenic forms of diabetes.

      After identification of genes, the second phase of the study will be to test the consequence
      of carrier status for the identified mutations on metabolic traits related to glucose
      metabolism. For this, after obtaining informed consent, the investigators will extend the
      recruitment of the initial families (after gene identification) to recruit relatives who may
      be carriers of these mutations. The investigators will determine the carrier status of these
      subjects and perform a detailed clinical description as well as metabolic studies to evaluate
      their glucose metabolism.

      This study will lead to the identification of new monogenic diabetes entities, and their
      corresponding genes, and may also result in the identification of new genes predisposing to
      common forms of diabetes. This project has implication for diagnosis of these monogenic forms
      of diabetes, and may result in some cases in improved care for the patients, including
      prevention and treatment.
