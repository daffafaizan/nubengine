    
      Phase 1:

      In the first phase, a randomized, controlled, two-period cross-over study design (AB/BA) was
      used with no washout period. After an acclimatization period (3 days), during which the
      compliance of the Positional Device was monitored, each patient was randomized into either
      Group I (sequence AB) or Group II (sequence BA). After commencement of treatment, the outcome
      measures were repeated on the last day of each treatment period. On the control night (B),
      subjects used the lumbar corset and were positioned ad lib.

      Phase 2:

      In the second phase of the study which began immediately after attainment of the first phase,
      subjects were randomized on a 1:1 basis, in a parallel group design, to 3 months of
      positional devices or sleeping ad lib. At 3 months later all subjects were interviewed face
      to face to determine the Barthel index and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item depression
      scale. Subjects in the positional devices group were also evaluated about devices adherence
      using the following questions: use of the device all nights, most nights, some nights, or no
      nights.
