      require the use of post-operative periodontal pack. The periodontal pack protects the
      surgical site from surface trauma, stops the post-operative bleeding and infection as well as
      stabilizing the blood clot and accelerate healing.

      However, a review article discussed the adverse effects of periodontal pack as it may cause
      plaque induced inflammation, patient discomfort due to difficulty in eating and irritation of
      the tissues. In the article, there were clinical trials that advocated that wound healing
      could occur without the need of periodontal pack if the surgical wound was kept clean alone
      indicating that the pack does not affect the wound healing.

      This gave rise to idea to use a material that has been proven to accelerate wound healing and
      decrease the patient discomfort to be placed under the periodontal pack which would be used
      only as a protective barrier.

      Several studies tested platelet rich concentrates as adjunctive methods under periodontal
      packs verses periodontal packs alone after surgical abrasion of gingival depigmentation. They
      found that there was a clinical, histological and statistical difference between the groups
      favoring the platelet concentrate groups.

      Using PRF which is a second generation platelet concentrate first developed by Choukroun et
      al in 2001 used as a membrane could provide accelerated wound healing properties which would
      accelerate ginigival re-epithelization . Using a periodontal pack is conventionally used
      which will provide a mechanical barrier to protect the wound from any stimulus.
