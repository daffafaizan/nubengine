      mitochondrial function in Parkinson's disease, presenting a unique target for therapy. A
      pilot study of ubiquinol in PD was therefore undertaken to determine its effects upon
      physiologic measures of mitochondrial metabolic function. The incorporation of a neuroimaging
      biomarker is particularly important, since changes would demonstrate our ability to achieve
      Central Nervous System (CNS) access from this an formulation, accompanied by a meaningful
      neurophysiologic effect. Hydrogen Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (1H MRSI) is
      a technique that provides insight into the metabolism of several endogenous brain compounds,
      most notably N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), choline-containing compounds (Cho), and creatine and
      phosphocreatine (Cr). A number of studies of mitochondrial function have now firmly
      established the utility of 1H MRSI in probing potential mitochondrial energy metabolism
      dysfunction, in primary mitochondrial disorders, but also in PD. This pilot study is
      therefore designed to test whether oral ubiquinol affects cerebral indices of mitochondrial
      dysfunction, as measured by 1H MRSI in patients with Parkinson's disease, and to gather
      preliminary information on the safety and tolerability of ubiquinol in individuals with PD.
