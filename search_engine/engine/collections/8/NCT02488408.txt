    
      This study is a dose-escalation of BGB324, an Axl kinase inhibitor, in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), followed by a cohort expansion
      study of BGB324 either as a single agent in patients with AML or MDS, or in combination with
      cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, Ara-C) or decitabine in patients with AML.

      The study will run in Germany, Norway and the US and may enrol up to approximately 75
      patients with AML or MDS.

      The study consists of a dose-escalation phase to determine the MTD and/or recommended dose
      for Phase II (RP2D) of BGB324 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS (Part A)
      followed by a cohort expansion phase in up to four disease-specific cohorts (Part B).

      BGB324 will be administered orally according to a daily schedule, with the first three doses
      of Cycle 1 serving as a 'loading' dose. Each 21-day (three week) period will constitute 1
      cycle of treatment.
