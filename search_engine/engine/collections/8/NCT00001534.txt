      ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. There is often associated LV diastolic dysfunction and
      myocardial ischemia. The severity of the LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and
      myocardial ischemia are important determinants of clinical outcomes. Angiotensin II modulates
      cell growth and cardiac function. There is also increasing evidence that the
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be present in cardiac cells, and the hypertrophic action
      of angiotensin II could therefore be mediated by circulating or locally produced hormone.
      Animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that independent of their effects on systemic
      blood pressure, ACE inhibition and angiotensin II receptor (AT1) blockade can reduce cardiac
      hypertrophy, improve LV diastolic function and myocardial ischemia. AT1 blockade may be
      preferable to ACE inhibitors because by inhibiting angiotensin II from binding to its
      receptor, the system can be turned off irrespective of the source of angiotensin II. Also,
      there may be fewer side effects due to lack of bradykinin. This is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study that examines the abilities of enalapril (ACE inhibition) and
      losartan (AT1 blockade), separately or in combination, to cause regression of the cardiac
      hypertrophy, and to improve LV function and myocardial perfusion in non-obstructive HCM.
