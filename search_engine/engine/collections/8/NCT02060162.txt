      guidelines. Routinely collected programmatic data will be used to assess general HIV outcomes
      (CD4 response, loss to follow-up, death) as well as collecting study specific data (hepatitis
      testing, questionnaire regarding risk factors for hepatitis/liver disease, and non-invasive
      liver scan) to address other aims. The study will be implemented at two sites in Southern
      Africa (Zambia and Mozambique) with a total enrollment across all sites of 1,900
      participants. The Zambia site will only enroll 900.
