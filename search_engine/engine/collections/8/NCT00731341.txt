      therapeutic options are conservative (medications), invasive (e.g., hysterectomy, surgical
      myomectomy), or minimally invasive (uterine artery embolization, or myolysis).

      Fibroid ablation using cryogenic energy, known as Cryoablation, offers a potential
      alternative method of fibroid treatment. Cryotherapy is a well-established technique for the
      treatment of various benign and malignant conditions. Cryoablation has been described for the
      treatment of prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, liver tumors and benign and malignant
      breast tumors.

      Galil Medical's proposed feasibility study is looking to examine the technical success,
      safety and feasibility of a hysteroscopic approach for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids.
      This technique involves the insertion and placement of Galil Medical's 17-gauge cryoablation
      needle(s)guided by a hysteroscopic device. Ultrasound provides real-time monitoring of the
      needle insertion, placement and iceball propagation during the cryoablation procedure.

      This treatment offers the patient to preserve her uterus by a minimally invasive procedure.
      The type of the fibroids intended for treatment (Type II submucous myomas)are often very
      difficult to completely and safely remove hysteroscopically and are often treated through an
      open or laparoscopic procedure. A hysteroscopic procedure does not involve intraperitoneal
      intervention and is therefore expected to be associated with less intra-operative and
      post-operative complications.

      The recovery from hysteroscopic cryoablation is expected to be fast with only minimal self
      resolving discomfort. The patient should be able to return to her normal activity within
      24-48 hours.
