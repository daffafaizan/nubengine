      to the SBRT dose groups. Subjects will remain on sorafenib therapy during SBRT. Any change in
      sorafenib dosage before, during or after SBRT will be at the discretion of the subject's
      medical oncologist. Subjects will be assessed during, immediately after and at 4 and 8 weeks
      post-therapy for toxicity.

      Stereotactic body radiotherapy will be given in increasingly higher dose levels each cohort
      until the maximum tolerated dose of radiation is determined.
