      recurrent cancer, including local advanced primary salivary gland cancer which could not be
      resected completely; recurrent salivary gland cancer which could not be resected completely;
      T3/T4 tumor which could not tolerate surgery due to severe combined disease. The subjects
      would be divided into Iodine-125 radioactive seeds permanent interstitial implantation
      brachytherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy randomly. During the follow-up
      period, the efficacy and the safety index would be monitored.
