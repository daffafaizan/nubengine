      efficiency of T-DM1 + Afatinib versus T-DM1 in HER2-positive breast cancer patients with
      active refractory brain metastases. This study will be divided into two phases. The purpose
      of Phase I is to find out the highest dose of Afatinib that can be given safely with T-DM1. 3
      ~ 24 eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study. The purpose of Phase II is to find out
      whether the dose of Afatinib with T-DM1 determined in Phase I will keep subjects from getting
      worse for a period of time. The estimated ORR is 17.9 percent in the control group,
      hypothesis Afatinib can improve the prognosis of subjects, so objective respond rate (ORR) of
      experimental group is increased by 30 percent, with alpha = 0.025 (unilateral), beta = 0.1.
      The ratio of the experimental group and control group is 1:1, assuming a 5 percent loss rate.
      As a result, calculating by PASS 11 software, approximately 106 subjects will be enrolled,
      with 53 cases in the experimental group, and 53 cases in the control group.
