ventricular septal defect with prolapsed aortic valve and outflow tractobstruction .a case of ventricular septal defect combined with aortic valvularlesion and infundibular pulmonic stenosis is described . the rightcoronary cusp of the aortic valve, protruding through the ventricularseptal defect, was demonstrated by right ventricular angiocardiographyas a polyp-like mass in the right ventricular outflow tract . cardiaccatheterization and angiocardiography showed progressive rightventricular outflow obstruction .
