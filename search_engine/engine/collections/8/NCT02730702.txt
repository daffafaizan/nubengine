      colon tissue. This probe will be used to identify subjects who do and do not have
      precancerous changes in the colon by capturing the light reflected back from the rectal wall
      and that will be assessed without the need for colonoscopy and bowel preparation (i.e
      unprepped). This device may detect early cancerous changes in colon tissue with higher
      accuracy than current tests.
