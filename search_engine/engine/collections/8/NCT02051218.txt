      acid in delaying time to a first on-study skeletal related event (SRE) in patients with solid
      tumors, with no effects on disease progression or survival. Many SREs were silent compression
      fractures found only because of scheduled imaging. The approved dose of denosumab is 120 mg
      s.c. every 4 weeks (q4w). Although generally well tolerated, there is a time-dependent
      increase in osteonecrosis of the jaw in up to 8% of patients. Cases of fatal hypocalcaemia
      were observed during post marketing surveillance.

      The optimal dose and schedule for denosumab is unknown. Denosumab is associated with
      considerable costs and may add toxicity; thus a study of de-escalation is warranted.

      The aim of the trial is to test the hypothesis that the benefit of Denosumab is maintained if
      administered 120 mg q12w as compared to 120 mg q4w. The primary endpoint of this open-label
      randomized phase III non-inferiority trial is time to first on-trial symptomatic skeletal
      event (SSE: i.e. clinically significant pathological fracture, radiation therapy to bone,
      surgery to bone or spinal cord compression). With a non-inferiority margin of 1.2 for the
      hazard ratio, a power 80% and a type I error 5%, the total sample size is 1380. Secondary
      endpoints are safety, time to subsequent on-trial SSE, quality of life, health economic
      outcomes, and change in bone turnover markers. This study is open for international
      collaboration.
