      specific aim of this study is to characterize the clinical cutaneous effects of varying spurt
      durations and spurt delivery patterns that spurt durations of 100 ms or less will result in a
      very low incidence (less than 2%) of clinical skin effects (redness, blistering, local skin
      allergic reaction or skin discoloration) in any skin type.

      Researchers can use Cryogen Spray Cooling to protect the skin epidermis during laser therapy
      to decrease treatment pain, allow safe treatment of darker skin types, and safe use of high
      laser fluences. Cryogen Spray Cooling with Tetrafluoroethane has been incorporated into many
      Food and Drug Administration approved, commercially available laser devices currently used
      for treatment of vascular lesions, hair removal and non-ablative skin rejuvenation.
