    
      Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a safe type of low intensity resistance exercise
      that has demonstrated enhanced muscle growth, muscle strength, oxygen delivery and
      utilization (VO2Max). With BFRT, lighter loads can be used to build muscle while sparing the
      joints from heavy loading and without overly fatiguing the central nervous system.

      The objectives of BFRT are 1) to increase the effectiveness of physical therapy, 2) safely
      increase muscle mass, reduce arterial stiffness, increase bone density, increase Vo2Max,
      improve carotid arterial compliance and enhance response of the autonomic nervous system, 3)
      improve muscle endurance in 1/3 the time, improve strength and hypertrophy after surgery,
      improve muscle recruitment and increase anabolic growth signaling.
