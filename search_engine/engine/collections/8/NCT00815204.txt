      traumatic events increases the risk of poor physical health, and chronic PTSD often leads to
      disability. The pathophysiology of PTSD is continually being explored in order to help find
      better treatment modalities for this debilitating disorder. Proposed mechanisms for the
      altered stress axis in PTSD include changes at the level of the pituitary. Though the
      pituitary stress hormone axis has been explored, no work has been done to evaluate for
      changes in the pituitary volume in response to these changes in the stress axis in PTSD. We
      have designed a study which will assess for differences in pituitary volumes. We will compare
      volumes in patients with PTSD, non-PTSD subjects who have had a history of trauma, and
      healthy controls. We will test the HPA axis through the dexamethasone/CRH test, a
      standardized diagnostic test, and correlate the findings with changes in the pituitary
      volume. Moreover, we will assess for changes in other endocrine axes and proteins.

      We propose to further our understanding of PTSD by establishing a direct link between
      structure and function. By establishing these links in structure and function, novel
      therapies which can intervene through the endocrine system may prove to be of benefit in
      treating PTSD
