      oropharyngeal cancer (tonsil or base of tongue cancer) using chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy in patients who have not smoked, or only smoked a minimal amount of cigarettes or
      equivalent. In these patients, the cancer is thought to be caused by a virus (Human Papilloma
      Virus, or HPV). HPV is a virus that infects the epidermis (outermost layer of skin) and
      mucous membranes of humans. In general, patients with HPV-related cancer such as yours have a
      better prognosis compared with patients whose tumors are smoking-related. Taking into account
      the good prognosis, it is possible that reducing the intensity of therapy will not affect the
      high rate of tumor control, while reducing the side-effects of therapy. In this study, the
      investigators plan to reduce the intensity of treatment by replacing the currently used
      chemotherapy drugs with an FDA approved drug, cetuximab, which is a monoclonal antibody to a
      growth factor which helps cancer cells grow. By opposing the effect of the growth factor,
      cetuximab may help radiotherapy kill cancer cells without a lot of effect on the normal
      tissue. It differs from chemotherapy in its more selective activity against tumors compared
      to normal tissue Cetuximab has the chance to preserve the high rate of success in killing the
      tumor but may reduce the side effects and complications of therapy in comparison to
      chemotherapy drugs.

      The investigators would also like to know if taking cetuximab has any effect on certain
      cancer-related molecules in the cancer and the normal cells inside the cheek. They would like
      to test this by taking a small biopsy of the tumor, as well as a swab of the inside of the
      cheek, before and shortly after the start of therapy.
