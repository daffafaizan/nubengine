    
      A single-arm, safety study intended to assess safety and system performance, and the
      feasibility to improve hemodynamics in patients with acute heart failure syndrome using
      transvenous, cardiac autonomic nerve stimulation (CANS) therapy. In addition, the effects of
      NeuroTronik CANS Therapy™ on the congestion of patients will be studied. The study proposes
      that the NeuroTronik CANS Therapy™ System be deployed during the acute heart failure syndrome
      hospital admission, along with existing standard treatment.
