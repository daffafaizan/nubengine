a study of the inhibitory effect of ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid onthe thrombin-fibrinogen reaction .1. ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid reversibly inhibits thethrombin-fibrinogen reaction by means of a time-dependent diminution infibrinogen reactivity .2. this alteration of fibrinogen is due to some property of the edtamolecule in an unchelated form, and is not due to the removal of tracemetal ions .3. possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed .
