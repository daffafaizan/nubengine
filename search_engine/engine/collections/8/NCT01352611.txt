      reduce symptoms of severe tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum disorder.

      Some people with autism spectrum disorder do not like to be touched. This is referred to as
      tactile defensiveness. Baclofen is a drug approved for treatment of spasticity in patients
      with conditions such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury.
      Intrathecal means that baclofen is administered by injection into the spinal canal. In this
      study, each patient will undergo a trial administration of intrathecal baclofen and the
      effect of intrathecal baclofen on symptoms of tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum
      disorder will be evaluated.

      Each patient will have three visits in connection with the study. First, there will be a
      screening visit in which the investigators determine if the patient is eligible to
      participate in the study. To participate, each patient must have autism spectrum disorder,
      severe tactile defensiveness, and meet other listed criteria. At the second visit, each
      patient will undergo the intrathecal baclofen trial procedure. The procedure used is the
      standard procedure to determine if intrathecal baclofen is effective for treatment of
      spasticity. In this study however, instead of evaluating the effect of intrathecal baclofen
      on spasticity, the investigators will evaluate the effect of intrathecal baclofen on symptoms
      of tactile defensiveness and autism spectrum disorder. The trial procedure and evaluation
      will require about one day. At the third visit, the follow up visit, the investigators will
      evaluate and discuss the patient's response to the treatment.
