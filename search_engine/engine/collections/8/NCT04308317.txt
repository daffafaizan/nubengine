      been found in wuhan, hubei province.Has now become a global epidemic of crisis.

      After recent frontline anti-epidemic experience, the diagnostic and treatment specifications
      for new coronary pneumonia have been updated several times. In the latest country,
      "Specifications for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Types of Coronary Pneumonia (Trial
      Version 6)", the traditional Chinese medicines have again emphasized For the treatment of
      patients, traditional Chinese medicine preparations such as Xuebijing and Qingfei Paidu
      Decoction have been recommended, but the introduction of anti-fibrosis related drugs is still
      lacking.Tetrandrine is a traditional Chinese medicine. Previous research has shown that it is
      an antagonist of calmodulin, has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory effects, and can effectively
      inhibit fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis.The study is expected to treat
      patients with mild and severe neo-coronary pneumonia through standard treatment regimens in
      combination with tetrandrine tablets, thereby reducing the clinical progress of some
      patients, improving prognosis, reducing the incidence of pulmonary fibrosis during
      rehabilitation, and improving patients' quality of life.
