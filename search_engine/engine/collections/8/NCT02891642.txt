      other benign medical conditions. Current standard method for detecting malignancy is by
      cytological examination. However, cytological examination is often low sensitive, often due
      to the large amount of fluid with relatively sparse tumor cells present and the presence of
      many normal cells such as mesothelial cell. The investigators have developed a new method,
      malignant cell enrichment with immunomagnetic beads capture followed by Pap staining and NGS,
      to identify target malignant cells in body fluids.

      McAb NJ001 is developed for malignant cell isolation with immunomagnetic beads capture
      technique. This is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, statistically powered clinical
      trial that will enroll patients scheduled to undergo a procedure for removal of fluid from a
      serous effusion with or without clinical diagnosis of caner. The purpose of the current study
      is to compare the novel serous effusion detection assay using NJ001 coated immunomagnetic
      beads capture followed by Pap staining and NGS analysis with traditional cytologic
      evaluation.
