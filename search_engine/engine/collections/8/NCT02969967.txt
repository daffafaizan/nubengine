      improve upper extremity outcomes post stroke, few therapeutic approaches allow those with
      moderate to severe upper extremity impairment to independently participate in repetitive
      grasp and release activities. The SaeboFlex orthosis is a dynamic wrist-hand orthosis that
      assists with finger and thumb extension after functional grasping with the paretic hand and
      therefore may allow those with more affected upper extremities post stroke to participate in
      repetitive grasp and release activities that they otherwise would be unable to do. More
      research is required on the effectiveness of this orthosis in improving upper extremity
      recovery post stroke especially when used at home as a continuation of therapy received
      during inpatient rehabilitation. It has been suggested that guided home rehabilitation
      programs can improve the ability of stroke survivors to be more independent in their
      activities of daily living. This study is a mixed methods study combining a quantitative
      single subject ABA design and qualitative post study individual interviews to first capture
      quantitative information on the effectiveness of the SaeboFlex intervention and then
      qualitative information that will build on and further explain the quantitative data. Three
      participants who are using a SaeboFlex orthosis as part of their upper extremity
      rehabilitation program will be recruited from an inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit as they
      are being discharged from inpatient rehabilitation and will be seen by the principal
      investigator in their homes for 1 hour 3 times a week for 2 weeks and then once a week for 6
      weeks while they are on the waiting list for outpatient occupational therapy services. The
      intervention will follow a set protocol of grasp-release activities using the SaeboFlex
      orthosis for 50 minutes at least 3 times per week, followed by 10 minutes of grasp-release
      activities without the orthosis, both of which will be graded to provide optimal upper
      extremity challenge throughout the intervention period. Repeated baseline assessments will be
      completed by a trained research assistant, in the participants' homes, within one week of
      discharge from inpatient stroke rehabilitation and will be repeated after 4 and 8 weeks of
      intervention, followed by individual interviews in the participants' homes.
