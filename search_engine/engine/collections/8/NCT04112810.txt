      myeloablative conditioning (MAC) alloHCT. Proinflammatory cytokines play a central role in
      initiation and development of acute GVHD and as such, inhibition of these cytokines has been
      examined for both prevention and treatment of GVHD. Interleukin (IL)-23 is a proinflammatory
      cytokine which the investigators' lab has shown to have a unique and selective role in
      induction of colonic inflammation during acute GVHD and that this cytokine serves as a
      critical mediator linking conditioning regimen-induced mucosal injury and endotoxin
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) translocation to subsequent proinflammatory cytokine production and
      GVHD-associated pathological damage. Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that
      blocking the IL-23 signaling pathway has not abrogated the graft-versus-tumor effect.
      Tildrakizumab is a commercially available anti-IL-23 antibody FDA approved for the treatment
      of moderate to severe psoriasis with good tolerance. The investigators hypothesize that
      blocking IL-23, with tildrakizumab, will reduce GVHD rates for patients undergoing MAC
      alloHCT without having an impact on relapse rates, thus improving GVHD-free relapse-free
      survival (GRFS).
