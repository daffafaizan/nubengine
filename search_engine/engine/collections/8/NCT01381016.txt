    
      -  Design: paired assessments Pre and Post estrogen administration in obese and normal
           weight women

        -  AIM 1: To test the pituitary and hypothalamic responsiveness in obesity, we will examine
           the luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) pulsatility during
           frequent blood sampling.

        -  AIM 2: To test the ovarian responsiveness in obesity, we will examine urinary
           reproductive hormones (E1c, estrone conjugates, and Pdg, pregnanediol glucuronide) over
           an entire menstrual cycle.

        -  AIM 3: To test the hypothesis that central adiposity is associated with reproductive
           hormone alterations in obesity, we will quantitatively assess body composition by dual
           energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
