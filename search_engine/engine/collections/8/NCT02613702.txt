      been lost, such as in inferior incisors with gingival recessions. In these areas, tooth
      brushing may become harder and painful, negatively influencing in plaque control. However,
      this type of graft seems to contract over time. A new approach of free gingival graft, in
      which the graft is covered by a flap, promises to provide greater vascularization. This would
      promote less graft contraction and better mucosal color. Forty patients with less than 2 mm
      of keratinized tissue (measured from gingival margin to mucogingival junction) in at least
      one inferior incisor will be included. Half will receive the original technique and half will
      receive the modified one. Patients will be followed at 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 days, 3, 6 and 12
      months after surgeries.
