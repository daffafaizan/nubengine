      sicca after chronic GVHD. Rosacea exacerbates the aqueous deficiency caused by damage to
      lacrimal and accessory lacrimal glands similar to cholestasis damage in the biliary system.

      Subjects who had inactive chronic GVHD after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and
      severe dry eye symptoms related to ocular rosacea were recruited and treated with 4 monthly
      sessions of IPL and meibomian gland expression. Their charts were reviewed prior to treatment
      to confirm quiescence of active systemic disease. Symptom scores were quantified with Ocular
      Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness questionnaire
      (SPEED2). Baseline complete eye exam was performed, and subjects received an eyes assessment
      score based on the Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) Assessment and Scoring Form.

      Symptoms, exam, and diagnostic data were obtained at baseline (month 0, month 1, month 2,
      month 3, month 4, month 5, month 6, month 9 and month 12). IPL treatment and meibomian gland
      expression was performed at baseline (month 0), month 1, month 2, and month 3.
