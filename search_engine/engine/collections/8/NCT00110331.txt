    
      Background:

      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has altered the natural history of HIV disease
      in children.

      A significant minority of HIV-infected children has evidence of ongoing CNS disease.

      Specific markers for CNS disease, factors predictive of risk for neurological decline, and
      pathophysiologic mechanisms have not yet been identified in HIV-infected children.

      Objective:

      To explore the clinical features (neurological and psychiatric exams, neuropsychological
      evaluation, and neuroimaging), viral and neuroinflammatory factors, anatomic changes (brain
      MRI) and patterns of brain metabolites (1H-MRS) associated with HIV-related CNS disease in
      HIV-infected children in the HAART era.

      Eligibility:

      HIV disease acquired in the first decade of life.

      Evidence of CNS disease (classification of encephalopathy or CNS compromise or diagnosis of
      ADHD, bipolar disease, major depression, or psychosis).

      Design:

      Serial neurologic and psychiatric examinations, neuropsychologic test, neuroimaging, and CSF
      sampling will be performed once a year for a total of 3 evaluations.
