    
      Cases and controls are closely matched on age and sex and evaluated cross-sectionally.

      Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high resolution peripheral quantitative computed
      tomography (HR-pQCT) are used in order to evaluate bone density as well as microarchitecture.
      Bone turnover markers and body composition are also measured.
