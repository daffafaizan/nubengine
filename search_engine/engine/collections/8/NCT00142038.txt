    
      Patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma who did not receive any
      prior chemotherapy for advanced disease can be enrolled in the study.

      Patients are treated with oral capecitabine 1000mg/sqm twice per day on the days 1-14 and
      docetaxel 75 mg/sqm on day 1 as a 1 hour i.v. infusion. chemotherapy is repeated every 21
      days. Staging by imaging is performed every 2 cycles.

      After 40 included patients an amendment was done and the starting of chemotherapy has been
      reduced to further improve tolerability. Starting dose of docetaxel was amended to 60 mg/sqm,
      d1, and starting dose of capecitabine reduced to 800 mg/sqm twice per day, d1-14. The patient
      number to be included was increased to 70 pts.

      Therapy is continued up to tumor progression to a maximum of 10 cycles. Therapy is stopped in
      case of severe side effects, tumor progression or withdrawal of consent.

      This investigator initiated study is supported by Hoffmann-La Roche and by Sanofi-Aventis.
