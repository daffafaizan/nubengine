      level and schedule that the subject was receiving at the conclusion of the Spectrum sponsored
      IGN002-101 study. If additional safety and PK data from another Spectrum sponsored IGN002
      study support a higher dose level that is deemed safe and well tolerated by the Safety Review
      Committee (SRC), the dose of IGN002 may be increased within a given subject. However, dose
      levels of IGN002 in this extension study may not exceed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In
      addition, the dose for a given subject may be lowered per Investigator discretion. Each
      treatment cycle comprises a total of 8 doses of IGN002 administered at weekly intervals.

      Subjects will be evaluated at the study clinic before each dose of IGN002. At each study
      visit, standard of care assessments will be performed, which will include physical
      examination, measurement of vital signs, documentation of adverse events (AEs) and
      concomitant medications, and laboratory analyses of blood and urine. Radiological assessments
      will be performed at the end of each 8-week cycle. Tumor status will be assessed by
      comparison to the subject's baseline tumor status, as determined in the separate study,
      IGN002-101, or tumor nadir, if the subject has demonstrated response.

      Reasons for subject withdrawal include PD in subjects not deriving clinical benefit from
      IGN002 therapy or clinically significant IGN002-related AEs. If a subject discontinues the
      study for any reason, an early termination (ET) visit will be conducted 30 (Â±3) days after
      the last dose of IGN002. This visit will include physical examination, vital sign
      measurements, laboratory analyses of blood and urine, and documentation of AEs and
      concomitant medications.
