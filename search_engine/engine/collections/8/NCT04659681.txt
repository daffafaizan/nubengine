    
      Standard General Anaesthesia with Endotracheal Tube and Intermittent Positive Pressure
      Ventilation (IPPV) was given to all patients,Monitoring included 5 lead ECG, Oxygen
      Saturation (SPO2), End tidal Carbon di oxide (ETCO2), Invasive Blood Pressure (IBP) , Central
      venous Pressure (CVP), Pleth variability Index (PVI) in study group and Bispectral Index
      (BIS) , Core temperature .Postintubation before commencement of surgery baseline Lung
      Ultrasonography will be performed with non-linear probe in 4 zones on Right and Left Lung--
      Zone I Right Midclavicular in second intercostal space , Zone II Right Parasternal in third
      intercostal space, Zone III Anterior axillary line in fourth intercostal space Zone IV
      Posterior axillary line in the V intercostal space. Zone V to VIII in Corresponding spaces on
      the Left side . In the control Group CVP Guided IV fluids were given during surgery CVP will
      be maintained between 10-16 cms H20 , for CVP values < 10 cms H20 colloid bolus 200ml was
      given.In the Study Group PVI guided IV Fluids will be given to maintain PVI <12 for increase
      in PVI value > 12 Colloid bolus 200 ml will be given. After the completion of surgery and
      before extubation Lung Ultrasonography will be performed in all 8 Zones in both lungs to
      identify B Lines and total number of B lines will be calculated , Extra Vascular Lung Water
      (EVLW) Grading will be done as B Lines <5 Mild, between 5-15 moderate , > 15 severe .Total IV
      Fluids along with colloid boluses will be calculated , Postintubation as Baseline and after
      the completion of surgery Arterial blood gas analysis will be done for Alveolar-Arterial
      Oxygenation Pa02 (A-a) and blood Lactate values . After completion of surgery neuromuscular
      blockade will be reversed and trachea extubated .
