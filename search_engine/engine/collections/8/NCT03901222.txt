      Relatively high level athletes will be recruited through social media and advertisements.

      Each subject came twice to the Liege University Hospitals' Human Movement Analysis
      Laboratory.

      After placing the different infrared emitters and placing and calibrating the surface EMG
      electrodes, subjects underwent 3 maximal squat jumps (without upper limb implication). They
      were then familiarized with the fatigue protocol (8 jumps at a 33 jumps per minute pace).

      Then each subject received either bi-anodal tDCS of sham tDCS. Neither the evaluator or the
      subject knew which they were receiving. Immediately following tDCS, subjects underwent
      another warmup 3 maximal squat jumps, and then the fatigue protocol (comprised of 30 maximal
      jumps at a rate of 33 per minute).
