    
      The objective of the trial is to define the feasibility and safety of TIL-ACT in combination
      with low-dose irradiation (LDI) in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

      Study treatment will begin with intravenous (IV) non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy composed by fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Both treatments will be started on
      the same day. Fludarabine will be administered for five days, and cyclophosphamide for two
      days. Low-dose irradiation (LDI) will be then administered once, to up to 20 measurable tumor
      lesions using tomotherapy.

      TIL infusion will be performed intravenously followed by high dose IL-2 administration every
      eight hours, for a maximum of eight doses. Supportive care will be given as needed during the
      whole treatment period.

      Patients achieving a stable disease, partial response or complete response after TIL-ACT
      treatment will then enter a follow-up period for 5 years.
