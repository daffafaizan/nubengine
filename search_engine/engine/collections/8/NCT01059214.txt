      patients enrolled in the INFUSE-AMI study (INFUSE-AMI is a multicenter, open-label controlled
      single-blind randomized study with up to 452 patients enrolled in approximately 50 US and
      European sites). Patients who present with anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction by
      electrocardiogram (STEMI) and an occluded proximal or mid left anterior descending artery
      (LAD) with TIMI 0/1 flow will be eligible for randomization to one of the following arms: 1)
      Local infusion of Abciximab and thrombus aspiration, 2) Local infusion of Abciximab and no
      thrombus aspiration, 3) No local infusion and thrombus aspiration, or 4) No local infusion
      and no thrombus aspiration. Cardiac MRI is performed to assess left ventricular function and
      infarct size for the primary INFUSE-AMI study. Thus, this local research protocol will
      provide the cardiac MRI scans at no cost to the participant. Additional images of the heart
      will be obtained for local research purposes. Cardiac MRI scans will be performed at around 5
      days (optional) and at 30 days after myocardial infarction.
