      autologous PRP intra ovarian infusion on reactivating ovarian functionality and on promoting
      folliculogenesis in regard to patients presenting with POI. PRP is blood plasma prepared from
      fresh whole blood that has been enriched with platelets. It is collected from peripheral
      veins and contains several growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth
      factor (TGF) and other cytokines all of which stimulate tissue proliferation and growth. PRP
      has been employed in several medical conditions in Orthopedics, Dermatology, and
      Ophthalmology for wound healing. It's efficacy in ovarian rejuvenation and reactivation and
      endometrial regeneration has not been fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate the
      effect of autologous PRP intra ovarian infusion on restoring ovarian tissue functionality in
      POI patients.
