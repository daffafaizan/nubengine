      is a critical, preventable and/or treatable disease potentially causing increased
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes (e.g., obesity, diabetes, hypertension, stroke,
      arrhythmia, and chronic heart failure). Improving sleep may have direct effects in reducing
      CVD risk,2 enhancing brain functions, and increasing workplace productivity. Unfortunately,
      our focus groups suggest that most at-risk blacks are unaware of OSA symptoms or its related
      morbidity. Thus, it is imperative to address poor adherence among blacks with OSA, if we are
      to reduce health disparities associated with CVD outcomes between blacks and whites.

      This is a randomized study with a total of 6 sites recruiting; 3 will serve as controls and 3
      that will be intervention. Group A participants (Intervention group) will receive health
      education from a trained Peer Health Educator and Group B participants (Control group) will
      meet with a salon worker, barbershop worker, or church Health Ministry group leader.
      Participants will be asked to use a sleep diary and wear a home sleep test device to measure
      sleep for 7 days. They will be followed for 12 months.
