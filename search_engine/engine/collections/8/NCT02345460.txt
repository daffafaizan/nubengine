      I. To determine feasibility of preoperative FOLFIRINOX for resectable pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine safety and toxicity of preoperative FOLFIRINOX. II. To determine response
      rate. III. To determine proportion achieving major pathologic response - per College of
      American Pathologists (CAP) criteria.

      IV. To determine proportion achieving R0 resection. V. To determine perioperative (30-day)
      mortality. VI. To determine the role of cancer antigen (CA)19.9 as potential prognostic
      and/or predictive biomarker.

      VII. To determine progression-free survival. VIII. To determine overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive FOLFIRINOX regimen comprising irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 120 minutes, and
      fluorouracil IV over 1-2 minutes and then continuously over 46 hours on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
