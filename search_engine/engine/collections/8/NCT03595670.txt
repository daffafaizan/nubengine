      high mortality rates (Colom and Lam, 2005). According to the self-regulation model
      (Leventhal, Nerenz & Steel, 1986), patients had some representations of their illness which
      are cognitive and emotional. Cognitive representations include the set of beliefs built
      around the illness, its consequences and treatment. Emotional representations are negative
      emotions generated by the presence of the illness. According to Leventhal et al. (1997),
      representations are linked to information extracts by patients from society, relatives,
      experiences. This model has been particularly studied in the context of somatic disorders,
      but Baines & Wittkowski (2013) shown that it may also be relevant in patients with mental
      disorders. In bipolar disorders, first results show that illness representations are related
      to relapses (Lobban et al., 2013) and to medication adherence (Averous, Charbonnier,
      Lagouanelle-Simeoni, Prosperi & Dany, 2018). That's why, we think that this relevant to
      improve knowledges of the psychological processes that accompany the experience of bipolar
      disorders. To assess illness representation, we will use both qualitative and quantitative
      tools. These results could have direct application to clinical practice in psychosocial
      interventions.
