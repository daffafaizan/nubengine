      practice.Those patients with high probability of EGFR mutation maybe could get benefit from
      gefitinib as first-line treatment. For this reason, the investigators need more investigation
      to focus on EGFR mutation unknown patients. In the previous study (including FAST-ACT), the
      patients enrolled trial received EGFR-TKI plus chemotherapy nearly simultaneously,so the
      investigators could not know whether those patients gained benefit from EGFR-TKI or
      chemotherapy, maybe chemotherapy alone was enough. If the patients with EGFR mutation status
      unknown could get stable disease(SD) after two cycles of chemotherapy,those patients may be
      optimal for the investigation of intercalating and maintenance administration of gefitinib.
      The reasons are that chemotherapy may be enough for those with objective response after two
      cycles chemotherapy, of course, those with disease progression (PD) should be excluded from
      the study.

      On the basis of these and other studies, the investigators hypothesized that in a selected
      population,first-line chemotherapy(gemcitabine +carboplatin) with intercalating and
      maintenance use of gefitinib would be more efficacious than chemotherapy alone. In this
      study, the investigators compared the efficacy, safety, and adverse-event profile of
      chemotherapy plus gefitinib with those of chemotherapy alone, when these drugs were used as
      first-line treatment in nonsmokers or former light smokers in China, who had lung
      adenocarcinoma with EGFR gene mutation unknown.
