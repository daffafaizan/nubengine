      processing and stress response to psychological and physical challenges (Huether, 1996; Sved
      et al., 2001). Adrenergic transmission also mediates drug withdrawal states and
      stress-induced relapse to drug use (Aston-Jones et al., 2004; Stewart, 2000). Consistent with
      these preclinical findings, adrenergic blockers showed promise as a treatment of cocaine
      dependence (Kampman et al., 2001b; Kampman et al., 2006). These preliminary findings are
      significant because there are no proven pharmacotherapies for cocaine addiction although an
      estimated 2.3 million of Americans aged 12 or older are regular cocaine users (SAMHSA, 2004).
      The societal cost of cocaine addiction is estimated to be $45 billion in the US, suggesting
      that development of even modestly effective cocaine pharmacotherapies will have great
      economic benefits. For example, availability of a medication decreasing cocaine use by 10
      percent is estimated to have $745 million economic benefit in the US alone (Cartwright,
      2000). Thus, developing effective treatments for cocaine addiction is an essential goal with
      significant benefits both for the society and the individual.
