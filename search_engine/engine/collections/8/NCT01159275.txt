      design will provide us optimal information to answer our research question. First and most
      important, we can assess the PK when lopinavir/r is used in a dose reduced form. By
      randomizing the patients to either Abbott's pediatric Aluvia dose reduction or India generic
      LPV/r dose reduction will allow us to assess the differences in AE severity and frequency.
      Using the standard abbott product as a control our study will provide important information
      about the bioavailability of the generic product. Although it's not an original BE design we
      must be able to make preliminary comparisons.
