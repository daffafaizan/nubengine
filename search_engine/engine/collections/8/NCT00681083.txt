      (OSA) patients who need continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Recent evidence
      has shown that using a heated breathing tube to increase the amount of humidification that
      can be delivered has decreased patient side effects, increased subjective sleep quality and
      decreased subjective symptom scores. Anecdotal evidence exists, in the form of clinical
      observation, when ThermoSmart® technology is utilized during CPAP titration, patients
      laboratory titrated pressure may in fact prove to be lower. The possibility exists, on a
      titration night, patients potentially may experience an adverse response to the positive
      airway pressure which manifests as increased airway resistance and inflammation necessitating
      higher CPAP pressures to overcome upper airway resistance and flow limitation. Therefore, we
      hypothesize the delivery of higher levels of humidity might reduce the nasal airway
      resistance during the titration night, reducing the overall positive airway pressure
      requirements. The goal is to investigate this phenomenon to find if a reduction in pressure
      is necessary and if so to what degree. Patients who are titrated on Continuous Positive
      Airway Pressure devices with ThermoSmart® technology will have lower titrated pressures than
      those who are titrated using conventional humidification.
