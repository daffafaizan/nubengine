      I. To refine two interventions - loving kindness and acts of kindness- for use with breast
      cancer survivors using an online platform.

      II. To determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of these interventions on positive
      affect, depressive symptoms, and other aspects of well-being among women with breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I (ACTS OF KINDNESS TO OTHERS): Participants perform small acts of kindness or
      generosity for others 3 times per week for 4 weeks and complete weekly online questionnaires.

      GROUP II (ACTS OF KINDNESS TO SELF): Participants perform small acts of kindness for
      themselves 3 times per week for 4 weeks and complete weekly online questionnaires.

      GROUP III (SELF-KINDNESS MEDITATION): Participants direct kind, loving thoughts to
      themselves, via guided meditation, 3 times per week for 4 weeks and complete weekly online
      questionnaires.

      GROUP IV (CONTROL): Participants keep track of their daily activities, focusing on factual
      information rather than thoughts and feelings, on 3 separate days each week. At the end of
      the week, participants report on their activities and complete several online questionnaires.
