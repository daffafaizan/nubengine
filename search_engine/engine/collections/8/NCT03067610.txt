      oropharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma both by tailoring the elective
      irradiation only to regions with a legitimate risk of recurrence (> 5%) and by lowering the
      elective dose to 40 Gy. Level IB will not be electively treated unless it is involved with
      pathologic or suspicious lymphadenopathy. Level V will not be treated unless two or more
      ipsilateral nodal levels are involved (or level V itself has pathologic or suspicious
      adenopathy). Levels III and IV will only be irradiated if the immediately proximal level
      contains pathologic lymphadenopathy (i.e. level III irradiated if level II is positive; level
      IV irradiated if level III is positive). We anticipate that this approach should dramatically
      improve the acute and late complication profile.
