      stroke patients. Lactate solution or placebo will be administered to acute ischemic stroke
      patients selected for endovascular treatment (EVT) without intravenous thrombolysis. Magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy will be performed before EVT to measure metabolite concentrations in
      the ischemic core, penumbra and in the contralateral hemisphere. The treatment will be
      administered within one hour after EVT. As soon as the patient is stabilized, she/he will
      undergo an additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      (MRS). MRS will also be performed during the control MRI after 24 hours. Neurological
      deficits will be evaluated on admission, at 24 hours using the National Institute of Health
      Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and at 3 months, with both NIHSS and the modified Rankin scale. Primary
      outcome measures will be lactate and metabolite concentrations changes in the ischemic
      lesion, in the penumbra and the contralateral side, evaluated by magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy after intervention compared to baseline MRS values. Secondary outcome measures
      will be evolution of the ischemic penumbra and clinical outcome at 3 months. The trial will
      end when 10 patients per group have completed the study.
