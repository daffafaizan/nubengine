      withdrawn and sent for pathology review. Carboplatin diluted in normal saline will be
      administered via intravitreal injection under anesthesia once to each eligible eye
      approximately every 14 days. Following the injection, triple freeze/thaw cryotherapy is
      applied to the injection site and the eye is washed with water. The eye is gently "shaken" in
      all directions to evenly distribute the drug.

      This trial will use a traditional phase I design for dose de-escalation with two dose levels.
      The first 6 patients will be enrolled at dose level 1 and will be observed for dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) throughout the treatment period up to approximately 5 months after start of
      therapy. If 0-2 (of the first 6) participants experience DLT, a second cohort of 6 patients
      will be enrolled at the same dose level 1. Study accrual would be completed at 12.

      However, if 3 or more of the first 6 patients experience DLT at dose level 1, the dose level
      would be de-escalated to level -1 and 6 patients enrolled at this level (dose -1). If 0-2
      patients experience DLT at dose level -1, a second cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled at
      dose level -1, and the study accrual would be complete. If 3 or more patients experience DLT
      at dose level -1, accrual would also be complete.
