      patients with cutaneous malignancies. These spectroscopy measurements will be compared with
      pathological diagnosis of tissue biopsies from the same site. If successful, the optical
      measurements could be used to survey for and delineate the extent of malignancies in a
      noninvasive manner. This would be especially helpful for clinic visits where suspicious
      lesions are seen and would otherwise require biopsy for diagnosis. Immediate benefits would
      include patients with numerous suspicious skin lesions who would require multiple biopsies.

      Further spectroscopy measurements of the tumor site and adjacent normal tissue during therapy
      (chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy) may provide useful information pertinent to tumor
      physiology and therapeutic effectiveness.
