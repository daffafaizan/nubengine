      malignancies. The objective of the study is to investigate whether high dose vitamin C
      infusion leads to pathological tumor response in resectable colorectal, pancreatic, and lung
      cancer (cohort A) or objective tumor response in KRAS or BRAF mutant solid tumors (cohort B).
      For Cohort C, the primary objective is to determine that maximal tolerated dose of the
      combination of high dose vitamin C with Y90 radioembolization for patients solid tumor
      malignancies and liver metastases amenable to local-regional therapy

      Patients in cohort A receive a high dose vitamin C infusion for 4 days per week for 2-4
      consecutive weeks prior to surgery. Patients in cohort B receive high dose vitamin C infusion
      for 4 days per week for up to 6 months or disease progression. Cohort C will receive high
      dose vitamin C for 1-2 weeks prior to and following Y90 radioembolization of hepatic
      metastases

      A tumor sample will be resected after completion of study drug (high dose vitamin C infusion)
      treatment to examine the effects of study drug (Cohort A only). In addition, organoids will
      be grown in vitro and continue to be treated with vitamin C added in culture medium to
      examine tumor response. The resected tumor in this study will

      Key eligibility:

        -  Men and women age 18 and older

        -  Patients with histologically proven early stage or locally advanced colorectal
           adenocarcinoma, lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, who are eligible for resection, and
           have not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy (cohort A) Patients with inoperable,
           metastatic, KRAS or BRAF mutant colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung cancer and pancreatic
           cancer, who have received at least 1 line of treatment for metastatic disease (cohort B)

        -  Patients with metastatic cancer with an extended RAS (e.g. KRAS or NRAS) or BRAF
           mutation with liver metastases amenable to Y90 radioembolization (cohort C).
