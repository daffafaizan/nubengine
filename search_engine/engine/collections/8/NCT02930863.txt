      pulse oximetry software and data to analyze the ability to evaluate the difference in patient
      oxygenation levels and supplemental oxygen use with automated verbal prompted monitoring
      versus a standard care control group. As well as determine if automated verbal prompted
      monitoring leads to less monitor alarms and subsequent improvement of subjective alarm
      fatigue and patient satisfaction with their care versus standard care.

      The pulse oximeter will have a finger probe that will be attached to the patient's middle
      finger to read the patient's SpO2 levels. Each time the participant's pulse oximetry value
      declines to 93% or less, an automated verbal prompt, created via the software, will generate
      as a soft prompt. This will be followed up by a hard prompt if no improvement is seen in
      their oxygenation level after a period of time. A positive feedback elicitation will be given
      if the participant's saturation levels increase above 93%. This automated verbal prompt
      guidance will take place during the entirety of the investigational group's PACU stay.
