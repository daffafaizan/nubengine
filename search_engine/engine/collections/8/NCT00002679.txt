    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the efficacy of dose intensive, sequential adjuvant chemotherapy with
      doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide in patients with stage II/III resected breast
      cancer. II. Evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive sequential chemotherapy regimens consisting of 3 courses each
      of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide on a schedule of one course every 14 days.
      Following completion of chemotherapy, patients who underwent breast conservation surgery
      receive radiotherapy. Mastectomy patients with 10 or more positive nodes or with T3-4 tumors
      are also eligible for delayed radiotherapy. Patients who are hormone receptor positive (or
      whose receptor status is unknown) are treated with oral tamoxifen for 5 years, beginning
      after completion of all other therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, then yearly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At total of 90 patients will be entered.
