      patients with suspected FH or a clinical diagnosis of FH have been randomized to genetic
      testing or standard of care with lipid testing alone. After systematic encouragement of
      family enrollment, as a primary endpoint, the compared the number of probands with relatives
      enrolled in each group one year after results were returned to probands. The secondary
      endpoints examined include the number of relatives enrolled within 52 weeks of the genetic
      counseling call and the number of relatives diagnosed with FH through the study. Exploratory
      subgroup analyses were conducted stratifying the cohort by randomization/genetic test result.
      Further exploratory analyses compared probands' perceptions about high cholesterol diagnosis
      at baseline and at 20 weeks from enrollment
