      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 due for the exposure to COVID-19 patients. The
      pharmacological treatment with chloroquine phosphate has emerged as one of the main
      therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 patients. However, some studies have described and
      hypothesized that the use of prophylactic chloroquine phosphate could provide some protection
      against COVID-19 infection reducing the chances of contagion in Health Care personnel during
      the development of the pandemic. A controlled clinical trial will be conducted in a tertiary
      hospital in Mexico City, Mexico. Participants will be divide in two groups; 1) intervention:
      who will receive chloroquine phosphate (300 mg/day during the first 30 days and 150mg/day
      during the last 30 days) and 2) control, both with a follow up for 60 days.
