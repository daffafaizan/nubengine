    
      Kidney transplanted patients with post-transplant follow-up visits at the national transplant
      center in Norway will be included before they are SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated. As a control group
      the investigators will include blood samples from healthy volunteers (hospital employees)
      that receive vaccine as first line health care workers.

      Baseline blood samples will be obtained before vaccination. The vaccination will be performed
      according to the national procedures and not necessarily by the hospital. Following
      vaccination, all patients and controls will have blood drawn 7-10 days as well as 4-6 weeks
      after the second dose. Depending on the results of the immunity testing the patients and
      controls may be invited to additional blood sampling up or at specific time points to two
      years following vaccination.

      At each blood sampling and at the time of both vaccinations the systemic exposure of
      tacrolimus will be assessed in kidney transplanted patients.

      All samples will be analyzed with validated assays for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG)
      (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) spike protein) using ELISA, flow cytometry bead arrays
      and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays or comparable techniques. Cells will be analyzed by flow
      and mass cytometry for activation and phenotype markers, and with functional assays for
      responsiveness (e.g. proliferation and cytokine production). Samples will be HLA-typed if
      HLA-genotype if not already established.
