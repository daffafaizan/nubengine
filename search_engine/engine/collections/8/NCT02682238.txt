    
      This is a Multicenter, Randomized, Double Blind, Vehicle-Controlled Study to Evaluate the
      Safety and Local Tolerability of Topically Applied BBI-4000 (Sofpironium Bromide) 15% Gel in
      Subjects with Palmar Hyperhidrosis.

      Participating subjects will apply either BBI-4000 15% or vehicle gel topically to the palms
      of both hands once daily for 4 consecutive weeks. The 4 week treatment period will be
      followed by a 2 week follow-up period.

      Safety and tolerability will be assessed through collection of vital signs, adverse events,
      assessment of local skin responses, ECG, UPT and blood sampling.

      Efficacy will be assessed through gravimetric sweat assessments as well as through the
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS).
