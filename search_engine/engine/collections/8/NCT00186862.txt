    
      Secondary objectives for this protocol included the following:

        -  To determine whether major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted or unrestricted
           antitumor immune responses are induced by injection of modified allogeneic neuroblasts
           and the cell doses required to produce these effects.

        -  To obtain preliminary data on the antitumor effects of this treatment regimen.
