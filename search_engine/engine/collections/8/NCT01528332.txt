      worn on the skin of the painful area, to see if it is effective in relieving chronic
      musculoskeletal back pain. It will also test the safety of the patch. The LEDs in the PRP
      emit a certain kind of light (peak wavelength 453 nm) that stimulates the production of
      nitric oxide (NO) in the skin. NO has been shown to induce a number of actions that should
      contribute to pain relief, including relaxation of smooth muscle cells, dilation of blood
      vessels, increased concentrations of oxygen in the cells and washout of metabolic byproducts
      and toxins caused by cell injury or death. Participants in one treatment group will be
      treated 5 times over 2 weeks for 30 minutes with PRP patches in the clinic. Participants in
      the control arm will be treated for the same length of time with a similar device that
      contains LEDs that emit another wavelength of light that does not induce production of NO. To
      prevent the influence of expectations on the results, neither the participants nor the
      medical staff directly responsible for their treatment will be told with which of the test
      patches the participants are treated. Other clinic staff will be responsible for all
      activities that could identify treatment arm, including putting the devices on and removing
      them, and examining the condition of the participants' skin before and after treatment. To
      get an accurate measure of how effective the devices are, participants will score their pain
      several times before the treatment period begins, as well as before and after each treatment.
      They will also complete several pain questionnaires during the study.
