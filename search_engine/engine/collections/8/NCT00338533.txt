      the child's intraocular pressure, measuring dimensions of the eye, examining the front of the
      eye under the operating microscope, examining the portion of the eye where the fluid drains,
      evaluating the back of the eye with an ultrasound, and possible documentation with
      photographs.

      When the diagnosis is confirmed by this examination, the eye or eyes will be carefully
      evaluated for their clarity. If a standard goniotomy procedure can not be done, then the
      endoscopic goniotomy will be performed. The procedure is identical with: cleaning the eyelid
      skin, using a speculum to open the eyelids, making a small cut into the cornea, and placing a
      viscoelastic substance into the eye to maintain its shape. The procedure then differs since
      the inserted needle is attached to the viewing endoscope. I will then view the inside of the
      eye on a TV monitor in addition to looking through the operating microscope. This will allow
      me to directly see the structures which I will need to cut. Normally, I depend upon looking
      through a lens placed on the cornea which must be fairly clear so that I can see to cut the
      structures in the standard procedure. The procedure should not take much longer than the
      standard goniotomy and the same amount of tissue will be cut as in a standard goniotomy. The
      needle is then removed. The remainder of the procedure is identical which includes placing a
      stitch in the corneal incision, adjusting the amount of fluid in the eye so the pressure is
      not too low or high, giving a dilating drop, giving a steroid and antibiotic injection around
      the eye, giving steroid ointment and an eye patch.
