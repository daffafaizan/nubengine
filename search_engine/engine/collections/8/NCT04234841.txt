      aortic valve replacement (AVR) and the subsequent risk of subclinical valve thrombosis in
      bioprosthetic AVR. The risk is significantly greater with transcatheter aortic valve
      implantation (TAVI) than surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and can lead to stroke and
      other neurological events including death, and early valve failure secondary to restricted
      leaflet mobility.

      Whilst oral anticoagulation (OAC) can reduce thrombosis, OAC has been shown to significantly
      and unacceptably increase the risk of bleeding when applied to all-comers undergoing TAVI. It
      would therefore be desirable to identify which patients are at increased thrombosis risk so
      these can be targeted with antithrombotic medications, whilst avoiding unnecessary bleeding
      risk in low risk patients.

      In this study, we will aim to identify those patients at greatest risk of thrombosis using
      novel biomarkers (assessing thrombosis and thrombolysis), and note whether these tests are
      able to predict adverse events.

      The tests for thrombosis and thrombolysis will involve a blood draw, which will be taken at
      various time points in the study to signal the time point of greatest thrombogenicity, which
      may be dependent on anti-platelet and anticoagulant therapy that the patient is prescribed.

      Adverse events include MACCE (myocardial infarction, stroke, TIA (transient ischaemic attack)
      and death), systemic embolism, clinical and subclinical valve thrombosis, valve restriction
      and bleeding.

      4D CT, echocardiography and clinical reviews will be performed at regular time points in the
      study to identify adverse events. The follow-up for each patent will be 5 years.
