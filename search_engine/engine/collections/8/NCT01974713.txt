      (CKD)patients under the care of a nephrologist at 3 Southern Ontario Nephrology centres and
      all affiliated satellite centres with an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) less
      than 60 ml/min to determine the rate of their renal disease progression over a 36 months. All
      CKD patients older than 18 years of age may be included in this study. This study will
      analyze, with 6 month serial measurements, conventional biochemical, hormonal and metabolic
      parameters in addition to the demographics, clinical status, medications and blood and urine
      samples of these patients. This study will assess the influence of inflammation on FGF23 and
      genetic polymorphisms that may reflect the processes involved with disease progression.
