      evaluates the effectiveness of occupational therapy (OT) interventions in equine assisted
      activities, and none have included interactive vaulting. Research that has been conducted has
      supported the use of equines in OT treatment sessions (hippotherapy) in increasing length of
      time engaged in activities, compared to conventional therapy as well as improvements in
      postural sway, adaptive behaviors, and participation. In addition, it has been found that
      children with visual impairments who participated in a 6-week EAT program demonstrated
      clinically significant changes in occupational performance and qualitative themes of peer
      interaction, taking on challenges and overall satisfaction with the program.

      The gaps in research warrant investigation into the efficacy of this intervention in the
      development of executive functioning and social skills in children with disabilities. Further
      research needs to be conducted to determine the effectiveness of occupational therapy in this
      context. Occupational therapy interventions will be integrated into the existing program.
      Group interventions will target the emotional awareness and regulation, social skills, and
      use cognitive strategies to improve social interactions with peers and adults.
