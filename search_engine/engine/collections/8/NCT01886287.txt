      neuroendocrine tumors with suboptimally controlled carcinoid syndrome. While the majority of
      patients will have primary tumors of the ileocecum (midgut), any serotonin-producing
      neuroendocrine tumors will be eligible (including pancreatic, lung and unknown primary).

      All patients will be followed for adverse events and serious adverse events for 28 days
      following the last dose of above-label octreotide, or until resolution or stabilization of
      the event, whichever comes first.
