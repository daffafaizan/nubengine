        -  This is a phase II randomized study of convalescent plasma for the treatment of
           non-immune individuals with COVID-19 infection at high risk of complications.

        -  Subjects will be considered as having completed the study after 2 months (+/- 5) days,
           unless consent withdrawal or death occurs first.

        -  Subjects will be randomized to receiving convalescent plasma or best supportive care.

        -  Patients randomized to best supportive care may receive plasma should they require
           hospitalization for progression of COVID-19 disease.

        -  The final analysis will be conducted once the last subject completes the 2-month visit
           or withdraws from the study.

      A total of 306 subjects will be recruited, 153 for each arm. If a patient in the best
      supportive care arm requires hospitalization, the patient will be eligible to receive
      convalescent plasma if requested and/or deemed medically appropriate by the admitting
      physician.

      Overall study duration

        -  The study begins when the first subject (donor or recipient) signs the informed consent.
           The study will end once the last enrolled subject completes the study (likely a
           recipient).

        -  The expected duration of the study is approximately 12 months.
