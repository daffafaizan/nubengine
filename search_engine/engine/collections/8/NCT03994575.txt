        1. To identify and describe post-ACS patients who do not achieve guideline-recommended
           LDL-C "target" (<1.8 mmol/L in Canada, >50% LDL-C lowering on high-intensity statin in
           the U.S.);

        2. To identify opportunities where PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may be of potential benefit in
           the management of post-ACS patients to achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goal by 1
           year follow-up; and,

        3. To determine reasons why physicians are not prescribing guideline-recommended LDL-C
           lowering therapies and/or patients are not achieving guideline-recommended LDL-C goals.
