      equal chance to participate in the sex education class or in the nutrition education class.
      Each participating school will have two (2) groups:

        -  The intervention group which will receive the HART sex education curriculum.

        -  The comparison group which will receive a nutrition education curriculum. There will be
           one PTSD awareness session for both groups.. This session will be provided by mental
           health professionals from the Haitian Mental Health Network. Each group will consist of
           about 13-15 student participants, with the groups meeting each week on specific week
           days. In addition to the ten-week curriculum, there will be sessions at the beginning
           and end of the cycle to administer the pre- and post-test questionnaires. The 12-week
           cycle will be repeated 2-3 times through the school year.
