      total cholesterol levels <240 mg/dL was needed. Furthermore, in general, a role for early
      statin therapy in patients with ST-elevated AMI reperfused by primary PCI has not been
      clearly established. Statins have been shown to prevent coronary artery disease and to
      preserve left ventricular function in dilated cardiomyopathy. The investigators hypothesized
      that the early use of statins would reduce cardiovascular events including heart failure in
      acute myocardial infarction patients. A prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter
      trial is conducted in AMI patients with normal total cholesterol levels (180-240 mg/dL).
      Patients are randomly assigned to receive any available statin within 96 hours of AMI onset
      or no statin and were followed for up to 24 months. The primary endpoint is a composite of
      cardiovascular death, nonfatal AMI, recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischemia, congestive
      heart failure, and stroke.
