      A- The global efficacy of each treatment defined by a minimum reduction of 25% in average
      pain over the last 24 hours between 0 and 6 months.

      B- The evolution of average pain over the last 24 hours between 0 and each different time
      frame (3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months).

      C- The evolution of maximum pain scores using nocturnal post-effort (Jamar grip test) visual
      analog scales (VAS) between day 0, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.

      D- The perception of change on the Patient's Global Impression of Change score (PGIC) at 3
      and 6 months E- The evolution of PRTEE scores at 0, 3 and 6 months F- Adverse events at 3
      weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. G - Quality of life and utility via the SF-12 at 3 and
      6 months. H- The consumption of analgesics.
