      (R/R) Grade 1, 2, or 3A follicular lymphoma (FL). FL is the most common subtype of indolent
      lymphoma. The prognosis of FL depends on the histologic grade, stage, treatment and age of
      the patient. More recently, efforts have been made to find novel regimens for the treatment
      of relapsed FL that do not contain non-specific cytotoxic agents.

      One of the important goals of this phase II study is to discover novel genetic, biochemical,
      and immunological markers that are associated with the response and safety of TGR-1202 in
      patients with FL. TGR-1202 blocks PI3K, a signal that is required for cancer to grow.
