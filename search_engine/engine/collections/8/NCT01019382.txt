      are suitable for the current standard of care which is gemcitabine chemotherapy. They will be
      assessed for suitability and then offered entry into the trial. This essentially consists of
      a 4 hour long infusion of purified omega-3 fish oil immediately after their gemcitabine
      chemotherapy has finished. This will occur once a week for three weeks, with a rest on the
      fourth week. The cycle then continues until the cancer has shown progression on a CT scan,
      the gemcitabine chemotherapy is stopped due to toxicity or the patient withdraws or dies. CT
      scans to assess this are performed every 2 months. Blood tests will be taken before and after
      each treatment and analysed for changes in inflammatory markers. The patients will be asked
      to fill in a quality of life and pain questionnaire each week during the 4 hour infusion.
