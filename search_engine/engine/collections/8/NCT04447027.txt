        -  Mature T-cell malignancies (TCM) are rare and heterogeneous group of leukemias and
           lymphomas accounting for 5 to 10% of all lymphomas in the US

        -  Patients with systemic TCM are most commonly treated with a CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
           doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone)-like regimens, that produce long-term
           progression-free survival in about 30% of these cases

        -  Patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) TCM have very poor prognosis with median overall
           survival of less than 1 year. Treatment options for R/R TCM are very few and of limited
           efficacy, thus novel treatment strategies are urgently needed.

        -  Mutations in epigenetic regulators are common in aggressive TCMs and standard treatment
           with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as romidepsin show modest clinical
           activity with single agent the overall response (ORR) around 25%

        -  Combination of romidepsin and 5-azacitidine (hypomethylating agents) was synergistic in
           preclinical models, and has demonstrated high clinical activity with an ORR of 79%

        -  Many TCMs rely on The Ikaros-dependent NF-kB/IRF4 signaling pathway to maintain
           proliferation, which is why lenalidomide, which induces degradation of Ikaros and
           downregulates IRF4, has single agent activity in R/R TCM with ORR of 26% to 42%,
           depending on the subtype.

        -  Lenalidomide synergizes with romidepsin and enhances tumor cell death in TCM cell lines,
           predicting that the addition of lenalidomide to the established romidepsin/ CC-486 (5-
           azacitidine) combination will further improve efficacy.

      Objectives:

      To determine the safety and toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      four-drug combination of CC-486 (5-azacitidine), romidepsin, lenalidomide and dexamethasone
      in patients with TCM

      Eligibility:

        -  Refractory/relapsed TCM defined as follows:

             -  Patients with systemic disease

             -  Have received at least one line of prior therapy

             -  Must have received brentuximab vedotin if the disease is anaplastic large cell
                lymphoma or CD30-positive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        -  ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2 (or less than or equal to 3 if
           decrease is due to the disease)

        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed relapsed and/or refractory mature TCM

        -  Adequate organ and marrow function

      Design:

        -  Open-label, single-center, uncontrolled Phase 1 study

        -  '3 + 3' design will be used to determine the MTD of dose-escalated lenalidomide with
           fixed dose of romidepsin and CC-486 (5-azacitidine)

        -  An expansion cohort of 9 patients will be evaluated at the MTD

        -  Maximum 6 cycles (21-day cycle) of combination therapy

        -  To explore all dose levels, including further evaluation in a dose expansion cohort, the
           accrual ceiling will be set at 30 patients
