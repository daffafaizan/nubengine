    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on transporter of the outer
      mitochondrial membrane subunit 20 (TOMM20) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in
      carcinoma cells and the impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on monocarboxylate
      transporter 4 (MCT4) expression in fibroblasts.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet treatment in head and neck
      carcinoma (HNC) patients.

      II. Assess the effect of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on the serum levels of insulin,
      and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 and -2.

      III. Assess the potential impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on the following:
      disease-free survival, distant metastases-free survival, overall survival.

      IV. To evaluate the utility of cancer-derived exosomes to serve as prognostic biomarkers for
      real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy and identifying early recurrence using
      longitudinal samples from cancer patients undergoing treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients follow a normocaloric, low-carbohydrate diet for 10-28 days (from the time of cancer
      diagnosis to definitive surgical treatment).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month, 3 months, and then every 3
      months for 24 months.
