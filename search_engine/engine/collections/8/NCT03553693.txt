      science principles and that targets key barriers to optimal HIV viral load (VL) processing
      will improve viral load ordering, speed up viral load turnaround, and improve the quality of
      viral load counseling of results to patients within a Ugandan network of HIV care clinics.
      Specific objectives are as follows: Objective 1: Determine the comparative effectiveness of
      the RAPID-VL intervention on VL ordering and VL turnaround time: We will randomize 20 HIV
      clinics to the RAPID-VL multi-component intervention vs. standard of care VL procedures (n=10
      clinics each, 60 patients/health facility). Objective 2: Identify facilitators and barriers
      to implementation, and perceived utility of the RAPID-VL intervention from both the patient
      and clinician perspectives. Objective 3: Determine the costs, cost-effectiveness, and
      incremental change costs of the RAPID-VL intervention.
