      agent 18F-thymidine (FLT) can rapidly assess treatment response in patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, we hypothesize that FLT-PET imaging will offer the
      potential of rapidly triaging therapy efficacy within hours to days following the start of
      therapy start by non-invasively monitoring metabolic changes in the tumor, rather than the
      conventional approach of waiting months for tumors to grow or shrink on computed tomography
      (CT).

      We propose two approaches to evaluate the potential of FLT-PET for assessment of response to
      therapy in NSCLC. In the first, we will exploit a specific effect (the FLT "flare") induced
      by pemetrexed, which is first-line chemotherapy for non-squamous NSCLC, to evaluate the
      utility of FLT-PET to assess successful response to pemetrexed (PEM) therapy within 24 hours.
      In the second approach, we will utilize FLT as a marker of cell proliferation, as has been
      done in other cancers, to determine whether chemotherapy has produced a decrease in tumor
      growth at 2 weeks after starting therapy. Since approximately 70% of patients will fail
      PEM-based therapy, an imaging technique that could reliably detect PEM efficacy in hours to
      days rather than months would save valuable time and allow for switch to a more effective
      therapy.
