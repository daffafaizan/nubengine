      clinics of IHA, a private multispecialty group practice, and Michigan Medicine, a large
      academic health system. The study will test whether pre-encounter clinician commitments
      combined with patient and provider supports decrease overtreatment of type 2 diabetes among
      patients 65 and older, use of benzodiazepines and sedative-hypnotics among patients age 65
      and older who have insomnia or anxiety, and use of PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer
      among men 75 and older. These 3 recommendations were chosen because they are commonly
      performed in primary care practice, have Choosing WiselyÂ® recommendations against these
      low-value services, and represent situations in which clinician decisions about ordering of
      services can be unduly swayed by interactions with patients.
