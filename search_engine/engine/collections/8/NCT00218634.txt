      suicidal ideation) that occur in the context of substance abuse or dependence can interfere
      with self-care behaviors necessary for maintaining HIV care, as well as interfere with
      potential benefit from an intervention that focuses on adherence alone. We hypothesize that
      teaching skills to cope with depression will improve the outcome from an adherence
      intervention to promote healthier living with HIV, in HIV+ opioid dependent individuals in
      methadone maintenance treatment.

      Overview of Research Plan. Patients who are HIV positive and who are receiving methadone
      maintenance for opioid dependence will be randomized to treatment with either: (1) CBT, a
      combination of CBT for depression and HIV medication adherence, including a single session
      intervention for HIV medication adherence (Life-Steps, Safren et al., 2001) in conjunction
      with physician feedback regarding baseline study assessments or (2) the single session
      intervention for HIV medication adherence (Life-Steps, Safren et al., 2001) in conjunction
      with physician feedback regarding baseline study assessments. Participants will be followed
      for one-year post-randomization.
