      findings. However, these agents have been implicated in varying degrees of nephrotoxicity and
      therefore are not usually used in patients with renal dysfunction. Gadoterate is a Gadolinium
      agent and previous studies have indicated that it is safe in patients with decreased kidney
      function. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using
      Gadoterate in this patient population.

      Participants who have been scheduled for an MRI will choose to either receive Gadoterate
      contrast as part of their MRI or not receive Gadoterate as part of their MRI.
