      diagnosis of depression than those with scores with 12 or less, so this is an appropriate
      cut-off. The primary endpoint is at 12 weeks post-randomization and the secondary endpoint is
      at 24 weeks post-randomization. Randomization will be performed as block randomization
      (varying block sizes) with a 1:1 allocation and will be stratified based on EPDS score (13-19
      vs. 20 or greater). Participants who score 12 or less on the EPDS in their initial
      self-referral screen will be informed that they are not at high risk for having depressive or
      anxiety disorder and the current time, and can re-screen as needed. Participants whose score
      is in the 9-12 range (i.e. those who are not likely to be experiencing a depressive or
      anxiety disorder requiring mental health treatment, but might benefit from additional
      support) will receive an automated message that communicates their score and the
      acknowledgment of their possible need for support, and provides a list of resources in
      Ontario that may be helpful for them. These participants will be invited to re-screen at any
      time into the study, and will be asked permission to be re-contacted in future to determine
      which supports they used, if any.
