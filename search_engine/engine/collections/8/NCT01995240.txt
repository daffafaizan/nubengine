      Novel predictive markers are needed to determine treatment efficacy in pancreatic cancer at
      an early stage. Preferably, these markers could be determined non-invasively and provide
      insight into the biology of pancreatic cancer. Several MR techniques can serve for this
      purpose. However, optimalisation of these techniques is needed and their reproducibility
      should be assessed.

      Objective of the study:

      To optimize DCE-MRI, T2* MRI and DWI in pancreatic cancer at 3T and investigate its
      reproducibility.

      Study design:

      In the first part of the study, patients with pancreatic cancer will undergo an MR
      measurement protocol once at 3T, to optimize MR techniques (DCE-MRI, T2* MRI and DWI). In the
      second part of the study, to assess reproducibility patients will undergo the MR measurement
      protocol twice within one week before start of any treatment.
