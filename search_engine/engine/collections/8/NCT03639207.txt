      end stage liver disease - successful treatment markedly reduces those risks.
      Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is a highly effective, but expensive, treatment for chronic hepatitis
      C. Previously, we demonstrated that genetic variation in IFNL4 predicts response to this
      regimen. We now propose to examine the association between genotype for the functional
      IFNL4-DeltaG/TT polymorphism and treatment response among patients enrolled in a large
      managed care organization. In a two-stage design, limited demographic and clinical data for
      patients who have been treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir will be ascertained from an
      electronic database. In the second stage, additional demographic and clinical data will be
      extracted from medical records and consented patients will provide a specimen for IFNL4
      genotyping. These data will be combined to examine associations of IFNL4-DeltaG/TT genotype
      and other variables with response to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. We will also develop a clinical
      prediction model for response to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment. These results could inform
      more efficient treatment of HCV in the United States and globally.
