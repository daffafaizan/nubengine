    
      Our purpose of planning this study is to examine the acute effect of passive joint
      mobilization application on pain perception and range of motion in women with non-specific
      neck pain.

      The hypotheses we will test for this purpose;

      H1- Passive joint mobilization application increases the range of motion of the cervical
      joint in women with non-specific neck pain.

      H2- Passive joint mobilization application increases the pressure pain threshold in women
      with non-specific neck pain.

      H3- Passive joint mobilization increases serum Orexin A and Neurotensin levels in women with
      non-specific neck pain.
