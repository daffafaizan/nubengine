      root canals with six files: three shaping files and three finishing files. A unique design
      element is varying tapers along the instruments' long axes. The three shaping files have
      tapers that increase coronally, and the reverse pattern is seen in the five finishing files.
      Wave-One is reciprocation-based systems that instrumented root canals with only single file.
      Some studies demonstrated that it has outperformed conventional continuous rotary
      nickel-titanium (NiTi) preparation in some aspects. The reciprocating motion of Wave-One
      relieves the stress on the file by special counterclockwise (cutting action) and clockwise
      (release of the instrument) movements and, therefore, extends the durability of a NiTi
      instrument and increases its fatigue resistance in comparison with continuous rotation
      motion.
