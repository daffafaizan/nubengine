      (TIA) or ischemic stroke should receive hypertension treatment, including antihypertensive
      medication and lifestyle modification, with a goal of reducing blood pressure (BP) to <120 mm
      Hg systolic BP and <80 mm Hg diastolic BP. Statin treatment and lifestyle modification is
      also recommended for post-stroke and post-TIA patients with elevated cholesterol levels or a
      history of stroke or TIA with an atherosclerotic cause. Despite the clear benefits of
      secondary stroke prevention, there is a gap between evidence and implementation in clinical
      practice. We will determine whether a telephone-delivered behaviorally tailored intervention
      (TI) can lead to sustained change resulting in (a) BP and lipid control and (b) improved
      adherence to diet, medication, and exercise recommendations in veterans with a history of
      stroke or TIA compared to an attention placebo (AP) in veterans who have completed 6 months
      of a clinical trial. In this CDA project, we evaluate the long-term effectiveness of booster
      sessions in a randomized manner. One arm will receive 6 months of a tailored intervention
      (TI) followed by two booster TI sessions at 8 and 10 months, and one arm will receive 6
      months of an attention placebo (AP) followed by two booster AP sessions at 8 and 10 months.
      BP (3 measures taken at least 5 min apart) and dietary sodium are the primary outcomes, while
      secondary outcomes will be total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ratio, adherence to
      antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, and exercise adherence.
