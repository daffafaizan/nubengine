      medical records were retrospectively reviewed for all histologically confirmed aNSCLC
      patients undergoing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC)
      between August 2016 and June 2018.

      All response and outcome evaluation were determined as per RECIST 1.1 by two senior
      radiologists blinded to patients'information. Discrepancy was solved by consensus.

      X-tile software was used to determine cut-off values that maximumly differentiate overall
      survival (OS). Log-rank tests and Cox regression models were performed for survival analysis.
      The predictive value of TGR for clinical outcomes in ICI-treated aNSCLC patients was
      validated in two external cohorts, recruited form Guangdong Province Traditional Chinese
      Medical Hospital and Shanghai Chest Hospital.
