      II-III with CR/PR according to RECIST criteria and EBV DNA decreased to 0 copies/mL after 3
      cycles of GP induction chemotherapy will be randomized into experimental group to receive
      IMRT of reduced dose (prescribed dose, 63.6 Gy, 2.12 Gy per fractions, 30 fractions) and
      control group to receive IMRT of conventional dose (prescribed dose, 69.96 Gy, 2.13 Gy per
      time, 33 fractions). Two cycles of cisplatin chemotherapy will be performed during IMRT. The
      efficacy, toxicity, and quality of life of patients between the two groups will be compared.
