      rate, response duration, and time to progression in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small
      cell lung cancer. II. Determine the side effects and toxicity profile of docetaxel when given
      in combination with carboplatin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is open label study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes once a week for 4 weeks. Patients receive at least 2 courses
      (8 weeks) of treatment. Courses are further repeated in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      and disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 20-38 patients accrued into this study.
