      brain metabolism causing transient neurological symptoms.

      At the current time, there is no universally agreed-upon objective biomarker or risk
      calculator of concussion upon which physicians can prognosticate future risk, identify
      optimal treatments, and for sports medicine physicians, decide if and when a particular
      player were safe to be returned to play.

      While the majority of patients experience a full recovery within a few weeks of a concussion,
      several going on to have chronic, debilitating symptoms, and all patients experience a
      permanently increased risk of experiencing more debilitating and long-lasting symptoms with
      each subsequent concussion. For certain people with certain genetic (e.g., ApoE status) and
      psychosocial (e.g., alcohol abuse, depression) risk factors, even a single concussion can put
      them at greater risk for earlier and more severe forms of dementia decades hence.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively collect a comprehensive, multi-modality set of
      diagnostics on patients who have had a concussion, repeating some of these tests serially
      over time, so that the investigators may then in the future perform retrospective data mining
      to determine if there were a biomarker or risk calculator that could be used to guide
      return-to-play and other medical decisions.

      This study plans to collect biological specimens (blood, saliva, urine, hair follicles),
      electrophysiological (EEG, EKG), imaging (HCT, MRI, PET, SPECT), ambulatory (actigraphy),
      sensory thresholds (Von Frey), ophthalmologic (fundoscopic photographs, OCT, SSVEPs),
      vestibular (ENG, BESS, BioSway) along with demographic, medical history, medication,
      psychosocial data and the results on validated instruments of cognition, mood, sleep, head
      discomfort and quality of life.

      Because it is important to determine the variability not only within the concussion group but
      also between groups, the investigators will also recruit a control cohort, specifically
      athletes who are already undergoing baseline cognitive testing pre-season. The clinical focus
      of this study will be on concussed athletes, both children and adults, and the investigators
      will also include non-sports patients who have mild traumatic brain injury due to other
      situations including slip and fall, occupational, motor vehicle accidents, assault, and blast
      exposure.
