      agents are in dire need.TRC105 has been shown to enhance the anti-angiogenic effect of
      bevacizumab and may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical
      efficacy when combined with bevacizumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin. Participants will be
      treated with the combination drugs for 6 cycles of therapy (3 weeks per cycle) and may or may
      not be placed on maintenance therapy depending upon the induction response. Maintenance
      therapy will continue until there is disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient
      withdrawal. Blood collections and tumor assessments will be performed throughout the study.
