      bath versus a lower bicarbonate dialysis bath, and will compare intradialytic acid-base
      changes and overall control of metabolic acidosis with the 2 treatment regimens. These
      parameters will be assessed in patients currently receiving high-bicarbonate hemodialysis as
      part of usual care. They will then be switched to a lower bicarbonate prescription, after
      which these parameters will be reassessed. The study will also examine changes in
      inflammatory markers, glycemic control, ketogenesis, and lipolysis.
