    
      The primary purpose of this study is to establish a validated drug cocktail, containing up to
      7 probes, for assessing the activity of six drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP 1A2, 2C8, 2C9,
      2C19, 2D6, 3A4/5) and the OATP1B1 transporter. In Part 1, the study will determine if there
      are pharmacokinetic interactions among the probe drugs by comparing the pharmacokinetics of
      the probe drugs when administered alone and in combination (i.e., as a cocktail). In Part 2,
      the study will evaluate the quantitative performance of the cocktail by examining the effect
      of select inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of respective probe drugs when the probe drugs
      are administered alone versus when administered in the cocktail.

      This study aims to establish a standard probe cocktail that can be used for drug-drug
      interaction studies, with the intention that any subset of the 7-drug cocktail could be
      selected for study with a drug in development.

      In addition, this study will provide a proof-of-principle evaluation of dried blood spot
      technology as a method to measure drug concentrations in blood samples collected from
      clinical studies.
