      bariatric surgery or pharmacologic treatment for obesity and harvest fibroblasts from skin
      biopsies, which will be reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). These iPSC's
      will then be differentiated into neural progenitor cells, neurons, astrocytes, and microglia
      to identify genetic and epigenetic pathways altered in disease-specific neural progenitor
      cells of the brain.
