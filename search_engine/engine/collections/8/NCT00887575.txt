      paclitaxel and carboplatin as neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced breast cancer. The
      Phase I portion of this study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel,
      sunitinib and carboplatin that can be used together as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with
      locally advanced breast cancer. The MTD identified in the Phase I portion of the study will
      be used in the Phase II portion which will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      neoadjuvant sunitinib/paclitaxel/carboplatin given for 6 cycles in patients with locally
      advanced breast cancer.
