      condition (B). The order of the conditions was randomly assigned to either the treatment or
      sham for the first round and vise versa in the second round in a balanced cross-over design
      (A-B-B-A) so there were four sets of measurements per patient.

      For the treatment condition (A), the study consists of three consecutive periods 1) baseline
      period: 10 minutes rest in horizontal supine lying 2) intervention period: 10 minutes rest in
      head-down 30 degree supine lying 3) recovery period: return to horizontal supine lying and
      rest for 10 minutes . For the Sham condition (B), the study was performed with a similar
      procedure except the intervention period consisted of horizontal supine lying.

      Hemodynamic and ventilatory parameter were recorded at the start of each period (0 min) and
      every 2 minute until end of each period for both conditions. Hemodynamic and ventilatory
      dependent variables were heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), electrocardiography (ECG), central venous
      pressure (CVP), respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), tidal volume (VT), minute
      ventilation (VE), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn) and end-tidal expiratory pressure of CO2
      (PETCO2). Subjects were rested between each condition. Subjects were suctioned via
      endotracheal tube to clear airway at 10 minutes before study commencement of either A-B or
      B-A.
