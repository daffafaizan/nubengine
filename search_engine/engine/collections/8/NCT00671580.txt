    
      PZ-601 is a novel investigational carbapenem antibiotic with an antimicrobial spectrum of
      activity that includes pathogens responsible for community-acquired bacterial infections as
      well as multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens - MRSA and vancomycin-resistant
      enterococci. PZ-601 also has activity against Gram-negative organisms including cephalosporin
      and quinolone resistant Enterobacteriaceae as well as Bacteriodes fragilis and
      peptostreptococci. Based on the antimicrobial profile, PZ-601 is a potentially promising
      agent for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections.
