      procedures will eliminate the source of clinical arrhythmias in subjects with clinical
      indications for repeat AF ablation procedures.

      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled study to assess the safety
      and effectiveness of FIRM procedures followed by ablation including pulmonary vein isolation
      versus a standard conventional procedure including pulmonary vein isolation for the
      redo-treatment of persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after one failed previous
      pulmonary vein isolation.
