      and is accompanied by the development of autoantibodies. The inflammation caused by SLE may
      affect the skin, joints, lungs, blood, kidneys and nervous system. The cause of SLE is
      unknown, but research has indicated that it is caused by a combination of genetic and
      environmental factors.

      Autoimmune diseases often run in families. Close relatives of people with these diseases are
      at greater risk of developing the same or another autoimmune disease. The study is designed
      to determine several things: If sisters of people with SLE make the same antibodies that are
      present in people with SLE, whether or not environmental factors affect the chances of
      developing these antibodies and if so what these environmental factors may be, if the
      presence of these antibodies in healthy people leads to increased risk for the development of
      SLE.

      This study enrolled over 400 unaffected sisters of young women diagnosed with SLE. These
      unaffected sisters are being followed with an annual health questionnaire (CSQ) and blood
      sample.

      Participation is voluntary and participants can stop participating at any time.
