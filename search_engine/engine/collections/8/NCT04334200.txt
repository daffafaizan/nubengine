      culturally tailored support group programs for Chinese dementia caregivers. The PhD candidate
      will contact three non-governmental organizations (NGO), including Rotary Club that provides
      dementia services to dementia persons or their caregivers in the elderly centres. The
      caregivers will be recruited as participants through these centres.

      A quasi-experimental, non-equivalent pre-test-post-test control group design will be used to
      determine the effectiveness of a culturally tailored support group program. A non-equivalent
      control group design was used because caregivers from the same centre would have known each
      other. If caregivers in each elderly centre were randomly assigned to experimental and
      control groups, there may have been a chance that caregivers in the experimental group would
      discuss the intervention with caregivers in the control group. Also, the caregivers in the
      control group may think it was unfair that they do not have a chance to have the culturally
      tailored support group programs. Hence, a quasi-experimental design will be implemented and
      the experimental and control groups will be from different elderly centres.

      The participants should be the family members who care for a relative with dementia at home.
