      (increased fetal morbidity and mortality) and long-term (increased incidence of
      cardiovascular disorders in adulthood) health implications.

      Doppler waveform analysis of these pregnancies suggests compromised uteroplacental
      circulation and placental hypoperfusion.

      Our aim is to assess if sildenafil citrate could improve vasodilatation in FGR pregnancies.

      Sildenafil citrate may offer a potential therapeutic strategy to improve uteroplacental
      perfusion in FGR.

      Animal studies suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil
      citrate, may improve uterine blood flow .
