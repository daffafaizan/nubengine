      guided ultrafiltration in hemodialysis patients versus traditional methods for volume
      assessment.

      The duration of the study was 3,5 years.

      During the first 2,5 years of the study all enrolled patients were randomized using a block
      randomization algorithm in two arms.

      In the interventional arm the post-dialysis dry weight was prescribed exclusively using the
      BCM device (Body Composition Monitor - Fresenius Medical Care, Germany).

      In the control arm dry weight assessment was done by traditional clinical methods.

      In both arms,during the intervention period (2,5 years) BCM measurements were performed every
      3 months before dialysis, but only in the interventional arm the values were disclosed to the
      medical personnel and used to guide the dry weight and ultrafiltration volumes.

      In the control arm (clinical), both patients and caregivers were fully blinded from the BCM
      results.

      The BCM device measures for each patient an ideal dry weight interval ( +/- 1.1 kg). In the
      interventional arm, the prescribed dry weights of the patients were strictly maintained in
      the ideal weight interval (+/- 1.1 kg) proposed by the BCM device.

      Primary outcome was all cause-mortality compared in the strict bioimpedance arm versus the
      clinical (control) arm and was assessed at 2,5 years.

      Secondary end-points, assessed during the randomization period (2,5 years), were to compare
      blood pressure (determined pre dialysis), arterial stiffness and relative fluid overload (RFO
      = overhydration/ total body water), as measured by the BCM device.

      During the last year of the study, all patients were left free of any intervention, and only
      arterial stiffness was assessed a third time at 3,5 years.
