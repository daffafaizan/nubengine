      metastases (CLM) is entered in clinical practice. However, its impact seems to decrease with
      the improvement of preoperative imaging. Therefore, if CE-IOUS should be selectively or
      routinely applied remains unclear: a profile of patients who may benefit of CE-IOUS
      application has to be disclosed. The aim of this study is to define reliable criteria for a
      selective use of CE-IOUS during surgery for CLM. IOUS is performed using 3-6 MHz convex
      probe, and a 7.5-10 MHz micro convex probe. Staging is completed by CE-IOUS using the
      standard 3-6 MHz convex probe and the dedicated 1.88-3.76 MHz harmonic frequency probe. In
      all patients, 2.4 mL of sulphur-hexafluoride microbubbles (SonoVueÂ®, Bracco, Milan, Italy)
      are injected through a peripheral vein by the anesthesiologist. Ultrasound guidance is used
      to drive the dissection plane as previously described. Reference standards are histology and
      imaging at 6 months after surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses are performed.
      Statistical significance is set at P=0.05.
