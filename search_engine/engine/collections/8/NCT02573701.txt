      an atypical antipsychotic must be maintained during 6 weeks before the evaluation of
      medication change if the PANSS score did not show a reduction of 30% and the patients did not
      show functional improvement. Clozapine could be administered if two trials of antipsychotics
      were not effective. Benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anticholinergics or anticonvulsants
      were allowed for the treatment of comorbid disorders or side effects.

      The psychosocial treatment included psychoeducation (three 90 min sessions with the family
      and two 45 min sessions with the patients), followed by a seven 45 min sessions training on
      social skills which focused on verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as in
      conversation skills. Patients were also trained in healthy life style habits and were
      included on a 30 min of exercise in group.
