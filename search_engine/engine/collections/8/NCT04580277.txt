      chronic pouchitis. Subjects with chronic active pouchitis will be screened and recruited if
      they meet eligibility criteria. Eligible subjects will undergo baseline clinical evaluation,
      laboratory testing and a pouch endoscopy. They will then receive oral tofacitinib 10 mg twice
      daily for 8 weeks. Clinical and laboratory data will be collected at week 4 and week 8, and
      all subjects will undergo a end of treatment pouch endoscopy at 8 weeks. Clinical, laboratory
      and endoscopic data at 8 weeks will be compared to the baseline data to evaluate study
      outcomes.
