      dynamics of the relation blood pressure (BP) - cerebral blood flow velocity CBFv) indicate a
      disturbed CA. Factors to be considered relevant are BP, blood carbon dioxide (CO2)
      concentration (measured as endtidal CO2 concentration), autonomic nervous system function
      such as heart rate, pulse pressure amplitude and baroreflex sensitivity, movement or
      psychological tasks, and in the patients the kind and the severity of the underlying disease.
      Via different mathematical models the effects of these variables on CBFv as the Output
      function is evaluated. The most frequently used approach is the use of Transfer functions.

      In the registry will include the patients with acute strokes hospitalized at our stroke
      center. We will include every stroke patient with any Kind and severity of stroke syndromes
      who gives informed consent and who has a so called temporal ultrasound window to insonate the
      middle cerebral artery. BP will be measure noninvasively by a Finapres device. Items
      registered are Age, gender, cerebrovascular risk factors, temperature, mean BP and ist
      variability on days 1-3, stroke classification using TOAST, Perfusion Computed Tomography and
      MRI, and at the time of the simultaneous recordings of CBFv and BP the endtidal CO2, mean BP,
      mean pulsatility index, and after Transfer function analysis coherence, gain and Phase in
      different frequency ranges
