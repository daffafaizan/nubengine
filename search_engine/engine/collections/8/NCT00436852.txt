      I. Compare the time to disease progression in children with refractory or relapsed
      neuroblastoma treated with ABT-751 vs historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with measurable disease treatment with
      this drug.

      II. Determine whether ABT-751 improves quality of life of these patients. III. Determine the
      toxicity of ABT-751. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-751 in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral ABT-751 once daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 52
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected periodically during course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies. Quality of life
      is assessed at baseline and prior to each course of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5.1 years.
