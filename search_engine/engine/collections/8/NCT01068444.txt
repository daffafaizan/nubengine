      resistance. It increases the use of glucose of peripheral tissues and decrease the production
      of glucose from liver and dose not influence the production of insulin. It is agonist of
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) and by binding to the receptors of
      PPARγ in various tissues it has effects on transcription of the insulin-dependent gene. In
      animal model, pioglitazone has shown to influence the metabolism by the insulin-dependent
      mechanism.

      Recent studies have demonstrated that PPARγ as well as diet control could improve glycemic
      control, decrease serum ALT level, decrease hepatic fat distribution, and increase
      intrahepatic insulin sensitivity. Meanwhile, PPARγ could also prevent the development of
      alcohol-induced steatohepatitis, improve hepatic necroinflammatory activity, and decrease
      lipid deposition. It is not yet clearly known how the effect of P-PARγ agonist among Asian
      peoples.
