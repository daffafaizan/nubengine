      psychological health of individuals show that psychological problems have been observed in
      individuals who are affected by the epidemic. Today, studies on the effects of COVID-19 on
      psychological health are also available in the literature, and the results of these studies
      are in line with those of previous studies on epidemics.

      The aim of this project is to deliver the "Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An
      Illustrated Guide" that is developed by the World Health Organization within Self Help Plus
      (SH+) intervention to decrease their psychological problems for a feasibility study. The
      feasibility study for the delivery of the SH+ book will be carried out and the psychological
      problems of the participants will be measured twice, before and after the intervention to
      evaluate the results.

      The most important contribution of the Project is conducting a feasibility study with the
      "Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An Illustrated Guide" which will be adapted to the
      Turkish culture based on the determination of Turkey's current psychological status, provide
      a form of intervention to the Turkish psychological intervention literature and to improve
      the psychological status of the participants in this project.
