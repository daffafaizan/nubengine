      heart defects, which has a high incidence and mortality. Iloprost is a prostacyclin analogue.
      When applied by inhalation, it selectively dilates pulmonary vessels, without side affecting
      the systemic circulation. No randomized controlled trials (RCT) of iloprost have previously
      been performed in this indication. The investigators study is the first RCT of iloprost for
      inhalation after surgery of children's congenital heart diseases to be performed in this
      field.
