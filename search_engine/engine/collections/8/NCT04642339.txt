    
      Randomized, double-blind (blinded for trial subject and the study physician), placebo
      controlled clinical trial in parallel assignment of the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy
      of the Gam-COVID-Vac combined vector vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2-induced coronavirus
      infection in adults.

      The trial will include 2,000 volunteers over the age of 18. After screening, they will be
      randomised (3:1) into two groups - a reference group of 500 volunteers who will receive the
      placebo and a study group of 1,500 volunteers who will receive the combined Gam-COVID-Vac
      vaccine against SARS-induced coronavirus infection-СoV-2oV-2. The trial subjects will be
      randomized into five age strata: 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60 and 60+ years. Each subject will
      participate in the trial for 180±14 days after the first dose of the study drug/placebo and
      will have one screening visit and five on-site visits to the study physician during the said
      period. The study drug/placebo will be administered intramuscularly during vaccination visits
      1 and 2 (day 1 and day 21±2). Follow-up visits Nos. 3, 4, 5 will be conducted on days 28±2,
      42±2 and 180±14, respectively. Blood samples will be taken from certain subjects during the
      following visits to assess the immunogenicity parameters on days 1, 42±2 and 180±14. During
      observation visits, vital indicators will be assessed on all trial subjects and changes in
      the subjects' condition and well-being will be recorded, observational visits may be remote,
      using telemedicine (TM) technologies. Additionally, the trial subjects will be able to have
      remote consultations with the study physician through the TM. Data from trial subjects will
      be collected through electronic case report forms.
