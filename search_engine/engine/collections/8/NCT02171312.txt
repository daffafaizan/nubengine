    
      The iDETECT (Integrated Display Enhanced Testing for Concussion and mild traumatic brain
      injury) system is a novel portable, open access platform that enables immediate and rapid
      assessment of multimodal neurologic function. This study seeks to evaluate and validate the
      iDETECT balance, vestibular, and oculomotor testing battery with clinician performed balance
      and vestibular assessment methods. Two groups of participants will be enrolled; concussion
      related dizziness cohort and control subjects (no concussion or dizzy symptoms). The
      investigators will enroll the concussion cohort from patients presenting to the Sports
      Concussion Institute (SCI) with persistent dizziness and imbalance symptoms following
      possible concussion. Healthy control participants with normal vestibular function and no
      history of concussion will be recruited from the local community. All participants will be
      tested with both the iDETECT balance and vestibular assessment battery and the current
      clinical reference standards for imbalance and vestibular dysfunction performed by a
      clinician. Performance on the iDETECT balance and vestibular assessment battery will be
      compared between normal controls and the concussion cohort.
