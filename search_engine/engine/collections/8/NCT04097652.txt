      the standard treatment for ischemic stroke is an intravenous tissue plasminogen
      activator(tPA; alteplase) and/or endovascular thrombectomy. However, the therapeutic time
      window for these treatments is narrow. Besides, endovascular thrombectomy requires
      specialized stroke expertise and endovascular skills. Less than 5% of ischemic stroke
      patients are treated by these therapy and not all patients achieve good outcomes. There is
      still a lack of therapy for the reduction disability from stroke. In 2018, at least 40
      clinical trials intent to treat ischemic stroke using cell therapy. In particular, MSCs have
      shown great potential in the reduction disability from acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Meridigen
      is developing UMC119-06, a mesenchymal stem cell derived from human umbilical cord for the
      treatment of AIS disease.
