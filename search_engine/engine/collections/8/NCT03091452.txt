      is treated by cardiac surgical ablation. In particular, the following questions should be
      answered:

        -  Indication: Which are the different indications for cardiac surgical ablation in
           patients with atrial fibrillation?

        -  How often and in which patients the different concepts of surgery and ablation
           procedures are used? At the same time, how often an intervention at the left atrial
           appendage is carried out?

        -  Safety: How secure is the cardiac surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation
           (periprocedural, during hospital stay and during the long-term follow up)?

        -  Effectiveness: How effectively is the cardiac surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation
           (procedural success)? How often are AF recurrences in the long-term follow up?

        -  What is the concommitant medical treatment after surgical ablation?
