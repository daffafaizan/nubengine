      approximately 52 weeks. Treatment visits will be scheduled in 4-week intervals. After 6
      initial monthly injections of 601 or ranibizumab (loading phase), subjects will enter an
      individualized flexible treatment (IFT) phase (week 24 to week 48). During the IFT phase, an
      assessment of disease stability will be performed at each monthly visit and subjects will
      receive either an injection or not. Safety and efficacy outcomes will continue to be
      evaluated up to a period of 52 weeks unless the patient is withdrawn or discontinues the
      study.
