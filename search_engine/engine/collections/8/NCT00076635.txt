      receive Interferon gamma-1b therapy three times per week and will be evaluated at 6-week
      intervals. Patients not taking Interferon gamma-1b at enrollment will re-initiate therapy
      with subcutaneous Interferon gamma-1b under a dose-escalation scheme, reaching full dose
      after 2 weeks.
