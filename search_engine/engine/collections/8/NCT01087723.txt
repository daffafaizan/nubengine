    
      The purpose of the trial is to show that the early administration of bivalirudin improves
      30-day outcomes when compared to the current standard of care in participants with STE-ACS,
      with an onset of symptoms of >20 minutes and <12 hours, intended for a primary PCI management
      strategy, presenting either via ambulance or to centers where PCI is not performed.

      All participants are to receive treatment with aspirin (150-325 milligrams [mg] administered
      orally or 250-500 mg intravenously [IV]), followed by 75-100 milligrams/day (mg/day) for at
      least 1 year and a loading dose of an approved P2Y12 receptor blocker, such as clopidogrel,
      prasugrel, or ticagrelor, that was to be continued as per European Society of Cardiology
      guidelines (preferably for 1 year) in all participants.

      The primary objectives of the trial are to show that, when compared with standard
      anti-thrombotic therapies other than bivalirudin (which includes treatment with
      unfractionated heparin [UFH] and optional glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor [GPI]) that at 30
      days:

      â€¢ Bivalirudin is superior to control at reducing a composite of death and non-coronary artery
      bypass graft (CABG)-related protocol major bleeding.
