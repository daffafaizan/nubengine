      improvement program can be increased by adding a sleep extension and sleep hygiene
      intervention. Improved sleep can improve weight loss through two possible routes: lessening
      fatigue may potentiate physical activity (PA), and decreasing appetite may potentiate diet
      improvements. A sample of 24-30 women will be assigned to either the Centers for Disease
      Control's (CDC's) standard PreventT2 program or the same program with an additional
      integrated sleep intervention. Both programs will involve 8 group sessions administered over
      3 months, and all women will be followed for a total of 6 months. The primary outcome is
      weight loss, and secondary outcomes include sleep quality and duration, physical activity,
      caloric intake, and physiological indicators of cardiovascular and diabetes risk (HbA1c,
      HOMA-IR, lipids, blood pressure). The combined program has the potential to significantly
      improve weight loss in those at risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
