      challenge is that clinicians will frequently be practicing without the supplies needed for
      specific indicated purpose. For treatment of a cutaneous abscess, sterile gloves are readily
      available whether at home or when deployed. It can be much more difficult to come across a
      penrose or vessel loop. In addition, follow up for wound repacking and reassessment is a
      struggle. Patients may have to move from location to location or have work hours that make it
      difficult to return to the clinic. The loop technique utilizing the rolled ring of a sterile
      glove solves both of these problems. Sterile gloves are always available and the Loop
      technique requires little to no follow up. Additional benefits include: subjects may
      experience less pain, improved cosmesis, faster healing, and decreased complication rates
      with incision and loop drainage utilizing the rolled ring of a sterile glove compared to
      traditional incision and drainage.
