      interaction and the regulation of stress signaling pathways. Maternal depression, parental
      stress and socioeconomic status can also affect the quality of mother-child interaction.

      A former controlled randomized delivery room skin-to-skin study (deisy) showed, that skin
      contact of preterm infants and their mothers after birth improves the mother-child
      interaction. It also leads to a differential expression of candidate genes of the stress
      signaling pathways, which suggests a long term effect on mechanisms in stress response. The
      study group should now be compared to a group of mature infants with a normal, uninterrupted
      postnatal course.

      The hypothesis is that the intervention in the deisy study (early skin-to-skin contact of
      preterm infants and their mothers) improves the mother-child interaction so that it is nearly
      comparable to mature infants with uninterrupted mother-child contact after birth. Furthermore
      it is assumed that the expression and methylation of candidate genes of the stress signaling
      pathways will be influenced by the intervention in the same way.

      The mother-child interaction will be evaluated at the age of six months with a standardized
      method (Mannheim Rating Scales). Questionnaires about maternal depression, social support,
      socio-economic status, parental stress and mother-child relationship disorders as well as
      samples for the molecular genetic testing will be collected on the third day of life and at
      the age of six months. For the molecular genetic testing one blood sample and buccal swabs
      will be taken. The blood sample will not be done additionally but with a routine blood
      sampling on the third day of life (screening of inborn errors of metabolism).
