      study will be carried out in 2 tertiary university hospitals on cardiology wards (adult and
      pediatric). The study will consist of four independent groups of patients whose ECG will be
      monitored using the biomedical shirt. The study groups will be as follows: patients after
      pulmonary veins isolation (PVI), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) recipients, patients
      during cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction, and pediatric patients with
      supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) before electrophysiology study (EPS). Approval for all
      study groups was obtained from institutional review board.

      ECG platform The system consists of biomedical shirt, electronic device and ECG software. The
      biomedical shirt captures the electrocardiographic signal via the textile electrodes
      integrated into the garment. The biomedical shirt enable non-invasive reception of a
      medical-quality ECG signal through adherence of textile electrodes to the skin. The
      biomedical shirt-ECG monitoring is based on BlendFixÂ® sensor electrode technology that is
      capable of being used in real-time and for continuous recording. To the shirt is attached the
      electronic device that transmits the ECG signal (as well as other signals including
      accelerometer and GPS) via bluetooth to a computer and stores the information in memory
      cards. The software allows the visualisation and analysis of data such as ECG, heart rate,
      activity index and relative position of the body captured by the electronic device. The
      platform is a medical device certified in the European Union that has been tested in patients
      who underwent an exercise echocardiography test.
