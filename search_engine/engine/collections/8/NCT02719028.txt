      Antroquinonol, in comparison with placebo, after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with
      hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the
      effects of Antroquinonol in comparison with placebo on other lipid parameters after 12 weeks
      of treatment and the effects of Antroquinonol on left ventricular diastolic function,
      arterial stiffness and fatty liver. The safety and tolerability of Antroquinonol will be
      monitored as well.
