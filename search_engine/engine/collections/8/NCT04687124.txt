      randomized to receive dietary counselling and daily fish-oil supplementation over a 5-7 week
      period, or standard care. Outcome parameters are measured at baseline (onset of
      radiotherapy), week 5, and 12 weeks after commencing radiotherapy, with one additional
      measurement of body weight at week 2. Quality of life (QoL) is measured using the EORTC
      QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Radiotherapy-related side effects are assessed using a questionnaire
      developed specifically for this study. Data from a historical control group collected in a
      previous observational study is included in this study to compare incidence of weight loss.
