      amoxicillin-clavulanate 1g twice a day for 3 days. Prior to administration of study drug on
      Day 0, stool sample and blood will be collected for microbiome and metabolomics & gene
      expression analysis respectively. Urine pregnancy test (for females subjects of child-bearing
      potential) will be performed prior to study drug administration. Baseline physical
      examination and vital signs will be done as well.

      Subsequently, stool and blood samples will be collected on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 7, day
      14, and day 28. Physical examination, vital signs, and review of adverse events will be done
      at each of the visits as well.

      Volunteers will be monitored for symptoms of AAD throughout this period. All study subjects
      will be asked to keep a standardised patient diary up to day 28 or until symptom resolution
      whichever is longer. All other potential AEs will also be solicited for throughout study
      period. Subjects who develop AAD will be graded according to CTCAE version 5.0 criteria for
      AEs. The study drug Augmentin will be discontinued in subjects who develop AAD, defined as a
      passage of loose or watery stool at least 3 times in a 24-hour period. Management of AAD is
      at the discretion of the study team PI and co-Is, guided by severity and clinical indication
      for intervention. All medication prescribed for the management of AAD or other AEs will be
      documented in the medication/concomitant medication clinical record form.
