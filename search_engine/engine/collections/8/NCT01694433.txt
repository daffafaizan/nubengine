      vs. placebo cream. Patients with acne will use calcipotriene or placebo cream 2x/day for 12
      weeks and will be assessed at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12. Each group will have 24 subjects as
      calculated by power analysis. Three additional subjects for each group will be recruited for
      possible dropouts and total of 27 subjects will be recruited for each group. Primary endpoint
      (lesion count) and secondary endpoint (IGA- Investigator's Global Assessment) will be
      determined. Lesion counts will be assessed by one of the investigator physicians or nurse
      practitioner. Adverse effects including irritation, dry skin, inflammation and worsening of
      the lesions will be noted at each visit. Photographs will be taken to aid in assessing the
      clinical changes.
