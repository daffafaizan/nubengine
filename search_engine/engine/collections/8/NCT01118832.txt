      thermal recovery to uniquely identify lesions that may be cancerous. Using computer models,
      the thermal signature is used to determine the size and shape of the lesions in question. In
      particular, this study seeks to add quantification analysis of high resolution thermal images
      of melanoma lesions to provide accurate early diagnostic capability with specific detail
      regarding size, shape and depth of the lesions. This information will be compared to biopsy
      results and surgical resection results.
