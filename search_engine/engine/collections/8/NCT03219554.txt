      symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawn of consent, whichever
      occurs first.

      Disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (Â±7 days) from the date of initiation of
      treatment. Each assessment will be performed as scheduled according to the calendar
      regardless of any dosing delay to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of
      efficacy. Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographically and/or clinically (ie,
      for photographed or palpable lesions) documented progressive disease (PD) as per RECIST
      v.1.1, initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study
      participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up), whichever occurs first.
