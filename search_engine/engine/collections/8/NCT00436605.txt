      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with stage III unresectable or stage IV
      melanoma treated with dasatinib.

      II. Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the expression of targets of Dasatinib prior to treatment by obtaining
      pre-treatment biopsies or examining paraffin-embedded tissues from previous tumor resections.

      II. In selected patients (approximately 5-10) where tumor tissue is available pre-treatment
      and can be obtained post-treatment with Dasatinib (21 days after initiation of therapy), to
      determine if Dasatinib induces changes in expression of selected targets and downstream
      mediators, including MEK, ERK and RSK-1.

      III. To assess toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
