      functional capability and increase the likelihood of injury due to fall. Anecdotal reports
      and a recent study suggest that triggering the ejaculatory reflex in men with vibratory
      stimulation can result in a significant decrease in spasm activity over a period of 2 to 42
      hours. This study examines the effects of penile vibratory stimulation on spasticity when
      conducted daily in the home setting.
