    
      Eligibility: A healthy person without memory complaints or someone with neurodegenerative
      disease. However, the person should not have metal in the body (ie, pacemaker, implants,
      shrapnel, etc.), should not be pregnant, and should not have claustrophobic anxieties.

      Study Procedures: During a regular office visit, a neurologist will perform a routine
      physical and neurological examination, including your medical and family history, to
      determine your eligibility for this study. You will then be scheduled for a series of
      neuropsychological tests, which take between 1 to 1.5 hours, and an MRI scan, which takes
      approximately 1 hour to complete. This is a longitudinal study and you may be asked to repeat
      these procedures approximately every six months for the duration of this 2 year project.
