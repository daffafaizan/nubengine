      the impact of enhanced institutional care on early childhood development to that of
      high-quality foster care. We will recruit a large (n= 220) samples of young children who have
      been identified as having to be removed from their families and we will randomize these
      children to two groups: enhanced institutional care (Group 1) or to enhanced foster care
      (Group 2). Institutional caregivers and Foster Parents will participate in a caregiving
      training, along with the child, that includes 5-1.5 hour sessions over 6-8 weeks.

      In this Randomized Control Trial (RCT), we will assess the children in Groups 1 and 2 at the
      time they come into care and then at several follow-up time points (12 months, 24 months, 36
      months of age). We hypothesize that children placed into foster/family care (FCG) will
      display enhanced socioemotional development, and enhanced behavioral and neural patterns of
      attention, cognition and social cognition, compared to children placed in enhanced
      institutional care.
