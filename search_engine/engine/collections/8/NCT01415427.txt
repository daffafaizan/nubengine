    
      This is a multi-center, multinational, extension study to evaluate 2 dose regimens of BMN 110
      treatment in patients with MPS IVA who completed MOR-004.

      The last study visit assessments for MOR-004 will constitute Baseline for this study. The
      first study drug dose of this protocol will occur on Week 0 of MOR-005, which is the same as
      the last visit (Week 24) of MOR-004. Initially, the study will be double-blind with patients
      previously randomized to BMN 110 in MOR-004 remaining on their assigned BMN 110 dose regimen
      (qw or qow dosing). The MOR-004 placebo patients will be re-randomized (1:1 ratio) to one of
      the 2 BMN 110 dose regimen groups: 2.0 mg/kg/qw or 2.0 mg/kg/qow.

      There will be two study parts:

        -  Part 1 - randomized double-blind until the optimal BMN 110 dose regimen has been
           determined, based on the final primary efficacy analysis from MOR-004

        -  Part 2 - open-label BMN 110 treatment with the single optimal dose regimen
