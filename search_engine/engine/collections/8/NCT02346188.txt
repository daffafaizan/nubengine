      supplementation among lead-exposed children in Torre√≥n, Mexico (altitude 1060 m) to test the
      hypothesis that supplementation with iron, zinc or both will reduce blood lead concentrations
      of the children and improve their cognition and behavior. Nine schools were selected based on
      proximity to a lead smelter and first-graders were individually randomized to daily treatment
      with 30 mg iron, 30 mg zinc, both, or placebo. In addition to biochemical indicators (blood
      lead, serum ferritin, CRP, serum zinc, urinary arsenic concentrations), cognitive functions
      and behavior were measured. Assessments were conducted at three time points: at baseline,
      after the 6 month treatment, and again after another 6 months without treatment. At baseline,
      602 children ages 6.2-8.5 years were enrolled.
