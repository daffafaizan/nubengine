    
      The baseline patient characteristics will be evaluated based on pilot tested data extraction
      sheets. The assessment will include demographics, clinical data as well as laboratory work
      up. The Charlson morbidity index, will be used to assess co-morbidity, the Nutritional risk
      score (NRS) to assess nutrition status and the Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) to evaluate the
      activity of Crohn's disease. The duration of surgical procedure, along with the amount of
      blood transfused, will be recorded in all patients.

      Laboratory variables

      The following variables will be assessed based on previous evidence about their role in
      surgical stress response:

        1. Immunological parameters: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, interleukin-6,
           interleukin-10, C reactive protein, and white blood cell counts.

        2. Endocrinological parameters: plasma cortisol, growth hormone , adrenocorticotropic
           hormone, epinephrin and norepinephrine
