    
      Primary objective: To assess the prevalence and severity of rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, with
      or without nasal polyposis, in asthmatic patients depending on severity of their disease.

      Secondary objectives:

      To assess the impact of nasal and sinusal pathology on asthma control.

      To correlate asthma severity to rhinitis and rhinosinusitis.

      To compare the potential association between chronic rhinosinusitis, with and without nasal
      polyposis, and asthma severity, and to detect radiographic differences, markers of atopy, and
      pulmonary function.
