    
      An ICU-ventilator capable to measure the FRC will be used for the mechanical ventilation in
      patients undergÄ±oing laparoscopic surgery, where anaesthesia maintenance will be achieved
      with TIVA.

      FRC will be measured in different steps of the operation. In the study group, a recruitment
      manover will be applied to evaluate its effects on FRC.
