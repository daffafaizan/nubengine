    
      This Phase 3 trial is an open-label extension study of the placebo-controlled, double-blind
      VRX-RET-E22-302 trial. Patients who have completed the VRX-RET-E22-302 trial and who meet
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be treated with 600-1200 mg/day of retigabine as an
      adjunct therapy to their current antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or vagal nerve stimulation.
      Treatment will be continued until retigabine is commercially available, or until the program
      is discontinued. Patients will be recruited from 55-60 sites in Europe, Israel, Australia,
      and South Africa. The safety and tolerability of long-term therapy with retigabine
      administered as adjunctive therapy in adult epilepsy patients with partial-onset seizures
      will be evaluated. In addition, the efficacy of long-term treatment with retigabine and
      patient quality of life will be assessed.
