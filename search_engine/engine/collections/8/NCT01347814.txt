      sensations in healthy subjects. Domperidone is a dopamine 2 (D2) receptor antagonist with
      claims of gastrointestinal tract pro-kinetic activity. Accelerated gastric emptying (GE) may
      lead to reduced satiation, increased food intake and is associated with obesity and diabetes
      mellitus. It is hypothesized that domperidone will increase gastric emptying rate and reduce
      satiety responses to a high-fat meal.

      The effect of acute oral administration of 10 mg domperidone on gastric emptying of a
      high-fat pancake test meal, and subjective appetite sensations by visual analogue scale will
      be measured for six hours postprandially in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded
      manner in 13 healthy subjects.
