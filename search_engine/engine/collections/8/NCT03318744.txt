      inversion recovery with no corresponding symptoms in the clinical history of the patient that
      could be attributed to the lesion. SBI were distinguished from nonspecific subcortical and
      periventricular white matter lesions by the presence of a corresponding hypointense lesion on
      T1-weighted images.

      The prevalence of SBI varies from 5% to 62% in healthy population. To date, few studies
      investigate the association between SBI and ethnicity. The effectiveness of antithrombotics
      including aspirin against future symptomatic stroke in SBI patients remains to be
      established. Due to the high prevalence of ICAS among Chinese, and its nature of
      artery-to-artery microembolisms, investigators hypothesize that the prevalence of SBI among
      Chinese might be significantly higher than other races such as Caucasians and
      African-Americans.

      Recent study has revealed that SBI is associated with an 2-fold increase of future ischemic
      stroke. Yet, interventions such as antiplatelet therapies for reducing the stroke risk in SBI
      patients have not been investigated to our best knowledge. In this study, investigators
      examine whether regular oral aspirin can reduce the incidence of cerebrovascular events and
      mortality in SBI patients.
