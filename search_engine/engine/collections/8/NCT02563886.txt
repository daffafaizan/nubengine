      Therapy (EAMT), an extension of Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy to moderately-to-severely
      paralyzed patients in their stable plateau phase of recovery. During EAMT, patients can
      assist affected upper limb movements through functional electrical stimulation. Initially,
      patients are divided in two groups. One of the groups receives EAMT, the other receives the
      best possible physical and occupational therapy. Therapy consists in 40 sessions of 45
      minutes twice per day over five weeks, including a one-week therapy break. After 20 sessions,
      group allocation is crossed-over, and patients don't receive any therapy for one week.
