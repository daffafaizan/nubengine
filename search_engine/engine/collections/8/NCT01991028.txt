      The following secondary efficacy (deposition) variables will be determined (where
      appropriate): Percentage dose deposited in the oropharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric regions
      Percentage dose remaining in the Miat Monodose inhaler Percentage dose remaining in the
      nebuliser mouthpiece Percentage dose remaining in the nebuliser reservoir Percentage dose
      deposited on the exhalation filter (if appropriate) Percentage dose contained in mouth
      washing(s) Penetration index based on the ratio of counts in the central:peripheral lung
