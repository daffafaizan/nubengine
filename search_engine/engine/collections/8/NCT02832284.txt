      lesion in the setting of a suspicion of lung cancer. Standard of practice radial
      endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is visualizing a
      peripheral lesion on R-EBUS, locking the placement of the access sheath, removing the
      ultrasound catheter from the access sheath and then blindly advancing a sampling device to
      acquire cellular matter for cytologic evaluation. The iNod system performs the same procedure
      with one fewer device exchange. It provides real-time visualization of the biopsy needle and
      target peripheral pulmonary lesions during tissue acquisition. The ultrasound probe is not
      retracted in advance of the sampling maneuver and the sampling is completed under direct
      visualization. Compared to current standard of care methods for transbronchial sampling of
      pulmonary lesions, this approach is not expected to add additional risk. Tissue sampling
      under real-time visualization may improve the efficiency of tissue sampling.
