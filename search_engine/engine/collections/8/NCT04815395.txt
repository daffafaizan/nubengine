      arousal rating and neural responses to emotional faces, however, it remains unclear whether
      different routes of oxytocin treatment would have differential effects on attention
      processing to social stimuli. Based on the previous registered studies (ClinicalTrials.gov
      ID: NCT04493515 and NCT03486925) from our group using a validated emotional anti-saccade task
      with social stimuli (emotional faces) and non-social stimuli (oval shape) have separately
      explored oral and intranasal oxytocin's modulatory effects on attention processing, the
      present study aims to conduct a secondary analysis of the previously acquired data to
      directly compare oxytocin's effects on attention control to social emotional stimuli via
      different routes. To this end data from subjects who underwent intranasal oxytocin
      administration (n = 33, NCT03486925) will be compared with data from subjects who underwent
      oral oxytocin or placebo administration (n = 36, or 37 respectively; NCT04493515). To further
      control for non-treatment related factors the intranasal placebo and oral placebo groups from
      the previous studies (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03486925 and NCT04493515) will be compared
      with respect to primary and secondary outcome measures of the trial, in particular general
      and emotion-specific effects on attentional control.
