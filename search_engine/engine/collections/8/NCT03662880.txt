    
      Patients with Mitral stenosis that admitted in Assiut University hospital -Cardiovascular
      Department for doing Percutaneous Mitral Commissurotomy Will undergo Trans-esophageal echo
      and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance for detection of left atrial Thrombus and left atrial
      appendage thrombus. Investigators will compare the result of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance with
      the results of Trans-esophageal echo for seen the sensitivity and specificity of Cardiac
      Magnetic Resonance in compare to Trans-esophageal echo who is the gold standard imaging for
      detection of left atrial and left atrial appendage Thrombus.Data will be presented as mean Â±
      standard deviation for continuous variables and frequency for categorical variables.

        -  Patients with and without thrombus will be compared using independent (unpaired) Student
           t test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables, or
           their non-parametric equivalents, after testing the data for normality.

        -  Diagnostic performance of each CMR component will be calculated in the standard manner.
