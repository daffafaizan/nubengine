    
      We seek to assess the knowledge, beliefs and reported treatment practices of primary care
      physicians with regard to gout.

      Specifically, we will:

        -  Assess the knowledge and beliefs with regard to acute and chronic gout management based
           on published treatment recommendations.

        -  Characterize the individuals who have knowledge deficits in terms of age, specialty,
           number of patients seen with gout, and practice setting.

        -  Assess the reported treatment practices of primary care physicians for the acute and
           chronic management of gout.
