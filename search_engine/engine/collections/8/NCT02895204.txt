      diabetes and obesity. Over a 8-week testing period, the F-MRP group consumed 6 g of powder
      containing 4.2 g F-MRP each day, whereas the placebo group consumed the same amount with
      dextrin. NK cell activity (%) was measured based on the ratios of effector cells (E;
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) from each participant to target cells (T; K562
      cells) at E:T= 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1, or 1.25:1.
