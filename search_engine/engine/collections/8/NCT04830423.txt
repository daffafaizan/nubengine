      inclusion criteria were randomized into two groups of people. The first group will be
      designated as Ozone group will be applied to these patients. Patients in the second group
      will be designated as the steroid group, and injections will be applied in accordance with
      protocol. Participants were evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The Western Ontario
      and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). The presence of suprapatellar effusion of
      the participants whose evaluations are completed will be evaluated by ultrasonography and the
      findings will be recorded. Initial evaluations of the participants will be made before the
      first injection. Patients in the ozone (O2-O3) injection group will be given intraarticular
      and per-articular knee injections 3 times as the first dose of 10 μg / ml, the second dose is
      15 μg / ml, and the third dose is 20 μg / ml, each session in a volume of 10 ml. In the
      steroid injection group, 1 ml of betamethasone (6 mg / ml) will be injected once
      intraarticular knee injection. Patients will be evaluated according to the study criteria at
      the beginning, 4 and 12 weeks later by a blinded investigator.
