      to be marketed formulation of ER OROS paliperidone in mobile healthy men, which represents
      the normal conditions. The 12-mg ER OROS paliperidone ER by oral administration single dose
      used in this study does not require prolonged bed rest as a precautionary measure to prevent
      orthostatic hypotension. To support an evaluation of the effect of posture on the
      pharmacokinetics of ER OROS paliperidone under fasting conditions, study medication was also
      administered to healthy men in the fasted state while confined to bed for approximately 36
      hours. The safety and tolerability of the treatments in healthy men will be assessed. 12 mg
