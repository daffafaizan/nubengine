      presence or absence of high versus low risk accepting male teenage passengers. Driving
      performance includes attention and risk measures including eye glance behaviors, speed
      management, following distance, closing speed and gap acceptance. To what extent does driving
      performance vary as a product of the male teen passenger risk- acceptance compared with no
      passenger present?
