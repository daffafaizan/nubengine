      insulin-sensitive based on a fasting homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) value are eligible
      for the trial. At baseline, a 6-minute walk test is performed, followed by assessment of
      coronary flow reserve with ammonia-PET imaging before/after adenosine infusion. Subjects are
      then given an oral glucose load (75g), followed by PET imaging with
      F-18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG). Subjects then begin taking rosiglitazone 4 mg qd x 12
      weeks, after which the 6-minute walk test & PET imaging is repeated.
