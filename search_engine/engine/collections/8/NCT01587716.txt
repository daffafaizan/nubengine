      effects of GSK2339345 in healthy subjects. GSK2339345 is a blocker of neuronal voltage gated
      sodium channels in development for the treatment of chronic cough, excessive cough and
      post-viral and viral (acute) cough. Inhaled pan NaV inhibitors are associated with
      oropharyngeal sensation perturbation and so this study will establish the potential local
      sensate effects of GSK2339345 at multiples of the predicted inhaled therapeutic dose. This
      study also aims to define the maximum tolerated dose of GSK2339345 administered via an
      aqueous droplet inhaler. Cohort 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      cross-over, inhaled single-dose escalating study using an aqueous droplet inhaler. Cohort 1
      will include assessments of sensate changes via a 4 point scale, assessment of taste via an
      11 point scale, and PK assessments to investigate the PK profile of GSK2339345. Cohort 2 of
      this study is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, inhaled repeat
      dose study using a aqueous droplet inhaler. Subjects will be randomised to receive 2000
      microgram of GSK2339345 or placebo four times a day for two consecutive study days. Similar
      assessments of sensations to those used in Cohort 1 will be performed. The potential for
      systemic cardiovascular (CV) or central nervous system (CNS) effects will also be assessed
      throughout the study via observation. Cohort 2 will also include PK assessments to
      investigate the PK profile of GSK2339345. Placebo will be used throughout the study as a
      control.
