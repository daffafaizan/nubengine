      of men with metabolic syndrome X. Genetic hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disease
      in Northern Europe. Both are due to a lack of regulation in iron absorption. To date, there
      is no nutritional study for those patients.

      Polyphenols, particularly flavanols, have shown as good iron-chelating abilities as
      pharmacological chelators. However, no human study in iron-overload disease have been so far
      conducted.

      The aim of POLYFER-study is to demonstrate that oral polyphenol intake reduces iron
      absorption in patients with genetic or metabolic iron-overload diseases.

      POLYFER is a cross-over randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of polyphenol
      supplementation versus placebo on iron absorption after loading dose of iron given through a
      rich-iron meal. Iron absorption will be studied by the area under the curve of serum iron
      after the meal. Serum iron will be collected after the meal Ã  0 minute, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2
      hours, 3 hours et 4 hours.

      Because of the nycthemeral variations of serum iron, it is essential to obtain a collection
      of serum iron data in the basal state (after fasting), allowing the calculation for each
      subject of a "relative" AUC after iron-rich meal with placebo and after iron-rich meal with
      polyphenols. The endpoint will be the difference between "relative" AUC after meal rich in
      iron alone and after polyphenols.

      In order to improve the underlying mechanism of atherosclerosis which is highly prevalent in
      those diseases, we will conduct an ancillary study. Recent studies showed interesting results
      linking some oxylipins levels and inflammation. Investigator will study basal oxylipin level
      and post-prandial oxylipin level by lipidomic analysis in both diseases.
