      to smallholder farmers for free would be a profitable investment for a cotton outgrowing

      The study therefore carries out a major net distribution through the existing distribution
      channels of a cotton outgrowing agribusiness, evaluates the impact of this distribution on
      smallholder cotton yields, and values the profitability implications for the outgrowing
      agribusiness.
