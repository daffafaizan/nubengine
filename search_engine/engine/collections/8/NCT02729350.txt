      called PAINReportIt Guided Relaxation Intervention, can be used to teach people who have
      sickle cell disease (SCD) how to track their stress and pain daily and use guided
      audio-visual relaxation exercises to help them reduce their stress and pain. To obtain
      preliminary data for a larger trial, 30 adult inpatients with SCD admitted with SCD pain will
      be recruited.

      The investigators will stratify patients on worst pain intensity (<=5 and >5) and randomly
      assign 15 adults to Attention Control (12-min SCD experience discussion on Day 1 and daily
      stress/pain tracking on Days 2-4) and 15 adults to Experimental (12-min GR video clip on Day
      1 and daily stress/pain tracking and GR on Days 2-4) groups.

      Immediate effects on pain, stress, and relaxation responses after the 12-min session will be
      examined. Patients will continue the trial for additional 4 days, with self-management on
      Days 2-4 and posttest on Day 5 while hospitalized to test short-term effects.

      During Days 2-4, the experimental group will choose and watch any of six video clips (2 min,
      5 min, 8 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min lengths) at least once a day; and at stress onset
      and as often as they need. We will investigate mechanisms by which GR produces its effects in
      adult inpatients with SCD.
