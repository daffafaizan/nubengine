      self-reported physical activity compared to a non-cardiac arrest (CA) control group who had
      acute myocardial infarction (MI). Additional aims are to explore potential predictors of
      physical inactivity (older age, female gender, problems with general physical function,
      global cognition, mental processing speed/attention, anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms,
      kinesiophobia, fatigue), and to investigate the relationship between self-reported and
      objectively measured physical activity among OHCA-survivors.
