      hands are our primary means of interacting with the world, post-stroke hand impairment
      diminishes stroke survivors' abilities for activities of daily living including self-care,
      hygiene, employment, and leisure, and lowers independence. Hand impairment is difficult to
      treat. Limited resources in rehabilitation services and financial burdens make it impractical
      to simply increase rehabilitation service visits within the current healthcare system.

      One way to augment hand function recovery is peripheral sensory stimulation. Afferent input
      is a powerful driver of change in the motor cortex. Sensory stimulation has been shown to
      improve motor recovery in previous studies. In particular, promising preliminary results have
      been obtained by using imperceptible random-frequency vibration applied via a watch. However,
      the laboratory prototype device for delivering this vibration must be improved in the form
      factor for patient adoption.

      Therefore, we developed an App that can be installed in smartwatches and control the vibrator
      within the smartwatch to deliver vibratory stimulation to the user. The objective of this
      study is to determine if the acute effect of vibration from a smartwatch on hand function is
      comparable to the effect of an existing laboratory prototype.
