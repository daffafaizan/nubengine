      increased to cover maternal and fetal thyroid hormones synthesis and the increased renal
      iodine clearance. Maternal hypothyroidism and/or severe iodine deficiency are associated to
      mental retardation in their offspring. Indeed, thyroid hormones and iodine are necessary for
      fetal brain development.

      Iodine deficiency remains the first cause of preventable mental retardation. In France,
      preventive programs with salt iodine fortification are insufficient to eradicate iodine
      deficiency. In previous studies, we have shown that iodine deficiency is the rule for
      pregnant women in our area: 66 to 85% of women tested depending on the stage of pregnancy
      (Brucker-Davis 2004, Hieronimus et al 2009, abstract at the 2008 ETA and SFE meetings,
      article in preparation reporting results from our 2006 PHRC: Study of thyroid function during
      pregnancy with or without iodine supplementation).We will study the impact of early iodine
      supplementation in normal pregnant women on the neuropsychological development of their
      offspring assessed at 2 years of age. This is the follow-up of a cohort of children born to
      women enrolled in our 2006 PHRC. 110 healthy women have been included in this prospective
      study: they were seen early (median 8 weeks of gestation) and had strictly normal thyroid
      function tests, as well as no personal thyroid history. They were randomized into two groups:
      group A taking pregnancy vitamins without iodine supplementation (Oligobs GrossesseR 2
      tablets/day) our group B taking the same vitamins but iodine fortified (Oligobs MaxiodeR 2
      tablets per day, i.e. 150 mcg of iodine/day).
