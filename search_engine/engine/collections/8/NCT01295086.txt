    
      Primary aim:

      To define the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of taxotere, eloxatin and
      capecitabine (TEX) in combination with herceptin given every third week as first- line
      treatment in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastro-esophageal cancer.

      Secondary aims:

      Estimating response-rate, progression free survival and overall survival

      Methods:

      This dose-finding study is planned to include 15 patients with HER2 positive
      gastro-esophageal cancer, adenocarcinoma. Patients will be included in cohorts of three at
      progressively higher dose levels.

      Chemotherapy will be repeated day 1 every third week to a maximum of eight cycles. Treatment
      with trastuzumab will continue until disease progression. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will
      be evaluated after the first cycle. In case of DLT among one of the three patients during the
      first course of treatment additional three patients will be added at the respective dose
      level. Dose escalation is continued if 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience DLT.

      Patients will be evaluated with a ct- scan at baseline and after every three cycles to
      exclude progression and evaluate response. Response is assessed by investigators according to
      RECIST version 1.1.

      Blood counts regarding tumour biology will be collected at baseline before 2nd, 4th and 7th
      cycle and 4 weeks after ended treatment. After completion of treatment patients will be
      followed every third month until progression or death.
