      receiving a telemedicine intervention and approximately 100 receiving usual care. Eligibility
      requires having diabetes and being a Medicare beneficiary.

      This program, called "TeleDiab" for the first time in our country, was designed in
      cooperation with the Istanbul University Rectorate and the local telecommunication company
      Turkcell. Its implementation was carried out as a pilot project in the Department of
      Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases of Istanbul Medical Faculty in the follow-up and
      treatment of diabetic patients. Subjects are randomized to receive telemedicine case
      management or usual care for diabetes.

      This project, it is aimed to evaluate the "TeleDiab" program developed for use in diabetic
      patients in terms of applicability, practicality, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. In
      this way, it was aimed to compare the electronically followed patient group with a similar
      patient group routinely followed in terms of glycemic control, treatment compliance,
      complications, and comorbid diseases 6 months and 1 year later.

      The intervention utilizes a home telemedicine unit (HTU). The HTU is a specially designed,
      web-enabled device with a data port connected to a home glucometer and home blood pressure
      cuff whereby measurements obtained with these devices can be directly uploaded to a computer
      database. A diabetes nurse and a practitioner case manager interact regularly with
      intervention participants through videoconference via the HTU.
