      photon based radiation therapy, with a significantly higher cost. The clinical advantages,
      however, may not be realized for all patient populations, even with the improved dose
      distributions. Establishing the clinical efficacy of proton therapy requires years of
      experience treating patients. The goal is to accelerate the knowledge gain through the use of
      the registry that allows for detailed information to be captured and is inclusive of every
      patient treated.
