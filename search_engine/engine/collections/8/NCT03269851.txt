      fractures. High activity and lack of stability make it more prone to fractures.

      Many studies have attempted to determine whether neurological deficit in such fractures is
      related to spinal canal stenosis or other parameters observed on axial computed tomography
      (CT). However, this relationship remains controversial.

      Few reports shed light on the correlation between different imaging parameters like: sagittal
      alignment, vertebral compression, and canal stenosis, type of the fracture according to AO
      classification and severity of nerve damage.

      These four radiographic parameters will be tested as expected risk factors for neurological
      deficit in thoracolumbar fractures .
