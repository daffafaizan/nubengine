        1. To establish that the Cordella PA Sensor can be safely delivered, deployed, and remain
           stable within the target pulmonary artery (PA) segment through 30 days post-implant.

        2. To compare Cordella PA Sensor System pressure measurements with fluid-filled catheter PA
           pressure measurements obtained by standard right heart catheterization (RHC) at 90 days
           post implant.
