      be evaluated during insulin-induced hypoglycemia followed by hyperglycemia and euglycemia,
      respectively, on two separate experimental days. Twenty-four patients with type-1 diabetes
      are included. Patients are randomised 1:1 to start with either the combined hypo- and
      hyperglycemic or the hypo- and euglycemic clamp. After an overnight 10 hour fast,
      participants are admitted for a 255 minute clamp. An individualised insulin infusion will be
      initiated targeting a plasma glucose level of 5.0-8.0 mmol/l. When the targeted plasma
      glucose level is achieved, the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp will be initiated at time 0.
      The insulin infusion will be fixed at an infusion rate 80 mU/m2/min and a 20% glucose
      infusion will be initiated in order to regulate plasma glucose levels. After 45 min of
      monitoring at euglycemic plasma glucose level, plasma glucose will be decreased over a period
      of 30 minutes, targeting 2.5 mmol/l for a period of 60 min in a hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic
      clamp. From 135 min to 195 min, plasma glucose levels will be increased to either
      hyperglycemic level or euglycemic level and will be kept constant for 105 minutes.
      Echocardiography is performed at baseline, at hypoglycemic level and at hyper-or
      normoglycemic level. Blood samples are taken every 15 minutes throughout the entire clamp,
      however bedside plasma glucose is analysed every fifth minute. A Holter-ECG is obtained
      throughout the entire clamp.
