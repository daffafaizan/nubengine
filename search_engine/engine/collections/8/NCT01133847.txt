    
      The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to address unanswered questions about the
      relative effectiveness of treatments for children with both Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) and significant reading difficulties (RD). The study evaluates attentional
      and word reading outcomes for students with both conditions when provided with either (a)
      disorder-specific ADHD treatment (carefully managed medication + parent training), (b)
      disorder-specific RD treatment (intensive, individualized reading instruction), or (c) the
      combination of ADHD and RD treatment. The study aims to address the relative benefits of
      providing either disorder-specific ADHD or RD treatment alone and providing the combined
      treatment. The investigators hypothesize that the combined treatment approach will result in
      better outcomes in terms of both word reading/decoding and a reduction in ADHD symptoms than
      either of the disorder-specific treatments alone. Treatment will last for 16 weeks, with
      assessment prior to and following treatment and some measures collected regularly throughout
      the intervention periods.
