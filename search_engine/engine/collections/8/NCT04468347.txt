      multidisciplinary study of Alzheimer's disease and aging funded by the Commonwealth
      Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Flagship Initiative, involving
      research centers in both Victoria and Western Australia. The goal of the A08 protocol was to
      further investigate the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging results with flortaucipir
      in patients across the AD spectrum from individuals with subjective memory complaints (SMC)
      to those with dementia, based on recruitment into the parent AIBL study.
