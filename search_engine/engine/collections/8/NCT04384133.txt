      Mersin University Faculty of Medicine Hospital Chest Diseases Clinic between
      01.10.2019-01.04.2020 will be taken. 35 healthy participants with smoking history and 35
      healthy participants without smoking history who were admitted to our clinic within the same
      date range will be taken as control group. Impulse oscillometric pulmonary function tests
      will be performed to all participants. Thorax computed tomography will be performed to
      evaluate small airway dysfunction. To evaluate the degree of disease inflammation and
      phenotype in COPD patients, nitric oxide measurements will be made in the breath air with
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) device. The blood eosinophil level will be studied to
      determine the COPD phenotype. To assess symptom control in patients with COPD, mMRC(Modified
      Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale will be administered. The COPD assessment test (CAT)
      will be applied to measure the quality of life. All patients will be followed for 1 year to
      record the number of exacerbations requiring emergency and hospital admissions for COPD. The
      effect of small airway dysfunction on the disease severity and control degree, disease
      phenotypes and quality of life, and the effect on the risk of exacerbation will be analyzed.
