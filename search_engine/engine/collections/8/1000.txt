cancer chemotherapy by continuous intra-arterial infusion ofmethotrexate.continuous intra-arterial infusions of methotrexatewere used in the treatment of45 patients with malignant disease of thehead and neck, 16 patients with advancedcancer of pelvic organs, and 7 with malignantlesions of the lower limb.  in 4 patientswith epidermoid lesions of the headand neck there was complete regressionof the local tumor.  thirty-three other patientsbenefited from treatment for varyingperiods of time, but the remaining 30showed no response.  eight patients diedduring or immediately after treatment; allhad advanced cancers of the head-and-neckregion.  the mean total dose of methotrexategiven in the patients with no responsewas significantly less than in thosewith partial regression of the tumor.this suggests that the greater the total doseof methotrexate tolerated, the greaterthe chance of beneficial response.  the roleof continuous intra-arterial chemotherapyin the management of malignant diseaseis discussed.
