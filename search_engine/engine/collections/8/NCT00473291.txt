    
      The accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural cavity of the lungs, known as pleural
      effusion, is a common clinical condition that may be the result of trauma or disease.
      Diagnosis and management of pleural effusion can be done by X-Ray or ultrasound; however
      X-Ray emits radiation, requires a special room and expert personnel, while ultrasound
      requires a high level of expertise to perform and analyze. The VRI device is non-invasive and
      radiation free. The VRI device is a simple method to image the lungs in a regional manner to
      examine changes that occur during pleural effusion.

      Comparison: X-ray and ultrasonography evaluations of pleural effusion, compared to VRI
      acoustic imaging evaluations.
