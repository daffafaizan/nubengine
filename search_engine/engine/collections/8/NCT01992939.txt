      study total. 30 patients will have peripheral vascular disease (PVD), vasoconstriction, or
      hypothermic extremities and 80 patients with no blood flow issues will be enrolled. The
      patients will serve as their own controls. Each patient will have a specialized pulse
      oximetry probe with external heat pack added to their extremity while measuring pulse
      oximetry. These SaO2 readings will be compared to SaO2 readings obtained from an arterial
      blood gas obtained during the course of the study.
