      along with continuing daily doses of the approved medicine Gleevec taken by mouth. The safety

      not achieve a meaningful hematologic or cytogenetic response after 4 cycles or less will be
      discontinued. Otherwise, patients may continue additional cycles of this combined treatment
      for a maximum of 12 cycles.
