      participate in 15-190 study visits,to complete the experimental procedures. These procedures
      have been broken up into "Phases" and will be completed in any order. Phase I and Phase IIa
      includes 2-30 total visits - approximately 2-3 hours each to measure arm and finger strength
      and ability to move. Phase IIb includes 2-30 total visits - approximately 2-3 hours each, to
      measure leg strength and ability to move. Phase IIIa includes up to 40 total visits -
      approximately 2 hours each, the investigator will again evaluate the participant's ability to
      use both arms. The participant will be asked to complete a series of tasks such as stacking
      checkers, turning over cards, squeeze a device to determine how strong their grip is, and see
      how well they are able to feel sensations on the surface of their skin. The investigators
      will complete these assessments at pre-determined times during the study participation. Phase
      IIIb includes up to 40 total visits - approximately 2 hours each, the investigator will again
      evaluate the participant's ability to use both legs. Assessments of the participant's legs
      will include walking around the lab space, how well they can bend their ankles and hips, and
      how well they are able to feel sensations on the surface of the participant's skin.
