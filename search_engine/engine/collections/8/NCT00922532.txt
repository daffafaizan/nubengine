    
      This trial will be a multi-center, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical
      trial. All mothers identified with prolonged rupture of membranes and/or oligohydramnios, and
      all inborn infants < 30 weeks gestational age (GA) at birth will be screened for enrollment.
      Infants who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria within the first 48 hours after birth
      will be randomized to either inhaled NO starting at 20 ppm, or matched placebo, delivered by
      means of a blinded INOventÂ® delivery device. Randomization will be stratified by center and
      treatment will be assigned using an interactive voice or web-based response system (IVRS).
      All infants will receive up to 14 days of therapy, following a dose reduction schedule. The
      primary outcome measure will be change in oxygenation at 1 hour after start of therapy. In
      order to determine the effects of iNO therapy on survival and need for mechanical
      ventilation, cross-over will not be allowed.

      This clinical trial will attempt to demonstrate if pre-term infants may benefit from
      treatment with nitric oxide for inhalation. A multi-center study is necessary to recruit an
      appropriate number of subjects, and to reflect the variability of standard practice across
      the different participating centers. All treatment assignments are blinded in order to
      minimize the risk of bias in treatment and data collection. In addition, a concurrent placebo
      group has been chosen as the most appropriate control group since there may be temporal,
      institutional and national variations in average outcomes. Methemoglobin levels will be
      measured locally and will collected in a blinded manner.
