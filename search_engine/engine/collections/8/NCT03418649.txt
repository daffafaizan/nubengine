    
      Patients with degenerative disc disease, who are recommended to have an epidural steroid
      injection as part of their routine clinical care, will be invited to participate in the study
      prior to their first epidural steroid injection. If they consent, they will complete the
      Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire (version 2) just prior to their first injection which
      captures the functional effects of back pain on various activities, providing a more
      meaningful picture than a simple static pain rating.

      The subjects will complete the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire again four weeks after
      their first injection, a time point at which patients routinely have a follow-up visit.
      Patients referred for a second injection at this time will complete an additional Oswestry
      just prior to that injection. Subjects will be asked to complete additional Oswestry Low Back
      Pain Questionnaires at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year after their epidural injection (or after
      their second epidural injection if this is recommended).

      Prior to receiving study medication (eplerenone or placebo), subjects will provide a blood
      sample to examine their creatinine and potassium levels, to ensure there are no
      contraindications to taking eplerenone.

      In addition to the pain questionnaires, data will be collected from the subjects' medical
      charts regarding basic clinical demographics and clinical outcome of the epidural steroid
      injection.
