      Pilot study to assess feasibility for combining treatment modalities that should be
      synergistic (radiation and thermal ablation).

      Thermal ablation with Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are standard
      treatments for focal neoplasms in the liver.

      High volume or scattered locations of tumor burden results in inability to successfully use
      this technology for a large proportion of patients with hepatic neoplasms.

      Methods to enhance treatment volumes could be advantageous in potentially increasing the
      indications for thermal ablation or the number of patients benefitting from local ablation.

      Primary objective:

      To determine the safety of combining 2 standard therapies (thermal ablation and external beam
      radiation therapy) for liver neoplasms up to 10 cm diameter.

      Eligibility:

      Patients greater than 18 years of age with pathologically proven unresectable primary or
      metastatic hepatic neoplasms

      Patients whose extent of hepatic neoplasms represents approximately less than 60% of total
      liver volume AND whose extrahepatic metastatic disease is determined to be minimal

      ECOG performance status of less than or equal to 2 and a life expectancy of more than 3
      months

      Patients with a history of chemotherapy, radiation therapy to liver, or biological therapy
      must have had last dose/ treatment for at least 14 days prior to starting study treatments.

      Patients must not have an acute, critical illness

      Design:

      Patients will undergo external beam radiation as well as thermal ablation according to
      standard operating procedures of the NCI and NIH CC.

      Patients will be monitored using the standard imaging studies when clinically warranted.

      Patients may be treated with a second (or more) thermal ablation procedure ALONE if it is
      deemed beneficial for the patient by the investigator.

      The sample size will be 10 evaluable patients
