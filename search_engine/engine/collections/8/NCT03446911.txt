    
      An open label randomized exploratory study of the safety and mechanisms of action of combined
      treatment with SBRT and immunotherapy (pembrolizumab, anti-PD1) for early stage NSCLC.

      Intervention:

      Patients will be randomized between SBRT with or without 2 cycles of pembrolizumab treatment
      (starting on the first day of radiotherapy). The patients will undergo a lobectomy with hilar
      and mediastinal lymph node dissection after SBRT +/- pembrolizumab treatment. Translational
      research to explore the immune mechanism of action will include biological imaging with
      immuno-PET (positron emission tomography). Expression rates and activation states of immune
      effector subsets will be assessed in tumor core biopsy specimens, peripheral blood and tumor
      draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) by means of fine needle aspirates of TDLNs.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      To assess the safety of combined SBRT and pembrolizumab treatment in early stage NSCLC and to
      identify the immunological mechanism of action.
