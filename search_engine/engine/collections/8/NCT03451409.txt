      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their siblings using task-based fMRI, resting-state
      functional connectivity, and diffusion MRI approaches. OCD is a chronic disorder presenting a
      high public health burden. Treatment presents a particular challenge because OCD is extremely
      heterogeneous, with clusters of symptoms likely derived from differing neural etiologies.
