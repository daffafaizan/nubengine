      year) motor incomplete traumatic SCI were randomized into real rTMS group (n=14) or sham rTMS
      group (n=14). Real rTMS (20 Hz, a total of 1600 stimuli) or sham r TMS were applied in the
      motor cortex area of lower extremities during 3 weeks (15 sessions). In addition to rTMS
      sessions, patients underwent a rehabilitation program including exercises for strengthening,
      walking and balance. Lower extremity motor score (LEMS), the temporal-spatial gait parameters
      measured by 3D gait analysis, Walking Index for SCI-II (WISCI-II) scale and 10 meters walking
      test were assessed at baseline, 3 weeks (after the treatment sessions) and 5 weeks
      (follow-up).
