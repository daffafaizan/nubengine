    
      This is a multicenter, post-marketing, observational, cross-sectional (single visit) study in
      HIV-infected patients treated with a combination of antiretroviral treatment (ART) containing
      LPV/r 200/50 mg tablets dosed QD for at least 12 weeks to assess the participants'
      satisfaction and adherence level with LPV/r QD ART as measured by specific validated
      participant questionnaires.

      As this is a non-interventional study, the decision to enroll a participant was separate from
      the decision to treat the subject with LPV/r. Prescription of LPV/r and duration of treatment
      were the responsibility of the treating physician.

      In addition, the overall study population was compared to Cohort 2 (394 patients on LPV/r BID
      for â‰¥3 months to <2 years) from KAPITAL2, a post-marketing observational, cross-sectional,
      single visit, multicenter, national study. For further details on this study, please see:
