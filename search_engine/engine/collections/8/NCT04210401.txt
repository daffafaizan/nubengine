      standard of care cleaning and reprocessing. This information will allow us to elucidate the
      number of endoscopic procedures that can be performed using a single duodenoscope until
      microorganisms are cultured from duodenoscopes after standard of care cleaning and
      reprocessing. This will in turn allow us to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients
      undergoing endoscopic procedures.
