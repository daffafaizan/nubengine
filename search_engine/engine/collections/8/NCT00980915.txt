      options once the condition is fully established.Not surprisingly, many treatments targeting
      the mechanisms identified in preclinical studies have failed to improve patient outcomes.The
      most likely reason could be due to inadequate and delayed recognition of patients at risk and
      the subsequent development of the full blown syndrome.ALI/ARDS usually develops during the
      first hours of ICU admission, and often is the very reason for ICU admission.

      Clinical prediction models have been extensively used in the clinical practice to identify
      patients at high risks who may benefit from specific interventions. However, no such tool
      exists to predict the development of ALI in patients at risk. We have recently developed an
      ALI prediction model (Lung Injury Prediction Score:LIPS)which incorporates demographic,
      environmental and clinical characteristics at the time of, and before, hospital admission. If
      validated, this model will serve to find the population of patients at high risk of ALI in
      whom future prevention trials will be conducted. By determining not only patients at high
      risk but also the attributable burden of ALI/ARDS in contemporary cohorts of patients at
      risk, our findings will facilitate the prioritization of preventive strategies and future
      clinical trials.
