    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 in women with
           platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer,
           based on RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors).

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety of the study drug.

        -  To determine the drug pharmacokinetics when administered in multiple weekly injections.

      Exploratory analysis

        -  Clinical Benefit (objective response rate + tumor stabilization).

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS).

        -  Duration of Response.

        -  Overall Survival.

        -  12-month survival rate.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu3S193 IV over 1 hour once weekly in weeks 1-8.
      Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly.
