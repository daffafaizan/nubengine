      criteria, physical evaluation (weight, height, systemic blood pressure) and functional
      capacity to determine the exercise parameters. After will be presented to the four
      interventions, ie the recovery techniques after the exercises favoring their adaptation.
      There will be four resistance exercise sessions followed by interventions with a one week
      interval between each session. Interventions (passive recovery = 1, active recovery = 2,
      recovery with IAF = 3 and recovery with myofascial self-release = 4) will be randomized.
      Functionality assessments will be performed before and one hour after the intervention
      protocol. DOMS will be evaluated 24 and 72 hours after the exercise protocol. Evaluators will
      be blind to interventions.
