    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare progression-free and overall survival of patients with advanced metastatic renal
           carcinoma treated with interferon alfa with or without interleukin-2 and fluorouracil.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (Interferon alfa monotherapy): Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously
           (SC) on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment continues weekly for at least 9 weeks in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (Interferon alfa, interleukin-2, and fluorouracil combination therapy): Patients
           receive interferon alfa SC on day 1 of weeks 1 and 4 and days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2, 3,
           5, 6, 7, and 8. Patients also receive interleukin-2 SC twice daily on days 3-5 of weeks
           1 and 4 and once daily on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2 and 3. Patients then receive
           fluorouracil IV on day 1 of weeks 5-8. Treatment repeats every 10 weeks for up to 2
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 9, 19, and 26 weeks, and then at 8 months.

      Patients are followed at 8, 10, and 12 months, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 670 patients (335 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
