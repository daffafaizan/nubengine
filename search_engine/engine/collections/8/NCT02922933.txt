    
      This is a 3-part study. A total of 204 subjects will be dosed in this study if Parts 2 and 3
      are conducted.

      In Part 1, in Period 1, a single dose of entinostat will be administered. In Period 2,
      multiple doses of omeprazole will be administered for 5 days with a single dose of entinostat
      co-administered. If preliminary results in Period 2 of Part 1 indicate that omeprazole
      exhibits clinically significant drug-drug interaction (DDI) with entinostat, then Parts 2 and
      3 will be conducted. If no DDI interaction is concluded between entinostat and omeprazole in
      Part 1, then neither Part 2 nor 3 will be conducted.

      Part 2 will investigate the effect of multiple doses of famotidine administration on
      entinostat PK. In Period 1, a single dose of entinostat will be administered. In Period 2,
      oral doses of famotidine with a single dose of entinostat co-administered.

      Part 3 will evaluate the effect of an acidic beverage co-administered with entinostat in
      subjects with increased gastric pH due to omeprazole treatment. In Period 1, multiple oral
      doses of omeprazole will be administered with a single dose of entinostat co-administered
      with water. In Period 2, multiple doses of omeprazole will be administered with a single dose
      of entinostat co-administered with an acidic beverage.

      In all parts, PK samples will be taken.
