1520. multiplication of bacteriophagesthe reproduction of bacteriophages requiresthe participation of bacterial metabol-ism.  synthesis of the viral protein componentsis accomplished by the same me-chanism as ordinarily produces bacterialproteins; however, for the synthesis ofnucleic acids (dna or rna) enzymes maybe required which are not present in non-infected bacteria; their formation is theninduced by the virus itself.  the fundamentalbiological processes of replication, transcriptionand translation are discussed inthis context.
