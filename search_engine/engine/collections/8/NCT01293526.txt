      automatically recognize and stop rapid, harmful heart beats and allow the heart to return to
      a safe, regular heart rhythm. The CRT-D device may help the heart pump more efficiently by
      improving the timing of different parts of the heart beat. A CRT-D device has three leads
      (wires that go to the heart). One lead is placed in one of the top chambers of the heart
      (right atrium), another lead is placed in the lower right chamber (right ventricle) and the
      third lead is placed along the side of the left ventricle. The top chambers are stimulated
      first, either by the natural heartbeat or by the CRT-D device if the heartbeat is too slow.
      Shortly after that, the bottom chambers are stimulated. By pacing the heart in this way, the
      doctor hopes to improve the timing of different components of the heart beat in order to
      improve the efficiency of the heart and to improve the patient's heart failure symptoms. The
      purpose of this study is to correlate the three lead placement possibilities and the
      responses from the patient's heart. This will be done with the help of an echocardiography
      and SonR signals, which is an external device that is capable of detecting sounds created by
      the heart.

      Based on the CRT implant, special measurements will be made to optimize the placements of the
      device leads. Based on the success of those measurements and a patient's own response, the
      patient will be placed into one of three groups.

      Group 1: Patients with no response

      Patients with a successful response will be randomized to:

      Group 2: Lead placement based on study measurements

      OR

      Group 3: Standard lead placement
