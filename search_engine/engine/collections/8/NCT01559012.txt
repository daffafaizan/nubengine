      Ethics. The study has been approved by our local Ethics Committee and women are requested to
      sign an informed consent. No pharmaceutical company is involved in any phases of the trial
      including protocol design, study conduction, coordination and monitoring, data handling and
      analysis.

      Randomization. The patients are allocated to a random list to receive first placebo and then
      TD clonidine or the other way round.

      Blinding. Neither the patients nor their attending caregivers know the order of
      administration . The outcome assessors are blinded as well.

      Treatment.The patients are randomly treated with and without TD clonidine for 2 consecutive
      periods of 5 days , other antiemetic drugs (promethazine, metoclopramide, ondansetron) and
      anti- reflux drugs (ranitidine, omeprazole) being administered on a scheduled or as-needed
      basis. All patients receive intravenous hydration and supplementation with thiamine.

      Assessment. Physical condition of patients are assessed daily: blood pressure (lying and
      standing), body weight, morning ketonuria. Two different clinical self administered scores as
      PUQE (Pregnancy Unique Quantification of Emesis) and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) are employed
      to check daily the intensity of symptoms and the sense of wellbeing. The consumption of
      antiemetic and anti-reflux drugs administered in the two periods is monitored .
