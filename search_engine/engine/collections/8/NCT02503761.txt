      combat the increased resistance and decreased development of antibiotics. Efforts were
      exerted to maximize antibiotic efficacy by optimal dosing based on pharmacodynamic and
      pharmacokinetic properties of antibiotics.

      Meropenem is administered mostly via a 30-min infusion, as some data indicate rapid
      degradation after reconstitution. Dose recommendations from two pediatric studies using Monte
      Carlo simulation have emphasized that a 4-h infusion may be needed if microorganisms showed
      increased minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), more specifically, for Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. A prolonged-infusion strategy has not been tested in neonates, although some data
      suggest that extremely small infusion volumes may significantly affect the drug amount
      actually delivered.

      Aim of work:

      The objective of our study is to compare the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of
      conventional intermittent dosing of meropenem to the prolonged infusions in critically-ill
      neonates, with a proactive focus on reducing ventilator days in ventilated patients, length
      of stay in NICU, and neonatal mortality.
