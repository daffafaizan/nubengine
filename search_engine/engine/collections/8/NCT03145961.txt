    
      Patients will undergo blinded serial ctDNA screening every 3 months from the point of
      registration and completion of primary treatment for their triple negative breast cancer. If
      a ctDNA positive result occurs on or before their 12 month ctDNA screening assessment they
      will be randomised by the Institute of Cancer Research Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit
      (ICR-CTSU) in a 2:1 ratio to the pembrolizumab treatment arm or observation arm. The patient
      and their treating team will only be informed of the randomisation if they are allocated
      treatment.

      Patients without a positive ctDNA result within 12 months of starting ctDNA screening, will
      not be randomised but will continue to have blinded ctDNA screening every 3 months up to 2
      years from starting ctDNA screening.

      All patients will be followed up every 6 months until recurrence, specific withdrawal of
      consent for follow up, or until sponsor advises no further follow up is required.
