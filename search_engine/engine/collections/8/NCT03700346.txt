      microdialysis (MD) is a bedside technique that can monitor tissue metabolic changes. We
      conducted this study aiming to assess the performance of muscle Lactate and lactate to
      pyruvate (L/P) ratio clearance in predicting mortality in septic shock patients by using
      microdialysis.

      Interstitial tissue concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol were obtained
      at baseline and every 6 hours for 3 days by using muscle microdialysis. Clearances of muscle
      lactate, and L/P ratio were defined as the percentage change in muscle lactate level or L/P
      ratio compared to baseline (H0) values. A positive value of clearance means a decrease in the
      rate of the parameter under study.
