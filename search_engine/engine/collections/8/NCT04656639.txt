    
      -  Primary objective: to compare the diagnostic performance of conventional imaging vs
           combination of conventional imaging and DW MRI for detection of multifocal, multicentric
           and contralateral breast cancer in patients planning for breast conservation surgery.

        -  Secondary objective: to compare the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced MRI vs
           combination of contrast-enhanced MRI and DW MRI for detection of multifocal,
           multicentric and contralateral breast cancer in patients planning for breast
           conservation surgery.

        -  This is a multicenter, intraindividual comparative cohort study.

        -  A total of 624 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer will be enrolled in this study.

        -  Each eligible woman with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer will undergo digital
           mammography, whole-breast US, and contrast-enhanced MRI and DW MRI at a 3T MR scanner.

        -  Conventional imaging, contrast-enhanced MRI and DW MRI will be interpreted independently
           according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) and likelihood of
           malignancy (Score range, 0%-100%) by trained radiologists.

        -  Multifocal breast cancer is defined as presence of more than 2 separate (>0.5 cm) foci
           of breast cancer in the same quadrant or within 5 cm of the primary lesion.

        -  Multicentric cancer is defined as two or more synchronous ipsilateral neoplasm located
           in different quadrant or beyond 5 cm from the primary lesion.

        -  BI-RADS final assessment score of 4 or 5 are considered to be positive.

        -  Pathology of core or surgical biopsy and 1 year follow up is the reference standard.
