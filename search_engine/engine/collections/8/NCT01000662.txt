      over 500 patients (NYU 03-30 and NYU 05-181) and has shown excellent tolerance, and results.
      Arm 2 evaluates a Weekend Boost Dose (WBD) regimen which may have a radiobiological advantage
      by counteracting tumor repopulation which can occur over the weekend break. At the time of
      registration in the study, patients will be randomized to either treatment arm and stratified
      according to pre or post-menopausal status and on previous chemotherapy received or not.
