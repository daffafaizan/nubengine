      clinical means only, objective parameters for specific GvHD assessment are highly desirable.
      Criteria for appropriate GvHD biomarkers have recently been defined, thereby stating that
      suitable validated markers for monitoring of chronic GvHD are still lacking. CK18-F is the
      first marker that mirrors the pathogenetic endpoint of GvHD i.e. GvHD-induced apoptotic
      activity in critical epithelial organs (bowel and liver). It represents a new class of GvHD
      markers which are complementary to the previously recognized immune activation parameters and
      might thereby be valuable for establishing serological signatures diagnostic for GvHD. This
      marker may allow distinguishing active GvHD from irreversible end organ damage and other
      clinical conditions commonly observed after transplant.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in the clinical
      management of hepato-intestinal GvHD may be based on the measurement of CK18-F levels.
