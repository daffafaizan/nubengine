    
      Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT), or inherited peripheral neuropathies, are among the most
      frequent heritable disorders, affecting approximately 1 in 2500 people. The most frequent
      genetic form of CMT is CMT1A. CMT1A is caused by a 1.4 Mb duplication within chromosome
      17p11.2 in the region containing the PMP22 gene. Most subjects with CMT1A have a "typical"
      phenotype characterized by onset in childhood or early adulthood, distal weakness, sensory
      loss, foot deformities and absent reflexes. How increased expression of PMP22 causes these
      disabilities is unknown but is currently being investigated in both animal and tissue culture
      systems. In this study, researchers will evaluate whether ascorbic acid (Vitamin C),
      administered orally, slows clinical progression of CMT1A and affects the PMP22 mRNA levels of
      myelinated peripheral nerve fibers obtained from biopsies of glabrous skin.
