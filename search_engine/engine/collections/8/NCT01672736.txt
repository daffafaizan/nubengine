      on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle combined with ASP7487 (OSI-906) dosed twice daily
      orally continuously. The combination of ASP7487 (OSI-906) with bortezomib has not previously
      been tested. The active agent bortezomib will be used during Cycle 1 - 8 at the recommended
      treatment dose of 1.3 mg/m2 days 1, 4, 8 and 11 and Cycles 9+ on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a
      5-week cycle and ASP7487 (OSI-906) will be dose escalated form 75 mg to 150mg utilizing 3+3
      design
