    
      In this 3-year study project, we will design a single-blind randomized controlled trial (1)
      to compare the treatment effects of home-based MTOT with a hospital-based MTOT group and a
      hospital conventional rehabilitation group, (2) to investigate the feasibility, satisfaction,
      and safety of this home-based program, and (3) to identify the factors that might influence
      treatment outcomes. An estimated total of 90 patients with stroke will be recruited in this
      study. All participants will be randomly assigned to receive home-based MTOT or
      hospital-based rehabilitation for a 4-week training period (a total of 12 sessions). Before
      the first treatment session, a client-centered questionnaire will be administered to each
      patient for identifying individual needs and goals. Feasibility evaluation and caregiver's
      wellbeing will be also assessed. Outcome measures will be conducted at baseline, immediately
      after treatment, and 3 months follow-up.
