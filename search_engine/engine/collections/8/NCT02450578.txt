    
      This study follows the First In Human dose-escalation study of DSM265 (25 - 800 mg of DSM265)
      and an Induced-Blood Stage Malaria Challenge study (150 mg of DSM265) conducted in healthy
      adult volunteers in Australia. After identification of efficacious DSM265 plasma
      concentrations in the Induced-Blood Stage Malaria model, the current study will evaluate the
      efficacy of DSM265 as a causal prophylactic in a standardized and validated Human Challenge
      model using direct venous inoculation of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, vialed Plasmodium
      falciparum sporozoites (Challenge).

      Three sequential cohorts of healthy male and women volunteers, of non-childbearing potential
      or of childbearing potential with predefined accepted methods of contraception, are planned
      in order to investigate three preventive conditions with regard to administration of DSM265.
      Preventive administration of the study drug will occur 1 and 7 days before inoculum of
      Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite Challenge, with a last cohort administered at a time point
      to be determined from the 2 previous cohorts but which will not exceed 28 days before the
      challenge. The study will also include a cohort where subjects will be treated with
      atovaquone-proguanil (MalaroneÂ®) using the approved regimen for chemoprophylaxis.
