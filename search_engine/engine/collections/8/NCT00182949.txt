      thousands of years ago, with very little immigration from outside during that entire period.
      SardiNIA is a longitudinal study designed under the assumption that in highly interrelated
      population, such as the Sardinians, discovering the genetic factors that predispose
      individuals to disease and to other physiological characteristics is easier and more
      cost-effective. Thus far, group of 6,148 participants from a cluster of 4 towns in the
      Ogliastra region (Lanusei, Ilbono, Elini, and Arzana) has been assessed for about 100
      quantitative traits, including a range of traits related to heart disease, features of
      personality, frailty, cognition and several blood tests (see Table 1). The DNA from all
      participants has been analyzed (genotyped) to look for variants of genes that are involved in
      determining the traits. Up to now, at least one gene has been discovered for each trait,
      including genes specific for levels of uric acid, fetal hemoglobin, cholesterol, etc. The
      analyses of genes are continuing, and are being extended to additional traits In addition, to
      improve the longitudinal perspective of the study, participants will be followed to detect
      the development on new health-related events or outcomes . This is done in 3 ways: 1) looking
      at genetic factors determining rates of change of levels of traits like blood pressure with
      age, based on repeated measures in currently ongoing second visits and planned third visits;
      2) seeing which participants do or do not contract particular diseases, to test whether the
      genes discovered that affect risk factors can help to predict related health problems; and 3)
      comparing the DNA of disease-free participants in the study to DNA from Sardinian patients
      affected by particular diseases, to see if the genes already found or additional ones
      uncovered by the comparisons are involved in those diseases By looking at the development of
      outcomes, the SardiNIA project (called ProgeNIA for the population) further improves our
      understanding of the genetic factors involved in age-associated diseases and disorders. Those
      genes may then provide possible points of intervention that may yield routes to prevention of
      the diseases.
