      morbidity and mortality. Although smoking rates have decreased in high income countries,
      these trends have not been noted for tow and middle income countries. This is especially true
      in Turkey, which was ranked 6th in the world in smoking consumption. Between 51-63% of
      Turkish men and 24-26% of Turkish women 15 years of age and older are smokers. With lung
      cancer the leading cancer-related cause of death for both men and women, effective and
      accessible smoking cessation interventions are needed. Cell phone technology represents a
      unique opportunity to deliver evidenced-based smoking cessation behavioral treatments through
      a delivery mechanism already widely adopted by adults. An estimated 35 million Turks were
      using cell phones, making them 1.8 times more common than land lines. Cell phone
      interventions are a unique delivery method because of their 'always on' capability. The rapid
      uptake of cell phones allows us to potentially reach those who might otherwise not utilize
      smoking cessation services.

      We designed and evaluated SMS Turkey, an evidenced-based smoking intervention that takes
      advantage of technologies adopted by adult smokers in Turkey. The primary outcome measure is
      sustained abstinence 12 weeks after quit day, confirmed with a carbon monoxide (CO) reading
      of 8 ppm or less. Sustained abstinence was defined as 5 or fewer cigarettes smoked since the
      quit date, per West et al. Secondary outcome measures included: 7-day and 30-day point
      prevalence of smoking behavior at 3 months; CO-verified 7-day point prevalence at 4 weeks;
      and reduction in cigarettes per day for those who are smoking at 3 months.
