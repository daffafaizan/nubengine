    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study is designed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of amifampridine phosphate in patients with MuSK-MG. In
      addition, a sample of AChR-MG patients will be assess for efficacy and safety of
      amifampridine phosphate. Planned duration of participation for each patient is at least 38
      days, excluding the screening period. Eligible patients will be titrated to an efficacious
      dose of amifampridine phosphate and those who demonstrate improvement will be randomized to
      either placebo or amifampridine, in a double-blind fashion, for 10 days.
