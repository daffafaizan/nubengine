      key measures at baseline and at 4 and 12 weeks of therapy:

      Primary Aims - to test the hypotheses that armodafinil therapy at 150-250 mg every morning:

        -  will result in improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth
           Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) (Aim 1A)

        -  will result in improvement in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease
           Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog) (Aim 1B)

        -  will result in improvement in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinician's
           Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) (Aim 1C)

        -  will be well-tolerated with no significant side-effects present (Aim 1D)

      Secondary Aims - to test the hypotheses that armodafinil therapy at 150-250 mg every morning
      will result in improvement in:

        -  cognition as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and other focused
           neuropsychological tests (Aim 2A)

        -  neuropsychiatric morbidity, particularly apathy, depression, visual hallucinations, and
           delusions, as measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (Aim 2B)

        -  functional status as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of
           Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) (Aim 2C)

        -  patient and caregiver quality of life (QOL) as measured by the linear analog scale
           (LASA) (Aim 2D)
