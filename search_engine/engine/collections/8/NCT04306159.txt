      rectus sheath block combined with general anesthesia was more effective in reducing pain
      scores and opioid consumption compared with general anesthesia alone. However, there was no
      statistically significant difference in supplementary fentanyl during operation. Besides
      adequate pain relief around incisions, blunting visceral traction response has also an
      important role in hemodynamic stability.With the evidences for a potential mechanism for the
      antinociceptive effects of propofol on visceral nociception and dexmedetomidine combined with
      oxycodone can provide good visceral analgesia, the investigators supposed that visceral
      nociception was well suppressed by adequate antinociceptive drugs. The propofol combination
      with dexmedetomidine may had significant effect on the reduction of the sympathoadrenergic
      tone with decrease of blood pressure and heart rate.
