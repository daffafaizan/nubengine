      double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy
      of Sativex in subjects with symptoms of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Eligible
      subjects entered a seven day baseline period. Subjects then returned to the centre for
      randomisation and dose introduction. Visits occurred at the end of treatment weeks two, six,
      ten and at the end of the study (treatment week 14) or earlier if they withdrew.
