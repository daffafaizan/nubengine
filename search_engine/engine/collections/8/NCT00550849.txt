    
      RTA 402 is a synthetic triterpenoid that is designed to suppress oxidative stress and
      inflammatory processes that play a significant role in a wide variety of diseases. It is a
      potent suppressor of inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress plays a role in the
      pathogenesis of hepatitis, and RTA 402 has demonstrated activity in a preclinical model of
      hepatitis, in addition to other models of inflammation.

      This is a 28-day, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study. It is anticipated that a total of 3
      groups of 8 patients each will be enrolled, in which 6 patients in each group will be
      randomized to receive RTA 402, and 2 patients per group will be randomized to placebo (3:1).
      Patients will receive treatment daily for 14 days with a starting dose of 5mg, 25mg, or 50mg.
      Patients will return for follow up visits on Days 16 and 21, and complete end of study
      procedures on Day 28.
