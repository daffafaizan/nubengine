      mean change in amblyopic eye Best Corrected Visual Acuity from baseline with Luminopia One
      ("therapeutic") to refractive correction ("control"). One-hundred and forty participants (n =
      140) aged 4-7 years will be enrolled. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the "therapeutic
      group ", to use Luminopia One, or the "control group", to undergo continued refractive
      correction, for 12 weeks of treatment.
