      high prevalence of heparin use. The diagnosis of HIT in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) is
      problematic due to the lack of reliable diagnostic method. No gold standard currently exists
      and the definitive diagnosis is mainly based on the detection of heparin-dependent
      platelet-activating antibodies by ELISA method, on the platelet serotonin release assay (SRA)
      and on the changes of the blood platelet count after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.
      As a result, no early definitive diagnosis could be done. This could expose patients to
      thrombotic complications related to the HIT or hemorrhagic complications related to the
      alternative anticoagulant prescribed. This complications can threaten the prognosis of these
      patients. Particle gel immunoassay and automated immunoassay has been proposed for the early
      diagnosis of HIT in medical critically ill and non-critically ill patients. Many authors
      suggest that the accuracy of these immunological methods for the diagnosis of HIT could be
      altered in surgical patients, but these tests has never been specifically evaluated in this
      population. The 4Ts and the HIT Expert Probability (HEP) score systems sound interesting for
      the diagnosis of HIT. These clinicobiological scores can be easily used by non-expert
      clinicians, but have also never been evaluated in the surgical ICU.
