      from heat moisture exchange (HME) filters connected to patient's endotracheal tubes for
      early, non-invasive detection of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill or
      injured ICU patients. The development of pneumonia during mechanical ventilation is the most
      common healthcare-associated infection in severely injured patients, accounting for
      substantial morbidity, excess ICU and hospital stay, additional cost and increased mortality.
