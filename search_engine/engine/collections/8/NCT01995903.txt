      obstacle to making a timely intervention to help patients suffering from this fatal disease.
      We envision a future in which neuroimaging techniques will be a critical tool in the
      diagnostic work-up of ALS. Advanced neuroimaging techniques offer great potential in
      identifying central nervous system metabolite and cellular alterations in ALS. We propose an
      innovative approach to combine complementary advanced MRI techniques to interrogate brain
      chemistry (MRS), brain microstructure (DTI) and brain function (fcMRI) and develop a
      clinically relevant discriminatory disease model.
