      holds true for quality of life, even several years after remission. This altered quality of
      life, highly subjective, is however, badly evaluated by the family of the patient. This could
      lead to misunderstanding, avec worsen the general physical and mental health of the patient.
      To our knowledge, this theoretical difference of perception has never been evaluated up to
      now. Aims: The aim of our study is to evaluate the difference of perception of the quality of
      life and body image between patients in remission of hypercortisolism, and their caregivers.
      Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the quality of life of the caregivers, the coping
      strategies, and the depression/anxiety parameters of both the patient and the caregiver.
      Patients and methods: the study is Observative, prospective and non-randomized. Inclusion
      criteria will be patients, aged more than 18, with hypercortisolism in remission for at least
      1 year. Self-questionnaires on quality of life, body image, coping, depression and anxiety
      will be provided to the patient and his/her caregiver. Fulfilling will be blind between the
      patient and his/her caregiver. Inclusion period will be 12 months. Results will be compared
      between the patient and his/her caregiver. Expected results: investigators anticipate that
      some caregivers will have a different perception of the general physical and mental condition
      as stated by the patient. The first time that the quality of life of the caregiver could be
      also altered. Perspectives: This original project might lead to modify the management of
      Cushing's syndrome, by considering both the patient and his/her caregiver on a long term
      basis after remission.
