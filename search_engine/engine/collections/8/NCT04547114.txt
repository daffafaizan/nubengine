      MCC-IMS in the context of SARS-CoV-2 detection from PCR- proven infected and non-infected
      subjects.

      Therefore nasal breath will be aspirated for 10 seconds during normal respiration by a foam
      cuffed oxygen catheter connected via a 0.22Î¼m filter and a line into the MCC-IMS and directly
      analyzed without any pre-analytic procedures.

      The during the proof-of-concept study derived significant peaks for volatile organic
      compounds will be used for discrimination in a point-of-care approach.
