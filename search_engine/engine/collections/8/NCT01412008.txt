      diverse disorders, including functionally significant, focal spasticity in the arm and leg of
      persons with injury/disease of the central nervous system. Spasticity is an involuntary
      muscle stiffness that limits movement of an extremity and often leads to pain, hygiene
      problems, difficulty in bed or wheelchair positioning, and functional deficits in self-care
      and mobility.

      There are three BT products on the market: MyoBloc®, Botox®, and Dysport®. FDA approval for
      use of Botox® in spasticity is anticipated sometime during 2010. In the Weill Cornell
      Division of Rehabilitation Medicine alone, nearly 50,000 units of Botox® were injected for
      the treatment of spasticity during the 2008-2009 academic year. (Note: The vast majority of
      the BT market share in the US rests with Botox®.)

      There is excellent evidence supporting the effectiveness of BT in decreasing tone and modest
      clinical evidence supporting functional improvement. Despite the frequent use, however, there
      is astonishingly little evidence delineating the impact on diffusion of dosing, dilution,
      approach to muscle localization, or serotype of BT. To better study these relationships we
      will be using advanced imaging to develop a model to characterize the physical
      characteristics of BT diffusion in human skeletal muscle.
