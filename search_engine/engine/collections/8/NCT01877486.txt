      ablation procedures. In patients with paroxysmal AF, pulmonary vein isolation alone is
      usually sufficient. The cryoballoon is now FDA approved to achieve PVI in patients with
      paroxysmal AF.

      Although no ablation system is yet approved in patients with persistent AF, these patients
      are increasingly undergoing ablation. Many investigators feel that these patients have more
      atrial disease and thus PVI alone is insufficient in these patients. As a result, it is
      common for these patients to undergo additional ablation, which is often quite extensive and
      exposes patients to proarrhythmia. Commonly utilized strategies include linear lesions (left
      atrial roof; mitral isthmus line), ablation of complex fractionated atrial electrograms
      (CFAEs), left atrial appendage isolation and/or even right atrial ablation. For years, the
      investigators have been concerned about the adverse effects of this additional ablation. The
      investigators postulated that the "answer" is not more ablation but trying to "reverse
      remodel" patients with persistent AF back to a paroxysmal form, whereby PVI alone would again
      be justified and sufficient. The efficacy of such a strategy has previously been
      demonstrated.

      In brief, the investigators start patients with persistent AF on dofetilide 3 months prior to
      scheduled ablation. In 96% of patients, AF either suppresses completely or is transformed
      into a paroxysmal pattern. The net effect is "reverse remodeling" of the left atria. The
      investigators have confirmed this by using a reduction in P wave duration as a surrogate of
      remodeling. At the ablation procedure, the investigators perform PVI alone.
