      regressions in relapsed low-grade lymphoma. B-cell malignancies express a unique antigen, the
      immunoglobulin idiotype (Id), on their surface. Each B-cell harbors a unique genetic sequence
      used in the production of immunoglobulin idiotype. B-cell lymphomas arise from the clonal
      expansion of a single B-cell and all tumor cells express that unique Id protein. No normal
      B-cells possess that Id on their cell surface. Hence, Id protein should serve as an ideal
      target for individualized active immune therapy of NHL. Many of the antigens expressed by
      tumors (including Id) are only weak immunogens. To augment the immune response against Id,
      the Id protein must be chemically coupled to a strongly immunogenic protein. Keyhole limpet
      hemocyanin (KLH) is a commonly used protein carrier capable of augmenting the body's immune
      reaction against Id protein. While initial studies reported a predominately humoral
      (antibody) response, cellular immunity (T-cells) also plays a critical role in anti-tumor
      immunity. GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor that stimulates T-cell proliferation.
