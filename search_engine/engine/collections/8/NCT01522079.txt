      with spinal muscular atrophy. Air stacking is a clearance airway technique frequently used
      but its effects on cardiac autonomic function in patients with spinal muscle atrophy is not
      clear.

      Objective: To evaluate the acute effect of air stacking and posture on cardiac autonomic
      function in patients with spinal muscular atrophy types II and III.

      Methods: Patients with spinal muscle atrophy type II and III will be recruited.
      Electrocardiogram signals will be recorded for analyses of heart rate variability during air
      stacking in supine and sitting position. Data will collected before, during and after air
      stacking and will be compared using Anova Repeated Measures or Kruskal-Wallis Anova on Ranks,
      followed by Tukey test. The relationship between heart rate variability indexes and age will
      be evaluated by Pearson correlation. Significant level will be set at 5%.
