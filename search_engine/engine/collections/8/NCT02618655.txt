      incidence has a tendency to rise continuously. The clinical symptoms and laboratory features
      of tick-borne diseases are always of no specific, and the diagnostic methods available, such
      as observing the pathogen after cultivation or by the method of Gimenez、serological tests for
      antibody always can't make a timely diagnosis, especially in the early period of the disease.
      The development of polymerase chain reaction(PCR) has been applied for pathogen detection,
      and showed high sensitivity and specificity,and may contribute to early diagnose，but no
      standardized method of PCR has been as yet proposed. This study mean to explore several
      laboratory diagnoses to find out which will be more helpful for making an accurate diagnosis
      in the early period of TBDs.
