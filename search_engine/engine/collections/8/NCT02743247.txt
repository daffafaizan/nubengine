      1,000mg; 2) single dose of tacrolimus 5mg; 3) single dose of mycophenolate mofetil 1,000mg
      and tacrolimus 5mg. All subjects have one week of washing period between single dose
      administration. Blood samples are drawn up to 72 hours after drug administration. Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms known to result in pharmacokinetic variability of study drug are
      also investigated. Drug interaction is going to be assessed through the ratio of area under
      the concentration curve of one drug in the presence or absence of another drug.
