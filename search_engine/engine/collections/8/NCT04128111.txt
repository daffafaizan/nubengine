      and mostly treated on stage, type, excess and deficiency.The phenotype was numerous and more
      classified from inflammation type, clinical classification, internal phenotype, etc.The
      flammatory phenotype was the more common type.The pathological basis of asthma was closely
      related to the infiltration of inflammatory mediators such as Airway eosinophil cells, so it
      was important to find the specific biomarker. The correlation between TCM syndrome,
      inflammatory phenotype and its biomarker wsa not clear. So we put forward theoretical
      hypothesis:There was of correlation between TCM syndrome and inflammatory phenotype of
      asthma.The biological target was contributes to the confirmation for TCM syndrome and
      inflammatory phenotype.The following research was planned to be carried out: relying on the
      registration system of National TCM Clinical Research Base to enroll in 900 cases patients in
      the acute and remission period of asthma and healthy physical examination crowd, filling in
      the patient's general demographic data, disease status, lung function, TCM syndrome and score
      and collecting the sputum, exhaled gas, urine, peripheral venous serum specimens and
      biomarker to be tested on the same day. Based on the clinical research database, confirming
      syndrome and in phenotype, clarifying the correlation between syndrome and phenotype and
      selecting identifiable biomarker by using correlation analysis, principal component analysis,
      multiple regression analysis, neural network analysis and other methods.The research provided
      evidence for the study of the essence of syndrome and phenotype and provided evidence for
      individualized diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
