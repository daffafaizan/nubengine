      There is an important relationship between the PTH release and vitamin D receptor for
      controlling hormonal systems. Also calcium-sensing receptor plays a crucial role in
      regulating parathormone secretion which means controlling the calcium-dependent systemic ion
      homeostasis.

      Cold ischemia protects organs and tissues by slowing their metabolism. The cold ischemia of
      the transplant tissue is a very important process. The University of Wisconsin (UW) solution
      substantially improves graft preservation and consequently increases patient survival. The
      researchers newly developed NPTS for transportation of parathyroid glands.

      For the comparision the researchers measured the parathyroid cell viability and the calcium
      sensing and vitamin D receptor density of the parathyroid cells at the 0, 6, 12 and 24 hours
      of cold ischemia.
