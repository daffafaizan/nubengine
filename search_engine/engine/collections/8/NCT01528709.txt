      surgical coronary revascularization. However, recent studies have illustrated that even more
      intensive lipid reduction with high-dose statins can further improve cardiovascular outcomes.
      Targeting LDL levels to 70 mg/dL after CABG with intensive statin therapy may prevent the
      process of postoperative saphenous vein graft disease and lead to improved graft patency.
      Therefore, in the ACTIVE Trial, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing
      high-dose (80 mg atorvastatin) to moderate-dose (10 mg atorvastatin)statin therapy in
      patients undergoing CABG with saphenous vein grafts. The effect of aggressive cholesterol
      therapy on the process of vein graft disease will be examined with computed tomography (CT)
      coronary angiography one year after CABG. This study will address the subject of
      postoperative high-dose statin therapy and help determine the optimal lipid-lowering strategy
      following CABG.
