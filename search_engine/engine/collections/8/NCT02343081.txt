    
      Prospective, randomized, two-period, two treatment, two-way crossover bioequivalence study of
      two Temozolomide oral formulations (Dralitem vs. Temodal), in primary Central Nervous System
      tumor patients under fasting conditions. Open label to the patients and investigators and
      blind to the bioanalytical and clinical laboratories.

      Study plan: days -21 to 0 (Recruitment period); days 1 to 5 (Treatment period); days 6 to 21
      (Safety surveillance period). Sample size: 24 patients will be randomized. The patients will
      be administered Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 on the first two days (Dralitem) of the treatment
      cycle.

      They will be admitted to the study clinical site on the evening of day 2. In the morning of
      day 3 they will be randomized into two groups of equal size. According to the assigned random
      number, each subject will receive a single oral dose of Temozolomide 200mg/m2 from either
      Monte Verde Sociedad Anónima (SA) product (Dralitem) or from Schering-Plough product
      (Temodal). The single dose of 200 mg/m2 will be reached with three different Temozolomide
      capsule strengths: 20, 100 and 250 mg. Drugs will be administered with 200-240 ml of water in
      semi-sitting upright position.

      The following day (day 4) each subject will receive an oral dose of Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 of
      the product that did not receive the day before. On days 3 and 4 after drug administration,
      blood samples will be obtained for pharmacokinetic evaluation. The patient will be discharged
      from the clinical site on day 4 after completion of sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis. On
      day 5, all patients will receive Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 (Dralitem).

      On days 3 and 4, samples of venous blood will be withdrawn from the forearm vein of each
      volunteer at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose) and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5,
      1.75, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 hours post-dose after each period administration.
      The washout period between the treatment arms was 10 hours, on days 3 and 4. Samples will be
      processed according to the validated method MANA (Método Analítico) - PLB (Proyecto
      Laboratorio Bioanalítico) 004 - TEM (Temozolomide) - 01/01. Measurement of plasma
      concentration of Temozolomide was performed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography
      (HPLC) followed by detection by tandem mass spectrometry (MS / MS).

      The area under the curve (AUC) and the Cmax levels of the drug vs. time will be obtained for
      each subject. The resulting values of the logarithmic transformation of these parameters will
      be used for statistical comparisons (mixed effects ANOVA). The limits of the 90% confidence
      interval for the ratio of log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated.
      Bioequivalence criteria: each calculated confidence interval should be within the acceptance
      range from 80.00 to 125.00.
