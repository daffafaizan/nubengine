      region CA was performed on the right side and RF on the left side. CA was administered using
      the beveled end of a 30G ½ needle introduced in the skin in an angle of approximately 30ºC
      and delivered at a velocity of 40 mL/min. The total quantity of CO2 infused was approximately
      20 mL (0,3 to 0,6 mL/kg of patient's body weight) encompassing the whole delimited are. For
      the RF treatment, the epidermal temperature was controlled using an infrared thermometer
      monitored to reach 40ºC and treatment time was of five minutes starting after having reached
      this temperature. Sample collection varied from zero to 120 days after application. The
      samples were then fixed, cut in paraffin (5 µm) and stained with Picro sirus and Weigert.
      Morphological analyses were acquired using a Zeiss Axiophot® microscope, and they were
      processed using Adobe Photoshop®.
