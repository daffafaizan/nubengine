      children or adolescents, and their parents on profiles of eye health, as well as routinely
      available indicators. This includes a series of baselining and follow-up analyses of cohort
      data collected on epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic, and service aspects of eye health
      (e.g., social environment, preventive behaviours, risk factors, knowledge and attitudes,
      health and social care, etc.) and individual-level outcomes (e.g., clinical parameters and
      symptoms, biomarkers, self-reported measures, risk profiles, etc.).
