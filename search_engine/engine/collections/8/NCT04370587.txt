    
      This is a phase 1, open-label, first-in-human study of T3011 monotherapy. The study will be
      conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 Dose Escalation and Part 2 Dose Expansion. The objectives of
      this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of T3011, and to
      determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or the recommended dose(s) of T3011 by Safety
      Review Committee (SRC) to be further examined during Part 2. In both parts, the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), viral shedding, immunogenicity, and clinical activity of
      T3011 will be evaluated. Pharmacodynamics (PD) markers related to T3011 exposure will be
      characterized.

      Part 1 will include up to 4 dose levels (from 1E+6 PFU/mL (plaque-forming unit/milliliter) to
      1E+8 PFU/mL) of 3-6 patients at each dose, enrolling a maximum of 24 patients. Approximately
      30 patients will be enrolled into Part 2 Dose Expansion.
