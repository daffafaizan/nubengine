    
      The goal of this randomized treatment study is to formally compare quality of life in
      patients with at least one pN0 hemi-neck after resection of a squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oral cavity treated with a primary radiation therapy versus a secondary targeted radiation
      therapy approach, to provide a high level of evidence to guide the selection of treatment
      options.

      The study will require a sample size of 90 patients randomized in a 2:3 between the two arms.
      Arm 1 (standard radiation therapy to tumor location and surrounding area) and Arm 2 (targeted
      radiation therapy to tumor location).

      Patients will be followed for a total of 5 years.
