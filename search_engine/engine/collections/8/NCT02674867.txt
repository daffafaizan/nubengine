      infected children, aged 5 to 17 years, followed in centers participating in the ANRS CO10 EPF
      cohort located in Ile-de-France. Eligible children are not necessarily included in the
      cohort. The sample will consist of two age groups of equal size (5-12 years and 13-17 years).

      Patient recruitment will be conducted in the centers of the ANRS CO10 EPF cohort located in
      Ile de France (Paris area). 80 children will be included, previously included or not in the
      ANRS CO10 EPF cohort. Our investigations will involve two blood samples, taken during two
      successive visits of the children in the hospitals where they are usually followed. Finally,
      a third blood sample will be taken during a third visit only for the 10 children
      participating in the substudy of the viral reservoir. All medical data since birth will be
      prospectively collected for children included in the ANRS CO10 EPF cohort, and
      retrospectively collected in the other cases.
