      contributed to early discharge after surgery. As practices move to favor ambulatory surgery
      in total joint arthroplasty changes must be made to postoperative pain and nausea management.
      Spinal anesthesia has been essential in managing associated ambulatory TJA, however, nausea
      and vomiting are known detrimental side effects. The use of systemic steroids has also been
      shown in the literature to reduce pain scores, length of stay, the need for antiemetics, and
      increase the distance of ambulation without increasing the rate of surgical site infection or
      prosthetic joint infection. As more same-day total joint replacement is incorporated into
      practice, an oral alternative may prove beneficial.
