      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of melphalan and lenalidomide in combination with
           prednisone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen. Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a
           dose-escalation study of melphalan and lenalidomide followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral melphalan and oral prednisone daily on days 1-4. Patients
           also receive oral lenalidomide daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of melphalan and lenalidomide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      * Phase II: Patients receive oral melphalan and oral lenalidomide as in phase I at the MTD.
      Patients also receive oral prednisone as in phase I. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.
