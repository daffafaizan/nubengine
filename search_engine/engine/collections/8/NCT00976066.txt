      healthy male volunteers. The degree and time course of μ-opioid receptor occupancy (RO)
      following single oral doses of GSK1521498 will be estimated by [11C]carfentanil displacement.
      Previous pre-clinical and human PET studies indicate that [11C]carfentanil is selective for
      the μ-opioid receptor and can be used to estimate μ-opioid receptor occupancy in vivo.

      The PK/PD relationship between plasma concentrations of GSK1521498 and μ-opioid RO will be
      described. Potential relationships between μ-opioid RO and functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) endpoints, measured in a food reward paradigm, will be assessed as an
      exploratory aim. Additionally, the PK/PD relationships between plasma concentrations of
      naltrexone (a generic μ-opioid receptor antagonist), μ-opioid receptor occupancy, and fMRI
      measures of reward processing will also be investigated.
