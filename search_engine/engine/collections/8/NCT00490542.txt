      subjects will be screened and asked to have a physical and specific safety labs done to make
      sure they can safely participate in the study. After the screening visit, subjects will be
      randomly, like a flip of a coin, placed into one of two groups. One group will get the study
      drug, Geodon. The other group will get placebo, a sugar pill. Neither the doctor nor subject
      will know in which group the subject has been placed.

      Subjects will see the doctor once a week for 6 weeks. During each visit, we will check and
      treat any side effects. We will ask questions about mood and go through a number of rating
      scales and assessments that will look at mood and symptoms. Subjects will also fill out
      questionnaires at each visit to assess their moods and see how the study is going. At the
      final visit, subjects will have the same physical exam and lab tests done as in the initial
      visit.
