      rehabilitation programme with or without tACS. The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the mean
      blood flow velocity (MFV) and Gosling pulsatility index (PI) captured for the middle,
      anterior, and posterior cerebral artery were the outcome measures.

      Fifteen 30-minute sessions of tACS appear to be effective for enhancing post-stroke patients'
      neurological function. The haemodynamic measures taken indicated that the regaining of
      function among the patients was largely attributed to a lowering of the vascular
      autoregulatory activity together with an increase in blood flow velocity at the middle
      cerebral artery. Future studies should explore the underlying mechanisms mediating the
      positive effects brought about by tACS in post-stroke rehabilitation.
