      severe than in adults. Although errors happen in each step of medication management process,
      a large proportion of errors occur during medication preparation and administration.

      This study will test the hypothesis that rates of medication errors during preparation and
      administration will be reduced by implementing an education program for NICU caregivers
      (Nurses) and providing convenient tools.

      The trial has a stepped wedge design, in which the NICU's from three hospitals in France will
      be randomized (Group A, B and C) to the timing of implementation of the educational
      intervention.

      According to the allocation (Group A, B or C), the education intervention will include a
      complete main program of nine weeks and one to three maintenance educational periods.

      Medication administration errors rates will be measured before (baseline measurements) and
      after each educational interventions (main or maintenance interventions).

      Errors will be identified by direct observations of nurse's acts by external observers.
