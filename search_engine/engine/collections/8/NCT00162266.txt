      continue in the open-label study. Participants received placebo, Abatacept 2 mg/kg, or
      Abatacept 10 mg/kg in the double-blind study. Participants receiving placebo in the
      double-blind study were switched 1:1 to continued treatment with placebo or Abatacept 2
      mg/kg. Participants receiving Abatacept 2 mg/kg or Abatacept 10 mg/kg continued at the
      double-blind study dosage. After results from the double-blind period became available, all
      participants were switched to a weight-tiered 10 mg/kg dose of Abatacept.
