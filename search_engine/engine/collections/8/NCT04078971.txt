      n=8) or to a western diet (WD n=8). Diets contain the same amount of protein (1.8g/Kg body
      weight/day). Body weight and body composition will be measured by dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Resting energy expenditure
      (REE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), cross sectional area (CSA) and isometric muscle
      strength of quadriceps, counter movement jump (CMJ) and yoyo intermittent recovery test will
      be measured.
