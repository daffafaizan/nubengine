      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) in
      combination with decitabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) II. To define the
      specific toxicities and the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of decitabine plus bortezomib
      combination

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR). II. To determine the rate of complete
      remission (CR) of decitabine plus bortezomib in AML III. To correlate the biological activity
      of decitabine as demethylating agent (changes in target gene methylation and gene expression,
      DNMT1 protein expression, global methylation) with clinical endpoints and plasma
      pharmacokinetics of decitabine.

      IV. To characterize the biological activity of bortezomib as a potential demethylating agent
      V. To correlate intracellular concentration of decitabine-triphosphate with global DNA
      methylation and other biological endpoints as well as clinical response.

      VI. To explore the biologic role of microRNAs in determining clinical response to the
      decitabine plus bortezomib combination and achievement of the other pharmacodynamic
      endpoints.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of bortezomib.

      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-5 or 1-10 and bortezomib
      IV on days 5 and 8 or days 5, 8, 12, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Once the maximum tolerated dose is determined,
      an additional 6 patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 30 days.
