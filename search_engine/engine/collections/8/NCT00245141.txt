        -  Determine the progression-free survival rate in patients with low-risk embryonal
           rhadomyosarcoma treated with a shortened treatment schedule of vincristine,
           dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide with or without radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive vincristine IV, dactinomycin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV. Patients
      may also undergo radiotherapy. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses (total of
      24 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
