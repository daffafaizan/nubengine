      other meats. It is important for the composition and repair of normal cellular membranes,
      normal brain function, and normal cardiovascular function. Research has suggested that the
      presence of adequate amounts of choline during pregnancy and breastfeeding can help ensure
      healthy fetal brain development. Additionally, adequate prenatal choline levels may have
      long-lasting positive effects on cognitive function, including memory. However, sufficient
      research has not been done on the effects of choline on pregnant women and their unborn
      babies. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of taking choline supplements
      during pregnancy, and whether taking choline during pregnancy will have an effect on infant
      development.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo
      or 1250 mg of choline daily throughout pregnancy, until delivery. Vital signs will be taken,
      potential side effects will be assessed, and study medication will be given at each visit.
      Blood samples will be taken at enrollment and approximately at weeks 20, 28, 32. Children
      will be followed and assessed until 4 years of age.
