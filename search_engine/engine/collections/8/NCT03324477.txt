    
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia is common in elderly males, and this group of patients is
      commonly associated with different comorbidities especially of the cardiovascular system ,
      this make them at risk of many intraoperative complications. The associated adverse effects
      arising in both the cardiovascular and nervous systems are known as transurethral resection
      (TUR) syndrome.Therefore TURP patients need meticulous monitoring of hemodynamics and fluid
      therapy.

      This study is designed to investigate the relevance of the timing of hypertonic saline
      administration either as a preload or as a coload on hemodynamic parameters in patients
      undergoing TURP surgeries.

      100 ASA physical status I-III male patients scheduled to electively undergo transurethral
      resection of the prostate under spinal subarachnoid block were included in this study

      Preload group (Group P):

      50 Patients will receive 4 ml/kg of hypertonic saline (NaCL3%) via G14 cannula over 15-20 min
      before the induction of spinal anaesthesia.

      Co-load group (Group C):

      50 Patients will receive 4 ml/kg of hypertonic saline (NaCL3%) via G14 cannula at the maximal
      possible rate at the time of identification of C.S.F .
