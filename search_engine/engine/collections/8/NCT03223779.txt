      portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use
      for further studies. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Trifluridine as a treatment
      option for this disease.

      The FDA has not approved Trifluridine in combination with radiation therapy as a treatment
      option for this disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are determining the safest and most effective dose
      of Trifluridine in combination with radiation therapy in participants with hepatic metastases
      from colorectal cancer.

      Trifluridine stops DNA replication which may prevent the cancer cells from growing. Radiation
      may help to kill the cancer cells while protecting normal tissue cells. Studies have shown
      Trifluridine may make radiation more effective.
