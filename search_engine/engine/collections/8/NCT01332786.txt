      are associated with a poor prognosis. For example, relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a
      highly aggressive and resistant disease, particularly when associated with first complete
      response (CR) duration of less than 12 months. Thus, there is an urgent need for new agents
      in relapsed and refractory hematologic malignancies such as acute leukemia. In elderly
      patients, where the tolerance of aggressive induction therapy is often poor and curative
      options such as bone marrow transplantation HSCT are not available, the need for effective
      non-aggressive drug regimens for AML is even greater.

      Tigecycline is a glycylcycline derivative of tetracycline. Tigecycline is currently indicated
      for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, and complicated
      intra-abdominal infections. This clinical trial is a Phase I dose escalation study of
      tigecycline in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or those with newly diagnosed disease
      not eligible for induction chemotherapy.
