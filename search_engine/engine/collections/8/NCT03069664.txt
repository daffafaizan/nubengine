      the pancreatic tumor causes radiologically visible dilatation of the pancreatic duct
      proximally to the tumor with a minimum diameter of 6mm. Patients also suffer from chronic
      abdominal pain caused by pancreatic cancer. The strength of the pain the patients are
      experiencing is evaluated with visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients in this study report
      experiencing chronic abdominal pain at least the strength of VAS 4 at the time of
      recruitment.

      In this pilot study a total of 40 patients are recruited. Patients are divided into to two 20
      patient groups. First group will receive a pancreatic duct stent followed by pain medication
      if needed and the control group will go with conventional pain relief methods only. All
      patients are asked to evaluate the strength of experienced pain with visual analogue scale at
      the time of recruitment, and then every 4 weeks up to 24 weeks. The patients will also be
      asked to evaluate their quality of life with a standardized EORTC-QLQ C30 version 3 quality
      of life questionnaire at the time of recruitment and then every 4 weeks up to 24 weeks. The
      patients are also asked to report their body weight, and the amount of pancreatic enzyme
      supplements needed at every point of survey.
