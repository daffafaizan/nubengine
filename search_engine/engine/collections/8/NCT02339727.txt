      infants less than 1500 grams and/or less than 32 weeks gestational age, admitted to the
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in the University Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela.
      They were recruited for a period of 14 months (from July 2010 to august 2011) and followed
      from birth until 2 years of life.

      40 children were included and followed in the study. Patients will be assigned randomly into
      two groups depending on the type of formula they are receiving. The group A of children will
      receive a formula supplemented with DHA and ARA with a relationship omega 6/omega 3 = 2. And
      group B will receive other formula with DHA and ARA, but with a ratio of 1/1.

      The classification of group A and B was made by simple random way; one birth in every group,
      continuously.

      Implementation of breastfeeding will be promoted and will be fortified after 7 days of life,
      when the total amount of breast milk will be more than 1/2 of the total.

      When breastfeeding will be insufficient or nonexistent, special formulas for premature babies
      will be given

      During the follow-up of patients, will be measured:

        1. - Levels of fatty acids in blood in the first week of life, 3 months, 6 months and 12
           months.The determination will be carried out in collaboration with the Hospital de
           Cruces, Bilbao, Spain.

        2. - Evaluation of psychomotor development by Brunet-Lezine scale at 2 years of corrected
           age.
