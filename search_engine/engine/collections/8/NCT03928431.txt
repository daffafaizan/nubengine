      directly after birth will halfen the cumulative incidence of Immunoglubulin E
      (IgE)-associated allergic disease at 2 years of age in CS delivered infants, compared with
      non-treated CS-delivered infants.

      The secondary outcomes are to compare the community structure of microbes from mothers and
      their infants and immunological programming of infants delivered via scheduled CS, with or
      without exposure to the maternal vaginal and fecal microbiota, from birth until two years of
      age. The primary and secondary outcomes will also be compared with a reference group of
      vaginally delivered infants. Sex differences in the incidence and prevalence of allergic
      diseases have been described. The anticipated benefit of the intervention can be implemented
      in clinical practice regardless of sex, so that improved conditions for good health are
      created.
