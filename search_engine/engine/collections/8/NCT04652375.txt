      versus lactated Ringer's solution in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery
      and in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery and evaluate the incidence of
      acute kidney injury as a primary outcome. Data will be collected from both EPIC and STS
      (society of thoracic surgeons) database. STS database extracts data from the electronic
      medical record and groups it in specific format to evaluate outcomes after cardiac surgery to
      compare institutional performance to similar institutions and the national average. Patients
      undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or aortic valve replacement will be randomized to
      receive either albumin or lactated Ringer's for fluid resuscitation post-surgery. The
      resuscitation volume will be based on clinical decision after examining all the hemodynamics
      parameters. This practice coincides with standard of care and current practice. All eligible
      patients will be randomly assigned to receive either albumin 5% or lactated Ringer's solution
      in a 1:1 ratio using computer-generated, permutated blocks of 2 - 4. Both solutions will be
      administered intravenously in 250 mL increments at the discretion of the physician until
      hemodynamic parameters are met. The IV infusion bag and IV tubing will be covered using
      opaque bags to allow for blinding.
