      memory task combined with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. TMS will be applied in three
      possible procedures, 1) Online TMS, 2) Offline TMS and 3) Sham TMS. All subjects will be
      given two trials within their one session, one of which will be sham TMS for all subjects and
      another of which will be randomly assigned to either Online or Offline TMS. Trials order will
      be randomly counterbalanced across subjects, who will be blind to the treatment of frontal
      vs. sham TMS (independent variable). Participants will be randomized into either the online
      or offline groups by computer generated lists to ensure equal numbers of participants in each
      condition. Half of the subjects will receive online TMS (online group) and half will receive
      offline TMS (offline group). Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The
      dependent variables will be performance accuracy and reaction time on the working memory
      task. By utilizing online and offline TMS, investigators will be able to explore whether
      frontal cortex is involved transiently in visual working memory or persistently throughout
      the task.
