      stair-stepping and cycling ergometer leg exercise will contribute to an improvement in whole
      body exercise capacity or submaximal exercise endurance in patients with mild congestive
      heart failure. Two groups of 25 patients with mild to moderate CHF, aged 30-70, will be
      trained for 12 weeks. The experimental group will train with pressure cuffs inflated on one
      thigh and lower leg during exercise. The cuff will be applied on alternate legs during
      training, such that each leg has the same duration of ischemic training. The control group
      will train for a similar duration and intensity without pressure cuffs on the legs. Pre and
      post training measures will include VO2peak, exercise duration at 30% VO2peak, 6 minute walk
