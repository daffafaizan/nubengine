      I. To evaluate the toxicity and determine recommended phase II dose of the combination of
      docetaxel and selinexor. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the efficacy as measured by progression
      free survival (PFS) of docetaxel and selinexor in patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous
      cell lung cancer. (Phase I/II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective tumor response rate as determined by radiographic response.

      II. To evaluated the disease control rate (complete response, partial responses, and stable
      disease).

      III. To evaluate the overall survival (OS). IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      single agent selinexor.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Lung cancer genomics sequencing panel. II. Tumor biopsy (baseline and cycle 2). III.
      Plasma cytokine analysis, peripheral blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) on day 1 and selinexor orally (PO) twice daily
      (BID) on days 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, and 15. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 9 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.
