      small joints of the hands, wrists and feet leading to swelling, pain and stiffness in the
      affected joints. The condition is two to three times more prevalent in women than in men.
      Although it might occur at any age, the incidence of the disease is highest between the ages
      of 40 and 65 years. Currently, there is no treatment that provides complete remission of the
      disease for people living with RA. Treatment of RA aims to reduce the symptoms and improve
      the health of the patient. Although diet is not part of the mainstream treatment, many
      studies have reported beneficial effects of certain diets on RA symptoms. The MEDRA study
      will examine the habitual dietary intakes of people living with RA in Ireland and will
      explore whether people with RA will benefit from either a Mediterranean dietary pattern or
      the Healthy eating guidelines in Ireland. It is important to conduct this pilot study in
      order to observe if people with RA can adhere to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and whether
      the intervention will have beneficial impact on the health status and quality of life. This
      is important work prior to proceeding to larger intervention studies.
