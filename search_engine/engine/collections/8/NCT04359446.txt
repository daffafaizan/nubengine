      stent once it has been implanted unless severe calcification.

      The investigators propose a study that serves as proof of concept for this technology (laser
      Excimer) used according to its intended use in this specific substrate of coronary lesions.
      (stent under-expansion without severe underlying calcification).The laser-excimer technology
      achieves a greater minimum luminal area when treating an infra-expanded stent, when compared
      with the results obtained with the simple dilatation at high or very high pressure.
