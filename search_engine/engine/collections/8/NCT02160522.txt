      are not currently in use at our institution's Emergency Department. This prospective cohort
      study will endeavor to determine the incidence of unacceptably high ETT cuff pressures in the
      ED, laying the foundation for follow up studies on patient outcomes and the potential need
      for more careful management of intra-cuff pressures in the ED.
