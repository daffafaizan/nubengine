      IV followed by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV. Cycles will continue every 3 weeks until progression or
      intolerable toxicity. Overall 27 patients will be enrolled in the Single Arm Part. If 6 or
      more responses (CR/PR) are observed in this group then the Randomized Part will be initiated.

      In the Randomized Part approximately 200 patients (100 per arm) will be randomized to receive
      SPI-1620 plus docetaxel or docetaxel alone.

      In the experimental arm, patients will receive 11 μg/m2 of SPI-1620 IV followed by docetaxel
      75 mg/m2 IV administered in 3-week cycles until progression or intolerable toxicity. In the
      control arm, patients will receive 75 mg/m2 docetaxel in 3-week cycles until progression or
      intolerable toxicity.
