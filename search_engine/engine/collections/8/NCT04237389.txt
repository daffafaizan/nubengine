      isolation of the pulmonary veins (PV) versus minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgical
      epicardial ablation.

      The patients in both groups will be comparable and have persistant or LSP AF only. Patients
      with previous catheter ablations or any interventions or open heart procedures in the
      anamnesis will be excluded. The catheter ablation will be Ablation Index-guided, which means
      that every ablation point will be taken according to ablation quality marker which corporates
      power, delivery time, contact force (CF), and catheter stability, called Ablation Index (AI).
      Both of the procedures will be performed by a single identical protocol including wide
      complete circumferential ablation around the right and left PVs, and additional lines between
      the lower and upper PVs. The thoracoscopic procedure will be supplemented with removal of
      left atrial appendage (LAA).

      In cases of AF or other atrial tachycardia recurrence after both procedures, every patient
      will undergo the opposite procedure (for example, if patient after thoracoscopic ablation
      will be diagnosed an AF recurrence, he will undergo catheter ablation). That is why there
      will be the third group, the so-called Hybrid procedure group of patients.
