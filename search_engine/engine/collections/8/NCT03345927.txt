      endothelial dysfunction, we plan to enroll approximately 150 patients with high risk of
      cardiovascualr disease,who will be measaured the flow-mediated dilation by B-ultrasound, and
      then use HPLC-MS/MS to measaure the plasma levels of methionine metabolites, such as SAH,
      SAM, and use methylated specifical PCR to detect the promoter DNA methylation of p66shc, and
      use ELISA kits to measure the plasma ROS levels of CVD patients, such as MDA,
      8-iso-prostaglandin F2a, and finally analyze the association between SAH, ROS levels,
      promoter DNA methylation of p66shc, and flow-mediated dilation.
