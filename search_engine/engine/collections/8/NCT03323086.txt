      efficacy, of the BI and technology extenders. At-risk women drinkers (N = 50) recruited from
      a reproductive health care clinic will be assessed, randomly assigned to the integrated BI or
      control (a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-produced brochure with information
      about alcohol and women's health), and reassessed at 3 months to determine impact on alcohol
      use, condom use, and number of partners as well as hypothesized mediators.
