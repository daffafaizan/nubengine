    
      This is a randomized, subject- and investigator-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study investigating the preliminary efficacy and safety of QBW251 administered orally for 12
      weeks in subjects with bronchiectasis. Approximately 72 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either QBW251 or placebo in order to achieve 60 subjects who complete the
      treatment period based on the assumption of a 16% drop-out rate. The sample size assumptions
      will be reviewed in an interim analysis in a blinded manner when approximately 14 subjects
      complete the treatment period.

      The study consists of the following periods: Screening, baseline/Day 1, treatment period, and
      end of study assessments (EOS) visit followed by an additional post-treatment safety follow
      up via phone call. The total duration for each patient in the study is up to approximately 18
      weeks.
