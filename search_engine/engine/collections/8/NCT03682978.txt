    
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a clinically and etiologically heterogeneous
      neurodevelopmental condition affecting approximately 1% of the population. The core symptoms
      of ASD are deficits in social communication and the presence of repetitive and restricted
      behaviours and interests, including sensory anomalies. Currently, there are no effective
      medical treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, and families frequently use costly non
      evidence based interventions. Developing drugs for ASD has been challenging because of a
      limited understanding of its underlying pathophysiology(ies), and difficulties modelling it
      in vitro and in vivo.

      A recent study from EU-AIMS reported, for the first time in ASD, that differences in E-I
      balance can be 'shifted' using a GABA acting drug (riluzole), and that abnormalities in
      functional connectivity can be 'normalised' by targeting E-I, even in adults. This offers
      promise that drugs targeting specific parts of the GABA pathway may improve symptoms.

      The aim of the investigator's project is to conduct a double-blind Randomized Control Trial
      (RCT) focused on GABA/glutamate equilibrium, to assess the efficacy of a drug that targets
      core and/or comorbid symptoms in ASD. Arbaclofen is a selective GABA-B receptor agonist and
      augments GABA-ergic activity, inhibits presynaptic release of glutamate, inhibits
      postsynaptic transmission, and modulates intracellular signalling. Through elevation of
      GABA-ergic inhibitory activity, Arbaclofen may act to alleviate ASD symptoms with social
      anxiety and emotional hyperarousal.

      Hypothesis: Arbaclofen will be superior to placebo in improving social function as measured
      by the Vineland-3 social domain.
