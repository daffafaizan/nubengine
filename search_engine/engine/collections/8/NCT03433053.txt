      all racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Many of the current HIV infections among young
      adult African American women remain undiagnosed. The established benefits of routine HIV
      testing, the limitations of safer sex programs, and the gap of research related to increasing
      HIV testing as prevention necessitates the need for future research that specifically targets
      mechanisms to increase HIV testing. Higher rates of HIV testing can decrease rates of HIV
      transmission, as individuals who are knowledgeable of their status are less likely to
      transmit the virus. The current literature is sparse on factors related to HIV testing among
      young adults and has largely only examined demographic and sexual behavior correlates of HIV
      testing. Additionally, no studies have developed evidence-based health messages to promote
      HIV testing specifically among African American young women, despite their high risk of HIV
      infection and the importance of HIV testing. Thus, the proposed study will intend to identify
      factors related to HIV testing beyond the demographic and sexual risk level through formative
      research. These identified factors will be included as important elements in the development
      of HIV testing messages to motivate increased HIV testing. An enhanced message (culturally
      tailored) and a knowledge only message will be developed and tested.
