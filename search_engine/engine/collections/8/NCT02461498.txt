      participating ED's (up to 33) in England and Scotland after blunt head injury. Over an
      18-month period from Oct 2011, ED attendance data will be collected from each ED as well as
      information from patient questionnaires about the care the patient received and the status of
      their health 6-10 weeks after the injury. Patients who died due to their head injury,
      experienced surgery due to their injury, had a change identified on a CT scan or re-attended
      the ED with a clear head injury complication are defined as experiencing a poor outcome.
      Information such as the patients' conscious state (GCS), level of clotting in their blood
      (INR) and symptoms will be investigated as predictors of a poor outcome. A mathematical model
      will be used to estimate the most cost-effective strategy assuming published National
      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) thresholds for cost per quality adjusted life
      year (QALY).
