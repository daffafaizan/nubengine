    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate, in terms of overall response rate (complete response and
           partial response), of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and
           carboplatin in patients with stage IIIB-IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer who
           are ineligible for treatment with bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To describe the overall survival of these patients.

        -  To describe progression-free survival of these patients.

      Tertiary Objectives

        -  To explore, in a pilot fashion, the activity of this regimen using predictive biomarkers
           including serum SPARC levels, methylation of SPARC in primary tumor samples and serum,
           Ras mutations, ERCC1 and SPARC immunohistochemistry, and serum miRNA expression
           profiles.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30
      minutes and carboplatin IV over 1-2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks or unstained slides and blood samples are collected for
      correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for serum SPARC by ELISA, Ras mutations, ERCC1 AND
      SPARC by immunohistochemistry, and serum miRNA expression profiling.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
