      The raters in group one review the echocardiographies examinations numbered from one to 50
      using LCD monitor of ultrasound machine and review the remaining 50 examinations numbered
      from 51 to 100 using iPhone with CubeView at their first visit The other group firstly review
      echocardiography numbered from one to 50 using iPhone with CubeView and 51 to 100 with the
      LCD monitor.

      They visit twice with an interval of four weeks and review the echocardiography examinations
      using revered devices at each session. They also review abdominal ultrasound images on the
      same plan as reviewing echocardiography.

      When they review the echocardiography, the raters measure the ejection fraction by visual
      estimation (1=obviously normal EF, 2 = probably normal EF, 3 = unsure, 4 = probably reduced
      EF, 5 = obviously reduced EF). In cate of d the abdominal ultrasound, they are instructed to
      rate the likelihood of the presence or absence of appendicitis in each case using a
      five-Likert scale (1 = obvious no appendicitis, 2 = unlikely appendicitis, 3 = unsure, 4 =
      likely appendicitis, 5 = obvious appendicitis).
