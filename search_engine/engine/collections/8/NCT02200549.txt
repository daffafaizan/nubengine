      in the proposed study will be randomly programmed into one of three intervention groups:

        1. Cycle training program alone (performing on calibrated stationary cycle ergometer).

        2. Combined cycle training and inspiratory muscle training(performing on calibrated
           stationary cycle ergometer and threshold loading device).

        3. Neither cycle training nor inspiratory muscle training.
