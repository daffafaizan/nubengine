    
      Participants received 3 doses of CYD dengue vaccine and 2 doses of Gardasil administered
      either concomitantly or sequentially.

      The study activities were put on hold for several months (up to 6 months for some
      participants) to obtain the approval of Protocol Amendment 1 by the competent authorities and
      completed the associated logistic tasks. Due to this protocol amendment as per Independent
      Data Monitoring Committee recommendation, only previously dengue immune participants
      (seropositive for dengue before vaccination) were eligible to complete the vaccination
      schedule. Dengue non-immune participants (seronegative for dengue before vaccination) did not
      receive any additional CYD dengue vaccine injections, but were followed for safety up to 6
      months after the last injection.

      Due to the change in amendment 1, the number of evaluable dengue immune participants at
      baseline did not meet the predefined number of participants that would have allowed for a
      global power of at least 80% for non-inferiority testing of Gardasil vaccine and CYD dengue
      vaccine (121 per group for the co-primary objectives and 194 per group for the secondary
      objectives).

      All participants were assessed for immunogenicity and safety. Safety assessments included
      solicited reactions within 7 or 14 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events
      (AEs) within 28 days after each injection, non-serious AEs of Special Interests (AESIs)
      within 7 days after each injection, and serious adverse events including AESI and
      hospitalized virologically-confirmed dengue cases during the study period.
