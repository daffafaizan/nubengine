    
      60 patients with chronic idiopathic neck pain will be randomly assigned into one of two
      groups: a group receiving visual feedback when performing 10 repetitions of each of neck
      movements (flexion, extension, side-flexion and rotation) and a group performing the same
      task without visual feedback. Participants will be assessed for pain intensity, pain
      location, disability, range of motion, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing and anxiety both at
      baseline and after visual the intervention (i.e., neck movements with and without visual
      feedback).
