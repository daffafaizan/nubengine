    
      To assess the efficacy and safety of local injection of botulinum toxin type B (BTX-B)
      against digital ulcers (DUs) and Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in patients with systemic
      sclerosis (SSc).

      In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigator-initiated clinical trial
      (phase II), 10 patients with SSc and RP-related DUs were randomly and evenly assigned to a
      placebo control group or treatment group taking BTX-B injections. The degree of improvement
      in DU, change in size, number of new DUs, improvement in symptoms of RP, and adverse events
      were recorded.
