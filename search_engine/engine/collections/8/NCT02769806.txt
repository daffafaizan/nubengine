      patients to determine whether novel method improves image quality in tumor regions. We will
      also compare accuracy of pseudoprogression (PsP) vs. early progressive disease (ePD)
      determinations by the two techniques. If successful, the project will culminate in a novel
      imaging method sequence optimized to monitor progression and guide treatment decisions in
      post-operative GBM patients.
