    
      This is an observational, prospective (study following participants forward in time) study to
      assess safety and efficacy of infliximab injection under post-marketing use and identify
      problems related to adverse events in participants with ankylosing spondylitis (chronic
      inflammatory condition affecting the axial joints), rheumatoid arthritis (chronic systemic
      disease, primarily of the joints, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes
      and articular structures), psoriasis (scaly skin rash) and psoriatic arthritis (a type of
      inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis). Participants with rheumatoid arthritis
      will receive 6 doses of infliximab 3 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) as an intravenous
      infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) at Week 0, 2, 6 and
      will be observed for 30 weeks; and those with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and psoriatic
      arthritis will also receive 6 doses of injection and will be observed for 24 to 30 weeks.
      Efficacy will be evaluated by Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI),
      Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Psoriasis Area and Severity
      Index (PASI), swollen joint counts and tender joint count. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
