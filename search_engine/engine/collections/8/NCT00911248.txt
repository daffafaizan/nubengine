      daily treatment with PTC299 administered at 100 mg/dose twice per day for up to 1 year or
      until tumor progression. If no subject responds with tumor shrinkage or an improvement in
      hearing, then the study will be stopped. If â‰¥1 out of 11 subjects respond, then the study
      will proceed to Stage 2 to enroll an additional 14 subjects for a total of 25 subjects.
