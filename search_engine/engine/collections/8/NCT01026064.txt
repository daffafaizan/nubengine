      different cantharidin blister induction/sampling timepoints (challenge options) ranging from
      16/16 hours to 48/48 hours, including the ability to evaluate the acute and resolving phase
      of acute inflammation. In Part A, 4 to 8 healthy male volunteers will be included. This will
      be followed by Part B (in up to 12 subjects), aimed to select the optimum challenge option
      based on the reproducibility of read-outs across two challenge sessions. This option will be
      applied in Part C in up to 24 subjects in order to evaluate the utility of the assay to
      demonstrate anti-inflammatory effects of a standard macrolide (azithromycin). Part C is
      designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Following the first
      cantharidin challenge and blister evaluation, subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive azithromycin or placebo. Skin blister induction and assessment will be repeated
      immediately after treatment completion and, potentially, approximately 3 weeks later. The
      inflammatory response to cantharidin and its modulation by azithromycin will be evaluated by
      total and differential cell counts in blister fluid, monocyte/macrophage phenotyping and the
      measurement of selected inflammation mediators in blister fluid and serum.
