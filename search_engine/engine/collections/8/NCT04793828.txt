      participation in the study to bridge the waiting time for face-to-face psychotherapy. After
      obtaining informed consent, a pre-treatment assessment is conducted. Then, participants are
      provided access to velibra, an internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program which they
      can work through at their own pace. While velibra is a self-guided program, participants are
      supported by study personnel during four assessments at four time points: pre-treatment,
      mid-treatment (after the first three velibra modules), post-treatment and at the one-month
      follow-up. The investigators expect improvements on the primary as well as the secondary
      outcomes. Furthermore, the investigators are interested in studying the acceptability of
      velibra and whether positive changes already become observable after the first three modules,
      i.e., at the mid-treatment assessment.
