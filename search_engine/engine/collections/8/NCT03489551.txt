      controls from previous research with bone marrow transplant patients and delirium incidence
      at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic
      Haldol in the prevention of delirium. This study will recruit adult cancer patients
      undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at UIHC.
