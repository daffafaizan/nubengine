      reduction in surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease. A number of components of wheat
      have been suggested to contribute to the cardiovascular health benefits associated with
      wholegrain consumption, most notably the fiber component. However, phenolic compounds that
      are bound to arabinoxylan fibre, particularly the hydroxycinnamate ferulic acid, may also
      contribute, in part, to vascular health effects. These phenolics may be more active when
      released enzymatically from the fiber prior to ingestion.

      The aim of the present study was therefore to determine whether the intake of high fibre
      bread containing higher free ferulic acid levels (enzymatically released during processing)
      enhances human endothelium-dependent vascular function to a greater extent than that of
      traditional wholegrain bread and/or a white bread control.
