    
      This is a phase I, single-site, pilot study of the kinetics of the immunological response and
      virological impact of AGS-004 administered in participants with durable viral suppression on
      ART initiated during acute (AHI) and chronic HIV infection (CHI). Patients will be screened
      for eligibility in Step 1. Those meeting study eligibility and with successful production of
      Argos (AGS)-004 product will then enter Step 2 with administration of AGS-004. All
      participants will continue ART throughout the study.
