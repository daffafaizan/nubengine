      glaucoma (NTG) or chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG), despite optimal conventional or
      intraocular pressure reducing surgery treatment so far. We will proceed with an optic nerve
      sheath fenestration (ONSF) (according to the studies in the literature, e.g. Wax MB, Barrett
      DA, Hart WM Jr, Custer PL. Optic nerve sheath decompression for glaucomatous optic neuropathy
      with normal intraocular pressure. Arch Ophthalmol. 1993;111(9):1219-28.) and compare the
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken from the subarachnoid space (SAS) of the optic nerve (ON)
      with the CSF taken during a lumbar puncture, on the same day. Concentrations of
      neurobioactive substances will especially be studied. Visual acuity and visual field
      development before and after ONSF will be studied. Quality of life assessment will be done
      before and several times after ONSF.
