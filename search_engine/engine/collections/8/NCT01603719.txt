    
      An experimental infant formula with added prebiotics (GOS) and with a higher content of
      palmitic acid esterified in beta-position is to be tested in a double-blinded randomized
      controlled trial.

      The addition of prebiotics to an infant formula should favor growth of a beneficial
      bifidogenic intestinal flora and have positive effects on immunity, promote softer stool
      formation and short chain fatty acid content in the stools. Higher proportion of
      beta-palmitic acid esterified in 2nd position of the triglyceride should reduce formation of
      fatty acid-calcium soaps in the stools and promote calcium and fat absorption in the gut,
      therfor reduce symptoms of constipation and colics.
