        -  Provide supervised access to yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) for patients
           with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

        -  Determine the response in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treated
           with hepatic arterial infusion of yttrium-90 glass microspheres.

        -  Determine the toxic effects and adverse experiences associated with this therapy in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the survival time of patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine the time to progression of disease in the liver, duration of response, and
           progression-free interval of patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Evaluate the influence of pretreatment characteristics on efficacy parameters in
           patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Radioactive material yttrium-90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) is infused
      directly into a liver tumor in order to kill tumor cells and cause less damage to the normal
      tissue. Patients receive TheraSphere® via hepatic arterial infusion on day 1. This artery is
      accessed through the femoral artery in the groin. This procedure is generally completed on an
      outpatient basis. Patients may receive a single dose to the whole liver, or sequential
      treatments to each side of the liver approximately 30 to 90 days apart. Patients may be
      re-treated at a later time.

      Patients are followed every 2 to 4 months for the rest of their lives to access tumor
      progression, symptom management and quality of life.
