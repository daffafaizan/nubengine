      undetected cardiac disease and avoid activities that they think might be harmful to their
      heart. These patients need help and support to evaluate the way they perceive and handle
      their chest pain. Therefore, we have developed a 4 session guided intervention based on
      cognitive behavioural therapy that will be delivered via internet.

      The intervention consists of psychoeducation, exposure to physical activity, and a
      breathing-based relaxation exercise. The goal with the intervention is to help the
      participants modify their beliefs about chest pain, change their cognitive and behavioural
      strategies, and give them tools to handle chest pain to prevent them from relapse.
