      higher flexion potential of the NexGen LPS-Flex femoral component in all patients with
      degenerative joint disease that require total knee arthroplasty. The primary variable of
      interest is postoperative range of motion achieved with the two devices, which are implanted
      with slightly different surgical techniques in patients who may also be subjected to
      different rehabilitation programs depending on the device they are assigned.
