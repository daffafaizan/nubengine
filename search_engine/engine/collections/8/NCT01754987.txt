    
      Intravenous Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) is a widely used alternative cancer treatment. This
      trial will study an intravenous Vitamin C treatment for persons with liver cancer that has
      spread, who are also receiving Sorafenib (a standard cancer drug), to see whether the
      combination of Vitamin C and Sorafenib is safe and well tolerated. Phase I will involve 6
      persons who will receive the Vitamin C for 8 weeks to more specifically assess the safety of
      getting Vitamin C in combination with Sorafenib. Phase II will be randomized to receive
      either Vitamin C plus Sorafenib or Sorafenib alone for 16 weeks. If Vitamin C has a
      beneficial effect on tumour cells, patients may experience a regression of tumor or tumor
      markers. Additional benefits include scans at no charge to the patient.
