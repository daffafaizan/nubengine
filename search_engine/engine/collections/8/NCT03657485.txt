      composition of the gut in healthy newborns delivered by CS. We studied colonization of GI
      tract on the day of discharge from hospital and after a month of life.

      It was a prospective, randomized trial with the control group, conducted in the Neonatal
      Clinic of the Jagiellonian University Hospital in Krak√≥w, lasting from April 2014 to April
      2017.

      The patients we recruited were randomized into 2 groups- interventional or control group. In
      the interventional group we supplemented the probiotic containing Bifidobacterium breve PB04
      i Lactobacillus rhamnosus KL53A (FFBaby, IBSS BioMed SA, Poland) orally during the first hour
      of life and after 12 hours in mother's milk or formula (the total amount of the probiotic was
      2 x 10 6 CFU bacteria).

      The permission for the clinical trial was granted by the regional medical Bioethical
      Committee of the Jagiellonian University. (The number of decision- KBET/46/B/2014 from the
