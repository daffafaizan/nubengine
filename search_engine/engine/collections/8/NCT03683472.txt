      generalized anxiety disorder, (2) determine user engagement and acceptability as well as
      measure effect sizes of the program vs. treatment as usual, and (3) preliminarily test
      mechanisms of action. The knowledge gained will set the stage for a number of future studies
      related to further elucidating the mechanisms of mindfulness, and the clinical efficacy and
      utility of this type of training delivered via digital therapeutics in general. Specifically,
      this study will provide necessary variances for powering larger phase 2 studies.
