      at 6-month follow-up. Left ventricular remodelling will be defined as an end-diastolic volume
      increase of >20% between the two exams. A low dose dobutamine gated Tc-99m-mibi SPECT will be
      also performed on 5th-6th day. Differences in the infarct size and severity as well as the
      residual inotrope reserve in the infarct area are expected between groups with and without
      remodelling.
