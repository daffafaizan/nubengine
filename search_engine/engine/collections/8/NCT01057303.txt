        -  Examine mRNA from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia with 11q23
           translocations by reverse transcriptase-PCR to quantify expression of EVI1 splice
           variants.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved mRNA from diagnostic samples is analyzed for gene expression by
      reverse transcriptase-PCR.
