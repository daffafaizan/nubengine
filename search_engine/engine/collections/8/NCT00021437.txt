      (endocrine evaluation mainly)--two in the last 25 years--the Registry does not develop a
      doctor/patient relationship with affected persons. They have their own doctors. We gather
      information about the affected persons and publish reports. We also publish reports of
      experiments carried out in the research laboratory using BS cells. Because we are a central
      repository for information on BS, families or their physicians find contact with us
      beneficial, and we provide them with information requested. Sometimes pregnancies at risk
      occur, and we have on occasion made cytogenic (chromosome) analysis of cultured cells of
      amniotic fluid (the cultures being initiated elsewhere and sent to us for cytogenetic study).

      Although the accessioning of new cases to the Registry was closed in 1991, 4-5 new patients
      are referred to us each year, and their clinical courses also are being followed. To date,
      the 169 officially registered and 36 additional cases are under our surveillance.
