      Operable patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary To assess the impact of breast-conserving therapy on disease-free survival compared
      with mastectomy in patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer.

      Secondary To assess the impact of breast-conserving therapy on locoregional recurrence-free
      survival (LRRFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) compared with mastectomy in
      patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a prospective, randomized, open, single-center Phase III clinical study.

      Patients undergo either lumpectomy or mastectomy with surgical axillary staging with all
      lesions resected to negative margins based on the results of randomization generated by
      computer.

      Patients with stage I and II receive adjuvant chemotherapy using TC and TAC regimen
      respectively.

      Since all tumors are smaller than 5cm and metastatic lymph nodes are less than 4, patients
      undergoing mastectomy do not receive radiation therapy. On the hand, within 4-8 weeks after
      completion of chemotherapy, patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery receive radiation
      therapy as follows: (1) N0: Radiation therapy to whole breast (+boost to tumor bed) or
      consideration of partial breast irradiation in selected patients; (2) N1: Radiation therapy
      to whole breast (+boost to tumor bed), infraclavicular region, and supraclavicular area with
      or without radiation therapy to internal mammary nodes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then 6 months for years 3-5.
