      for the Phase III trial in hormone refractory prostate cancer-Satraplatin and Prednisone
      Against Refractory Cancer (SPARC) trial.

      The trial evaluated satraplatin plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone as a
      second-line treatment in 950 patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). The
      companies reported that the trial did not achieve the endpoint of overall survival (p=0.80,
      stratified log rank analysis). The median was 61.3 weeks for the satraplatin arm compared to
      61.4 weeks for the control group and the hazard ratio was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.13). The
      companies are currently conducting pre-specified subset analyses.

      Satraplatin is a member of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based
      drugs have been clinically proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer
      therapies. Unlike the currently marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given
      orally.
