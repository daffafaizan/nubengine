      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of hepatic arterial infusion with floxuridine and
      dexamethasone followed by systemic therapy with oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with
      surgically resected liver metastases from primary colorectal carcinoma.

      II. Determine the 2-year survival rate of patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine
      the 2-year recurrence rate and time to recurrence in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive floxuridine and dexamethasone intra-arterially continuously on days 1-14,
      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 22, and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 22-35.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease recurrence or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the fourth course, patients receive oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours on day 1 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every
      3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2.5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-75 patients will be accrued for this study within 9
      months-3.25 years.
