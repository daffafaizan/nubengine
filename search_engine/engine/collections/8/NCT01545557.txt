      and face soft-tissue contour defects correction using specific dermal filler for all
      indications to be injected will satisfy both subjects and investigators.

      This device will be used for full face correction of volume loss: chin, temporal areas,
      jawline, cheek, cheekbones, deep to very deep nasolabial folds (only if cheekbones are
      injected concomitantly).

      Study duration will be up to 19 months. Injections will be performed at baseline. If
      necessary, investigator will perform touch-up injections at the following visit (3 weeks
      after baseline injection).
