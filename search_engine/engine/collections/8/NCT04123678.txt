    
      DERM, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based diagnosis support tool, has been shown to be able
      to accurately identify melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) and other conditions from
      historical images of suspicious skin lesions (moles).

      This study aims to establish whether the use of DERM in the patient pathway could reduce the
      number of unnecessary referrals to dermatologist review and/or biopsy.

      Suspicious skin lesions that are due to be photographed for a dermatologist to review, will
      have two additional photographs taken using a commonly available smart phone camera with and
      without a specific lens attachment. The images will be analysed by DERM, and the results
      compared to the clinician's diagnosis (all lesions) and histologically-confirmed diagnosis
      (any lesion that is biopsied).
