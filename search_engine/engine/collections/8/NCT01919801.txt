      most frequently for the treatment of hypertension. They are also used post myocardial
      infarction as well as in patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney
      disease. Approximately 35 to 40 million patients are on ACE-Is worldwide.

      Study HGT-FIR-096 is a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, two-armed,
      placebo-controlled trial. The study population will consist of 118 adult patients, 18 years
      of age or older, who present with an acute ACE-I-induced angioedema attack. The primary aim
      of the study is to demonstrate that icatibant is significantly more effective than placebo in
      resolving attacks of angioedema caused by ACE-I based on the Time to Meeting Discharge
      Criteria (TMDC). Safety and tolerability, as well as the pharmacokinetics (PK), of icatibant
      will also be evaluated. Eligible patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive a
      single sub-cutaneous injection of either 30 mg icatibant or placebo.
