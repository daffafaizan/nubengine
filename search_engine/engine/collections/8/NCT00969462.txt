    
      Aim of the study:

      To evaluate the association between response to chemotherapy, the degree of myelosuppression
      and the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients.

      Methods:

      Study protocol:

        1. At diagnosis

           Demographic and clinical parameters be collected (Appendix 1)

        2. At course 2:

      1. Doxorubicin will be given by 5-7 minutes infusion before the other medications
      (Doxorubicin doses will be collected (Appendix 1))

      2. Blood will be sampled in course 2, at:

      0 minutes 30 minutes 120 minutes 24 hours

      Two 2ml EDT tubes will be drawn at each time The tubes will be centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 15
      min. Plasma samples will be stored in - 700C

      3. At the end of chemotherapy courses the following data will be collected (Appendix 2):

        1. Episodes of bone marrow depression (leucopenia, neutropenia) Treatment delays Dose
           reductions Neutropenic fever

        2. Remission status

      [Complete remission (CR) - disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms of NHL along with
      normal laboratory and radiological findings].

      4. At the end of one year of CR

      Remission status

      Number of patients: 30
