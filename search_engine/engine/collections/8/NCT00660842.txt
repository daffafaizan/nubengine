      carboplatin and paclitaxel, given every 3 weeks. Researchers are looking at new ways of
      giving chemotherapy to make it more tolerable and more effective. One way is by giving the
      chemotherapy more often in smaller doses. This approach can be associated with fewer or less
      troubling side effects. Some chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel have been shown to also be
      more active when given once a week rather than once every 3 week schedule.
