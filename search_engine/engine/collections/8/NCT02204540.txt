    
      In the first phase of this study, the study scientists will research and compare technologies
      that will be used in video monitoring via webcam. The study team will also develop a
      standardized protocol for using the webcam technology through hands-on testing (without the
      use of study participants).

      In the second phase of this study, video monitoring via webcam will be tested. Specifically,
      the study scientists will see whether the video recordings can be used to assess compliance
      to clinical interventions. Study participants will be recruited from among Pennington
      Biomedical Research Center employees and assigned to be either evaluators or testers. Testers
      will act as if they were study participants in a clinical study who are supposed to adhere to
      an intervention such as swallowing a pill or consuming food. They will be video-recorded by
      webcam while performing these tasks. Evaluators will then try to detect how well the testers
      followed the instructions for the task through in-person observation and by watching video
      recordings. Data from these tests will then be used to see whether watching the video
      recordings is as effective as watching in-person.

      In the third phase of this study, past, current, and potential study participants at
      Pennington Biomedical Research Center will be surveyed to determine their comfort with using
      webcams and their likeliness to opt to use webcams to participate in clinical studies.
