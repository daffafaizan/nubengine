    
      Children will be prospectively included and randomly assigned in two groups : Propofol (P)
      Group or Sevoflurane (S) Group.

      Steady state periods will be performed at a fixed randomized concentration between 2, 3, 4, 5
      and 6 mcg/ml of stable Ct P concentration in the P group and between 1,2,3,4,5 % of FeS in
      the S group.

      At the end of each steady-state period the BIS value was noted and the relationship between
      BIS and anesthetic concentrations will be studied using non linear regression. For all steady
      state periods, EEG traces will be reviewed to determine the presence of epileptiform signs
      (ES) and spectral EEG signal analysis with fast Fourier transformation (FFT) will be
      performed.
