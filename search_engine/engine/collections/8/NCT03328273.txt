      (discontinued) and in combination with acalabrutinib in subjects with R/R CLL and in subjects
      who have few therapeutic options available to them. As such, this study includes a formal DLT
      assessment of the first 6-12 subjects dosed in Part 1 of the study. In addition, routine and
      regular safety monitoring will be undertaken during this study to fully assess safety of
      ceralasertib given as monotherapy and in combination with acalabrutinib, with toxicity
      assessment and dose reduction guidelines.
