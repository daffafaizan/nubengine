    
      Primary Objective 1: Determine changes in tumor EGFR, pEGFR, downstream signaling and novel
      phosphoproteins following a loading dose of cetuximab in patients who are poor candidates for
      chemoradiation (age =70 years or with significant co-morbidities) and are therefore treated
      with cetuximab with radiation.

      Primary Objective 2: Characterize clinical outcomes, including local recurrence,
      progression-free survival and overall survival in these patients, and correlate these
      clinical outcomes with the changes in tumor EGFR, pEGFR, downstream signaling, and novel
      phosphoproteins.

      Primary Objective 3: Describe the toxicity, in particular mucositis/dysphagia, of this
      regimen.

      Secondary Objective 1: Conduct normal mucosa EGFR assessment for comparison with tumor
      sample.

      Secondary Objective 2: Correlate HPV presence and titer with p53 status and clinical outcome.
