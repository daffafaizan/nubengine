      been evaluated in the treatment of ED patients with low back pain including acetaminophen,
      NSAIDS, opioids, steroids, and muscle relaxants.

      Lidocaine is a local anesthetic that can be administered by various routes. It is used in a
      transdermal patch for the treatment of pain. It is commonly used for focal causes of pain,
      including low back pain. The addition of lidocaine 5% patches to standard low back pain
      therapy has not been rigorously evaluated, although it is frequently used.
