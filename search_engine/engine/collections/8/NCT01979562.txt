      major effect on the development of overuse injuries.

      To define a prevention strategy, one must have the knowledge about risk factors and
      causation. The training composition is very relevant clinically but the underlying factors
      have not been studied yet. For the present there is no scientifical evidence of a possible
      relation between the body composition such as the mutual length and width of femur and tibia
      and the development of overuse injuries.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to achieve evidence-based knowledge of these factors in order
      to advice runners about the precautions and to avoid that people get a sedentary lifestyle.
