      accesses and is the sole outflow conduit for brachial- cephalic autogenous accesses. The
      portion of the cephalic vein that becomes perpendicular in the region of the deltopectoral
      groove before its confluence with the axillary or subclavian vein,the cephalic arch, is prone
      to the development of hemodynamically significant stenosis which is usually treated with
      balloon angioplasty. Unfortunately restenosis due to angioplasty induced intimal hyperplasia
      is common and periodic repeated angioplasty is necessary to maintain patency.

      Paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy which is used as an
      antiproliferative agent for the prevention of restenosis (recurrent narrowing) of blood
      vessels after balloon angioplasty caused by excessive intimal proliferation. It is locally
      delivered to the wall of the blood vessel during the dilatation using a paclitaxel eluting
      balloon.

      Initial trials with these balloons have shown promising results in peripheral arteries and
      early encouraging results in dialysis access.
