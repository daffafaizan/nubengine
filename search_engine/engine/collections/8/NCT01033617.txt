    
      CD133+ are well-characterized distinct early progenitor group of stem cells that possess high
      engraftment, pluripotent and angiogenic capacity and proved to be valuable for cardiac repair
      by promoting neovascularization, inhibition of apoptosis and cardiomyogenesis.

      Our proposed research protocol involves patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and left
      ventricular dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In this phase II
      clinical trial, prospective, randomized, 2 arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we
      will assess the safety, feasibility and functional effect of intra-myocardial injection of
      highly selected autologous CD133+ bone marrow stem cells to placebo.
