    
      The intervention group will receive PT 3 times per week for 60 minutes each session. The
      therapy sessions will include endurance, strengthening, and stretching exercises. Endurance
      exercises will consist of ambulating with assistive devices as needed, using the upper
      extremity (UE) ergometer, and/or playing the Wii. Strengthening exercises will involve both
      UE's and LE's. For UE's, bicep curls, triceps curls, shoulder flexion, and/or press-ups from
      the therapy mat or wheelchair will be included. For the LE's, bridging, long arc quads,
      hamstring curls, calf raises in standing, single LE squats, and/or dorsiflexion (DF) in
      supine will be performed on the uninvolved extremity. Resistance and exercise time will be
      increased depending upon participant's tolerance. Stretching will consist of ankle stretch
      into DF in supine or long sitting, hamstring stretch in supine with hip flexed to 90 degrees,
      and trunk extension in sitting.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      To determine if individuals diagnosed with a malignancy of the LE can participate in a 10
      week preoperative strengthening, stretching, and aerobic exercise regimen.
