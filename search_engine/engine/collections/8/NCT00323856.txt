    
      This is a Phase IV, non-randomized, multicenter study of at least 50 evaluable subjects
      diagnosed with severe hemophilia A. Enrolled subjects will be treated at home and with
      in-clinic therapy exclusively with Alphanate as their sole source of Factor VIII concentrate
      for prophylaxis and treatment of all bleeding episodes and surgical procedures. Subjects will
      be treated for at least 2 years and a minimum of 50 exposure days, or if 50 exposure days are
      not reached, for a maximum of 30 months and in accordance with the subject's usual pre-study
      treatment regimen. Subjects will continue treatment as above or until they develop inhibitors
      to Factor VIII at a titer greater than or equal to 5 Bethesda units (BU/ml); Factor VIII
      becomes ineffective at providing hemostasis, or the subject exhibits severe or serious
      adverse events that prevent completion of the study.
