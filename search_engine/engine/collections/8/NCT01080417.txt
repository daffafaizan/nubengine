      be administered either the Test or the Reference Product with 240 mL of water in each period
      as per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to High Fat
      Breakfast half an hour before administration of the study drug and for four (4) additional
      hours each, post dose during each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each
      study period. Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour Predose and 2 hours Post
      dose in each period.A total of 27 blood samples will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic
      profiling. The concentration of mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid will be
      quantitated using validated LC-MS / MS method.ANOVA, two one-sided tests for bioequivalence,
      power and ratio analysis for un-transformed and ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters
      Cmax, AUC0-t AUC0-inf will be computed and reported for Mycophenolic acid. Bioequivalence of
      the test product with that of the reference product under fasting conditions will be
      concluded if the 90% confidence interval falls within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%
      for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf for Mycophenolic
      acid.
