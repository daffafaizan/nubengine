      system (hardware and software) to distinguish between lung pathologies by assessing the
      sensitivity and specificity as well as the overall agreement with the CT scan in terms of
      spatial resolution. The study will test, as well as refine, the mathematical algorithms
      needed to create meaningful outputs on adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation and
      who also have received or will be receiving a CT scan as part of their standard of care.
