      medically intractable. An estimated one-quarter to one-half of the 400,000 patients in the
      United States with intractable epilepsy have MTLE. Generally, MTLE becomes intractable in
      adolescence and early adulthood. Persistence of seizures during this time commonly causes
      adverse social and psychological consequences which can become irreversible.

      The current treatment of MTLE primarily consists of medications to control seizures. Usually
      surgical treatment is considered only if medications are not effective. Recent studies have
      shown that surgery can stop disabling seizures in 60 to 70% of patients with long standing
      MTLE. However, to date, no research study has examined surgery performed as an early therapy.

      The goal of the study is to determine if more patients treated with early surgery become
      seizure free and have improved quality of life compared to similar patients who continue to
      receive antiepileptic medication only. This study will determine the difference in seizure
      frequency between the two groups and the impact of the two treatments on the quality of life
      of the participants.
