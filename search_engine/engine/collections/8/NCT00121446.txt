      following three treatment groups defined as Group A: optimal pharmacologic therapy (prompt
      administration of tenecteplase (TNKase) and enoxaparin) at the earliest point of medical
      contact with usual post MI care; Group B: an identical pharmacological reperfusion strategy
      followed by an early invasive strategy including timely mechanical intervention, Group C:
      timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), undertaken after enoxaparin and an
      oral loading dose of clopidogrel.

      The secondary objective of WEST is to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving optimal
      pharmacologic therapy and a strategy of usual post-MI care, Group A versus protocol-mandated
      early catheterisation and PCI, Group B.
