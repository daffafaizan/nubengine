      Beyond the pandemic, stroke care is further impacted directly by COVID-19-induced systemic
      inflammatory response and coagulopathy which leads to increased risk of embolic stroke and
      intracranial hemorrhage.

      In the United States, the highest level of stroke care is provided to the most critically ill
      stroke patients at comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs). Many CSCs also utilize telestroke to
      deliver remote stroke care externally to partnering spoke hospitals without local stroke
      expertise in order to improve time-sensitive, emergent stroke interventions such as
      thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Conceptually, telestroke may also surmount pandemic-related
      barriers to stroke care delivery internally at CSCs and workflows incorporating telestroke
      have been adopted out of necessity. However, the efficacy of remote patient care via
      telestroke for stroke patients hospitalized at CSCs remains unclear. The aim of the
      TELECAST-CSC trial was to prospectively evaluate whether inpatient stroke specialist care
      provided via telestroke was equivalent to stroke care provided in-person during the COVID-19
      pandemic.

      TELECAST-CSC compares two cohorts: the "in-person phase" (December 1, 2019-March 15, 2020),
      when all inpatient stroke team care was delivered conventionally in-person and the
      "telestroke phase" (March 16, 2020-June 29, 2020) when all inpatient stroke team care was
      delivered exclusively via telestroke as part of our healthcare system's pandemic response. We
      studied the following primarily clinical endpoints: diagnostic stroke evaluation, secondary
      stroke prevention, health screening and evaluation, stroke education, and stroke recurrence
      rates.
