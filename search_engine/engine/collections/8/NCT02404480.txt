      PTC596 in patients with advanced cancer. A variation of the traditional 3+3 dose escalation
      design will be employed.

      PTC596 will be administered orally on a twice a week (biw) schedule. Each 4-week period of
      drug administration will be considered one cycle. The objective of the study will be to
      determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to determine preliminary proof of mechanism
      of action.

      Collectively, data from the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP studies indicate that
      40 mg/kg biw is approximately the severely toxic dose in 10% of animals (STD 10). Therefore,
      the starting dose in this study will be calculated as one-tenth of the human equivalent dose
      (HED) of 40 mg/kg biw in rats, which is 0.65 mg/kg biw.

      In this study, escalating dose levels will be evaluated to determine the RP2D. Three patients
      will be enrolled at the starting dose level (0.65 mg/kg biw); if 1 of the 3 patients
      experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), an additional 3 patients will be enrolled at the
      same dose level. Thus, 3 to 6 patients will receive the starting dose level of 0.65 mg/kg.
      Dose escalation will continue until the occurrence of DLT in ≥2/6 patients at a given dose
      level. Dose escalation will occur in approximately 100% increments until Grade ≥2,
      first-cycle toxicity is seen in at least 2 patients across all dose levels, after which dose
      escalation will occur in smaller (50% or 33%) increments.
