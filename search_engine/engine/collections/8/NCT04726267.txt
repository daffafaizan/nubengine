      use during the trabeculectomy was much less than used during phacoemulsification,
      trabeculectomy also could induce the PVD and it's sequelae such as VMI abnormalities. Because
      the baseline visual acuity of glaucoma patients who were indicated for trabeculectomy usually
      quite poor, so the sequelae of PVD can cause more visual loss. The incidence of PVD after
      trabeculectomy has never been published before and nowadays no standard guideline for retinal
      examination or screening after surgery. Furthermore, Tsukahara et al introduced wide-field
      OCT-based PVD classification. The new OCT device with higher technology will be useful in PVD
      detection.
