    
      Research procedures will include:

        1. Pre-operative blood draw for genotyping candidate genes and exploratory genes and for
           future similar studies will be collected.

        2. Standardized pre-, intra-, and post-operative care will be received by all participants.
           The study team will record medical history, demographic information, concomitant
           medications, vitals, pain scores, post-operative nausea and vomiting, and all
           medications given post-surgery for pain management throughout the participants
           in-patient stay.

        3. Psychological questionnaires to assess pain, risk of developing OD and chronic pain,
           anxiety and depression will be administered pre-operatively, and 48-72 hours, 7-14 days,
           2 months, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively.

        4. Quantitative Sensory Testing will be performed on up to 100 participants
           pre-operatively, and 48-72 hours,3 months and 12 months post-operatively.

        5. Serial blood draws for oxycodone and methadone pharmacokinetic modeling will be
           collected from up to 200 participants. QTc measurements will also be recorded from pre-
           and post-operative EKGs for those participants in which methadone pharmacokinetic blood
           samples are collected.
