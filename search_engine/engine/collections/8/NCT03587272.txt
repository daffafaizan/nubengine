    
      This is a prospective, multicenter phase II study of HLA-identical sibling donor HSCT in 30
      pediatric patients with SCD using nonmyeloablative conditioning with alemtuzumab, total-body
      irradiation, and sirolimus. The primary Objective of this study is to determine if the SUN
      regimen can decrease the incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus host disease (GVHD) by
      day +100 while maintaining similar disease-free survival compared to establish HLA-identical
      donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) regimens in children with SCD. The secondary
      Objective is to determine if health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for children undergoing
      SUN HSCT is preserved during the early post-transplant time period. To determine if the SUN
      regimen can decrease the number of platelet transfusions compared to established
      HLA-identical HSCT regimens in children with SCD. The tertiary/Exploratory Objectives: To
      describe other markers of toxicity (duration of neutropenia, mucositis, length of
      hospitalization) and indicators of a successful HSCT (HRQoL at 1 year, proportion needing
      additional immunosuppression during the first year, proportion able to wean sirolimus at 1
      year).
