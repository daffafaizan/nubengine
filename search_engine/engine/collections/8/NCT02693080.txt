    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of performing computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging (CT
      perfusion imaging) at baseline, within 48 hours post-stereotactic ablative radiation therapy
      (SABR), and at 2-4 months SABR in patients undergoing SABR for treatment of a lung tumor per
      standard of care.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine the range (variability) of perfusion parameters at baseline, within 48
           hours post-SABR, and at 2-4 months post-SABR

        2. To assess the change in perfusion parameters at baseline, within 48 hours post-SABR, and
           at 2-4 months post-SABR

        3. To correlate any change in perfusion parameters with circulating-tumor deoxyribonucleic
           acid (DNA) levels at baseline, within 48 hours post-SABR, and at 2-4 months post-SABR

        4. To correlate perfusion parameters with tumor response 1 year post-SABR

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive an infusion of Isovue-200 and undergo CT perfusion imaging of the lungs at
      baseline, within 48 hours of first SABR, and at 2-4 months after completion of SABR. Cancer
      Personalized Profiling by Deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq) will be conducted evaluate
      circulating-tumor DNA levels.

      Perfusion parameters will be correlated with tumor control at 1 year post-SABR, with tumor
      control defined as no evidence of disease seen at the site of SABR by surveillance imaging at
      1 year post-SABR.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 2-4 months and then at 1 year.
