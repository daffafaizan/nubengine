      Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) using a combination of pretest probability assessment and
      quantitative interpretation of the anti-platelet factor 4 Immunological assay (anti-PF4).
      Patient with a clinical suspicion of HIT will follow the study diagnostic algorithm (Figure
      1). The study algorithm will be considered a safe approach to move forward into a larger RCT
      if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for 'false negative management failures' is
      â‰¤ 4% based on a Serotonin Release Assay (SRA) gold standard. The main objective of the pilot
      study is to inform feasibility and recruitment barriers for a larger randomized control
      trial.
