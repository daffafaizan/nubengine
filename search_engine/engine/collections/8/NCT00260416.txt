      they accept to participate, we infuse 600 MBq of Sestamibi i.v. This binds in a first passage
      fashion without later redistribution to perfused myocardium. Non-perfused myocardium does not
      bind sestamibi. Primary angioplasty with stent and abciximab is then performed followed by
      myocardial scintigraphy to illustrate the non-perfused myocardial area that was at risk of
      infarction before the coronary artery was opened. Echocardiography is also performed. At 1
      month, myocardial scintigraphy is repeated to evaluate infarct size. The difference between
      the myocardial area at risk of infarction before angioplasty and the myocardial infarct size
      1 month later is defined as "salvage". Scintigraphy is repeated at 6 month and
      echocardiography is also repeated at 1 month and 6 months. The primary endpoint is "salvage".
      Accordingly, the aim is to demonstrate that salvage can be achieved with primary angioplasty
      for acute myocardial infarction despite symptom duration above 12 hours. Clinical endpoints
      are death and reinfarction. The results are compared with results in 200 patients with
      symptom duration below 12 hours. These patients are treated and examined according to the
      exact same protocol. By this comparison, it can be evaluated whether it is relevant that the
      current guidelines recommend acute balloon angioplasty only to patients with less than 12
      hours of symptom duration.
