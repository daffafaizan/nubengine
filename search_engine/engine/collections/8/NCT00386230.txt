      were tested for HIV from the beginning of pregnancy until 26 of gestational age (GA). If
      HIV-positive and eligible, women completed a Pre-entry baseline check-up. Enrollment took
      place at 28 weeks' gestational age. Women meeting selection criteria were randomly assigned
      to one of four study arms (see below).

      AMENDMENT (March 20, 1999)

      Data Safety and Monitory Board interim review (March 17, 1999) The DSMB reported that the
      transmission rate in the longest arm (long treatment of both mother and baby), was
      significantly lower than that in the shortest arm (short treatment of both the mother and the
      baby) and this discrepancy was larger than the previously agreed on difference which, if
      found, would call for changing the study design. In addition, the transmission rates in the
      remaining two arms of the study were similar to that in the longest arm. The difference that
      was found could not be explained by any baseline characteristics of the participants, such as
      maternal age, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, cesarean section rate, or any
      others.

      The DSMB recommended that enrollment into the shortest arm of the study be terminated, and
      the study be continued with a modification of design so that new enrollees would enter one of
      the three remaining arms.

      All women enrolled before this amendment was effective and delivering after March 20th, 1999,
      and previously randomized to the Smother-Sinfant arm, were unblinded in order to give their
      infants open label zidovudine for 6 weeks.
