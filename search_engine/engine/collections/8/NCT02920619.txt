      composition measurements in three laboratory ultrasound systems. We propose a cross-sectional
      study to obtain ultrasound images of selected muscles in Veteran participants. These data
      will be used to develop conversion models for each system. Evaluation of neuromuscular
      symptoms such as muscle weakness and fatigue is crucial to improving quality of life among
      Veterans. These symptoms may be related to progressive changes in muscle tissue composition,
      including increased intramuscular fat and atrophy. Quantitative musculoskeletal ultrasound is
      a diagnostic imaging application used to characterize muscle tissue composition. Despite its
      non-invasiveness and relative low cost, quantitative musculoskeletal ultrasound has not been
      widely adopted by the medical community due in part to technical barriers that impede
      generalization of measurements across ultrasound systems. Unfortunately, few techniques have
      been proposed to reliably compare system measurements. Development of new cross-comparison
      methods could expand quantitative musculoskeletal ultrasound applications and improve
      neuromuscular symptoms diagnosis.
