      reproductive technology departments in collaboration with Caen University Hospital (members
      of G4) want to conduct this type of routine clinical practice follow-up study in the context
      of an inter-regional research grant (PHRC). These 2 University Hospitals are situated in
      agricultural regions with potential polluting industries. The recruitment of these centres
      comprises younger couples presenting with infertility for which a cause cannot always be
      demonstrated and in which the percentage of ART by ICSI is higher than the national average
      (close to 75% vs 60%). This population also presents a higher cancer risk than in other
      regions.

      This research project concerns evaluation of the impact of male smoking on the couple's
      fertility and will consist of a two-centre case-control study.
