      are associated with progressive vision loss. Fluid in the subretinal space disrupts the
      physical apposition between photoreceptor outer segments and retinal pigment epithelial
      cells, which may in turn hinder the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments.
      Material derived from the unphagocytized outer segments may accumulate in the subretinal
      space to form vitelliform lesions, resulting in a persistent detachment. Anti-VEGF therapy in
      the form of intravitreal aflibercept injections may be useful in controlling or eliminating
      subretinal fluid, thus promoting contact between photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal
      pigment epithelium. Vitelliform detachments may resolve subsequent to the removal of
      subretinal fluid and restoration of contact-dependent mechanisms of photoreceptor outer
      segment recycling.
