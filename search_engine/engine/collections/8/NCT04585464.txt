      EDG-5506 or a placebo. Blood and urine samples will be collected to measure how EDG-5506 is
      processed by the body and how the body responds when exposed to EDG-5506. Participants in the
      single ascending dose part of the study will remain in the clinic for 7 days with a 42-day
      follow-up period. Participants in the multiple ascending dose part of the study will remain
      in the clinic for 16 days with a 13-day follow-up period. Safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of EDG-5506 will be assessed in healthy volunteers prior to enrolling
      participants with Becker muscular dystrophy.
