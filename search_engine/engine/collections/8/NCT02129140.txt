    
      Prior to their scheduled surgery, the patient will be consented and will complete a brief
      quality of life survey. They will also be asked some questions about their medical history
      that pertain to the study, such as current/ past abdominal infections and surgeries, history
      of the hernia, comorbidities, etc.

      During the surgery, some key data points will be recorded by the research coordinator, such
      as time of surgery, type of case, size of mesh used, size of the hernia defect, technique
      used, type of sutures used, etc. The mesh will be placed either retrorectus or
      intraperitoneally, after the component separation is complete. The mesh will not be used as a
      "bridge," and the fascial layers will be closed completely.

      The research staff may photograph the repair of an enrolled patient's hernia during their
      treatment and will supply a copy of the photograph to Cook Medical, Inc. if the sponsor's
      review is requested. Any photograph taken for research purposes will be kept in a
      password-protected, encrypted database separate from any patient identifying information.
