      The investigators try to inject KS patients with mesenchymal stem cells to stimulate
      testicular tissue for production of sperms.

      before injection the investigators measure:( FSH, LH, Testosterone, Prolactin, Inhibin B,
      Karyotyping, Azoospermic Factor, Testicular size by ultrasound).

      Three to twelf months after stem cell injection the investigators reevaluate patients by the
      same measure to demoenstarte any changes.
