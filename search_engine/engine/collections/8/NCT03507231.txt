      university. Each recipient will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: control,
      main task incentive or indirect incentive. Our main dependent variable will be whether or not
      participants decide to get vaccinated. The investigators will obtain their actual vaccination
      records from the university Occupational Health Department.

      Within the e-mail message, participants will indicate whether or not they intend to get
      vaccinated. Intention serves as an indirect dependent outcome. Upon clicking to indicate
      their intention, participants are redirected to a page which gives further instructions on
      how to proceed.

      Participants who vaccinate will be asked to complete a brief follow-up questionnaire to
      evaluate their experience with vaccination and (for those offered and incentive) to provide
      contact information to receive their payment.
