    
      The aim of this controlled double-blind randomized 3-session cross-over designed study is to
      evaluate the effects of a single dose of 150 mg and a 14-day repeated dose of 300 mg
      bupropion (therapeutic dose) on cognitive and executive functions, behaviour and subjective
      feelings, and some physical parameters after sleep deprivation in 12 trained healthy
      volunteers (18-35 years old).

      Cognitive and executive functions were assessed by reaction times, critical flicker fusion
      test, Stroop test, digit symbol substitution test, span test and short term recal of
      pictures, tapping and tracking tests.

      Behaviour and subjective effects explored were :

        -  feelings frequently experienced with psychotropic drugs assessed by ARCI,

        -  some mood states as tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue and confusion assessed by
           both POMS and Norris visual analogic scales,

        -  sleep assessed by LSEQ,

        -  feeding behaviour assessed by food intake during a meal test and self-ratings of
           appetite and satiety,

      Physical parameters were :

        -  rest and orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate,

        -  body temperature and weight.

      Bupropion was tested versus both placebo and 20 mg methylphenidate as positive control. Each
      subject received the 3 treatments, sequently randomized, with a 17-day wash-out period
      between sessions. Each session was organized as follow :

        -  2 20-hour hospitalisations consisting in adverse effects review, physical examination,
           test training, sleep deprivation, drug compliance evaluation, drug dosing and
           dispensation, and assessments described above,

        -  2 visits consisting in adverse effects review, drug compliance evaluation and drug
           dispensation.

      The total duration of participation for the subjects was 106 days.
