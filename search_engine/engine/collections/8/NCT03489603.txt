    
      Observational, prospective, real-world clinical practice, multicentric study, conducted at 12
      Emergency Departments in Italy.

      Patients with suspected non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) who have undergone at
      least one high-sensitivity cardiac troponin test will be included.

      Patients will be enrolled in the study after verification of selection criteria.

      Enrollment is consecutive; each Center will suspend enrollment when it has reached the
      expected number of patients.

      An electronic data collection form (eCRF) will be used to automatically generate an
      enrollment number to identify each patient.

      Given the observational nature of the study, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays will be
      used according to current clinical practice.

      Patients will be examined in the ED, and on a 30-day follow-up.
