      corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is usually effective at controlling active disease.
      However, disease relapse is frequent and requires increased exposure to these toxic drugs. In
      other patients initiation or continuation of these standard drugs is contraindicated due to
      intolerable side effects. No well-established therapy is available for relapsing patients.
      They may suffer severe organ damage due to progressive disease, or may die. The proposed
      indication for gusperimus is the treatment of relapsing Wegener Granulomatosis. The aim of
      therapy with gusperimus is to induce and maintain remission thereby avoiding further
      cyclophosphamide and reducing corticosteroid exposure.
