      urgent need to try old re-purposed drugs on COVID-19. Methods: Randomized controlled study on
      70 COVID-19 patients (48 mild-moderate, 11 severe, and 11 critical patients) treated with
      200ug/kg PO of Ivermectin per day for 2 days along with 100mg PO doxycycline twice per day
      for 5-10 days plus standard therapy; the second arm is 70 COVID-19 patients (48 mild-moderate
      and 22 severe and zero critical patients) on standard therapy. The time to recovery, the
      progression of the disease, and the mortality rate were the outcome-assessing parameters.
