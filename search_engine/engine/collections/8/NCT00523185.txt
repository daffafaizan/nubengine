      comparing the efficacy of long and short half-life benzodiazepines in the treatment of
      alcohol withdrawal have shown mixed results. Due to the conflicting nature of published
      reports, clinicians have no clear indication as to which type of agent is preferable. The
      purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of two commonly accepted medications in the
      treatment of alcohol withdrawal, diazepam and lorazepam, which are long and short half-life
      benzodiazepines, respectively.
