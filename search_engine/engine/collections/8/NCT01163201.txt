      of Treg and 3 x 10^6/kg of CD3+ Teff cells).

      One patient will be entered at each level with a minimum of 35 days to observe the patient
      prior to moving to the next dose level. (1) If GVHD does not occur, a "successful step", then
      the CD3+ Teff cell dose will increase to the next higher level for the next patient; (2) If
      GVHD occurs, a "failed step", then Treg dose will increase to the next higher level for the
      next patient. It would take a minimum of 5 (if no GVHD) and maximum of 9 patients (if GVHD is
      observed at each level) to complete all Treg:CD3+ Teff cell combinations.

      An additional 10 patients will be enrolled to verify that this reflects the optimal
      combination and evaluate its safety profile.
