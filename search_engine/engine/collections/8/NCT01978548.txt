      treatment the patient receives), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is
      compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial),
      randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), multiple-dose,
      proof-of-mechanism (POM) study in pAD. Approximately 24 outpatients (n=8/treatment group)
      diagnosed with pAD, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will participate in
      this 4-week treatment study. For all enrolled patients, this study will consist of an 8-week
      eligibility screening period, a 4-week double-blind treatment period, and a follow-up
      examination (7-14 days after the last dose). Patients will be assigned randomly to 1 of 3
      treatment groups: placebo, JNJ-54861911 10 mg once daily, or JNJ-54861911 50 mg once daily.
      Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study. The maximal study duration for a
      patient will be 14 weeks.
