    
      The specific aims include:

        1. Compared to usual care, examine whether the 6-month exercise intervention improves
           cognitive function in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer.

           Hypothesis 1. Exercise will improve cognitive function in women in a domain specific
           fashion such that attention, executive and memory functions will be influenced more than
           other domains.

        2. Compared to usual care, examine the direct effects of exercise on neuroimaging metrics
           of brain health including regional gray matter volume, white matter architecture and
           functional dynamics of the brain and the pro-inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6 as primary
           outcomes; TNF-α as secondary), and explore the direct effects of exercise on symptoms
           (fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety).

           Hypothesis 2. Exercise will improve neuroimaging metrics of brain health and
           pro-inflammatory biomarkers.

        3. Compared to usual care, explore whether the effects of exercise on cognitive function
           are mediated by a) neuroimaging metrics of cognitive function, b) IL-6 and TNF-α levels
           and c) symptoms (fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety), and moderated by E2
           levels.
