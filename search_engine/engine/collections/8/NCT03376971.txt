      I. Show that it is possible to distinguish lung cancer from benign lesions in ex vivo tissue
      samples using optical microscopy.

      II. Test a proof-of-concept endoscopic instrument for imaging through a biopsy needle under
      computed tomography (CT) guidance on ex vivo tissue samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo extraction of up to 3 additional lung biopsies from target lesions that are
      at least 2-3 cm in diameter using the 19 gauge SuperCore biopsy needle or the 20 gauge Rotax
      needle. The extracted tissue is imaged via confocal fluorescence microscopy using a variety
      of fluorescent contrast agents, such as, fluorescein sodium, methylene blue, or indocyanine
      green and then undergo hematoxylin and eosin processing.
