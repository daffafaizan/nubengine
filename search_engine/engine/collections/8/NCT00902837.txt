    
      Subjects with moderate to severe pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) will be randomised to
      oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release (OXN PR) or oxycodone prolonged release tablets (OxyPR)
      alone to demonstrate that the treatment with OXN PR tablets is non-inferior to the treatment
      with OxyPR with regards to analgesic efficacy and locomotor function and to demonstrate that
      subjects taking OXN PR have improvement in symptoms of constipation compared to subjects
      taking OxyPR alone.
