      measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in participants with and without
      Bipolar I Disorder. Eligible participants will undergo 5 study visits: a screening visit, a
      baseline MRI visit, and 3 cTBS visits. Participants will receive brain stimulation and
      undergo fMRI scanning at each of the 3 cTBS study visits, however, at one of the visits, the
      brain stimulation will be a sham. The research associates and participants will be blinded to
      when the sham occurs, which will be randomized beforehand. Certain information is withheld to
      protect the scientific integrity of the study design
