      for adolescents with early onset psychosis and their families. The intervention was
      implemented in parallel in 2 separate groups, by focusing specifically on problem solving
      strategies and structured psychosis-related information to manage daily life hassles
      associated with the disease in order to manage crises and prevent relapses.

      Method: The investigators performed a 9-month, randomized, rater-blind clinical trial
      involving adolescent patients with early onset psychosis and 1 or both of their parents. The
      primary outcomes were number of hospitalizations, days of hospitalization, and visits to the
      emergency department. The secondary outcome measures were clinical variables and family
      environment and well being.
