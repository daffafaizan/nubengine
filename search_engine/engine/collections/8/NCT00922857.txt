      and resistance exercises on muscle biopsies.

      The present study should help to know the molecular pathways implicated in muscle atrophy in
      CRF patients and to assess their evolution with rehabilitation. This could lead to
      individualized recommendation for exercise program according to the muscle mass of the
      patients.
