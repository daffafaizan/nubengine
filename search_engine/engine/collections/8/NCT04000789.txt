      sodium hyaluronate 0.15%, vitamin A and vitamin E eye drops compared to sodium hyaluronate
      0.1% eye drop only in patient with NPDR or PDR with decreased corneal sensitivity. The
      examination consisted of OSDI questionnaire, tear film break up time, Schirmer I, and goblet
      cell density, examined at baseline and 4 weeks (day 28) after the initial eye drops is given.
      For sample size calculation, estimated 96 patients are required to give statistical effect,
      this number already calculating the possibility of 20% drop out rate. Every eligible patient
      is then randomized with block randomization into each allocated arm. Statistical analysis
      used for this study is unpaired T test if the data distribution is normal, if not
      Mann-Whitney test will be used.
