      prevalence in the population increases with age, and it is estimated to affect over 4% of the
      population above the age of 60. Common approaches to AF management includes the use of
      anti-arrhythmic drugs to control the arrhythmia.

      An alternative to treatment of AF using drug therapy is ablation of cardiac tissue, with the
      goal of disrupting the aberrant electrical pathways that cause AF through the creation of
      ablation lesions within the left atrium. There are several different approaches to creating
      lesions to treat AF, although both substrate derived and focal AF mechanisms share a common
      ablation therapy protocol in which the PVs are isolated by a series of ablation lines placed
      endocardially, either around the PV ostia or more proximally from the PV ostia at the atrial
      carinae.

      The Over-the-Wire Mesh Ablation System (OTW MAS) catheter is a combined mapping and ablation
      catheter designed to create lesions at the PV ostium. The Genesis Feasibility Study is
      designed to collect clinical information on the use of the OTW MAS to access and perform
      electrophysiological mapping, cardiac stimulation and radiofrequency ablation in the region
      of the pulmonary vein (PV) ostia for the treatment of patients with Paroxysmal Atrial
      Fibrillation (PAF).
