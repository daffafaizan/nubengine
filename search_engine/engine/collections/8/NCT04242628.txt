      on physical and mental health of older people. The experiment is carried out on 180
      participants of the Brain Aging in Abbiategrasso Study (InveCe).The InveCE study is a
      biannual cohort study of older people born between 1935 and 1939 and living in Abbiategrasso,
      a town near Milan, in northern Italy (NCT01345110, ClinicalTrials.gov). For more information,
      see http://www.golgicenci.it/en/studio-invece/.

      Participants are selected among those who agreed to take part in the 4th wave of the
      InveCe.Ab study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified in the Eligibility box below.
      The study is constituted of two stages, i.e. the baseline and the follow up. The experiment
      is structured into two treatment groups and a control group; the interventions are the
      attendance to a course on SNS use (T1) and lifestyle education and brain functioning (T2).
      The control group (C) is constituted of a waiting list. Participant are assigned to one of
      these three groups randomly. Before/after the intervention, researchers administered a
      questionaire to participants to measure levels of loneliness, depression and
      neuropsychological functioning (see the box "Outcome Measure" for the description of the
      scales and measures used), together with a medical examination. The same assessment will be
      performed after one year. Data collected will be analyzed using statistical techniques in
      order to evaluate the impact of Facebook use on well-being.

      The study is part of the project "Aging in a networked society. Older people, social networks
      and well-being", funded by the Italian Fondazione Cariplo.
