      subjects with Parkinson's disease. The current study examines the differential microbiome of
      the gut in subjects with parkinsonism. The current study determines whether certain
      Parkinson's subtypes are prone to pro-inflammatory microbiomes. This study also explores
      whether the intestinal microbiome in post-appendectomy Parkinson's subjects is modified as
      appendix has a role in regulating intestinal microbiome. The current study will examine
      whether microbiome changes influence inflammatory markers in the blood.
