      education intervention on men's attitudes towards, and participation in, sexual and
      reproductive health, maternal, newborn and child health, and equitable and non-violent
      relationships with their children and partners. The MenCare+/ Bandebereho program is a
      multi-component comprehensive intervention being implemented by the Rwanda Men's Resource
      Center (RWAMREC) and Promundo-US, in collaboration with the Rwanda Ministry of Health and
      local authorities in Karongi, Musanze, Nyaruguru and Rwamagana districts. The proposed study
      will evaluate one component of the program, a 15-session group education intervention
      targeting young fathers and mothers. The impact of the fathers' group education will be
      assessed through a randomized control trial design with an intervention arm of men and women
      participating in the father groups and a control arm of men and women who do not participate
      in the intervention. The study will collect quantitative and qualitative data over a period
      of approximately three years.
