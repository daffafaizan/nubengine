    
      -  Primary Study Objective: To evaluate the disease control rate (DCR) of gefitinib as
           third-line retreatment in stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with EGFR 19del/L858R positive mutation
           patients who had benefited from first-line gefitinib treatment with EGFR 19del/L858R
           positive mutation and tumor progression after the second-line chemotherapy

        -  Secondary Study Objectives: To evaluate objective response rate (ORR), progressive-free
           survival (PFS), overall survival(OS) and quality of life (QoL) of gefitinib as
           third-line retreatment in NSCLC patients To evaluate the safety of gefitinib as
           third-line treatment in NSCLC patients

        -  Exploratory analyses: To dynamically monitor EGFR mutation status and explore the
           relationship with clinical outcome
