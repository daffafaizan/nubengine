      years. It provides energy and essential fatty acids. Commercial fatty emulsion products
      mostly come from soy bean. The omega 6 fatty acids make up with the major fatty acids of this
      fat emulsion, and lack of omega 3 fatty acids generally. The imbalance of these two types of
      fatty acids may impact with negative clinical outcomes.

      There are lots of omega 3 fatty acids makes up with fish oil emulsion, especially with
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).Few clinical studies found its
      clinical efficacy in recently years. A commercial product of omega 3 fat emulsion by
      Fresenius-Kabi was registered in Europe at 1998. There is no any clinical trial in Asia to
      elaborate the efficacy of omega 3 fat emulsion, as well the lack of large scale clinical
      trial in the world.

      Currently study is the first large scale, randomized, double blind and multi-center clinical
      trial to elaborate the impact of fish oil fat emulsion in Asia and Europe.
