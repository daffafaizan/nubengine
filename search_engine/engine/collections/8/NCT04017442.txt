      randomized into two groups, intervention and placebo. Baseline demographic data and surveys
      in regards to postpartum depression, anxiety, breastfeed willingness and pain scores will be
      obtained. After delivery of the baby patients will either receive 2mg preservative free
      morphine or saline via the epidural catheter prior to its removal. The study team will then
      record pain and recovery scores, as well as follow up screens to the aforementioned
      endpoints. The study will end at the 6 week postpartum visit with the patient's obstetrician.
