      coronary artery bypass grafting with and without cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with
      independent risk factors for the development of postoperative complications (advanced age,
      diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)
      with various types of anesthesiology benefits (general anesthesia and thoracic epidural
      analgesia versus general anesthesia and opioids). Investigators predict a decrease in the
      risk of developing cardiac, respiratory, infectious and renal complications, a reduction in
      the duration of intensive care, inpatient treatment and mortality.
