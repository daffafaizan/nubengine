    
      This is a randomized, double - blind, placebo - controlled, parallel - group, multicenter,
      Phase 3 study to evaluate the immunogenic equivalence of a heterologous prime - boost regimen
      using 3 different batches of Ad26.ZEBOV in healthy adult participants. The study consists of
      a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a vaccination period in which participants will be
      vaccinated at baseline (Day 1), followed by a boost vaccination on Day 57, and a
      post-vaccination phase until 6 months post-boost visit (Day 237). The participants will be
      randomized at baseline (on Day 1) in a 2:2:2:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
