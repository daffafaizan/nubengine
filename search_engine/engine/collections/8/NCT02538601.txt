      of the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster on September 11th 2001 and are often comorbid.
      Cigarette smoking is a modifiable health behavior associated with both lower respiratory
      symptoms (LRS) and PTSD. Smoking cessation programs are considered the crucial front-line
      intervention for smokers with pulmonary problems. Unfortunately, trauma exposed smokers with
      elevated PTSD symptoms have greater difficulty quitting, are more likely to fail standard
      cessation programs, and are more likely to relapse than smokers with other anxiety disorders
      and those without mental illness. Interventions that concurrently target mechanisms thought
      to maintain the comorbidity between PTSD and LRS (e.g., anxious reactivity to nicotine
      withdrawal, smoking to reduce negative affect) may offer a means of improving smoking quit
      rates in trauma exposed populations. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy
      of a combined CBT smoking cessation treatment enhanced with transdiagnostic skills for the
      management of anxiety and fear-based avoidance behaviors (CBT-A). The investigators
      randomized 90 WTC disaster exposed daily smokers with elevated PTSD symptoms to either CBT-A
      (N=44) or a standard CBT-based smoking cessation program (CBT-S; N=46). Participants were
      followed up to six months post-treatment.
