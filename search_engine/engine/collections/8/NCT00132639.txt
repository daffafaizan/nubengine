      are under way in early stage (clinical stage IB-II) nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In
      each trial, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is employed. Although platinum-based doublet
      is the treatment of choice for advanced NSCLC, risk/benefit balance might well be different
      in earlier stages. There have been no prospective randomized trials to choose an optimal
      preoperative chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC.

      Comparison: Preoperative cisplatin-docetaxel combination versus docetaxel monotherapy in
      clinical stage IB/II NSCLC.
