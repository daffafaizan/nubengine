      a chronic or relapsing inflammation of the gut. Its aetiology is largely unknown, limiting
      the development of preventive and curative therapeutic options. In 2001, we have identified
      the first CD susceptibility gene: CARD15/NOD2. This gene is involved in the innate immune
      response but we do not know today how gene mutations may induce the disease lesions. However,
      many data suggest that the intestinal inflammation may be related with an abnormal function
      of the lymphoid tissue present in the gut.

      The aim of the present proposal is to better understand the role of CARD15/NOD2 mutations
      (R702W, G908R and 1007fs) in the development and the function of the intestinal lymphoid
      tissue. 250 patients and controls will be enrolled at Robert Debré and Saint Louis Hospital
      (Paris, France) within a 2 years period.

      For participant, 4 to 5 ileal biopsies will be taken during a routine colonoscopy. Patients
      will be classed in three groups according to their number of CARD15/NOD2 mutations (1)
      wild-type, 2) mutated heterozygotes and 3) mutated homozygotes or compound heterozygotes). A
      comparison between groups and with non inflammatory (colonoscopy performed for other reasons)
      or inflammatory (ulcerative colitis patients) controls will be done. For each group, cell
      phenotype, cytokine profile, permeability and bacterial translocation will be analysed on
      Peyer's patches.

      The project is based on adult and paediatric cohorts among the largest ones in Paris and
      located at Saint Louis and Robert Debré hospitals. Experiments will be performed at INSERM
      Unit U843 in collaboration with the department of immunology and statistics, Robert Debré
      Hospital.
