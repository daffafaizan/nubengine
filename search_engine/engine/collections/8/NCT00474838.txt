      diabetes. Although the relative importance of these two alterations is controversial, growing
      evidence is swinging to the concept that there is no hyperglycemia without β-cell
      dysfunction. Also there is agreement that deterioration of glucose tolerance over time is
      associated with a progressive decrease of beta cell function.

      Beside the role of genetic factor, the continuous decline in β-cell function is affected by
      glucotoxicity generated by hyperglycemia and lipotoxicity due to high fatty acid. A vicious
      cycle of hyperglycemia per se further impairs and may destroy β-cell. Recently, many reports
      have shown that early intensive glycemic control plays a role in the prevention of
      progressive ß-cell function and worsening of diabetes.

      Some studies have shown that early intensive insulin therapy(IIT) to achieve near
      normoglycemia in new onset type 2 diabetes gives short term and long term improvement in
      glycemic control after discontinuation of insulin. It is suggested that long term glycemic
      control is associated with improvement of β-cell function.

      In the unpublished previous pilot study, the investigators found that early intensive insulin
      therapy using multiple daily injection (MDI) or daily twice injection in newly diagnosed type
      2 diabetes can significantly improve the beta cell function and facilitate further long term
      glycemic control. To establish the effectiveness of intensive insulin therapy for long term
      glycemic control and improvement of β-cell function, the investigators will perform a
      randomized controlled prospective study in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in Korea.
