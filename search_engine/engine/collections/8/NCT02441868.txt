      life. In home hospice care family caregivers are expected to assist their family member with
      symptom management. This is often accomplished with little or no training.

      The investigators have developed a bundle of training materials targeted for family
      caregivers of home hospice patients at risk for shortness of breath. The investigators will
      pilot test the intervention in this clinical trial. A future randomized clinical trial is
      planned and the evidence from this pilot will enhance the planning of that future trial.
