      management of LVDD in cirrhosis, but the previous study could not demonstrate the role of
      ivabradine alone in absence of betablocker therapy. This trial will be a validation cohort
      for the initial data obtained on this novel drug. The use of ivabradine can treat patients
      who do not tolerate betablocker therapy due to contraindications or adverse effects
      especially hypotension.
