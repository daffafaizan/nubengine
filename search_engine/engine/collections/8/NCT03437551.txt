    
      Purpose: This study is designed to evaluate the prevalence of different stages of diabetic
      retinopathy and diabetic macular edema among patients suffering from type 1 diabetes for 5 to
      25 years and have been treated with intensified insulin therapy aiming near-normal blood
      glucose levels for the whole duration of disease.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to examine the prevalence (percentages) of the stages of
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) within one cross-sectional
      examination. Key secondary/exploratory objectives are the prevalence (percentages) of the
      stages of diabetic macular edema (DME), the means of individual average
      5year-/10year-/15year-/20year-/25year-HbA1c value (%) as a measure for long-term glycemic
      control, the means of individual average 5year-/10year-/15year-/20year-/25year-blood pressure
      (mmHg) as a measure for long-term blood pressure control, mean BCVA score, mean contrast
      sensitivity score, mean NEI-VFQ 25 score (for further details see section Objectives).

      Study design: Non-interventional cross-sectional investigator initiated study. The study will
      be conducted at Vista Klinik Binningen/Switzerland (ophthalmological evaluations) and the
      Department of Endocrinology of the University Hospital Basel/Switzerland (patient
      recruitment).

      Study population: All patients with DM Type 1 with a least 5 years and maximum 25 years
      disease duration and intensified insulin therapy for the whole duration of disease, who are
      currently in follow-up for their DM1 at Department of Endocrinology of the University
      Hospital Basel/Switzerland. In order to prevent selection bias, patients will be screened for
      enrollment consecutively. For In-/exclusion criteria see section Eligibility.

      Investigational and reference therapy: None.

      Assessments:

        -  Visual acuity measurements using the ETDRS-like testing charts at a test distance of 4
           meters

        -  Contrast sensitivity

        -  Ophthalmic examinations (slit lamp exam with fundus biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure)

        -  High resolution optical coherence tomography (Spectralis-OCT)

        -  Stereoscopic fundus photography

        -  Fluorescein angiography

        -  NEI-VFQ 25 (25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire)
