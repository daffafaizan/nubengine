      of the head and neck, although past trials have not demonstrated its feasibility.

      Valproic acid (VA) is a modifier of epigenetic events as it is an histone deacetylase
      inhibitor and causes DNMT degradation. The histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g. VA)
      encompasses a new class of anti-tumor drugs, that can affect multiple pathways related to
      tumor initiation and progression due to histone and non-histone protein acetylation and DNMT
      degradation. VA promote histone acetylation when orally administered with a dose of 20-40
      mg/kg, per day or 1000/1500 mg, per day.

      Initially the authors will study saliva from participants documenting if there is saliva
      histone acetylation and if a difference in DNMT expression in saliva exists when comparing
      valproic acid arm to placebo arm (biological validation) after giving placebo or valproic
      acid for three months.

      This will be the initial step of a bigger project. If authors prove that there will be a
      difference in histone acetylation and/or DNMT expression between groups they will launch a
      randomized, double blind, placebo control clinical trial (phase 3 clinical trial), to
      evaluate VA action as a chemopreventive agent in HNSCC patients who usually carries a high
      chance to develop recurrence (stages III/IV) or second primary malignancies (stages
      I/II/III/IV).
