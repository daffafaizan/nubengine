    
      Preeclampsia (PEC) is a heterogeneous disease that complicates 5-8% of pregnancies.
      Approximately 10% of PEC patients will present with post-partum PEC without having developed
      the syndrome during the pregnancy (PP-PEC). Management of post-partum preeclampsia (PP-PEC)
      is challenging because many women do not seek care until neurologic symptoms result from
      severe-range elevated blood pressure. The pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of PP-PEC
      are understudied and poorly understood. Identifying clinical risk factors and biomarkers of
      PP-PEC would help to identify women at risk.
