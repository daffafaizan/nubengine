      infants and children living in malaria-endemic areas as part of the Expanded Program of
      Immunization (EPI). 30% efficacy against clinical malaria and 58% efficacy against severe
      malaria disease was seen with a related vaccine, RTS,S/AS02A, in children aged 1 to 4 years
      (Malaria-026) in Mozambique. The efficacy against clinical malaria and infection was
      sustained beyond 18 months. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccines have been developed in parallel with the
      RTS,S/AS02 vaccines, and differ in the adjuvant formulation which has been shown to be more
      immunogenic.The utility of a partially effective vaccination depends heavily on the overall
      effect of malaria incidence during a child"s acquisition of natural immunity. However, other
      cohorts vaccinated in Phase II studies have already discontinued follow up for episodes of
      malaria, and the planned Phase III studies will run for at most 30 months post vaccination.
      The proposed extended follow up is expected to run for four years and will inform the design
      of Phase 4 studies and may prove critical in informing public health policy once the vaccine
      is licensed.
