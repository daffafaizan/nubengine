           The aim of clinical test is to collect BMI, body fat, total body water, muscle mass,
           bone mass, calorie, and visceral fat reading value which measured by DUT and reference
           device.

        2. Target Subject:

           The subject database shall contain at least 30 male and 30 female subjects and all above
           10 years old.

        3. Test procedures:

             1. Record the name, age, gender, and height of each subject.

             2. Let subject seated calmly for two minutes before test, dry the feet.

             3. Use device to measure weight, body fat, total body water, bone mass, and muscle
                mass; record reading value.

             4. For each subject, repeat 3) to get 3 pairs measurements.

             5. Repeat step 1) to 4) for every device (DUT: GBF-835-N2, GBF-835-N2 Plus, LS202-B1,
                LS202-B1 Plus, LS206-E1, LS206-E1 Plus, GBF-1251-B1, and GBF-1251-B1 Plus; and
                reference device: GBF-1251-B and BC-533).

             6. Repeat step 1) to 5) for each subject.

        4. Note:

             1. No motion and speaking are allowed during the measurement.

             2. All DUT use the same algorithms and contact the patient at the same body locations
                (feet), and operate on the same frequency.

             3. Test environment: Temperature: 22±1℃; Relative humidity: 40~70%.
