      aneurismal hemorrhage has been based on three major approaches: increasing arterial pressure
      and cerebral blood flow with the use of triple H therapy, increasing the ischemic threshold
      of neurons with nimodipine and reopening proximal arteries with angioplasty and/or
      intra-arterial administration of nimodipine, verapamil, milrinone or papaverine. Recently,
      several teams have observed the efficacy of diverse statins in the prevention of vasospasm by
      improving the imbalance between the nitric oxide and the endothelin pathways, a major actor
      in the physiopathology of vasospasm. Indeed, this family of molecules improve the
      bioavailability of endogenous nitric oxide and upregulate the endothelial NO synthase.

      In humans, statin administered within the first 72 hours showed to significantly reduce the
      incidence of vasospasm up to 50% an therefore, induce a lower morbidity and mortality of this
      severely ill population. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that atorvastatin reduces
      the incidence of cerebral vasospasm-related morbidity and mortality within 1 year post
      aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) treated by either clipping or endovascular coiling.
