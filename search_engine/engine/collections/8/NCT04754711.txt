        -  During sickle cell disease, the decrease in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in children is
           very common: 19 and 56% depending on the studies

        -  children with sickle cell disease have an increase in resting energy expenditure of
           15-20%

        -  children with sickle cell disease have a significant decrease in muscle mass

        -  there are no specific nutritional recommendations for sickle cell disease in children

      Our main purpose is to assess the effects of an increase in nutritional intake on the bone
      mineral density of children with sickle cell disease, for 12 months

      Our secondary objectives are :

        1. / Evaluate the effects of an increase in nutritional intake on: body composition, height
           and weight growth, frequency of complications of sickle cell disease, school
           absenteeism, cardiac function, cerebral vasculopathy, biological parameters follow-up,
           and the relationship with the treatment started

        2. / Creation of a sero-type blood bank for future research
