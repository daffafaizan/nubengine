      reflexion. If they accept to participate to the study, they will be randomised in one of the
      two groups : foot reflexology or "toucher massage" (for those randomised in the "toucher
      massage" group, a session of foot reflexology will be proposed in a second time). The
      investigators will assess the level of anxiety, the quality of the sleep and the pain using
      the ESAS scale, before and after the session. 24 hours after the session, they will be
      interviewed about what they felt with the session. The investigators will also have a look on
      the anxiolytic and antagic medication they consume before and after the session.
