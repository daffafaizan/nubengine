      beta-like cells in vivo in type 1 diabetes models. Aiming to eventually apply these findings
      to type 1 diabetic patients, we initiated multiple screens seeking for compounds inducing
      alfa-to-beta-cell conversion. Using the mouse as a model, we thereby found that GABA
      (gamma-aminobutyric acid) could promote a cycle of conversion of alfa-cells into functional
      beta-like cells,GABA being considered as a non-harmful food supplement, one could envision a
      trial in type 1 diabetic patients. Indeed, a putative cure for type 1 diabetes may include
      halting the autoimmune insult to the pancreatic beta-cells and restoring insulin secretion by
      expanding beta-cell mass by beta-cell-regeneration and/or preventing beta-cell apoptosis
      induced by cytokines. Immunosuppression initiated at the onset of type 1 diabetes has been
      shown to preserve beta-cell function, but is associated with significant toxicities. Other
      studies using nicotinamide and parenteral insulin have failed to prevent development of type
      1 diabetes.

      Objectives Primary objective: To investigate the effect and safety of the dietary supplement
      GABA provided at a dose of 6 g daily compared to placebo for 12 weeks on change in beta-cell
      function in patients with C-peptide negative type 1 diabetes as an adjunctive therapy to
      insulin treatment.

      Population A total of 30 patients with C-peptide negative type 1 diabetes, randomised 2:1
      GABA: Placebo.

      Intervention After randomisation patients are treated with the dietary supplement GABA or
      matching placebo, titrated to 3 x 2g, or maximum tolerated dose, for 12 weeks. The insulin
      dose is reduced if needed according to Self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) and hypoglycaemic
      episodes.
