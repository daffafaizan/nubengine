      commonly present in the human diet. Accumulating data demonstrate a causal role for dietary
      flavanols in mediating the cardiovascular benefits associated with the consumption of
      flavanol-/procyanidin-containing foods. In this context, there exists a great interest in
      understanding the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of flavanols in
      humans. While significant advances in understanding the ADME of flavanols were made, the data
      obtained thus far remain fairly preliminary and with significant shortfalls and seeming
      contradictions. Aimed at addressing the challenges and gaps of previous investigations, this
      study will investigate the ADME of (-)-epicatechin, one of the most abundant dietary
      flavanols, following the intake of radiolabeled (-)-[2-14C]epicatechin by healthy humans
      observing a flavanol-/procyanidin-controlled background diet.
