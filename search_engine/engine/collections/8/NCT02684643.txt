      nephrologist for the past two decades. Elevated phosphate contributes to secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, elevated FGF23 levels, and vascular calcification, which in turn
      predispose to mortality in this population. Current guidelines recommend limiting dietary
      phosphate intake, strengthening dialysis and using phosphate binders as three therapies for
      treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Yet exact clinical implication remains ambiguous: how intense
      restricted phosphate intake should be and how dosage of phosphate binders and dialysis should
      be adjusted accordingly. Thus, treatments of hyperphosphatemia have not been effective
      enough, but appear to be refractory. In the current study, the investigators designed
      individualized phosphate-lowering therapy based on each patient's phosphate-clearing ability,
      in order to observe and compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the individualized
      therapy and the regular guideline-recommended therapy.
