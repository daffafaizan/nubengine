      the many medical co-morbidities associated with anorexia nervosa, the most common is
      significant bone loss, which can persist despite weight recovery. Nearly 90% of women with
      anorexia nervosa have osteopenia and this low bone mass is associated with an increased
      fracture risk. Nearly 30% of women with anorexia nervosa report a history of a fracture and a
      prospective study demonstrated a 7-fold increased risk of fracture in women with anorexia
      nervosa compared to age-matched controls. Because anorexia nervosa is a chronic disease that
      can persist despite psychiatric and nutritional counseling, the bone loss and increased
      fracture risk can persist and lead to lifelong morbidity. Therefore, finding a treatment for
      bone loss associated with anorexia nervosa is of critical importance.

      This 18-month randomized, placebo-controlled study will investigate in women (ages 20 to 45
      years old) with anorexia nervosa whether treatment with transdermal estrogen replacement will
      increase bone mineral density (BMD).
