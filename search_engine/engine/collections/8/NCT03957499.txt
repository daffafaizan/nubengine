    
      Different modes of analgesia are given prior to neuraxial blockade for pain relief like
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), opioids and peripheral nerve blocks such as,
      femoral nerve block, 3 in 1 block or fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB).

      FICB is believed to be most beneficial compared to other procedures because of its safety and
      efficacy . FICB provides blockage of at least two of the three major nerves that supply the
      medial, anterior and lateral thigh with one simple injection, namely the femoral and lateral
      femoral cutaneous nerves.

      FICB is an anterior approach to the lumbar plexus. The pop technique using fascial click had
      a low success rate of 35% - 47% .However, as the FICB was performed under real-time
      ultrasound guidance, the success rate was increased up to 82- 87%, leading to an increased
      interest in FICB as a postoperative analgesia option for hip and knee surgical procedures .
