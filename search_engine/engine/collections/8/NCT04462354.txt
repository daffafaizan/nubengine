    
      Background: Postoperative pancreatic fistula is currently the most frequent complications
      after duodenopancreatectomy. There are currently no RCT comparing two of the most frequently
      used method of pancreato-enteric anastomosis (invaginating pancreatogastric anastomosis
      versus Blumgart anastomosis)

      Hypothesis: in patients with resectable pancreatic and periampullary tumors, performing a
      Blumgart (AB) anastomosis for pancreatoenteric reconstruction after duodenopancreatectomy
      decreases the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (PPF) compared to to pancreatogastric
      anastomosis.

      Main goal: To comparatively evaluate the rate of PPF in patients with pancreatic and
      periampullary tumors undergoing cephalic duodenopancreatectomy after reconstruction with
      Blumgart anastomosis or pancreatogastric anastomosis.
