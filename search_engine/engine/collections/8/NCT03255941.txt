      of Sindh province propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to provide evidence that could
      change current policies in Pakistan that forbid initiation of DMPA by Lady Health Workers
      (LHWs). Positive findings on the safety and effectiveness of LHW-initiation of DMPA may also
      prompt the WHO to consider modifying the recommendation for targeted M&E for lay health
      worker provision of intramuscular injectable contraceptives. The trial will compare the
      screening and counseling of (LHWs)-the main lay health worker cadre--with that of Family
      Welfare Workers (FWWs) who are clinically-trained. The Government of Sindh province also
      expressed interest in introducing Pfizer's subcutaneous form of Depo Provera, Sayana Press®
      (SP) in Pakistan, which could simplify administration of injectable contraceptives. As such,
      an SP arm will be included in the trial, which will be facilitated by relevant training of
      LHWs and FWWs by Jhpiego and stocks provided by a special USAID procurement, since the
      registration process for SP in Pakistan is ongoing. A successful RCT demonstrating the
      non-inferiority of LHWs vis á vis FWWs on first-dose initiation of Depo Provera IM (DMPA IM)
      and (SP) would facilitate efforts to expand CBA2I in Pakistan, and in turn improve access to
      family planning services for a potentially large number of underserved women.
