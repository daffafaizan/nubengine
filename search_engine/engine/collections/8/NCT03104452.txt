      delivery . This occurs even though half who smoke quit during the course of pregnancy. This
      is an observational, cohort study of pregnant women who smoked in the six months before
      becoming pregnant. Women will be followed from the first trimester to one year after the
      birth of their babies. The results of this study will help us to describe women's' views on
      the quality of tobacco counseling they receive from their doctors; understand patterns of
      smoking and quitting throughout pregnancy and after childbirth; and provide information
      needed to develop an intervention to help women quit.
