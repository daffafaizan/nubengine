      Service (NHS) frontline diagnostic imaging test for COVID-19, in conjunction with clinical
      history and key blood markers: C-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphopenia. Typically, every
      suspected COVID-19 patient presenting to the emergency department is undergoing blood tests
      and a chest radiograph. Therefore, it has become critical for radiologists to review and
      "hot" report the chest x-ray urgently.

      Primary Objective: Use chest radiographs and clinical data to determine whether patient can
      survive with a ventilator
