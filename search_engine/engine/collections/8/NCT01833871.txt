      Doppler Sonography has the potential to detect fluctuations in blood flow , with results
      superior to those of frequency-based color Doppler sonography, particularly in situations of
      low-velocity blood flow. Three dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography can be applied to
      differentiate between uterine adenomyosis and leiomyoma ,and it may reduce the number of
      false positives by detailed investigations.
