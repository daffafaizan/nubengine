      pretreatment uracil level-guided dose individualization in wildtype patients. Patients with a
      pretreatment serum uracil concentration above 16 ng/ml will be treated with a 50% reduced
      fluoropyrimidine starting dose. The pretreatment serum uracil levels in DPYD variant carriers
      will be assessed retrospectively and non-interventional. Additionally, the effect of a higher
      dose reduction in c.1236G>A and c.2846A>T DPYD variants carriers (50% instead of 25%) will be
      studied.
