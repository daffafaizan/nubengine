      progression free survival and overall survival in women with advanced ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or peritoneal cancer who attained complete remission on initial platinum (carboplatin
      or cisplatin) and paclitaxel based chemotherapy. II. Assess the toxic effects associated with
      prolonged paclitaxel administration in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by stage (optimal stage III vs
      suboptimal stage III vs stage IV), prior treatments with paclitaxel (over at least 24 hours
      vs over less than 24 hours), and age (65 and under vs over 65). Patients are randomized to
      one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1.
      Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or 1
      year from registration, then every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients (225 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 5 years.
