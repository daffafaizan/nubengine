      of maternal morbidity with well documented health consequences for the mother, child, and
      family. While the cause of PPD remains unclear, research consistently demonstrates the
      importance of psychosocial variables. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to
      evaluate the effect of peer (mother-to-mother) support on the prevention of PPD among mothers
      identified as high-risk. Public health nurses using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
      (EPDS) screened mothers who were less than 2 weeks postpartum in the regions of Toronto,
      Peel, Halton, York, Windsor, Sudbury, and Ottawa. Eligible and consenting mothers were
      randomized to either a control group (usual postpartum care) or experimental group (usual
      postpartum care plus telephone-based support from an experienced mother who has participated
      in a 4-hour training session). Diverse study outcomes, including depressive symptomatology
      and health service utilization, were assessed at 12 and 24 weeks postpartum. The results from
      this trial will make substantive contributions in six areas: (1) develop the body of
      knowledge concerning the effectiveness of peer support in the prevention of PPD among at-risk
      mothers; (2) advance our understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of using peer
      volunteers as a complementary form of health care; (3) provide an economic evaluation of a
      peer support intervention; (4) offer a detailed analysis of peer support interactions
      including supportive functions provided, types of relationships developed, and health
      benefits perceived; (5) investigate the utility of screening at-risk mothers using the EPDS
      in general public health nursing practice; and (6) present valuable information regarding PPD
      among a multicultural Canadian population.
