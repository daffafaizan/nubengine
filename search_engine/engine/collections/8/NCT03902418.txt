      1. Determine the distribution of women across the PrEP cascade:

        1. Evaluate the proportion of pregnant and breastfeeding women who initiate PrEP out of all
           women offered PrEP

        2. Evaluate the proportion of pregnant and breastfeeding women who are retained in the PrEP
           cohort

        3. Evaluate the proportion of pregnant and breastfeeding women who initiate PrEP who adhere
           to PrEP using objective dried blood spot measures and subjective measures of
           self-reported pill count and adherence

        4. Evaluate the proportion of pregnant and breastfeeding women on PrEP (and not on PrEP)
           who acquire HIV, who transmit HIV to their infant, and who report adverse events 2.
           Evaluate patient and provider-level factors associated with the PrEP cascade using
           quantitative and qualitative approaches (including in-depth interviews) 3. Apply an
           established mathematical model to simulate the impact of improvement in the PrEP cascade
           on HIV infections averted (maternal and perinatal)
