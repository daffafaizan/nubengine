      (premolars) should be included in the study. The sealer and cut will be randomly determined
      at time of endodontic treatment, originating four groups (n = 12): AH Plus-Cervical, MTA
      Fillapex-Cervical, AH Plus-2mm and MTA-2mm. The endodontic access cavities will be sealed
      with resin composed of the color of the dental element. The mean, standard deviation and
      confidence interval (CI 95%) of the values of ΔE00 obtained for each sealer will be initially
      analyzed using the variable cut level (cervical or 2mm) using the T test. Indeed, the values
      of ΔE00 will be analyzed by two-way analysis of variance, where the level of the cut and the
      type of sealer will be the factors under study.
