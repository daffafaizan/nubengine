        -  To enrol and follow-up a large group of people with acute hepatitis C infection to
           examine why some people naturally clear hepatitis C and some don't.

        -  To examine how many people become re-infected after having cleared hepatitis C and to
           look at why this happened.

      The study will also offer everyone taking part the option of undergoing a 6 month course of
      pegylated interferon alfa 2a (plus ribavirin if HIV coinfected) as treatment for hepatitis C.
      The purpose of this part of the study is:

      1. To examine whether treatment is effective in clearing the virus.
