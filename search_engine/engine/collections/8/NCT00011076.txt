      and mortality in HCM. These abnormalities are believed to be in part due to myocardial
      fibrosis which frequently complicates HCM. Several studies indicate that pirfenidine can
      safely inhibit progression or cause regression of fibrotic lesions. We therefore propose to
      perform a six-month study that examines the ability of pirfenidone to improve LV diastolic
      dysfunction, exercise performance, and electrophysiologic abnormalities in symptomatic
      patients with severe HCM.
