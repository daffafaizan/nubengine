      psychophysiologic reactivity measures. Trained research assistants will collect
      psychophysiologic reactivity data. The investigators will collect the 3-month data in-person.
      At 6-months, self-report data will be collected in-person. If study participant is unable to
      complete the 6-month assessment in person the investigators will attempt to collect the
      self-report data by phone. The study instruments have all been previously administered by
      telephone. The project coordinator will schedule and track the participants using the
      telephone. The project coordinator will call participants to remind them about follow-up
      appointments. The consent form will also include the name and phone number of at least one
      contact person.

      Psychophysiologic reactivity measures will be collected first to minimize fatigue. In
      addition, the psychophysiologic reactivity measures are context dependent and the
      investigators do not want the psychophysiologic measures to be primed by symptom reporting.
      Heart rate variability data will be collected at baseline for five minutes prior to other
      testing and then continued during eye gaze tracking and modified Stroop testing.
