        1. To evaluate the impact of adjunctive IVM to DP MDA on malaria transmission in
           communities with high ITN coverage.

        2. To evaluate the impact of IVM MDA on An. gambiae population density and age-structure.

        3. To evaluate the impact of IVM MDA on the prevalence of co-endemic IVM-susceptible
           Neglected Tropical Diseases (lymphatic filariasis, soil transmitted helminths and
           scabies)

        4. To evaluate acceptability, feasibility and access to MDA as a strategy for malaria
           control and to identify the most acceptable way of achieving and sustaining high
           coverage MDA with IVM and DP.

      This cluster-randomized placebo-controlled trial has two arms. A total of 24 clusters will be
      randomly assigned to receive DP + IVM MDA or DP+ Placebo MDA using computer-generated random
      numbers. To mitigate against contamination effects, the majority of clusters will be separate
      islands and will be separated by distances greater than 2km. On the two islands that are
      divided (each into two clusters), a buffer zone of 2km between each cluster will be ensured.
      The total population of the archipelago is 24,000. The investigators will ensure balance
      between trial arms with respect to population size, baseline Plasmodium falciparum prevalence
      and access to health care. All clusters will receive the standard programmatic malaria
      control interventions implemented by the National Malaria Control Programme which includes
      insecticide-treated nets (ITN), intermittent preventative treatment in pregnancy (IPTp),
      seasonal malarial chemoprophylaxis (SMC) for children aged 3-59 months and case diagnosis and
      treatment (CDT) with Artemether-lumefantrine.
