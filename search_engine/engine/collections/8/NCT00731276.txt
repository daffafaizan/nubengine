      Primary

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan
           hydrochloride according to the genotype status of Asian patients with solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan hydrochloride and its metabolites
           SN-38 and SN-38G.

        -  To evaluate time to tumor response, response duration, and time to progression in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to genotype status (UGT1A1*28 vs UGT1A1*6)

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every
      4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic,
      and pharmacodynamic studies.
