      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and tremelimumab in patients with
      muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer who are ineligible for neoadjuvant
      cisplatin-containing chemotherapies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses (e.g. peripheral blood cluster of
      differentiation [CD] 4+inducible T-cell co-stimulator [ICOS]+ T cells) to durvalumab and
      tremelimumab in patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer who are ineligible
      for neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapies.

      II. To evaluate pathologic T0 rate after neoadjuvant treatment with durvalumab and
      tremelimumab in patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer comparing to
      historical data (about 10% in patients with high-risk disease).

      III. To evaluate relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on
      day 1 of weeks 1 and 4. Beginning 4-6 weeks after the last infusion, patients undergo
      cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days, and then every 3
      months for up 1 year.
