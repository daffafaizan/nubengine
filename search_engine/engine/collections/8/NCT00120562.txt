      weight loss, it is also associated with other biologic changes that occur in the body when
      weight is lost. In this study, subjects undergoing gastric bypass surgery will be followed
      throughout the weight loss period. They will undergo four detailed medical evaluations to
      assess changes in several biological systems that occur in the body when weight is lost.

      The initial assessment will be performed before the surgery (testing period 1). After surgery
      is completed, subjects will attend clinic visits at the Rockefeller University outpatient
      clinic. During these visits, weight and leptin levels will be monitored. Two additional
      assessments will be performed during weight loss, when subjects lose 10% and 20% of their
      initial weight (testing periods 2 and 3 respectively). A final evaluation will be performed
      after weight is stabilized, about 18 months after the surgery is completed (testing period
      4). Each testing period will be performed over a 2 week period in an inpatient setting at the
      Rockefeller University Hospital. During testing periods subjects will undergo a series of
      metabolic, behavioral, hormonal, immune and molecular tests to evaluate changes that occur in
      the body after weight loss. Subjects will receive monetary compensation for participating in
      the study.
