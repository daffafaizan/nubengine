    
      OUTLINE: This is a single center randomized clinical trial. Participant recruitment and
      enrollment will occur at Gangnam Severance Hospital Breast Cancer Center for 4 years,
      followed by one year of follow up data collection and analysis.

      Arm I (Prepectoral): immediate ADM-assisted implant-based breast reconstruction with
      prepectoral implant placement.

      Arm II (Subpectoral): immediate ADM-assisted implant-based breast reconstruction with
      subpectoral implant placement.

      This clinical study is aimed at patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and who
      have undergone a total mastectomy for the therapeutic indication, and who are planning to
      undergo implant based reconstruction and postmastectomy radiotherapy.

      It will be carried out prospectively in a single institution, and the study will be divided
      into two groups, subpectoral implant and prepectoral implant, according to the reconstruction
      method.

      A total of 96 patients or 48 patients per arm will be recruited. Randomization will be
      accomplished using randomly permuted blocks, and randomization will be stratified on the
      basis of reconstruction method. (tissue expander insertion or direct-to-implant)

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year for observation of
      capsular contracture and patient reported outcomes.
