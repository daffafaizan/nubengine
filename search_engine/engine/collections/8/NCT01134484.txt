      TD, addition of Velcade to TD increases rate of CR and nCR from 15% to 30%, respectively. For
      this purpose, symptomatic patients aged 18-65 years with previously untreated MM and
      quantifiable M-protein in serum or urine are randomized (1:1) to receive induction therapy
      comprising three 3-week cycles of Velcade 1.3 mg/sqm, days 1, 4, 8, 11, thalidomide 100 mg,
      days 1-14, cycle 1, then 200 mg daily, and dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11,
      12, or thalidomide and dexamethasone (same schedule and dosage as in VTD). Randomization to
      VTD or TD is stratified according to International Staging System disease stage at diagnosis.
      Following induction therapy, patients in both arms receive cyclophosphamide (4 g/sqm, day 0
      and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, 10 μcg/kg/day, from day +2) to collect autologous
      peripheral blood stem cells (minimum threshold CD34+ cells: 4 x 10^6/kg) and two subsequent
      courses of stem cell-supported high dose melphalan (200 mg/sqm), 3 to 6 months apart. Upon
      neutrophil (≥1 x 10^9/L) and platelet (≥75 x 10^9/L) recovery following the first
      autotransplantation, patients receive thalidomide (100 mg daily) and dexamethasone (40 mg,
      days 1-4 every 4 weeks) as bridge therapy until the day before the second transplantation.

      Patients initially randomized to receive VTD or TD induction therapy are planned to receive
      two 5-week cycles of VTD (Velcade 1.3 mg/sqm, days 1, 8, 15, 22; thalidomide 100 mg daily;
      dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23) or TD (thalidomide 100 mg daily;
      dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1-4 and 20-23) as consolidation therapy, starting 3 months after
      last transplant. Maintenance therapy comprise dexamethasone 40 mg, days 1-4, repeated monthly
      until relapse or progression.
