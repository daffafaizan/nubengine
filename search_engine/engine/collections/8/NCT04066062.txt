      Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is a robust non-invasive modality to
      evaluate the presence, extent and severity of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). For a plaque
      assessment, previous studies demonstrated that CCTA provides a high correlation with
      intravascular imaging by intravenous ultrasound (IVUS) in assessing coronary plaque
      characteristics stenosis severity and volume. High risk (vulnerable) plaque characteristics
      (positive remodeling, low attenuation plaque, spotty calcifications) are recognized to be
      more prone to rupture with increased rates of short-term cardiovascular disease events.
      Although several studies similarly demonstrated the good concordance between CCTA and IVUS or
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) in assessing high risk plaque features, patient numbers in
      these prior studies were limited to fully understand the effect of CCTA for the assessment of
      coronary atherosclerotic plaque features.

      The Research is a multi-center, registry enrolling patients with single/multi vessel
      atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The study will be conducted in up to 15 Medical
      Centers in Japan. In each patient, a CCTA, IVUS), and/ or OCT will be performed, to provide a
      total of 1,300 vessels from 1,000 patients. Thus, the full cohort (Prospective plus
      Retrospective patients) will provide a total of 2,000 vessels as basis for a diagnostic
      performance comparison between CCTA and IVUS or OCT. Accrual is expected to take 24 months.
