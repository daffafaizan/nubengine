      test strips in a digital way via a mobile application.

      Ovulation prediction kits consist of test strips that measure three different hormones - LH
      (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), PdG (pregnanediol). Through daily
      testing with the mobile application, it is possible to measure these hormones and build
      hormonal profiles along the menstrual cycle. This way we can accurately predict and confirm
      ovulation, as well as calculate the most fertile days in the cycle.

      There are multiple solutions that claim to accurately monitor fertility. However, some of
      these solutions use period statistics with high level of error, for example period trackers,
      or body temperature monitors. Some others use hormonal test strips in which
      reading/interpretation is not always easy. This study evaluates the accuracy of using hormone
      test strips in combination with an app that will digitally read and record data over time.
