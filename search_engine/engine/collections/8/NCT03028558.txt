      oral epithelium expresses nicotine receptors, and exposure of epithelia to nicotine activates
      the nicotine pathway; (2) EC vapors also contain chemical contaminants that can potentially
      effect oral epithelial biology; and (3) in vitro studies suggest that EC vapors modify
      epithelial biology and data generated by our laboratory demonstrates that even a brief, acute
      exposure of healthy nonsmokers to EC vapors induces significant changes in the airway
      epithelial transcriptome, including the expression of genes in the nicotine and p53 pathways.
      With the knowledge that disordering of cell biology occurs long before clinical disease,the
      investigators will evaluate the oral epithelium at the transcriptome (mRNA and miRNA) levels.
      They will then identify gene(s)/pathways/communities disordered by EC vapors.
