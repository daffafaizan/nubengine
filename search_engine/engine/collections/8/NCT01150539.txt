    
      Young, overweight/obese women with PCOS along with age and BMI-matched healthy controls
      without PCOS will be enrolled in this study. Participants will have assessments of body
      composition (by DEXA), visceral and ectopic fat (by MR), ovarian parameters (follicle size
      and number, by MRI) insulin sensitivity (by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), interstitial
      lipolysis (by microdialysis), whole body lipolysis and glycolysis (by stable isotopes),
      aerobic fitness (by VO2max test) and a fat biopsy performed across two clinic visits (1
      outpatient visit, and 1 overnight stay). Participants in the control group will undergo these
      assessments once only, whereas participants in the PCOS Group will have these assessments
      twice, once at baseline and once following a 16 week supervised aerobic exercise program.
      Throughout the exercise program body weight will be measured weekly and menstrual cycle
      frequency will be documented on a calendar. Additionally, vital signs, weight, waist and hip
      circumferences will be measured and a fasting blood sample collected every 4 weeks.
