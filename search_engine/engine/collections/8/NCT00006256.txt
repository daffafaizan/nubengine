        -  Determine the feasibility of concurrent paclitaxel and breast radiotherapy in women with
           stage II or III breast cancer who have had primary breast conserving surgery and
           adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Assess the cosmetic results of breast conservation after this treatment in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pulmonary toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours every 21 days for 4 courses beginning 3
      weeks after completion of the last doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide adjuvant regimen.
      Patients also undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6-7 weeks.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for the next 5
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 12-18
      months.
