3056. the localization of aortic shunts developed by a precordialregistration of i 131 injected into the aorta at different levelsa technique for localizing shunts of aortic originis described, based on the analysisof precordial records of i 131 injected at differentaortic levels.  seven patients withpatent ductus arteriosus (pda), 1 with acoronary av fistula, 2 with ventricularseptal defect (vsd), 1 with atrial septal defect(asd), 3 with mitral regurgitation,2 with aortic regurgitation and 2 with systemichypertension were studied.  retro-grade arterial catheterization by seldinger'stechnique was performed in all thepatients, as well as right-sided catheterizationin those with congenital cardiopathies,and transseptal catheterization in those withvalvulopathies.  a dose of 5-15 uc of nai 131 was injected at the levels of the aortic root,the ascending aorta, the aortic arch,the origin of the left subclavian artery (ductuslevel) and the descending aorta (post-ductus level).  precordial curves were obtained bymeans of a 2-inch thallium-acti-vated nai crystal focused over the 3rd left intercostalspace at the sternal margin.the shunt outlet can be detected by obtainingsimultaneous venous dilution curvesfrom the right chambers and the pulmonary artery.the latter technique was usedin 2 patients with pda, 1 with coronary av fistulaand 1 with vsd.  these curveswere obtained by continuous withdrawal of blood whichhad flowed through a wellscintillation counter.  the crystal pulses were carriedto ratemeters which workedwith the following time constants  0.01-0.15 sec for theprecordial curves and 0.5sec for the venous curves.  a direct recorder with a5-mm/sec paper speed wasused.  normal precordial curves after injecting abovethe aortic valve were obtainedin patients with arterial hypertension, mitral regurgitationand asd and vsd.  aswift downslope which fell down near the baseline level andthe recirculatory areawas observed.
