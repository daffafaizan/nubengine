      dietary setting, might serve as a "surrogate" for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
      (DASH) diet to lower blood pressure. This study has obvious biomedical importance. Lifestyle
      modifications are often recommended for pre- or Stage I hypertension. The DASH diet is such a
      modification that has been shown to be effective. However, this diet is costly and difficult
      to adhere to long-term. If KMgCit were shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure, it
      would provide a safe and convenient alternative to the DASH diet.
