    
      This is a non-randomized, unblinded single arm Phase II trial to evaluate the combination of
      yttrium90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and bortezomib in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle
      cell lymphoma (MCL). Standard hematology and chemistries, imaging and bone marrow biopsies
      will be done.

      Research tests: 17cc of blood will be collected at screen, Day 8 OR 11 and month 3. Samples
      will be collected and stored for future analysis. These analyses may include but are not
      limited to measurements of proteasome inhibition. No genetic studies will be performed on
      these samples. Samples will be destroyed at the end of the study.

      Primary Objective Estimate the overall response rate (CR + PR) of the combination of
      bortezomib and ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell
      lymphoma.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Estimate the progression free and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory
           mantle cell lymphoma who receive bortezomib and ibritumomab tiuxetan.

        -  Assess the toxicity of the combination of bortezomib and ibritumomab tiuxetan in
           patients with relapsed/refractory MCL.
