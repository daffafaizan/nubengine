      promoting intentional awareness of experience, coupled with attitudes of non-judgment and
      curiosity. Following the success of 8-week, manualized group interventions, mindfulness
      training has been implemented in a variety of modalities, including smartphone apps that seek
      to replicate the success of group interventions. However, although smartphone apps are
      scalable and accessible to a wider swath of population, their benefits remain largely
      untested. This study aimed to investigate a newly developed mindfulness training app called
      Wildflowers, which was co-developed with the laboratory for use in mindfulness research. It
      was hypothesized that 3 weeks of mindfulness training through this app would improve
      subjective well-being, attentional control, and interoceptive integration, albeit with weaker
      effects than those published in the 8 week, manualized group intervention literature.

      Methods: Undergraduate students completed 3 weeks of mindfulness training with Wildflowers or
      3 weeks of cognitive training with a game called 2048. State training effects were assessed
      through pre- and postsession ratings of current mood, stress level, and heart rate. Trait
      training effects were assessed through pre- and postintervention questionnaires canvassing
      subjective well-being and behavioral task measures of attentional control and interoceptive
      integration. State and trait training data were analyzed in a multilevel model using emergent
      latent factors (acceptance, awareness, and openness) to summarize the trait questionnaire
      battery.
