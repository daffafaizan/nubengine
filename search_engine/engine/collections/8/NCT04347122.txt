      significant risk of perioperative blood loss requiring transfusion. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is
      an antifibrinolytic that is commonly used to reduce blood loss in orthopedic procedures, most
      often arthroplasty. The aim of this study is to determine in a randomized controlled fashion
      if there is any difference in perioperative blood loss and blood transfusion rates when TXA
      is used compared to when it is not used in patients undergoing radical resection of bone and
      soft tissue sarcomas with endoprosthetic reconstruction.
