      therapy still retain a congestive heart failure (HF) picture. During the study, patients
      should remain on their prescribed heart failure medications and the same dosing schedule for
      the duration of the study unless investigators determine medically necessary to change.
      Patients will be assigned randomly to receive either PolyCore PUF (over the top of their
      prescribed heart failure medications), for 6 months, or to the control arm receiving stable
      medical therapy according to international guidelines and comprehensive of loop diuretic
      (furosemide) dose till to 2.5mg/kg/day, without PUF therapy. The PUF ultrafiltration will be
      performed with a single nightly exchange, with 2 liters PolyCore solution, lasting 12-14
      hours, for 6 months. An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be convened for
      this study and will review the results of the trial at regular intervals to protect patients
      participating in the study. An adaptive interim analysis will be performed when in each group
      20 patients have completed 6 months in the study, for analysis of the primary outcome. The
      purpose of the adaptive interim analysis is to calculate the final study sample size.The DSMB
      will closely examine the interim primary efficacy results, respecting the confidentiality and
      integrity of data, to investigate the final sample sizes necessary to complete the study.
