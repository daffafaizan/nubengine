      worldwide prevalence ranging from 0.7% to 29.6%. Complaints include infrequent bowel
      movement, painful defecation due to hard and/or large stools, fecal incontinence, and
      abdominal pain. Although the condition is rarely life-threatening, it strongly impairs
      quality of life. Oligosaccharides have been shown to relieve constipation symptoms in young
      adults and elderly. However, sufficient evidence is lacking linking oligosaccharides intake
      to improve symptoms in children with FC. The investigators hypothesize that oligosaccharides
      might be able to relieve symptoms of constipation in young children as well, among which
      softening stools.
