      affects females of childbearing age. The disease is characterized by immune activation and
      the development of autoantibodies.

      About 50% of SLE patients experience inflammation of the kidneys. Lupus Nephritis (LN) is a
      major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with SLE. Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF),
      accompanied by Prednisone, is considered the current standard of care for LN. However,
      long-term use of Prednisone has many serious side effects.

      ACTHar Gel is an FDA approved drug comprised of an active substance called
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH belongs to an anti-inflammatory group called
      melanocortins and carries out its effects by binding to five different melanocortin receptors
      (MCRs). Specifically, ACTH binding to melanocortin 2 receptor subtype (MC2R) on the adrenal
      cortex stimulates the production of cortisol that reduces inflammation in the kidney. In
      addition to binding to melanocortin 1-5 receptor subtype (MC1-5R) and acting directly on
      kidney tissues, ACTH may bind to MCRs on various cell types, such as immune cells, and
      activate processes to protect the kidney.

      This study will evaluate the most effective dose of ACTHar gel in proliferative LN (Class III
      and IV) when given with MMF, the standard of care LN therapy. The intent of this study is to
      determine the effectiveness and safety of ACTHar gel in an attempt to change the clinical
      care requirements regarding steroid use in treating LN.
