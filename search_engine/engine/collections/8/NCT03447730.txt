    
      In Part 1, a sentinel open-label cohort of subjects with cirrhosis and Model for End-Stage
      Liver Disease (MELD) score <12 was admitted to an inpatient facility for a run-in diet,
      baseline assessments, IMP administration, safety monitoring, and collection of blood, urine,
      and stool samples for evaluation of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations. Subjects in Part 1 were enrolled sequentially to receive
      SYNB1020. Once the safety and tolerability were established in Part 1, enrollment was opened
      to subjects in Part 2.

      Part 2 comprised a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with
      cirrhosis and hyperammonemia. Subjects were permitted to be pre-screened for eligibility
      based on medical history and a single fasting spot venous ammonia measurement. Eligible
      subjects with elevated fasting spot venous ammonia then underwent full screening within 7
      days of pre-screening. Eligible subjects were admitted to an inpatient facility for a run-in
      diet and 24-hour ammonia profile, and those with an elevated 24-hour ammonia area under the
      curve (AUC) (>1.2 Ã— the upper limit of normal [ULN]) proceeded with computer-generated
      randomization in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SYNB1020 or matching placebo. Randomization
      was followed by IMP administration, safety monitoring, and collection of blood, urine, and
      stool samples for PK and PD evaluations.
