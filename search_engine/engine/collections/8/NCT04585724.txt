      I. Prospectively evaluate safety and toxicity of the combination of radiosurgery (SRS) and
      concurrent CDK 4/6 inhibitors (CDKi) for hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer
      patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate late toxicity (after 3 months) following SRS and concurrent CDKi. II. Evaluate
      local control efficacy with combination therapy of SRS and concurrent CDKi.

      III. Assess quality of life and neurologic functional outcomes following treatment using
      standardized questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain [FACT-Br]).

      IV. Analyze overall survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive
      abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive
      ribociclib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP III: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive
      palbociclib PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 4-6 weeks post
      stereotactic radiosurgery, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.
