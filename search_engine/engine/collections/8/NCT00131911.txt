      I. To determine the objective tumor response rate of BAY 43-9006 (sorafenib tosylate) in
      patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Adverse event rate(s). II. Progression free survival and time to progression. III.
      Improvement in circulating hormone levels. IV. Overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are grouped into 2 separate analysis Groups
      according to tumor type (Group A: Carcinoid; Group B: Islet cell/other well-differentiated
      tumor). Each Group was independently evaluated for all study endpoints.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 2 years from study entry.
