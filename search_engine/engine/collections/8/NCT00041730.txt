      FavId™ and GM-CSF to mount an immune response (humoral and/or cellular) to KLH and their
      idiotype. Secondary objectives are the determination of overall objective response rate,
      duration of response and time to progression. B-cell malignancies express a unique antigen,
      the immunoglobulin idiotype (Id), on their surface. Each B-cell harbors a unique genetic
      sequence used in production of unique Id protein. No normal B-cells possess that Id on their
      cell surface. Hence, Id protein should serve as an ideal target for individualized active
      immune therapy of NHL. Many of the antigens expressed by tumors (including Id) are only weak
      immunogens. To augment the immune response against Id, the Id protein must be chemically
      coupled to a strongly immunogenic protein. keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is a commonly used
      protein carrier capable of augmenting the body's immune reaction against Id protein. For
      vaccines which produce primarily an antibody response, there is a concern that combining
      immunotherapy with Rituxan®, which produces a rapid and sustained (up to 6 to 9 months
      post-treatment in 83% of patients) depletion of circulating and tissue-based B-cells, would
      blunt any antibody response. For vaccines that induce strong T-cell responses like Id-KLH
      plus GM-CSF, there is evidence in mice that depleting the host of B-cells could actually
      increase the T-cell response to the vaccine. GM-CSF is a hematopoietic growth factor that
      stimulates T-cell proliferation. T-cell response to both the patient's Idiotype and KLH will
      be measured during this trial.
