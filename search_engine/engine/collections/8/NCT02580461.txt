      cancer family caregivers. One half of the participants enrolled will receive no exercise
      program until after twelve weeks have passed (the delayed start group) and the other half of
      the participants will start the exercise program right away. In addition to regular
      attendance at exercise classes, participants will also be asked to complete some measurements
      throughout the study including an initial assessment and one after 12 weeks and 24 weeks of
      the exercise programs. If participants are a part of the delayed start group, they will
      receive a fourth fitness assessment. Assessments include an evaluation of physical activity
      levels, quality of life, depression, sleep, and social support through survey type
      questionnaires as well as a fitness assessment to measure overall fitness and body
      composition. Participants will receive an individualized exercise program appropriate for
      their fitness level as well as 6 education sessions about healthy behaviors throughout the
      study.
