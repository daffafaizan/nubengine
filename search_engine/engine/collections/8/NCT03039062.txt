      tissue-specific, and cannot detect drug-induced liver injury (DILI) at a very early stage,
      thus unable to properly guide risk assessment and patient management. miR-122 is a
      liver-enriched miRNA. Many studies have demonstrated that miR-122 is a sensitive and specific
      biomarker when DILI occurred. However, there is a lack of a standard quantification method
      for miR-122 and confirmatory studies using a comprehensive list of drugs and patients. The
      investigators have developed the miRNA-derived Fragment Length Polymorphism (miRFLP) assay
      for the simultaneous quantification of multiple miRNAs.The methodology improves detection
      reliability by eliminating intra-assay variables. In this study, the investigators will
      investigate the role of miR-122 as a real-time detection biomarker of drug-induced liver
      injury utilizing the miRFLP assay. In addition, the investigators will try to identify the
      normal physiological range of miR-122 in healthy population and the relationship of miR-122
      and hepatic failure in patients of intensive care unit.
