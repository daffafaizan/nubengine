      resulting in a higher quality of life for the patient as well as improving social and
      psychological functioning while reducing the overall cost to society. The maintenance dose of
      methadone is highly variable between patients, and drug-drug interactions have been observed
      between methadone and various medications used to treat a variety of diseases. Identification
      and understanding of the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of methadone could
      potentially lead to improved strategy in individualizing methadone dosing and reduce the risk
      of adverse drug interactions.

      Several cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) have been identified and hypothesized to be involved
      in methadone metabolism in vitro, particularly CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. However, the quantitative
      contribution of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in the elimination clearance of methadone in vivo remains
      undefined. In addition, methadone is a substrate of the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein
      (Pgp) at the intestinal mucosa. We are proposing a pilot study in healthy human subjects to
      investigate the following hypotheses:

        1. Pgp limits the gastrointestinal absorption

        2. Inter-subject variations in CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 activities explain the variation in
           methadone clearance in vivo

      This will be accomplished by correlating the pharmacokinetics of methadone and the phenotype
      probes for Pgp (digoxin), CYP2B6 (bupropion) and CYP3A4 (midazolam). We plan to use these
      data to design a human subject study to assess the utility of MDR1 and CYP genotyping in
      predicting the methadone maintenance dose in a cohort of MMT patients.
