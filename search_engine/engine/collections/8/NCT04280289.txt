      phytocannabinoids after single dose administration of CBDE (at 2.5 mg/kg CBD). Attainment of
      this goal will provide essential information on phytocannabinoid disposition and dosing
      regimen optimization. To accomplish this objective, the working hypothesis that complex
      phytochemical mixtures present in full spectrum hemp extracts (FSHEs), as exemplified by
      CBDE, differ from purified CBD-containing products with regard to PK, will be tested. The
      approach to testing this working hypothesis will be to use liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry (LC/MS) to both characterize the phytocannabinoid concentration-time profiles
      following CBDE administration (single and multiple dosing).
