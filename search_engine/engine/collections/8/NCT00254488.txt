    
      This is the first controlled acute treatment study of bipolar disorder in adults 60 years or
      older with current DSM-IV manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes. The number of older adults
      with severe and disabling bipolar disorder is increasing, and information to guide the
      management of the treatment of the disease is lacking in this population. Guidelines for
      treatment of younger people with bipolar disorder cannot be used for older people, and there
      are no safety and efficacy data upon which to base initial treatment decisions for older
      patients with bipolar mania. Mood stabilizers (lithium and divalproex) are the first-line
      treatment for bipolar disorder. However, in aged patients physiological changes and comorbid
      diseases may increase vulnerability to side effects and limit the benefits of the
      medications.

      This double-blind study will compare the benefits and side-effects of 9 weeks of treatment
      with lithium and divalproex in people with bipolar mania. Participants, who may be treated
      during inpatient hospitalization or as outpatients, will be randomly assigned to receive
      either lithium or divalproex. During the first 3 weeks of treatment careful titration of
      lithium and divalproex will be done to reach dose ranges. All other psychotropic medications
      will be discontinued. Behavioral interventions and/or lorazepam may be added, if necessary.
      After the first 3 weeks, if symptoms do not improve, risperidone will be added to be taken
      everyday with the study medication.
