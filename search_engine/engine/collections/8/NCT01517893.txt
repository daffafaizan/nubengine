      melanocytes, and interferon-γ-induced CXCL10 plays an important role.1 Simvastatin inhibits
      interferon-γ signaling by blocking activation of STAT12 and prevented and reversed disease in
      our mouse model.3 A case report described a patient with vitiligo who repigmented with
      simvastatin.4 We conducted a small, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II
      clinical trial to test simvastatin as a treatment for vitiligo. After obtaining informed
      consent, we enrolled men ages 18 to 64 years with vitiligo affecting 3% to 50% of their body
      surface area (BSA). We excluded patients with a segmental presentation; those already taking
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; those with existing thyroid
      disease; and women, based on their increased risk of simvastatin-induced myopathy.
