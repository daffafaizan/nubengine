      chemotherapy has a number of potential advantages including increasing the chances for breast
      preservation at the time of surgery as well as it may improve the local control of the
      cancer. Several national breast cancer studies have shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
      equal to chemotherapy given following surgery.

      A standard treatment for stage II or Stage III invasive breast cancer with low HER2
      expression is combination chemotherapyAdriamycin, Cytoxan,followed by a Taxane: given either
      before or after surgery), followed by surgery +/- radiation therapy.

      The main purpose of chemotherapy however is to reduce the risk of recurrence of cancer and
      also make surgery more successful. HER2 is a receptor located on the surface of some cells.
      This receptor plays a role in regulating the growth of the cell, in addition to the growth of
      tumors. High levels of the HER2 receptor may predict those women who benefit from treatment
      with agents such as Herceptin that target HER2. Herceptin (Trastuzumab) is a drug that is
      effective both alone and in combination with standard chemotherapy. There is some data to
      suggest that patients whose tumors have low expression of the HER2 protein and are normal by
      FISH may also receive benefit from Herceptin.
