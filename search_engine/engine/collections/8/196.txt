characterization of bacillus subtilis bacteriophages .brodetsky, anna m. (university of california, los angeles), and w. r.romig . characterization of bacillus subtilis bacteriophages . j.bacteriol. 90..1655-1663. 1965.--a group of six phages, sp5, sp6, sp7,sp8, sp9, and sp13, which use the marburg strain of bacillus subtilis ashost was characterized . these phages, referred to as group 1, wereexamined for the following properties.. host range, plaque morphology,stability, adsorption kinetics, one-step growth characteristics, calciumrequirements, serum neutralization, thermal inactivation, andinactivation by ultraviolet irradiation . five unrelated b. subtilisphages, sp3, sp10, pbs1, sp alpha, and sp beta, were included in thestudies . when first isolated, none of the group 1 phages was able toreplicate efficiently on b. subtilis sb19, a mutant of the /transforming/ b. subtilis 168 . host range mutants capable of growth in sb19 wereisolated for all of the group 1 phages except sp13, and are designatedthe /star/ phages (sp5 through sp9 ) . for characterization, sb19 wasused as host for the star phages, and another b. subtilis mutant, 168b,was host for sp13 .
