      surgeons in search for a biological treatment for osteoarthritis that has failed
      non-operative management. Surgeons have begun to harvest and centrifuged bone marrow aspirate
      to produce bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) in hopes that the mesenchymal stem cells
      in the bone marrow aspirate can stimulate cartilage regeneration in areas of articular
      cartilage deficiency. This study is a first-in-human blinded randomized clinical trial using
      labeled BMAC cells in adults diagnosed with grade II-III Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis.

      This is a single site study where 20 cases among eligible patients will be identified and
      randomly assigned to either the control (no calcified cartilage) or experimental (calcified
      cartilage removed) group. A power analysis will be performed after 20 patients to determine
      the total number of patients required to reach adequate power.

      A patient will receive an infusion of Feraheme 2 days before the procedure and a baseline MR
      Pelvis and knee. A nurse will be present at all times during the infusion to monitor vitals.
      On the day of the procedure patient will undergo harvesting of the bone marrow from the
      pelvis and arthroscopy procedure involving menisectomy, synovectomy and debridement. Patients
      in the experimental group will also undergo removal of the calcified cartilage cap. The bone
      marrow aspirate will be centrifuged and about 5-7 cc of BMAC injected into knee. MRIs will be
      done at the 2 day mark for confirmation of the labeling of the mesenchymal cells, and at the
      two week and 3 month mark. Patient related Outcomes will be measured using the Knee injury
      and Osteoarthritis Score at 12 months follow up.
