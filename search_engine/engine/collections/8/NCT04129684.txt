      which is the main cause of tooth loss in adults. Periodontitis has also been demonstrated to
      be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and many other systemic diseases due
      to the host immune response elicited by periodontal pathogenic bacteria. In the last decade,
      probiotics therapy using Lactobacillus Reuteri has been applied for periodontitis patients in
      European countries. But no evidence has been provided for its effectiveness in a Chinese
      population. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of application of
      Lactobacillus Reuteri probiotics therapy on clinical improvement and on microbial shift in
      Chinese periodontitis patients. The influence of probiotics therapy on the host inflammatory
      cytokines levels in periodontitis patients with systemic diseases is also evaluated.
