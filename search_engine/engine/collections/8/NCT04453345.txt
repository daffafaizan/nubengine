      the standard first-line therapy for T-LGLL and CLPD-NK. Previous studies showed that the
      overall response rate (ORR) of first-line oral immunosuppressants ranged from 21% to 85%
      (median: 50%). Both methotrexate and cyclosporine A are LGLL first-line treatment options,
      but the CR rate of methotrexate is only 21%, while the CR rate of CsA is less than 5%. There
      is insufficient evidence for the treatment of LGLL with prednisone and other glucocorticoids,
      but it can reduce RA-related inflammation and increase granulocyte levels. The TPM regimen
      was designed by the investigators. A pilot prospect observation showed that 18/20 (90%)
      patients obtained response, including 80% CR. This study is a prospective multiple center
      clinical trail to evaluate the efficacy of TPM regimen in the treatment of symptomatic LGLL.
      Eligible patients choose the initial treatment plan: thalidomide 50-100mg qn+ prednisone
      0.5-1mg / kg qod +methotrexate 10mg / m2 / week. Four months is one course. Maximum three
      courses will be given if there is a response and thalidomide maintenance will be for another
      year.
