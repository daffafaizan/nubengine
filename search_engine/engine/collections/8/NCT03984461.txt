    
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the combined use of platelet-rich
      plasma (PRP) with lipoaspirate and/or bone marrow aspirate in osteoarthritis of major joints,
      and to compare the outcomes achieved using three combinations: PRP plus lipoaspirate, PRP
      plus bone marrow aspirate, and PRP plus both lipoaspirate and bone marrow aspirate.

      A total of 240 participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: Group
      A will receive PRP plus lipoaspirate, Group B will receive PRP plus bone marrow aspirate, and
      Group C will receive tri-partite therapy of PRP + lipoaspirate + bone marrow aspirate which
      allows for 80 in each group. The combination of biologic materials will be injected in to an
      arthritic joint.
