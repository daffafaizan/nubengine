      of a subgroup with binge-eating disorder (BED), the most prevalent formal eating disorder.
      Improved treatments for patients with obesity and BED are needed that can produce sustained
      clinical outcomes and promote weight loss. This study (maintenance stage) RCT will provide
      findings from a controlled test, amongst responders to acute treatments, whether LDX
      medication results in superior maintenance and longer-term outcomes than placebo. This is one
      of the few RCTs for BED of medication with follow-up after medication discontinuation.
