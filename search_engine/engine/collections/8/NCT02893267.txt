      superiority of PNS over PT in reducing HSP, and to determine if multimodal treatment of HSP
      with PNS + PT is more efficacious than PNS or PT alone. The standard of care for treating
      shoulder pain is to try several options, most commonly including medications, injections and
      therapy. Candidates considering this study likely have tried some treatments but without
      lasting success. Ninety-six participants will be randomized to receive PNS + PT, PNS +
      sham-PT, or sham-PNS + PT. The PNS + PT group will receive active PNS therapy for 6 hours per
      day for 3 weeks along with 8 sessions of PT to improve biomechanics of the affected shoulder.
      The PNS+ sham-PT group will receive active PNS therapy and sham-PT, consisting of placebo
      ultrasound, application of inert gel, lower limb strengthening, and walking exercises. The
      sham-PNS + PT group will receive a percutaneous lead in a similar manner as the active
      therapy groups, but with sham-stimulation, along with 8 sessions of PT. Measures of pain,
      pain interference with ADLs, QoL, shoulder biomechanics (shoulder abduction torque, shoulder
      kinematics, and Fugl-Meyer score), and measures of central sensitization (pain thresholds,
      secondary hyperalgesia, and temporal summation) will be assessed at baseline and at weeks 4
      (end of treatment), 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28.
