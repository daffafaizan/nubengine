      is done by injecting a bolus of x-ray contrast into the ventricle through a pigtail catheter
      over a short period of time and observing the heart as it is pumped out. This provides
      information on regional wall motion abnormalities, ejection fraction, and mitral
      regurgitation. A common occurrence when performing a LV angio is frequent PVC's or V-tach
      during the injection, it has been suggested that ectopic's occurs about 54% of the time and
      that interpretability was limited 30% of the time(3) This is rarely serious and subsides at
      the end of the injection but the irregularity of the contractions does affect the diagnostic
      quality of the exam.

      In an attempt to decrease the incidence of ventricular ectopic's during the LV angiogram
      Contrast injections with a greater linear rise increasing the injection duration to at least
      Â½ the flow rate, greater than previous settings should decrease the tension and the contrast
      jets coming out of the catheter, decreasing the fling of the catheter at the initiation of
      the injection. Whether this affects the quality of the angiogram with a pig tail vs. a
      straight catheter will also need to be considered?
