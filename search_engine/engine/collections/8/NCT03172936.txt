      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of MIW815(ADU-S100) in
      combination with the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor PDR001. Two different schedules were explored
      in two dose escalation groups in accessible cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions. The optional
      dose confirmation group exploring intratumoral injection of viscerally located lesions was
      not opened due to the program's early termination.

      Group A included patients with accessible solid tumors and lymphomas. This group received a
      fixed dose of PDR001 i.v. on day 1 of every 28 day cycle and intratumoral injections of
      MIW815 (ADU-S100) on days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28 day cycle. Group B included patients with
      accessible solid tumors and lymphomas. This group received a fixed dose of PDR001 i.v. on day
      1 of every 28 day cycle and an intratumoral injection of MIW815 (ADU-S100) on day 1 of every
      28 day cycle.

      Once the dose and dose schedule had been confirmed, the plan was to open the dose expansion
      part of the study. However, the expansion phase of the study was not opened to enrollment due
      to the program's early termination.
