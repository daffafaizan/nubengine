      density. Despite new guidelines for the care of such women, research has shown that they are
      not generally evaluated for osteoporosis. This care gap exists although it is known that
      wrist fractures are an important marker for subsequent fractures, such as a hip fracture,
      which represents a significant socio-economic burden to society.

      Comparison: Cluster randomized trial of women and their physicians, both of whom receive
      educational material and reminder on post fracture osteoporosis evaluation. Comparison is to
      women and their physicians who receive standard post fracture information. Family practices
      are randomized to intervention or non-intervention group.
