      (arm: usual care) or in accordance to the international scientific recommendations (arm: T2T)

      The tight control means that as soon as a treatment is initiated in a patient, the time
      permitting to evaluate its potential efficacy/safety has to be determined. In terms of
      safety, such time frame can be very short based on the occurrence of adverse events. In terms
      of efficacy it is usually recommended to evaluate an NSAIDs after 2 to 4 weeks of treatment
      intake and the TNF blockers after 12 to 16 weeks.

      The Treat to Target means that there is an a priori decision of the target to reach while
      initiating a treatment and more importantly an a priori decision to intensify the treatment
      in case such target is not achieved.

      There will be 2 arms in the study (tight control and treat to target arm and usual care arm).

      160 patients (80 patients per arm) will be included during one year by 18 centers (10 in
      France, 4 in Belgium and 4 in Netherlands). Patients will be followed during 1 year.
