      I. To determine the number of diagnosed cancers in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
      presenting to participating clinical sites in Latin America, and estimate site-specific
      prevalence based on all presenting cancers (new diagnosis, recurrence, and surveillance
      cases) and site-specific incidence based on newly diagnosed cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain information on the use of diagnostic testing and treatment for the cohort of
      diagnosed HIV-associated cancer participants.

      II. To collect information on participant characteristics for diagnosed HIV-associated
      cancers (e.g., antiretroviral therapy [ART] regimen, current CD4 count, current viral load,
      etc.).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the timelines and requirements for protocol review and approval at the local,
      regional, and national level.

      II. To familiarize local sites with the online data entry systems utilized by the AIDS
      Malignancy Consortium (AMC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients respond to surveys and/or undergo medical record review at baseline and at 4 weeks.
