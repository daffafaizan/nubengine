      bladder cancer, or recurrent high grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The high rates of
      morbidity and mortality reflect the fact that the majority of patients undergoing this
      procedure are elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. Postoperative ileus is the most
      frequent reason for prolonged hospital stay following cystectomy. To reduce the risk of
      ileus, prokinetics such as metoclopramide should be used postoperatively. Local anesthetics
      exert their actions as local anesthesia and antiarrhythmic through Na channels blocking but
      still have many other important actions through other receptors (e.g., m1 muscarinic
      receptors) that occur at very low plasma levels compared to levels needed for Na channels
      blocking, one of these actions is the anti-inflammatory effect against surgical stress
      response. Several randomized studies found that i.v. lidocaine shortens duration of
      postoperative ileus and some of it reported decreased postoperative pain with i.v. lidocaine,
      so they recommended i.v. lidocaine as a safe, simple, and less invasive method for management
      of postoperative ileus and equal to postoperative epidural analgesia.
