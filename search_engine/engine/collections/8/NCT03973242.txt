      Participants are randomized into DF-NBI and WL groups. Rapid urease test will be performed in
      all cases. By captured images of gastric mucosa, classification of DF-NBI for Helicobacter
      pylori infected mucosa will be developed and validated. The established classification of WL
      for Helicobacter pylori infection will be used. Finally, the investigators will compare the
      accuracy between two groups based on each classification.
