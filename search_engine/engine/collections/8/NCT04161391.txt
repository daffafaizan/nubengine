    
      Phase 1 Dose Escalation: To evaluate the overall safety profile, characterize the PK profiles
      and assess the preliminary efficacy of TPX-0046 in adults subjects with advanced solid tumors
      harboring oncogenic RET fusions or mutations.

      Food Effect Sub-Study: To determine the effect of food on PK of TPX-0046 in adult subjects
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring oncogenic RET fusions or mutations.

      Phase 2 Efficacy Evaluation: To determine the overall safety and anti-tumor efficacy of
      TPX-0046 in defined cohorts of subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors harboring
      oncogenic RET fusions or mutations.
