      minimally invasive surgery, visualization of the surgical field will be assessed following
      the placement of the near infrared fluorescence (NIR F) imaging system proximal to the ureter
      of interest and then ASP5354 will be administered.

      Based on Visualization Review Committee (VRC) review of the initial 3 dose levels, if none of
      the doses selected have visualization, then additional two dose levels (dose D and E) will be
      added; if 1 dose selected has visualization, then the dose level D will be added. The dose
      level F will only be added if only the dose E level has visualization.
