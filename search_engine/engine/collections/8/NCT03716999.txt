      Palliative Care patients and reduce the need for PRN or "as needed" medications. This study
      will investigate the efficacy of this intervention using a mixed-method analysis.

      Starlight Therapy will be offered to patients with unpleasant end-of-life symptoms such as
      dyspnea, agitation, anxiety, restlessness and insomnia. The effect the Starlight Therapy has
      in helping alleviate these symptoms will be measured using the ESAS (Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment System) questionnaire at baseline and following a predetermined period of time of
      Starlight Therapy.

      Three Starlight Projectors have been purchased for the unit where the study will take place:
      the Inpatient Palliative Care Unit 7A, Victoria General Hospital, Centennial Building. The
      funding was acquired by a Comfort & Care Grant from the QEII Foundation.

      The results will be compiled and analyzed in a research paper "Concerning the Efficacy of
      Starlight Therapy as a Non-Pharmacological Nursing Intervention for Palliative Care
      Patients".
