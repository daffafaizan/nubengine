      weeks of resistance exercise training for the purpose of inducing skeletal muscle
      hypertrophy. These individuals will consume either 0, 1, or 3 whole eggs per day in a
      double-blind design to test the hypothesis that dietary cholesterol is essential for skeletal
      muscle hypertrophy. If so proven, this will confirm a very strong association between dietary
      cholesterol and hypertrophy observed in a previous study of 51 men and women (age 60-69). The
      current proposal is using a randomized double-blind, placebo controlled design to provide the
      most conclusive evidence that dietary cholesterol plays an essential role in skeletal muscle
      hypertrophy.

      The secondary objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that increased dietary
      cholesterol consumption in the context of an exercise program does not alter blood
      cholesterol concentrations or other cardiovascular risk factors.
