      Population includes subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19
      deletion or L858R mutation with tumor progression after treatment with osimertinib. The
      starting combination dose regimen is patritumab deruxtecan 3.2 mg/kg IV every 21 days (Q3W)
      and osimertinib 80 mg orally (PO) once daily. At least 3 to 6 subjects will be enrolled in
      each cohort.

      Dose Expansion: Two subject populations will be evaluated in the Dose Expansion Part:

        -  Second-Line: Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19
           deletion or L858R mutation with tumor progression after treatment with osimertinib

        -  First-Line: Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR exon 19
           deletion or L858R mutation, and without prior systemic therapy for advanced or
           metastatic disease. Note: The first line expansion will only be initiated if the RCD
           includes osimertinib 80 mg PO once daily.
