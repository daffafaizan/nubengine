      accumulated cholesterol and fats in carotid arteries. While some research indicates that CEA
      is associated with improvements in neuropsychological functioning, other studies have
      identified deficits in neuropsychological functioning following CEA. The factors associated
      with these different outcomes are unclear. Identification of the factors that mediate
      post-CEA neuropsychological functioning outcomes may allow for the development of
      interventions that would improve such outcomes. Recent research has identified a relationship
      between post-CEA neuropsychological deficits, and cerebral blood flow in certain areas of the
      brain, with some indication that brain cell loss following CEA may be a key factor. The
      proposed study will explore changes in cerebral blood flow through the use of
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI) to investigate the relationship between
      neuropsychological functioning and brain perfusion in 70 CEA patients and to compare
      neuropsychological functioning of the CEA patients to a control group of 30 patients
      undergoing other peripheral vascular surgical procedures. Patients' neuropsychological
      functioning will be assessed pre, post and six months after the CEA or peripheral vascular
      surgery. Additionally DW-MRI will be assessed pre and post surgery for the patients
      undergoing CEA.
