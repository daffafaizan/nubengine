    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single ascending dose study in
      healthy participants for JNJ-54175446. The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase
      (between 21 and 2 days prior to dose administration), a double-blind treatment phase (8 days;
      Part 1 and Part 3) or an open-label treatment phase (8 days; Part 2), and a follow-up
      examination (within 14 to 21 days after dose administration). The maximal study duration for
      a participant will not exceed 6 weeks. In each cohort of Part 1 (6 cohorts) and Part 3 (1
      cohort), participants will be randomly assigned to receive JNJ-54175446 or matching placebo
      and in cohort of part 2, all participants will be assigned to JNJ-54175446 treatment. In part
      1, primarily maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be assessed, along with safety and
      tolerability of JNJ-54175446. In part 2, pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-54175446 in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be assessed. In part 3, the effect of food on the plasma PK of
      JNJ-54175446 in young healthy male participants will be assessed. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
