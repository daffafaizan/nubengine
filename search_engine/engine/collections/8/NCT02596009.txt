      are one of the important factors that can influence the efficiency of the drug delivery by
      the inhalation route. The peak inspiratory flow (PIF) rates achieved by COPD patients through
      different breath actuated dry power inhalers may differ because of the differences in
      internal resistance of the different type of devices. The results of inspiratory airflow rate
      and pressure drop over time, from this study, provided an assessment of the range and
      variability of inhalation profile characteristics generated by COPD patients within the
      population selected for this study (e.g. demographics, gender, disease control) through the
      Breezhaler and the other marketed comparator DPIs.

      The inhalation profiles were obtained through an Inhalation Profile Recorder (IPR). The
      inhalation profile recorder was a data acquisition device which consists of a computer, an
      interface unit and a pressure transducer. This allowed it to measure the real time dynamic
      pressure drop at the mouthpiece of the inhaler during an inhalation maneuver. On the graphic
      user interface, plots of inspiratory pressure drop versus time and flow rate versus time are
      displayed in real time. The investigator or designated study personnel at site was
      responsible for typing in the Test Location, selecting the Inhaler Type (Breezhaler, Ellipta,
      Handihaler), typing in the Patient ID and Patient Age, selecting Male or Female, and
      recording Patient Comments made during the test session, as necessary.

      Each patient were required to generate three (03) inhalational profiles through each of the
      three (03) study devices: Breezhaler®, Ellipta® and Handihaler®.
