      Clinics, enrolling 15 subjects and lasting approximately 12 months. Eligible patients will
      start treatment with lenvatinib 18 mg PO daily (administered as one 10 mg capsule and two 4
      mg capsules) and everolimus 5 mg PO daily for 4 weeks, constituting one cycle. Two cycles of
      treatment (8 weeks) will be administered followed by a 1-week wash out period during which
      time patients will be evaluated by the urology oncology team and appropriate surgery will be
      planned. The wash out period is for drug to be eliminated prior to surgery, to avoid
      bleeding/wound healing effects. This includes partial nephrectomy or radical nephrectomy.
      Following surgery, patients with no evidence of disease will have active surveillance.
      Patients who continue to have disease following surgery will receive further systemic
      treatment for metastatic disease.
