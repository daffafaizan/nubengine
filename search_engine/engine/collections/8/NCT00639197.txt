      with a mortality ranging from 12% to 25% in critically ill patients.

      It is also widely accepted that the internal jugular site is associated with a higher risk of
      catheter related infection if compared with the subclavian site.

      Therefore, the benefit of catheter tunneling was best seen at the internal jugular site as
      described by J F Timsit in 1996 in his prospective randomized multicentre study where it
      significantly decreased the rate of catheter related sepsis from 11.4% to 3.4%.

      At the same time, tunneling catheters did not increase the rate of mechanical complications
      such as pneumothorax, hematoma, or arterial puncture, but it almost doubled the rate of
      technical difficulties, such as problems with advancing the catheter or multiple puncture
      sites, at that time it was a blind technique.

      Now, and with the introduction of the ultrasound guidance in our routine central line
      insertions, we would like to evaluate its benefit in reducing the technical difficulty and
      mechanical complications that used to be encountered while tunneling the short term central
      venous catheters at the internal jugular site.
