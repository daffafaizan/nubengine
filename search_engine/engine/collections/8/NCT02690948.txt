    
      This study is a non-randomized evaluation of pembrolizumab as a treatment for unresectable or
      metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Participants are assigned to treatment with
      pembrolizumab plus vismodegib or pembrolizumab monotherapy on the basis of suitability for
      treatment with smoothened (SMO) inhibitors such as vismodegib. Prospective participants who
      have progressed on vismodegib, are intolerant to or have a medical contra-indication to
      vismodegib may receive pembrolizumab monotherapy. Because treatment is non-randomized, no
      comparison between treatment groups is conducted.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To assess the overall response rate (ORR) of unresectable or metastatic BCC
      patients to pembrolizumab with or without vismodegib (all evaluable patients) at 18 weeks

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess the ORR of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab
           monotherapy at 18 weeks

        -  To assess the ORR of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab
           monotherapy at 9 weeks

        -  To assess ORR of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab plus
           vismodegib at 18 weeks

        -  To assess ORR of unresectable or metastatic BCC patients to pembrolizumab plus
           vismodegib at 9 weeks

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab (either monotherapy or
           combination therapy) for unresectable or metastatic BCC.

        -  To assess the duration of response after pembrolizumab (either monotherapy or
           combination therapy)

        -  Incidence and severity of adverse events

        -  Correlative studies including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression
           pre-treatment, lymphocytic infiltrates pre- and post-treatment, mutational analysis pre-
           and post-treatment
