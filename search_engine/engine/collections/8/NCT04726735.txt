      progression (20 to 30%) to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).

      The local immunotherapy (intra-vesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) following transurethral
      resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT)) reduces significantly the risk of recurrence and
      progression as compared to observation or to intra-vesical chemotherapy.

      Systemic immunotherapy with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) or Programmed cell Death 1
      (PD1) inhibitors has shown major efficacy in the treatment of patients with
      advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have progressed on platinum-based regimens of
      chemotherapy, or even in front line setting. In the field of NMIBC, immunotherapy using PD-L1
      or PD1 inhibitors is under investigation but the frequency of PD-L1 expression has rarely
      been precisely described in the different subtypes.

      The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the expression of PD-L1 by different
      types of NMIBC.

      The secondary objective is to characterize the immune contexture of NMIBC. The immunological
      contexture of NMIBC in comparison with normal bladder tissue and invasive bladder cancer will
      be deciphered. The objective is to determine immune signatures associated with response or
      relapse/progression, with and without immune treatments in NMIBC.
