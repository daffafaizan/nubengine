        -  To determine if BRM is silenced in the majority, if not all, rhabdoid tumors by
           immunohistochemistry in primary tumors.

        -  To determine if BRG1 is silenced in the majority, if not all, rhabdoid tumors by
           immunohistochemistry in primary tumors.

        -  To determine if GATA1 and/or HDAC2 is overexpressed in the same tumors that lack BRM
           expression.

        -  To determine if BRM promoter polymorphisms correlate with loss of BRM expression in
           primary rhabdoid tumors.

        -  To determine how BRG1 is silenced in primary rhabdoid tumors by sequencing BRG1 exons in
           genomic DNA derived from frozen samples.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for BRM, BRG1, GATA1, and/or HDAC2
      expression by immunohistochemistry. BRM- and BRG1-negative samples are also analyzed.
