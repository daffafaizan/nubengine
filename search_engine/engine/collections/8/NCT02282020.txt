    
      This open label, randomised, controlled, multi-centre study will assess the efficacy and
      safety of single agent olaparib vs. standard of care, based on physician's choice of single
      agent chemotherapy ( i.e paclitaxel, or topotecan, or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or
      gemcitabine) in platinum sensitive or partially platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer
      patients who carry germline deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation and who have
      received at least 2 prior lines of platinum based chemotherapy. Patients are eligible to
      undergo BRCA testing even if they have not yet had recurrence or progression of disease >6
      months (>/=183 days) after completion of their last platinum therapy.
