      - What is the relationship between the preoperative nutrition status and the postoperative
      nutrition status in gastrointestinal cancer patients ?

      Secondary Questions

      - What is the relationship between malnutrition during preoperative and postoperative stages,
      compared with postoperative complications?

      OBJECTIVE :

      The objective of this study is to study the association between pre- and postoperative
      nutrition status compared with postoperative complications and surgical outcome. The results
      of this study may affect future nutrition practices and encourage different behaviors in
      gastrointestinal cancer patients who prepare to undergo surgery.

      Sample size is calculated by n=(z_(1-α/2)^2 p(1-p))/d^2

      Proportion (p) = 0.80, Error (d) = 0.064 Alpha (α) = 0.05, Z(0.975) = 1.959964 Power = 0.80
      Sample size (n) = 178 Include drop out 10 % = 196 patients

      Patients:

      For 196 gastrointestinal cancer patients (esophageal, gastric, colon and rectum cancer), who
      underwent scheduled surgery. Every patient underwent nutritional assessment by NAF before
      surgery and (1 & 3 months) after surgery at in the Department of Surgery, Ramathibodi
      Hospital and Buriram Hospital from 20 November 2018. Patients with incomplete documents were
      excluded from this study.

      DATA COLLECTION AND DATA ANALYSIS:

        -  Pre-operative nutrition status assess by NAF

        -  Post-operative nutrition status at 1 month and 3 months assess by NAF

        -  All postoperative complications were collected according to Clavin-Dindo Classification8

        -  All case were included in this study, following TNM staging and others pathologic
           parameters :

        -  Cancer type - Tumor grading

        -  Lymph node metastasis - Tumor depth
