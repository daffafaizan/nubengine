      underwent anterior transvaginal mesh surgery (ATVM) but without concomitant mid-urethral
      sling surgery were reviewed. Data of pre- and post-operative lower urinary tract symptoms and
      urodynamic parameters were compared. The bladder outlet obstruction was defined when the
      detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate was not less than 40cmH2O, and the maximum flow rate
      was less than 12 mL/s. Overactive bladder syndrome, detrusor overactivity, bladder
      oversensitivity and urodynamic stress incontinence were also recognized as international
      continence society definition. STATA software was used for statistical analysis. Wilcoxon
      signed-rank test or McNemar's test was used for statistical analysis as appropriate. P < 0.05
      was considered as statistically significant.
