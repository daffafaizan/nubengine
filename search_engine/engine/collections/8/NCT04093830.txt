      hearing in the non-implanted ear. To avoid auditory deprivation and to provide binaural
      hearing, a hearing aid or a second cochlear implant can be fitted to that ear. When bilateral
      cochlear implant cannot be used for patients with bilateral hearing impairment, a hearing aid
      can be used in their non- implanted ear with residual hearing. This is because patients with
      bilateral hearing loss need bilateral stimulation to develop the neural pathway required for
      central processing of binaural hearing.
