      thus of limited availability. DatScan (I123 ioflupane) is an FDA approved and clinically
      indicated biomarker, which has a high binding affinity for presynaptic dopamine transporters
      (DAT) in the brains of mammals, in particular the striatal region of the brain. A feature of
      Parkinson's disease is a marked reduction in dopaminergic neurons in the striatal region. By
      introducing an agent that binds to the dopamine transporters a quantitative measure and
      spatial distribution of the transporters can be obtained. The use of SPECT/CT (with the new
      validated collimators) and the FDA approved DATScan biomarker would allow for readily
      available diagnosis of Parkinson's disease
