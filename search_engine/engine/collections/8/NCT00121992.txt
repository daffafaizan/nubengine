    
      Primary objective:

        -  To compare disease-free survival (DFS) after treatment with docetaxel in combination
           with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) to 5-Fluorouracil in combination with
           doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) as adjuvant treatment of high risk operable
           breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 above mentioned arms.

        -  To compare toxicity and quality of life between the 2 above mentioned arms.

        -  To evaluate pathologic markers for predicting efficacy (hormonal receptors and human
           epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression).
