      ventilator timing of both inspiration and expiration . It is a commonly reported problem
      during mechanical ventilation. Thille et al. found that 24% of patients developed asynchrony
      in at least ten percent of their breaths, moreover they stated that the most frequent
      asynchronies was each of ineffective triggering and double triggering . Eighty percent of
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients experienced ineffective triggering,
      where it is considered the most frequent asynchrony in this group of patients. Asynchrony
      between Patient and ventilator also leads to prolonged duration of invasive ventilation, and
      increase possibility of weaning failure.

      Both spread and intensity of asynchrony during the early phase of weaning in COPD patients
      has never satisfactorily described. The aim of the current study was to describe the
      patient-ventilator asynchrony and its impact on weaning outcome in mechanically ventilated
      COPD patients.
