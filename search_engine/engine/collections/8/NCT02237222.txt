      Functional Assessment Questionnaire - walking scale' (GFAQ) are evaluated in terms of
      construct validity, inter- and intra-rater reliability as well as responsiveness in children
      with a neuromuscular diagnosis, who absolve an inpatient stay in the rehabilitation center of
      the University Chilren's Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.
