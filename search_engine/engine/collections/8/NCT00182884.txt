      surgery. Up to 65% of elderly undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture experience
      post-operative delirium. These individuals often stay in the hospital longer, have more
      complications, and are more likely to die. Early studies suggest that delirium could be
      prevented by correcting the central cholinergic deficit that is associated with delirium.
      Donepezil is currently being used to treat memory loss in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

      This study will recruit 30 adults aged 65 or older who are undergoing hip fracture surgery.
      Participants will be randomized to receive either Donepezil or a matching placebo within 24
      hours prior to surgery and for 4 days after the surgery.

      All material to be collected will be from interviews, questionnaires, and medical chart
      review at baseline and daily for the entire hospital stay. The Confusion Assessment Method
      (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) will be used to evaluate the effect of
      Donepezil on delirium incidence and severity. Other assessments include cognitive deficit,
      length of hospitalization, discharge site, adverse effects, and psychotropic medications.
