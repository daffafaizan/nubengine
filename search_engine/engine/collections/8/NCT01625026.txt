    
      In a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trial, 20 otherwise healthy morbidly obese
      patients scheduled for bariatric surgery, and 20 otherwise healthy gallstone patients will be
      administered 25 mg/day INT-747 or placebo for three weeks until the day before surgery. Serum
      from days 1 and 21 will be analyzed for routine liver tests, bile acids, a complete lipid
      profile including FA and in addition for 7Î±-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and FGF-19, markers for
      bile acid synthesis and its intestinal stimulation. For the evaluation of insulin resistance
      and possible pre-diabetes, plasma will be taken for the estimation of HOMA index and oral
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed at days 1 and 21. At surgery, a liver biopsy
      (0.5-1 g) and a white adipose tissue (WAT) specimen (1 cm2) will be taken and immediately
      frozen in liquid nitrogen for mRNA and protein preparation for quantitative RT-PCR and
      Western analysis, respectively, histopathological NAFLD grading, and measuring of hepatic and
      WAT lipase activity. In gallstone patients, gallbladder bile will be sampled for the
      measurements of biliary lipids (cholesterol, phospholipids, bile acids) and the calculation
      of the cholesterol saturation index.
