      disease and sexual dysfunction. Heart disease lowers the activity or the ability to perform
      the sexual activity. Sexual problems have a negative impact on quality of life and
      well-being, and sexual dysfunction is associated with anxiety and depression. The causes of
      sexual dysfunction are physical changes (the disease), mental changes and adverse reactions
      from medication. Despite the fact, that several international guidelines recommend that
      health professionals address sexual function in patients with heart disease, this is rarely
      done in practice. In Denmark there is no consensus or practice on how or where patients with
      heart disease and sexual dysfunction should be treated. Some patients are treated with
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and a few referred to sexological clinics.
      Non-pharmacological rehabilitation interventions such as physical exercise, pelvic floor
      exercise, and sexual therapy have shown potential beneficial effect on sexual function.
      However, the effects have not been tested sufficiently, have not been tested in combination,
      and have never been tested in a Danish population.

      Objective: The objective of this trial is to investigate the effect of a comprehensive sexual
      rehabilitation intervention program, consisting of a psycho-educative component and an
      exercise-training component plus treatment as usual versus treatment as usual in male
      patients with impaired sexual function and implantable cardioverter defibrillator or ischemic
      heart disease.

      Design: CopenHeartSF is an investigator-initiated randomised clinical trial with blinded
      outcome assessment, including two university hospitals, with 1:1 central randomisation to
      sexual rehabilitation plus usual care versus usual care alone.
