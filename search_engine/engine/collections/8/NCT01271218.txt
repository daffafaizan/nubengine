      university research setting. Participants with physician diagnosed OA participated in a
      14-week fitness and weight loss program that consisted of moderately hypo-energetic higher
      protein or higher carbohydrate diets. Participants were also randomly assigned to ingest in a
      double-blind and randomized manner either a placebo or a commercially available dietary
      supplement containing glucosamine and chondroitin. Outcome measures were assessed at 0, 10,
      and 14 weeks of training, dieting, and supplementation.
