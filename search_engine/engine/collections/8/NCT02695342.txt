      leading cause of death, disability and hospitalization in Canada. There is a growing body of
      evidence demonstrating that older adults with COPD have important problems with their balance
      and a high incidence of falls compared to those of a similar age. This research will explore
      the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a tailored 6-month home balance exercise program
      for reducing falls in older adults with COPD.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of a tailored home
      balance intervention for older adults with COPD in terms of recruitment, retention and
      adherence. The secondary objective is to examine the within-subject effects of the
      home-balance intervention on intermediate outcomes linked to falls including balance,
      functional strength and self-reported disability.

      Thirty-five older adults with COPD will be recruited from respirology clinics at West Park
      Healthcare Centre (Toronto) and the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health (Hamilton) to
      participate in a single-group, non-randomized clinical trial. Eligible participants will be
      enrolled in a 6-month balance home exercise intervention. The home program will be supervised
      by a physiotherapist and outcome measures will be collected at home at baseline, 3- and
      6-months by a research assistant not involved in the intervention.
