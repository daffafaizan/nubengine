      mmHg) and 29% have hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg or antihypertensive medication
      use). Numerous factors contribute to the development of prehypertension and hypertension
      including age, genetics, obesity, and behavioral factors such as exercise and diet.However,
      the sleep disorder insomnia is another behavioral factor increasingly implicated with risk of
      hypertension. Insomnia, the most frequent sleep complaint in adults, is characterized by
      difficulty falling asleep, trouble maintaining sleep or non-restorative sleep coupled with
      significant daytime distress or functional impairment. Insomnia is a pervasive sleep disorder
      associated with decreased quality of life, reduced work productivity, and increased health
      care costs; it is increasingly identified as a cardiovascular disease risk factor. Lifestyle
      modifications recommended for pre-hypertension and hypertension do not address sleep. This
      pilot randomized clinical trial will test the preliminary efficacy of an online cognitive
      behavioral therapy intervention (N=40) versus an online healthy sleep habits intervention
      (N=20), to reduce blood pressure in a sample of untreated individuals with insomnia and
      prehypertension or hypertension. Participants will be followed for 12-weeks
      post-intervention. Primary outcome measures are systolic blood pressure. Secondary measures
      include sleep efficiency, insomnia severity, physical and mental function.
