    
      This randomized open-label study is designed to evaluate whether the addition of either or
      both different dose levels of CX-01 to standard induction therapy and consolidation therapy
      has a beneficial effect in newly diagnosed AML patients (60 years of age or older) when
      compared to patients receiving standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy alone. 75
      patients will be randomized to one of 3 treatment groups to receive standard
      induction/consolidation therapy alone or standard induction/consolidation therapy with CX-01
      at one of 2 different dose levels (lower and higher). Patients will receive up to 2 induction
      cycles and up to 2 consolidation cycles and will participate in the study for up to 18
      months. Clinical laboratory tests will be conducted routinely, and bone marrow aspirates and
      biopsies will be performed during the induction cycles. Safety will be monitored through
      adverse events and clinical laboratory results.
