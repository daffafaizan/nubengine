      often receive taxane-based chemotherapy (paclitaxel or docetaxel) in combination with
      bevacizumab as it has been shown to increase progression-free survival. There is currently
      minimal information whether bevacizumab should be given as maintenance therapy after
      discontinuation of chemotherapy.
