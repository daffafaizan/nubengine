    
      This is a two-arm, 14 month pragmatic cluster randomized trial to evaluate the added benefit
      of EE-CTH relative to CTH for patients with T2DM in primary care.

      Primary care practices (not patients) will be randomly assigned to receive and deliver CTH or
      EE-CTH in an innovative effectiveness-implementation hybrid design. Using the RE-AIM
      framework, the investigators will evaluate program effectiveness in a real world setting,
      while at the same time gathering information on program reach, adoption, implementation and
      maintenance. CTH and EE-CTH practice trainings and delivery will each follow separate and
      standardized protocols, with support provided to practices through staff training, ongoing
      supervision and case presentations, and a practice improvement team assisted by a practice
      facilitator to address issues of staffing and patient flow. Practice training and
      facilitation notes, in conjunction with feedback from patient advisory councils, will be
      captured and integrated to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation process
      and inform dissemination efforts. Beyond the requirements of the study, practices will be
      permitted to use EE-CTH or CTH with other patients as wished, which will enable the
      investigators to document the program's reach within the practice. Patients in both study
      arms will receive the intervention at a minimum of two primary care appointments (baseline
      and follow-up between 6 and 12 months).
