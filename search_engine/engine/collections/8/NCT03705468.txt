      the use of LISA was associated with the lowest likelihood of the composite outcome of death
      or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age when compared with the
      other ventilation strategies for preterm infants. Further studies are needed to optimize the
      indications and identify adequate strategies for premedication that preserve respiratory
      function and which limits pain and cardio-respiratory instability associated with laryngeal
      exposure without increasing risks of complications. According to a recent European survey,
      only 48% of neonatologists perform LISA with sedation. In a recent retrospective study,
      Dekker showed a more favorable COMFORTneo score with Propofol versus without, similar rates
      of intubation during LISA. Ketamine infusion has been used in several NICUs with few reported
      effects on respiratory function, but without publication. No prospective studies exist on
      LISA premedication. This study aims to optimize sedation during LISA in NICU patients with
      RDS. Comparing Ketamine and propofol sedation with rate of mechanical tracheal ventilation
      from the start of the LISA procedure up to 2 hours of life, in the NICU of Arnaud de
      Villeneuve University Hospital of Montpellier (France).
