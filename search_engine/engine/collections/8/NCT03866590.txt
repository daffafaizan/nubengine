    
      Pyruvate kinase deficiency is the most common red cell glycolytic enzyme defect causing
      hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, caused by mutations in the PKLR gene. PKLR
      encodes a pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the transphosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate into
      pyruvate and ATP. The current treatment options are red cell transfusions, chelation and
      splenectomy.

      This is an international, multicentre, epidemiological and observational study.

      The patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled into the Study and
      genetically tested for PKLR mutations via Next generation sequencing (NGS). Any mutation
      being detected by NGS, will be confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

      PKLR-positive samples (homozygous or compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants) will be
      analysed for the identification of potential biomarkers via liquid chromatography multiple
      reaction-monitoring mass spectrometry (LC/MRM-MS) and compared to a merged control samples in
      order establish a PKD specific biomarker.
