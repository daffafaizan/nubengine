      there is a potential risk that PF-06648671 PK will be affected by co-administered drugs that
      can inhibit CYP3A activity. This is a clinical drug interaction study to evaluate this
      potential drug interaction in human. In this study, healthy volunteers will take a single
      dose of 25 mg PF-06648671 in period 1 followed by at least 7 day washout. In period 2, same
      subjects will take 200 mg itraconazole oral solution once a day for 3 days, followed by
      co-administration of 200 mg oral solution and a single dose of 25 mg PF-06648671 on day 4
      which are dosed approximately one hour apart with itraconazole is given first. The
      PF-06648671 PK will be collected 0-48 hours after dose in period 1 and 0-240 hrs in period 2.
      Safety will also be monitored throughout both periods.
