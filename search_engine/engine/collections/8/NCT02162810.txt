      with problems that include urethrocutaneous fistula formation, complete wound breakdown,
      glans dehiscence, urethral diverticulum formation, retraction of the urethral meatus,
      urethral stricture, and meatal stenosis . Failure of a proximal hypospadias repair (i.e. the
      development of a post-operative complication) is unpredictable, and few modifiable risk
      factors having been identified. Complications necessitate subsequent surgical intervention
      for pediatric patients, which must be carried out under general anesthesia. Evidence
      regarding the harms of multiple general anesthetics for children is increasing. Additionally,
      with each surgical revision comes the morbidity associated with another post-surgical
      convalescence. Thus, any measure that can be gained as a way to increase the rate of success
      of proximal hypospadias repair would be of help to all pediatric urologists and patients with
      hypospadias. The proposed intervention of administering a 5 day course of placebo versus oral
      steroids at a dose equivalent to what is given for outpatient treatment of asthma
      exacerbations, is expected to have very low risk. This would be the only variation from the
      current practice and one that has never been studied in the past. Thus, it would be
      worthwhile to perform use scientific methods to determine if the administration of a short
      course of oral steroids is of benefit to healing and minimization of post-operative
      complications for hypospadias patients.
