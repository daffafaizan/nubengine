      cancer-related deaths, with the highest mortality rates reported in East Asia, including
      China. Many patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of gastric cancer because of late
      onset and nonspecific symptoms. The prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer with
      non-curable factors, such as hepatic, peritoneal, or distant lymph node metastases, is poor.
      Chemotherapy is the standard of care for these patients. Palliative resection or bypass
      surgery is generally indicated in the presence of major symptoms such as bleeding or
      obstruction for incurable advanced gastric cancer. The usefulness of gastrectomy and
      metastasectomy is still unclear.

      The REGATTA trial is the first clinical trial to explore the significance of surgery for
      incurable advanced gastric cancer. However, it concluded an opposite conclusion that
      gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy did not show any survival benefit compared with
      chemotherapy alone in advanced gastric cancer with a single non-curable factor.
      Interestingly, there was a significant interaction between treatment effect and tumor
      location in subgroup analyses of overall survival. Gastrectomy plus chemotherapy was
      associated with significantly worse overall survival in patients with upper-third tumors for
      less chemotherapy cycles. This finding raises the question whether inclusion criteria were
      restricted to the patients with lower-third tumor, findings of study might have been
      positive. So we raise this new trail to assess the significance of Gastrectomy and
      Metastasectomy for Distal Gastric Cancer With One Non-curable Factor.
