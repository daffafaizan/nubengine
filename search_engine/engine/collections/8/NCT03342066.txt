      developing a caries. Dental caries is a multifactorial disease and is affected by several
      factors, such as the patient's general health and diet, the amount and type of bacteria
      present in the oral cavity, salivary factors and exposure to fluoride.

      Thus, caries risk assessment approaches should take into account risk implications from
      various factors that influence carious activity Many caries risk assessment models had been
      developed to assess the caries for certain individual, this study will be carried out to
      measure the reproducibility between CAMBRA and cariogram model to evaluate if one of them is
      enough to be used as they give the same result or not
