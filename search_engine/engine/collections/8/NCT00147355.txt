      the amount of rIL-2 taken during a dosing cycle of rIL-2 can be increased through controlling
      the predictable side-effects of rIL-2 better. This is a four arm study with a factorial
      design; patients will be randomised to one of four arms. Each arm consists of different
      combinations of adjunctive agents. Each patient will receive paracetamol and ibuprofen
      prophylactically throughout the cycle, the other adjunctive agents prescribed will vary
      according to which arm the patient is randomised to, but the antiemetic used will be either
      ondansetron or metoclopramide with or without low dose codeine phosphate as an additional
      analgesic agent. The primary end-point is the percentage of planned rIL-2 actually taken
      during the cycle. Secondary end-points include safety, side-effects of rIL-2 and the
      adjunctive agents, CD4+ T-cell changes and quality of life measures.
