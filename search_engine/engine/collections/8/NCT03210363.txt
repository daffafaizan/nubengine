      the epidemiology of arboviruses has recently evolved and marked by important outbreaks.

      Dengue remains an important public health problem despite the efforts of local health
      authorities to mitigate the impact of epidemics and the epidemiology of dengue evolved from
      an endemo-epidemic to a hyper-endemic state. In late 2013, the first local transmission of
      chikungunya virus in the Americas was identified in Caribbean countries and territories
      including French Guiana. Rapidly, more than 16,000 suspected local Health authorities had
      reported cases. In May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert
      regarding the first confirmed Zika virus infections in Brazil. The emergence of Zika virus in
      South America led to a rapid spread throughout South and Central America, reaching French
      Guiana in December 2015. With the increasing frequency of epidemics related to arbovirus and
      the resulting health, social, and economic impacts of dengue, the surveillance of arbovirus
      have become social, political, and public health challenges that require specific and
      non-available immune status information.
