      of cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, olfactory impairment is associated with incident
      (amnestic mild cognitive impairment) aMCI and progression from aMCI to (Alzheimer disease) AD
      dementia. On one hand, in the cross-sectional study, biometric measurements, cognitive
      assessment, olfactory function and fMRI results are analysed to explore the differences among
      T1DM patients, T2DM patients and non-diabetic people . One the other hand, in the
      longitudinal study, changes in olfactory function and fMRI results in diabetic and
      non-diabetic obese patients both at baseline and 6 months after their bariatric surgery are
      collected to investigate whether better glucose and weight control benefit brain function.
