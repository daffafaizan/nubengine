    
      This is a randomized, prospective, unblinded study with 1:1 randomization. Both groups will
      undergo PTA of stenotic lesion and patients will be randomized such that 50% will receive a
      covered stent in addition to the PTA. Patients will be followed at 3, 6, and 12 months
      post-procedure. Follow-up will be conducted with either angiographic and/or transonic
      measurements.
