    
      Study participants will be asked to use a newly developed web-based symptom self-management
      program, called the My MS Toolkit, for 8 weeks.

      The My MS Toolkit includes 8 modules that describe symptom self-management strategies.
      Participants will explore the My MS Toolkit, following the prompts and guides built into the
      program, and meet with a study coach weekly for 15 to 30-minute telephone-delivered coaching
      sessions. Participants are encouraged to practice and apply the skills learned.

      The study can be done from participants' homes using a reliable internet-connected device. No
      travel is required.
