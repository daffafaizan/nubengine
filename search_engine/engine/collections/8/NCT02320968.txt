      designed to elevate the head and torso and maintain a patient in the left-lateral position in
      order to decrease night-time/nocturnal acid reflux. The MedcineTM Sleep Assist Device is
      composed of a 9-inch incline base and a wrap-around body pillow. Traditionally wedge pillows
      have been recommended for patients with acid reflux. The addition of the body pillow helps to
      maintain the patient in the left-lateral position (LLP) during sleep, which has been shown to
      reduce night-time reflux compared to wedge alone, right lateral position and/or sleeping
      flat.

      In healthy controls, sleeping in the left-lateral position with this device system
      significantly decreased esophageal acid exposure and overall episodes of acid reflux. To
      date, there has been no study in patients with extra-esophageal reflux (EER) and nocturnal
      heartburn.

      Primary Objectives The primary objective of the this study is to evaluate the effect of a
      reflux pillow on esophageal acid exposure in patients complaining of nocturnal EER.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the effect of the reflux pillow on nocturnal EER symptoms,
      sleep quality, daytime EER symptoms, and overall quality of life.
