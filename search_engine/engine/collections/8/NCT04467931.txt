      2020. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for
      COVID-19, enters type II pneumocytes using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE
      inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase ACE2 expression.
      Theoretically, if ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression in the lungs, ACEI/ARBs could
      promote SARS-CoV-2 entry into type II pneumocytes and worsen COVID-19 infection. In contrast,
      other evidence suggests that ACEI/ARBs may mitigate virus-induced inflammatory responses in
      the lungs by upregulating ACE2-mediated generation of the vasodilator and anti-inflammatory
      protein angiotensin-(1-7), thereby preventing tissue damage. Few data exist on the direction
      or magnitude of the association between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 severity, and whether these
      associations differ between ACEIs and ARBs. Because ACEI/ARBs are among the most commonly
      used prescription medications, it is critical to determine if ACEI/ARB users have a
      differential risk of more severe COVID-19 infection compared to non-users. The objective of
      this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic by generating timely
      evidence on the direction and magnitude of the association between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19
      severity and mortality.
