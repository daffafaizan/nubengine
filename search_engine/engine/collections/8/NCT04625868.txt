      consumption and proper disposal following elective hand surgery. Patients undergoing elective
      hand surgery are randomized to either watch a preoperative educational video or not. Patients
      are asked to record their pain medication usage postoperatively, as well as their daily pain
      levels and satisfaction with their pain control after surgery.
