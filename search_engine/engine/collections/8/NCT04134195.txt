      stimulation on visual attention in the healthy seniors. A cross-over, randomized,
      placebo-controlled design will be used. Single tDCS sessions will be performed in 4 sessions
      over distinct brain areas with ongoing visual attention training. During the stimulation,
      investigator will use the visual matching task. MRI protocol consisting of T1 and resting
      state fMRI sequences will be acquired before and after every stimulation session in order to
      search for active vs. placebo tDCS-induced changes in brain activation and resting state
      functional connectivity and to identify neural correlates of behavioral changes.
