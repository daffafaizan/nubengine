      neurobehavioral and behavioral mechanisms of cardiometabolic risk. The investigators propose
      that circadian misalignment, which is more common among individuals with late sleep timing,
      leads to increased consumption of energy dense/prepared foods and to decreased insulin
      sensitivity. Short sleep duration and neurobehavioral measures (i.e. delay discounting) may
      moderate these associations, thus exacerbating cardiometabolic risk factors. There is
      evidence for a direct biological link between circadian misalignment and insulin resistance,
      and for a relationship that is mediated through changes in eating behaviors. Insulin
      resistance and increased caloric intake over time lead to increased BMI and body fat.

      In this study, the investigators will conduct cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to
      determine biological and behavioral mechanisms that link circadian alignment and sleep
      duration to changes in cardiometabolic risk over 1 year. This study will identify individual
      differences that predict risk for cardiometabolic disorders and suggest potential for sleep,
      circadian and neurobehavioral interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk.
