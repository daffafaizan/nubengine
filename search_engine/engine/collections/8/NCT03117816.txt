      rejection of a null hypothesis), further confirmatory testing has to be stopped as soon as a
      null hypothesis could not be rejected.

      All four hypotheses are tested at significance level 0.05. Null hypotheses 1, 2, and 4 deal
      with probabilities of molecular relapse-free survival 7, 13, and 25 months after
      randomisation, respectively; arms A and B are compared with the uncorrected chi-square test.
      Null hypothesis 3 investigates molecular relapse-free survival as a time-to-event variable;
      the two arms are compared with the log-rank test
