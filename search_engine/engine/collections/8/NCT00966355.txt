      vasoactive drugs such as terlipressin, somatostatin, and octreotide is recommended as soon as
      possible, even before endoscopy. However, it is still unclear whether the efficacies of these
      drugs are same or not. This study is performed to compare the efficacy of terlipressin,
      somatostatin, and octreotide in patients with variceal bleeding for the control of variceal
      bleeding in combination with endoscopic therapy.
