      (study group) will demonstrate improved clinical outcomes compared to those undergoing
      routine ERCP training only (control group).

      Hypothesis #2: Trainees who are initially in the control arm, but receive the simulator
      training after the initial 30 procedures (delayed intervention) will have significantly
      greater improvement of clinical outcomes in the second phase of the study (steeper learning
      curve) compared to the initial period.

      STUDY DESIGN & OUTCOMES

        -  Controlled randomized observational study.

        -  Immediate intervention (simulator training in the beginning of or just prior to the
           trainees' ERCP rotation) and delayed intervention (simulator training after 30 clinical
           procedures) will be studied

        -  Primary outcome: diagnostic biliary cannulation and deep biliary cannulation success
           rates Secondary outcomes: cannulation time, subjective competency score (5-point scale)
           graded by supervising physicians.
