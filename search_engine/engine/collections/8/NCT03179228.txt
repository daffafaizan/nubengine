      the safety and efficacy of prostate artery embolization (PAE) for treatment of severe lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH in patients with prostate size greater than 40
      grams that either refuse surgical treatment or are considered poor candidates for traditional
      surgical therapy. Two hundred patients will be enrolled in the single treatment arm with
      follow-up for no less than 12 months.

      The study will involve a screening period in which patient eligibility will be determined.
      Once eligibility is confirmed, patients will receive PAE with bland microspheres within 4
      weeks of screening baseline imaging. After treatment, patients will return for follow-up
      visits at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post PAE. At each of these visits,
      patients will complete IPSS and IIEF questionnaires, undergo a physical exam, laboratory
      assessment (including PSA) and perform a medication review. Repeat TRUS and uroflowmetry will
      be performed at the 3, 6, and 12 month post PAE follow-up visits. MRI or CT will be conducted
      at the 3 and 12 month visit. Cystoscopy and proctoscopy will be performed if medically
      indicated.

      The primary endpoint will be improvement of BPH symptoms as assessed by the IPSS at 12 months
      post PAE. Patients will continue to be followed according to the institutional standard of
      care follow-up schedule after they complete the study.

      Safety will be evaluated throughout the initial 12 months of the study by assessing adverse
      events and findings on physical examination. Concomitant medication usage will be assessed.
