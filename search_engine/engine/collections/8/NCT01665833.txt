      angina caused by coronary atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, 35-42% of patients report recurring
      or persisting anginal symptoms after coronary revascularization. This can be attributed to
      many structural and functional causes, prominent amongst which is pre-revascularization
      angina severity, unrevascularized coronary territory, progression of native or bypass graft
      atherosclerosis, restenosis (re-narrowing of the vessels) and accompanying adjunctive
      pharmacotherapy.

      The SYNTAX score is an angiographic tool for grading the complexity of coronary disease. It
      is the sum of points assigned to coronary lesions within one of the 16 segments of the
      coronary tree. The segments are given a 1,2, or 5 based on the disease presence as defined by
      the American Heart Association classification. The SYNTAX score has been used to help predict
      the outcomes of patients undergoing PCI with 3-vessel involvement (e.g. a triple bypass or
      3-stent placement PCI). Those patients with the highest scores had the highest risk of a poor
      outcome with PCI revascularization compared to CABG. Despite these observations, the impact
      of CAD severity on post-revascularization angina, using the SYNTAX has never been
      systematically addressed in the current era.
