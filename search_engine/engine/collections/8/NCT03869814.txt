      detection of disease. As cancer cells manifest their epigenomic changes in blood due to cell
      death, DNA and protein molecules can be probed using specific molecular analytic approaches.
      Bluestar Genomics employs epigenomic technologies to measure dynamic changes in DNA
      demethylation events via direct measurement of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine residues in cfDNA.
      Companion assays are also run to provide information on cfDNA digestion patterns and
      protein-based changes in plasma. This information, combined in a machine learning framework,
      enable the provision of prediction models that report on the presence of cancer and the
      determination of the tissue of tumor origin. This study will build predictive models and test
      performance of these models to detect the presence of cancer and tissue of origin in several
      cancer type by using a matched case-control study design.
