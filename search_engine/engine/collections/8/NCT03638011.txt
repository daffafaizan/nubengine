      bilateral TAP Block (with combined bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine) to Duramorph (an
      opiate). Neuraxial duramorph provides approximately 24 hours of pain relief (analgesia),
      whereas a bilateral TAP block with liposomal bupivacaine is expected to provide up to 72
      hours of analgesia.

      All participants will have neuraxial anesthesia (either a spinal or epidural) for their
      non-urgent or elective Cesarean section.

      The control group (Group 1) will receive either intrathecal or epidural Duramorph
      (preservative-free morphine sulfate). Post-operatively, participants will have orders to
      receive, on an as-needed basis, IV/oral acetaminophen and/or IV/oral non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for mild-moderate pain, and narcotics for severe pain;
      specifically- oxycodone or hydromorphone. All patients must receive acetaminophen and NSAIDS
      (unless contraindicated) before receiving narcotics. This multi-modal pain management regimen
      is our current standard of care.

      The experimental group (Group 2) will also receive a spinal or epidural anesthetic. This
      group will not receive neuraxial Duramorph for post-operative pain. Instead, the patient will
      receive an ultrasound guided bilateral TAP block with a combination of bupivacaine and
      liposomal bupivacaine solution immediately after the Cesarean section. Additionally, all
      participants will receive the same post-operative analgesia orders as group 1.
