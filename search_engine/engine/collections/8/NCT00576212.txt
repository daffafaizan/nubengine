      and stress and a significant increase in hardiness over time at 6 and 12 months
      post-termination compared with the control group; 2) women who score low on hardiness
      initially will experience more psychological distress at 6 and 12 months than subjects who
      score higher initially, irrespective of group; 3) women who have anxious/avoidant attachment
      styles will not show an improvement in psychological distress over time, irrespective of
      group.
