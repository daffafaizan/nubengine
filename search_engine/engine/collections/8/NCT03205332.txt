      chronic worry the effects of an active form of concreteness training that involves imagery
      practice (compared to a no training control condition) on frequency of worrying, problem
      solving quality, and worry-related processes; 2) to examine the degree to which concreteness
      training causes improvements in daily worry and negative affect during the 7 days of
      practice. Participants are recruited from the community via advertisements. Following a
      telephone screen, participants attend a baseline visit during which they complete the MINI
      interview. Those who continue to be eligible complete the outcome measures and are randomly
      assigned to either the experimental condition or the control condition. Participants assigned
      to the experimental condition receive training in concrete processing and learn how to
      complete the daily experience sampling diary. Participants assigned to the control condition
      do not receive training and learn how to complete the daily experience sampling diary. All
      participants then complete their assigned activities for 7 days. They then return to the lab
      to complete the outcome measures at post-test, 1 week follow up and 1 month follow up.
      Participants are then debriefed.
