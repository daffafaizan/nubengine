      be divided into B cells, T cells, and NK cell lymphomas depending on the origin of different
      lymphocytes. Among them, B cell lymphoma accounts for about 90% of lymphoma.

      Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells is a promising treatment for lymphoma. T lymphocytes
      from patients are separated and engineered with CD19-CAR, to specifically recognize and
      eliminate CD19-positive tumor cells. At present, many CD19CART cells therapy studies are in
      the stage of clinical research and have achieved significant clinical effects.

      Although there are some CD9CART cells clinical trials, the therapeutic effect on lymphoma is
      significantly lower than that of acute leukemia. One of the reasons is that lymphoma has the
      nature of solid tumors, whichi has a certain immunosuppressive microenvironment. The clinical
      trials of anti-PD-1 antibody drugs against lymphoma also show good therapeutic efficacy.
      Therefore, the combination of anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody and CD19CART is one of the ways to
      improve the therapeutic effect of CART cells.

      The investigators screened PD-1 mutants that have high bind with the PD-L1 ligand, and
      prepared CD19CART which secretes the mutant PD-1Fc fusion protein. Preclinical studies have
      shown that CD19CART cells secreting mutant PD-1Fc fusion protein have a superior killing
      effect to CD19CART cells which does not express PD-1 fusion protein.

      The trial was conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of CD19-PD1-CART cells in
      Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Lymphoma.
