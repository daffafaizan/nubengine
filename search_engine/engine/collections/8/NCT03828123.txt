      to inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below) screened four times prior to administration.
      Then the subjects will be observed for three consecutive yearsAfter a half year of screening
      period, the autologous multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow will be
      isolated. The cells will be cultivated for 3 passages (3 - 4 weeks) in order to get
      sufficient amount for therapy, cell suspension for intrathecal application will be prepared
      and introduced intrathecally through lumbar puncture. Subsequently, all the subjects will be
      observed at the range of standard medical care used at these types of interventions.
