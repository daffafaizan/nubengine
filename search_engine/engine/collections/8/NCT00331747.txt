      undergo a 3 dimensional gait analysis before initiation of treatment with glatiramer acetate.
      The gait analysis will include kinematic evaluation using a Charnwood Dynamics CODA CX-1
      system, 4 AMTI force plates and a Noraxon telemetric EMG system. Patients will be videotaped
      and will also undergo a detailed physical examination by a physical therapist.

      Treatment with Glatiramer acetate will be initiated after the gait analysis. Therapy will be
      observed and controlled by a neurologist fromn the staff of the Multiple Sclerosis Center.

      Repeat gait analysis will be performed after one year of treatment.
