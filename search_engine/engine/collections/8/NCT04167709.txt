      postpartum depression with help of an interpreter according to the Edinburgh Postnatal
      Depression Scale (EPDS) method more than three times a year. The EPDS is a likert form scale
      with ten statements and is used in combination with a Clinical interview.

      calculated in comparison to two other published studies within the same context. The
