      DRF genes using standard molecular biological approaches to measure mRNA levels. Extracted
      DNA will be analyzed for mutations that affect expressions or function using direct
      sequencing techniques.

      Alternatively, expression of DRF gene products (mDia proteins) will be assessed using
      specific antibodies and flow cytometry. Molecular findings resulting from these assays will
      be correlated with clinical information recorded in specimen logbook.
