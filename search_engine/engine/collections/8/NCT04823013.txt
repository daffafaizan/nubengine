      within a taut band of skeletal muscle or fascia which when compressed produce pain,
      tenderness, dysfunction and autonomic phenomena. The treatment techniques aimed to return the
      fiber groups affected by myofascial trigger points to their normal length and endplates to
      their normal function. Although both ischemic compression and two different application
      methods of high power pain threshold ultrasound techniques are effective methods in the
      treatment of trigger points , there are no studies showing which technique is more effective.
      It is aimed to to compare the efficacy of ischemic compression and two different application
      methods of high power pain threshold ultrasound techniques on myofascial trigger point
      treatment.
