      critically ill newborn babies. A special category of high-risk babies consists of premature
      infants. Their motor growth differs from that of healthy full-term infants and their
      occurrence of motor disorders is greater. The outcome of neuromotor disorders can be
      substantially changed by treatments during the first year of life. So in order to detect
      these neuromotor disorder there must be a reliable screening tool present. Hence, in this
      study we will check reliability of INFANIB.

      Purpose: Reliability of INFANIB among hospitalized preterm infants. Methodology: It will be
      an observational study and will be carried out in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The
      study will recruit preterm infants that are stable and are present without any respiratory
      assistive devices.

      INFANIB screening tool will be performed on these infants. It has 20 items that measure the
      state of the infant for body tone and posture, primitive reflexes and French angles in the
      supine, prone, sitting, standing and suspended position upto 18 months. But we will take only
      preterm infants so only 14 items will be assessed and infants will be scored accordingly. The
      main focus will be on test- retest reliability.

      Discussion: A similar research has been carried out in Iran and China, that established that
      reliability of INFANIB is excellent. Another research was carried out in India that stated
      INFANIB's reliability to be low. So this study is required to be carried out in India to know
      the actual results.
