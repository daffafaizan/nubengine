      containing these mutations as non-self antigens in the context of HLA on the tumor cell
      surface. A fraction of mutated peptides result in neoantigens capable of generating T-cell
      responses that exclusively target tumor cells. Sensitive detection of these mutations allows
      for the identification of neoantigens unique to each patient's tumor to be included in a
      personalized cancer vaccine that targets these neoantigens. This vaccine regimen uses two
      vaccine vectors as a heterologous prime/boost approach (GRT-C901 first followed by GRT-R902)
      to stimulate an immune response. This study will explore the safety and early clinical
      activity of this patient-specific immunotherapy intended to induce T-cell responses specific
      for neoantigens.
