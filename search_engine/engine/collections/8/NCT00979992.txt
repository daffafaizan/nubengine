      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of SU11248 (sunitinib malate), a highly potent,
      selective tyrosine kinases inhibitor, in patients with persistent or recurrent clear cell
      ovarian carcinoma.

      II. To examine the nature and degree of toxicity in this cohort of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the distribution of progression-free survival and overall survival for
      patients treated with SU11248 (sunitinib malate).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pre-cycle 1, pre-cycle 4 and off-treatment levels of pro-angiogenic
      proteins (e.g., angiogenin, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM]-I, basic
      fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF], placental growth
      factor [PlGF], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], and hypoxia-inducible factor
      [HIF]1alpha).

      II. To identify changes in serum and plasma angiogenesis markers at baseline (pre-cycle 1),
      during treatment (cycle 4), and at progression in association with primary and secondary
      clinical endpoints associated with clinical response or progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
