      until 80 years undergoing cataract extraction will be randomized in two groups. Exclusion
      criteria will be myocardial ischemia, psychiatric disease, chronic pain, drugs dependency,
      chronic use of beta-blockage channel drugs. Group 2, patients will receive a single dose of
      4mcg.kg-1 of clonidin2, 20 minutes before the surgical incision; group 1, patients will
      receive a sterile saline solution dose. Pain intensity will be assessed with the numeric
      rating scale. The antiarrythmic effect will be assessed with the continuous measure by
      Holter. The number of patients was calculated by Instat Graph® program. To detect difference
      in pain intensity of 3 between the groups by NRS, with 95% of power (estimated SD= 2.0), when
      the alpha level is set at 0.05, the sample should be of 20. Statistical analyses will be
      performed with parametric and nonparametric tests, considering the variety studied. The
      statistical program that will be utilized is Instat Graph®.
