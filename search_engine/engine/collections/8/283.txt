903. lattice structures and osmiophilic bodies in the developingrespiratory tissue of ratsosmiophilic inclusions have been observed in thelungs of rats particularly in the 20-day rat embryo andnewborn up to 3 days post partum.  these inclusionsare present in the large alveolar cells as dense lamin-ated structures of variable size and configuration.  theygenerally consist of concentrically arranged membranesand have the appearance of myelin figures, usually witha dense center.  these osmiophilic inclusions are fre-quently seen in direct contact with the cell membranesand the alveolar space.  the alveolar space containsnumerous osmiophilic myelin figures which are thoughtto originate from the intracellular osmiophilic inclu-sions.  they may extrude through a channel formed in-side the cell or by rupture of the cell membrane.  secre-tion materials may occasionally be seen in the cyto-plasm of the large alveolar epithelial cells.  these cellsappear to be in the process of degeneration.  their cellsurfaces are disrupted and the cytoplasm is continuouswith materials in the air space.  the lattice structurein the alveolar space may originate from the cytoplas-mic secretion material.  the cytoplasmic secretion ma-terial in the cell and the lattice structures in the airspace disappear after the rats are 3 days old.
