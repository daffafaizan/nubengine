    
      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of two different treatments for
      inhibitory control improvement (measured by the modified Stop signal task): a behavioral
      treatment based on Retrieval-Extinction Learning, through the AAT (Alcohol Approach Avoiding
      Task) and a treatment based on the neuromodulation of prefrontal cortex through the rTMS
      (repetitive transcraneal magnetic stimulation) technique. To carry out this study, 105
      alcoholic patients will be compared for clinical variables (abstinence/relapses),
      self-informed (UPPS) and behvavioral impulsivity (Stop signal task), along with biological
      measures for polymorphism determinations. Alcohol-dependent individuals will be divided into
      4 groups of study (1:1 proportion for Retrieval-Extinction Learning with AAT and 2:1 (double
      for the effective technique comparing to placebo/control) for rTMS): Group 1 (N=30): exposure
      to an alcohol-related video followed by AAT; Group 2 (N=30): neutral-content video followed
      by AAT; Group 4 (30): active stimulation rTMS (10 Hz) ; Group 4 (N=15): placebo stimulation
      SAM.
