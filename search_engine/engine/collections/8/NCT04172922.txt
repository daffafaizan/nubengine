      classified into vascular tumors and malformations. Complicated vascular anomalies can cause
      disfigurement, chronic pain, and organ dysfunction with significant morbidity and mortality.
      Despite the severity of potential complications, we lack uniform guidelines for the treatment
      and response to treatment of children and young adults with these diseases. Pre-clinical and
      clinical data supporting the essential regulatory function of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in
      vascular growth and organization, and suggest a therapeutic target for patients with
      complicated vascular anomalies. Nemours Children's Hospital (NCH) and other groups have been
      successfully using the mTOR inhibitor siroli-mus in a selected group of patients with VA. NCH
      exclusively uses the systemic oral formulation of sirolimus. The potential toxicities of
      systemic sirolimus is well documented, and many patients do not tolerate systemic sirolimus.
      We hypothesize this study will advance our treatment options of vascular anomalies by
      offering topical sirolimus. This prospective open labeled study will allow us to determine
      the efficacy and tolerability of topical sirolimus in the treatment of complicated vascular
      anomalies. This will potentially generate data for the use of topical sirolimus as an
      alternative to systemic sirolimus for patients with complicated VA with a cutaneous
      component.
