      androgen excess and the features of PCOS can run through a spectrum of severity. The optimal
      modality for long-term treatment of PCOS should positively influence androgen synthesis, sex
      hormone binding globulin (SHBG) production, insulin sensitivity, the lipid profile, and
      clinical symptoms including hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles. Combined oral
      contraceptives have been a key component of the chronic treatment of women with PCOS;
      improving androgen excess and regulating menstrual cycles. The effect of OCs on ovarian
      folliculogenesis significantly decreases androgen production. This mechanism was confirmed in
      both healthy women and women with PCOS. In obese patients with PCOS, it is likely that the
      suppression of androgen production is not as significant. It is thus possible to hypothesize
      that the effects of OCs in PCOS could be dependent on body weight and what is needed is a
      head-to-head comparison. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of 6 months of a
      low-dose oral contraceptive regimen of 24/4 DRSP 3 mg/EE 0.02mg/levomefolate calcium 0.451 mg
      on androgen profiles, cardiometabolic measures, B-vitamin status, and menstrual cycle
      regulation in three groups, normal (BMI 18-24.9 kg/ m2) overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/ m2) and
      obese (BMI 30-35 kg/ m2) women with PCOS.
