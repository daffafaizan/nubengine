      (CLD), though some support for this practice exists in the literature. Carracedo et al.,
      Lipson et al., and Garcia-Porta et al. found that orthokeratology resulted in better ocular
      comfort than soft contact lenses. Nevertheless, all three studies excluded subjects who had
      been diagnosed with dry eye and all three studies used symptoms surveys that were not
      specific to assessing CLD. Garcia-Porta et al.'s study was also limited by including both
      neophytes and established contact lens wearers. Yet, these studies overall suggest that
      orthokeratology could be used as a treatment for CLD, and one case report has even found that
      orthokeratology is a viable option for treating contact lens intolerance.

      To date, there has yet to be a study fully investigating orthokeratology as an alternative to
      soft contact lens use in patients with CLD. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
      formally investigate if orthokeratology is a good alternative to soft contact lenses for
      patients who are experiencing CLD or for patients who have dropped out of contact lenses
      because of CLD. This study will also simultaneously evaluate the neophyte orthokeratology
      wearing experience with hopes of finding additional means for improving contact lens comfort.
      Knowing the success of orthokeratology in wearers with CLD will allow practitioners to better
      help and prescribe for those who may have experienced or at risk for experiencing CLD. It may
      also be a way to allow patients additional years of contact lens wear.
