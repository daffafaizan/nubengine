    
      This is a placebo-controlled, single-center, multiple ascending dose study. Seven healthy
      volunteers will be enrolled into 2 sequential cohorts, for a total of 14 enrolled subjects.
      The study will be conducted using two doses of valproate (250 mg PO bid, followed by 500 mg
      PO bid). At each dose level, 7 cognitively intact normal elderly subjects will be entered
      into the study with two subjects randomly selected to receive placebo while the other five
      subjects receive the designated dose of valproate.

      Study procedures will include routine assessment of adverse events, safety labs, baseline
      MRI, physical and neurological exams, and cerebrospinal fluid collection.

      Other investigational medication or devices are prohibited during this study.
