    
      This pilot trial is designed specifically to collect the preliminary safety and tolerability
      data necessary to conduct a future phase III clinical trial to investigate the hypothesis
      that deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in subjects with early Parkinson's
      will slow the progression of the disease.

      The study design is a prospective, randomized, blinded, single-center trial comparing the
      safety and tolerability of B-STN DBS + Optimal Drug Therapy (ODT) vs. (ODT) alone (control,
      standard of care) in 30 subjects (15 per group) with early PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage II when
      off medication).
