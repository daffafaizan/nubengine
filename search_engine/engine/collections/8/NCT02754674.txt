        1. Double bundle transportal technique with flexible reamer: 33

             -  Advantage: more normal ACL reconstruction than single bundle technique

             -  Disadvantage: to make the two bone tunnel must remove all the residual tissue.

        2. Single bundle outside in technique with remnant preservation: 33

             -  Advantage: good for being synovium and revascularization. Remained proprioception
                function helps to functional recovery.

             -  Disadvantage: difficult to ensure of visibility and tunnel drilling in the correct
                position because of remnant tissue.
