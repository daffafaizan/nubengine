      safey and feasibility has been evaluated. However, the learning curve of this procedure is
      unclear. Specially,whether the two surgical robots (Micro Hand S and da Vinci) shared a
      similar learning curve and the two robot can be trained simultaneously are unclear.Therefore,
      this srudy is conducted to evaluate the learning curve of the two robots in low anterior
      resection.
