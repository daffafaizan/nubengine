      surgical indications and postoperative prescription. The unstable fractures were A2 and A3
      (31 A2.2 and 3, and 31 A3.3) according to the AO classification. The investigators will use a
      prospective randomized approach to determine the treatment procedure for patients. The
      patients undergoing arthroplasty will be regarded as the experimental group and the patients
      who accept the intramedullary nail fixation will be regarded as the positive control group.
      All patients will receive consistent anticoagulant, analgesic and other therapeutic measures
      in the perioperative period except for the different surgical methods. The two groups will be
      compared in age, sex, pre-fracture place of residence, fracture type and preoperative
      comorbidity. The investigators will evaluate the effect and safety of the two types of
      operations by comparing the surgical related data, complication incidence and functional
      rehabilitation.
