    
      Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) is a music therapy technique that provides rhythmic
      auditory cues (like a beat) to help improve patients' movements, especially when walking. The
      RAS can be delivered at a fixed tempo or interactive tempo.

      The device used in this study will deliver an interactive tempo. The equipment will include a
      mobile device app and sensors that are attached to the participant's shoes. Headphones and
      smartphones will be required to use the device and will be provided to the study team and
      kept at the center for this study. The device is designed to use audio cues to facilitate
      improvements in the participant's walking speed while listening to music.

      The overall purpose of this study is to assess the safety and acceptability of interactive
      RAS music combined with gait training in individuals with MS and walking impairment, and to
      gather preliminary efficacy data for future studies.
