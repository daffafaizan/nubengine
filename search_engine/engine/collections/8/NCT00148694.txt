    
      Before starting treatment patients will undergo placement of a clip into the tumor bed so the
      surgeon can locate the site of the tumor at the time of surgery.

      Patients will receive cisplatin intravenously once every three weeks for a total of 4 cycles
      or 12 weeks of treatment.

      After completion of cisplatin, patients will undergo surgery to remove any tumor that remains
      and to assess the tissue to see if tumor cells remain in the breast.

      Patients may receive a second breast MRI and biopsy 7-14 days after treatment begins to see
      whether we can identify tumors that will ultimately respond to cisplatin with a rapid
      evaluation.

      Patients will receive study treatment for approximately 12 weeks unless unacceptable toxicity
      occurs. After surgery patients will receive standard adjuvant therapy based on discussion
      with their physician. Follow-up progress will occur for several years.
