    
      The primary objective of this trial is to provide information regarding the efficacy of a
      combined treatment with transcranial US and systemic tPA (Target group) compared to systemic
      tPA alone (Control group) in subjects with acute ischemic stroke. The primary efficacy
      endpoint is functional outcome at 3 months from stroke onset (modified Rankin Score ordinal
      shift analysis). The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects in the Target vs
      Control group experiencing symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) within 24 hours of
      treatment.
