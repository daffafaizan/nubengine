      in the Malm√∂ uptake are for an opioid overdose requiring naloxone antidote administration,
      and if they sign informed written consent to the study. Subjects are randomized by ambulance
      staff to either an active intervention, or a control condition:

      Intervention: A telephone alert signal is sent from ambulance staff after successful naloxone
      reversal of an opioid overdose, leading to an active outreach effort from the staff of the
      addiction research facility, where staff locate the individual and offer her/him formal
      inclusion in the study.

      Control: No telephone alert signal is sent, and the active outreach procedure is not carried
      out. Ambulance staff hand over written information to the individual about how she/he can
      apply actively for treatment.

      Primary outcome is entry into formal assessment and treatment of the substance use disorder.
