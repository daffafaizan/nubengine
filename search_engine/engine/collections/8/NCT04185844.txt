    
      Investigators will conduct a longitudinal study of a CKD cohort of Southwest AIs to identify
      unique risk factors for CKD and CVD progression and compare CKD and CVD event rates and risk
      factors between AI and the populations represented in CRIC. Investigators will establish a
      specimen bank to support future ancillary studies designed to identify and examine biomarkers
      associated with the progression of CKD in AIs.

      At the Clinic Visit the following will occur:

        -  weight is measured

        -  blood pressure and heart rate are recorded

        -  information about medical history and medication used recently

        -  blood draw (about Â½ cup) for the following tests: CBC (Complete Blood Count), tests of
           metabolism, and several other heart and kidney tests

        -  blood pressure in the leg and arm calculated as the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)

        -  urine sample collection for kidney function testing

        -  complete questionnaires about quality of life, diet, mood, thought processes and
           physical activity.

      This visit takes about 1 to 2 hours. Participants will be contacted by telephone six months
      after the Baseline Visit to ask about recent medical events and medications.

      Participants will be asked to return to the center for annual visits during which many but
      not all of the procedures described above will be conducted.

      Additionally, participants will be asked to participate in one of two substudies using remote
      data collection techniques to identify trajectories of kidney function and cardiovascular
      risk sub-phenotypes
