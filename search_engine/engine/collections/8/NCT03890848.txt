      ligament (ACL) injuries has increased. ACL reconstruction is the best treatment for ACL
      injury. The success rate of surgery is high, but the patient still needs to rehabilitate
      after surgery, otherwise it is difficult to fully recover knee function. However, the
      rehabilitation medical resources in China are obviously insufficient. Patients who have
      undergone ACL reconstruction usually return home to work according to the rehabilitation
      plan. However, the adherence is still poor, and it is difficult to achieve the expected
      effect. The WeChat public account and its affiliated applets have been widely used in
      different health fields. The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a guiding theory commonly used in
      health education to guide patients for behavioral changes. This study aims to use the WeChat
      small program to explore the effects of optimized the existing Peking University Third
      Hospital Sports Medicine WeChat small program by using HBM to improve the adherence of
      patients with home-based functional exercise after ACL injury reconstruction.
