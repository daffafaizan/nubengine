    
      Patients with a documented history of moderate to severe non-malignant pain that require
      around the clock opioid therapy will be randomised to an oxycodone or an oxycodone-naloxone
      treatment arm to assess the safety and efficacy of oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release
      compared to oxycodone prolonged-release in relieving opioid-related constipation.
