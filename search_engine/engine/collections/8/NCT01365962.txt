        -  To determine and quantify the degree of surface insulin-like growth factor I receptor
           (IGF-IR) expression in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) tumor tissue.

        -  To assess the feasibility and validity of a mass spectrometry assay for IGF-IR
           expression on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue.

      OUTLINE: Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue slides are analyzed for insulin-like growth factor I
      receptor (IGF-1R) expression by mass spectrometry and correlated with the results obtained by
      IHC assay.
