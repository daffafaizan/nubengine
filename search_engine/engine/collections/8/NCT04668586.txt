      lithotripsy with Holmium and Thulium lasers. SFRs will be compared both for ureteral stones,
      renal stones and ureteral and renal stones in total.

      Secondary aims are to compare the results of the two lasers in terms of operating times,
      intraoperative complications, postoperative complications and the rate of post endoscopic
      JJ-stenting.

      The study is designed as a prospective clinical randomised trial, where the study
      participants are randomised to either URS with Holmium:YAG laser or URS with Thulium Fiber
      Laser.

      The outcomes of the URS procedures are compared for the two treatment arms.
