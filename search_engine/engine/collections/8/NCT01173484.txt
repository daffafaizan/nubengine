      Pathophysiology may not be "idiopathic," but merely unidentifiable with conventional methods
      suggested for gastroparesis. The diagnosis of "gastroparesis" suggests that delayed gastric
      emptying is the underlying cause of symptoms, but this description fails to explain the
      variable presentation. There are fundamental differences in pathophysiology, clinical
      presentation, severity, and future prognosis among patients with idiopathic gastroparesis.
      Understanding these differences is necessary in order to provide cost-effective treatment in
      these patients.

      We believe our clinical classification for gastroparesis is a clinical useful tool in the
      management of patients with idiopathic gastroparesis to predict clinical severity, treatment
      response, and future prognosis. Patients with vomiting-predominant gastroparesis will be more
      likely to have an underlying cause, such as viral infection or impaired glucose tolerance
      with vagal neuropathy. Their symptoms will likely be persistent. Patients with
      dyspepsia-predominant gastroparesis mimic those with functional dyspepsia and are unlikely to
      have complications such as weight loss, and dehydration. The necessity of enteric feeding in
      these patients is also unlikely. Prokinetics may help since delayed gastric emptying may
      contribute to epigastric pain or postprandial distress. Finding and treating small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth as well as suggesting lifestyle and dietary modifications may be
      helpful. Patients with regurgitation-predominant gastroparesis may benefit most by improving
      their delayed gastric emptying. Their gastroparesis may cause reflux-like symptoms,
      especially at night.
