      tap to rule out or prove septic prosthesis failure and thus establish a new diagnostic
      method. The subsequently calculated sensitivities of the previous and the procedure are used
      as the main indicator. In addition, we would like to prove that the total cost of diagnosing
      a septic / aseptic prosthesis failure using the proposed method has socio-economic advantages
      over the previous algorithm.

      One of the secondary objectives is the evaluation of the use of a punch biopsy for
      simultaneous a priori pathomorphological examination of periprosthetic soft tissue samples
      for the determination of wear particles. Furthermore, the study is intended to demonstrate a
      shortening of the time span between the first suspected diagnosis of septic prosthesis
      failure and its reliable exclusion / detection.
