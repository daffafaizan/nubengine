    
      In this disease registry, data on approximately 120 allo HSCT patients who have received
      salvage treatment (second or later line) with any antiviral therapy for ADV and / or CMV post
      allogeneic HSCT will be documented; of these 120, at least 40 patients will have been treated
      with Cell Medica's immune reconstitution ACT as salvage therapy. The patients will be
      consented prospectively or retrospectively for collection of data. Data will be collected at
      baseline, 6 months and 1 year after commencement of salvage treatment. Retrospective data
      collection (for patients who underwent HSCT in 2010 or later) is permitted.
