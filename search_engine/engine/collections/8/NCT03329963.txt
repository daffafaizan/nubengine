      weight loss in elderly population improves physical function, cardio metabolic risk factors,
      and cognition/quality of life, but a major complication is loss of BMD. The addition of
      exercise to diet-induced weight loss attenuated but did not eliminate weight-loss-induced
      reduction of BMD. Moreover, while long-term maintenance of weight loss and physical function
      was feasible, sustained lifestyle change led to continued loss of hip BMD, which might
      predict hip fractures. Although similar BMD loss with weight loss has been observed in
      younger populations, BMD loss in older adults might be of particular concern because of
      aggravation of age-related bone loss. Moreover, the belief that obesity protects against
      fractures has now been challenged by studies demonstrating that obesity is associated with
      poor bone quality and ankle and leg fractures.Because of previous lack of options to assess
      bone quality in vivo, there has been little or no scientific study of the possibility that
      lifestyle therapy in obese older adults improves bone quality. This study represents an
      unprecedented opportunity to prove the hypothesis that lifestyle therapy intervention
      improves bone quality and thus, may confer a protective rather than adverse effect on bone
      health. This will be the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to comprehensively assess
      bone quality using novel techniques in response to lifestyle therapy in obese older adults,
      with major ramifications with regards to defining optimal treatment strategies for this
      increasingly high-risk older population.
