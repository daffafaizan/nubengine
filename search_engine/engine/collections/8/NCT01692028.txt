      previously enrolled in the Pure North S'Energy Foundation's health program. Individuals with
      a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or a HOMA-IR value above 16 were excluded. Standard
      statistical analyses carried out. An association between 25(OH)D and the endpoints of
      interest was first established. The residual values after adjusting HOMA-IR, serum insulin,
      QUICKI, and blood pressure for BMI, age, sex, and waist circumference were then regressed
      against serum 25(OH)D using 40-percentile data blocks, stepping upward from the lowest
      25(OH)D values by 5 percentile increments through the 7th decile. Regression coefficients are
      then computed for each data block and each outcome variable. The location (along the 25(OF)D
      continuum) of the largest and most statistically significant coefficients is noted, and
      regions of null response noted as well.
