      divided into two random groups that will be exposed to sand (one monazite sand group and
      another beach sand group without radiation) for 12 months. The groups will be evaluated at
      time 0 (at the patient's arrival in the group) and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of exposure
      following the literature criteria for evaluation of knee osteoarthrosis (Visual Analogue
      Scale (EVA) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)) and
      non-specific and specific biomarkers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate,
      IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TGF-β, and TNF-α). In addition, the groups will undergo an initial
      interview and monitoring of the pharmacological therapies used prior to the study and during
      the months of follow-up using the Dáder methodology of pharmaceutical care adapted to the
      study. As a result, the scientific evidence of the efficacy of monazitic sands in knee
      osteoarthrosis is expected not only by clinical criteria but also by laboratory evidence on
      the markers of the inflammatory and degenerative process that allow us to document the real
      value of the monazitic sands for health of the population, to establish a great line of
      research for the state of Espírito Santo and to value the State of Espírito Santo and the
      municipality of Guarapari as potential itineraries for SPA tourism (aiming to improve
      health).
