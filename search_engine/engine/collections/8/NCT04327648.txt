      the ability of language, behavior and learning. However, there is no suitable and effective
      behavior intervention for home training yet. Current study try a 3 months' randomized
      double-blinded clinical trial to find out whether tablet computer social interaction
      treatment at home is effective for ASD children. 90 3-6 years old ASD children will be
      included and divided into three groups, social interaction treatment group, neuronal
      cognition treatment and routine treatment group respectively. During the treatment days,
      children in social interaction treatment group will have 30min social interaction each day
      for 3 months. Children in neuronal cognition treatment group will experienced neural
      cognition training 30min each day for 3 months. Children in routine treatment group will keep
      the same initial treatment. All ASD children are followed up closely. The primary observed
      indicator is the score of Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) at the inclusion, one month
      and 3 month after treatment to evaluate the effect of tablet computer social interaction
      treatment on ASD children.
