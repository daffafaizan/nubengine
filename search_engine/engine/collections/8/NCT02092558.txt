      in the diagnosis and treatment of N-KSM of the urinary bladder in children aged from 5 to 17
      years. From 2005 to 2013, metaplasia was diagnosed in 119 patients - 116 girls and 3 boys.
      The reasons behind visiting the hospital were non-specific intense pain in the abdomen,
      recurrent urinary tract infections, and urination disorders. The most common symptoms of
      urinary bladder dysfunction were pollakiuria and difficulties in initiating micturition and
      retention of urine (reduced detrusor muscle activity).

      Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: In 20 patients (16.8%), metaplasia was
      incidentally diagnosed during cystoscopy performed for other causes. Only the children whose
      bladders showed metaplastic changes on cystoscopy were subjected to a bladder biopsy for
      collecting specimens for further histopathological examination.
