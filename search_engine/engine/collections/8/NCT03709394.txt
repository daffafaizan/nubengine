      medicine. When performed by conventional approach, the failure of the first attempt occurs up
      to 22 % and cannulation time exceed 2 minutes in up to 15 %. Ultrasound guidance of
      peripheral venous catheter (PVC) insertion may improve both. However, this approach has not
      been verified in the setting of pre-hospital emergency care so far.
