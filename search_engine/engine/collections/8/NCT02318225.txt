      hysteroscopy has been proposed by several authors.

      The use of misoprostol is usually associated with undesired side effects and therefore any
      beneficial effect of misoprostol on reducing pain should be weighed against its undesired
      side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, shivering, pain) and coasts. Till now , no
      studies have yet determined whether misoprostol should be used routinely or for the subgroup
      of patients at higher risk for cervical stenosis.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether vaginal misoprostol reduces pain during office
      hysteroscopy in parous patients with no risk factors for experiencing severe or unacceptable
      pain.
