      an adjunctive tool to standard practice for intraoperative identification of tumor at
      lumpectomy margins, and its ability to reduce positive margins and decrease the need for
      additional surgical procedures.

      Aims of the study:

      Primary objectives

      1. Determine positive margin rate following lumpectomy

      Secondary objectives

        1. Determine accuracy of intraoperative margin assessment with use of MarginProbe plus
           standard of care (gross pathologic examination and/or intraoperative specimen Xray)
           versus standard of care (gross pathologic examination and/or intraoperative specimen
           Xray) alone.

        2. Determine impact of MarginProbe on total tissue volume removed

        3. Determine the impact of MarginProbe on the need for additional surgical procedures.
