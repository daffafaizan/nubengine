    
      The study consists of a Screening period, Treatment period and Follow-up. The Screening
      period is comprised of two separate in-clinic visits, SV1 and SV2. At the initial Screening
      visit (SV1), subjects will be required to provide written informed consent to participate in
      the study and will then be assessed for eligibility. Electronic diaries will be provided to
      subjects at this visit to use for the duration of the study in order to record information
      relating to their UC disease. Subjects will return to the clinic for their Screening
      endoscopic assessment (SV2). Ulcerative colitis disease activity for eligibility will be
      assessed using the 3-Component Adapted Mayo Score. Upon successful completion of the
      Screening period, subjects will return to the clinic for their Baseline visit.

      During the Treatment period, subjects will be evaluated in the clinic at Baseline (Day 1),
      Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 (End of Treatment Period). At Week 6 and Week 10,
      subjects will be contacted by telephone to assess Adverse Events (AEs), concomitant
      medication usage and study drug regimen adherence.

      Subjects who complete the 12-week Treatment period will attend the Week 16 End of Study (EOS)
      visit. Subjects who discontinue study drug and withdraw or are withdrawn from the study
      before the Week 12 visit will be requested to return to the clinic as soon as possible to
      complete an Early Termination (ET) visit.
