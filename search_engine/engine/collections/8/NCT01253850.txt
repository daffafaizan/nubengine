      the study, including hiring and training activities with study staff. This time will be spent
      conducting interviews and using these data to inform the development of the intervention
      protocol and adaptation of all Life-Steps intervention materials, including study assessment
      instruments, for HIV-infected youth.

      The interview is a one-time event and will last for 1.5-2 hours. It has two components: a
      quantitative assessment and a qualitative discussion. After all participants have completed
      the informed consent and assent (if under the age of 18) processes, the research staff will
      administer a brief quantitative assessment that will ask questions related to demographics,
      medication adherence, sexual risk, substance use, and psychosocial condition. The second part
      of the interview will be an open discussion. The interviews will be conducted by a trained
      member of the research staff. The interviews will be informed by a pre-determined qualitative
      topic guide.
