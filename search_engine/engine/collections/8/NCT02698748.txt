      directly observed treatment with CQ (vs. placebo) for the clearing of asymptomatic
      parasitemia. People with asymptomatic P. falciparum parasitaemia, defined as the presence of
      a P. falciparum infection in the absence of any clinical symptomatology including fever,
      history of fever in the preceding 24 hours, malaise, fatigue, chills, or any other symptoms
      that may be derived from the malarial infection, who meet the study inclusion criteria will
      be enrolled, treated on site with CQ phosphate (25mg/Kg CQ base divided in three daily doses:
      10mg/kg day 1 (usually 4 tablets); 10mg/kg day 2 (4 tablets) and 5mg/kg day 3 (2 tablets)) or
      placebo pills (same schedule, 4 tablets day one and two; and 2 tablets on day three), and
      monitored for 28 days. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and
      corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these
      assessments, the patients will be classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or
      an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the
      follow-up period will be used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis will
      be used to distinguish between a true recrudescence due to treatment failure and episodes of
      reinfection.
