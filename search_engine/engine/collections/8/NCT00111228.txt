      (CGMS速) allow diabetic patients to find a balance between the two hyper- and hypoglycemic
      extremes. Nevertheless, there are still patients who fail to achieve good control due to fear
      of hypoglycemia, or who underestimate post-prandial hyperglycemias.

      The Guardian速 RT Telemetered Glucose Monitoring System is indicated for continuous or
      periodic monitoring of real-time interstitial blood glucose values and low/high blood glucose
      alarms (when pre-set levels are reached) in persons with diabetes mellitus. The glucose
      values calculated by the device will be used to trigger hypo- and hyperglycemia alerts and
      will be displayed every 5 minutes. The Guardian速 RT stores up to 21 days of data.

      The overall primary objective of the study is to determine whether patients with poor
      glycemic control as evidenced by HbA1c > 8.1% can achieve improved metabolic control using
      the real-time values of the Guardian速 RT compared to conventional self-monitoring blood
      glucose finger-sticks (control group) after 12 weeks of continuous use.
