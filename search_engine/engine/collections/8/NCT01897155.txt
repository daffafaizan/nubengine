      animal and humans. One of the explanations to this phenomenon is a baroreceptor activity and
      vasopressin release at the level of spinal cord dorsal horn and hypothalamus.

      As far as we know, there is only one study about the effect of chronic hypertension on
      postoperative pain and none with acute hypertension. We therefore decided to conduct a
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of acute hypertension on postoperative
      morphine's requirements.
