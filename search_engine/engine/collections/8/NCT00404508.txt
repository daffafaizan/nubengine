      acetylation status typing before being treated. Patients will begin treatment (day -7) with a
      daily dose of a slow-release formulation of hydralazine tablets containing either 182 mg for
      rapid-acetylators or 83 mg for slow-acetylators and slow-release tablets containing 700mg of
      magnesium valproate at a dose of 40mg/Kb t.i.d. Both hydralazine and magnesium valproate will
      be administered from day -7 until the last day of the last chemotherapy cycle. Chemotherapy
      will initiate at day 1 (after seven days of being taken hydralazine and magnesium valproate)
      with the same pre-study protocol regimen at which patients showed tumor progression. Toxicity
      will be evaluated after each course of chemotherapy. Response will be evaluated at the third
      course of chemotherapy. Promoter of selected genes will be evaluated by methylation-specific
      PCR in serum DNA before and after 7 days of treatment with hydralazine and valproate.
