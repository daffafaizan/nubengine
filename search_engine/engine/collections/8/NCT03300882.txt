      through infected body fluids. In those with a normal immune system, CMV does not cause much
      of a problem. The immune system keeps the virus under control so most people do not have any
      symptoms. Once infected, the virus usually stays dormant (inactive) in the body for a
      person's entire life. This means some of the cells in the body are infected and the virus can
      become active again.

      Lung transplant recipients take anti-rejection medicines to prevent the body from rejecting
      the transplanted lung(s). Although anti-rejection medications help protect the transplanted
      lung(s) from the body's immune system, these medications also decrease the body's ability to
      fight infections. This reduces the immune system's ability to control viruses like CMV. Many
      transplant recipients take an antiviral medication early after transplant to help the body
      control the CMV virus. This is the time that risk of infection would be highest. Sometimes
      recipients get an active CMV infection after stopping these medicines. If this happens, the
      infection is treated and monitored.

      In this study, investigators are trying to determine whether a blood test can predict
      development of active CMV infection in lung transplant recipients. Specifically, the clinical
      research study will prospectively assess the performance of an immune signature based on the
      "ex vivo" measurement of T cell CMV specific immunity in predicting freedom from future CMV
      infections among recipient positive (R+) lung transplant participants receiving standard
      durations of valganciclovir prophylaxis.
