      Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitors BGB-3111 and ibrutinib in participants with Waldenstr√∂m's
      Macroglobulinemia who require therapy. Participants will have baseline bone marrow samples
      assayed for sequencing of the MYD88 gene. Approximately 188 participants with the MYD88
      mutation will be enrolled onto Cohort 1 and randomized to receive 160 mg BGB-3111 PO BID
      (treatment Arm A) or to receive 420mg ibrutinib QD (treatment Arm B) until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants with MYD88 wild type will be enrolled to
      Cohort 2 and will receive 160 mg BGB-3111 PO BID (treatment Arm C) until disease progressive
      disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study
      termination by Sponsor.
