    
      Eligible subjects entered a one to two week baseline period; followed by a six week double
      blind, randomised, parallel group comparison of GW-1000-02 with placebo, self-titrated to
      symptom resolution or maximum tolerated dose. Existing medication continued at a constant
      dose.

      Primary efficacy comparisons were made between symptom scores recorded during baseline and
      scores recorded at the end of the parallel group period.
