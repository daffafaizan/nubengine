    
      Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for
      patients with high risk or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R-AML). Graft-versus-host
      disease （GVHD）is a major barrier to achieve success for patients with HSCT. High dose
      cyclophosphamide given after HLA-matched related and unrelated allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation for patients with hematologic malignancies is effective single agent (GVHD)
      prophylaxis in adults and in pediatric benign patients. Data describing outcomes for
      pediatric maligant patients has not been reported. Investigators have recruited 26 pediatric
      patients (3 years < age <18 years) between March 2015 to July 2018 with primary induction
      R-AML treated in investigators' institution for R-AML with modified myeloablative regimen,
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has been used as GVHD prophylaxis.

      Conditioning regimen of the group of patient consisted Idrabine(IDA,10mg/m2/day) which was
      administered intravenously for 2 days, from days -14 to -13, total body irritation (TBI, 9
      Gy) which was divided into 3 fractions and 3 days from -12 to -10, thymoglobulin
      (2.5mg/kg/day) was administered for 3 days, from -9 to -7, etoposide (VP-16, 300mg/m2) which
      was infused intravenously on day -6, cladribine (10mg/m2/day) which was administered for 3
      days from -5 to -2 .
