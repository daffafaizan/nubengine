      While inflammation is pervasive to many neurological disorders, no clinical trial has yet
      demonstrated the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents for AD. Interestingly, chronic
      peripheral low-grade inflammation is associated with aging and increases the risk for disease
      and mortality, including AD. Accumulating evidence indicates that nuclear factor-kappa B,
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukins (e.g. IL-1beta, IL-2, and IL-6), and
      chemokines (e.g. IL-8) are found elevated both in the blood and central nervous system (CNS)
      of AD patients. These data confirm that inflammation plays a central role in the cause and
      effect of AD neuropathology.

      The immunomodulator, anti-cancer agent lenalidomide is one of the very few pleiotropic agents
      that both lowers the expression of TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and increases the expression of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-10), to modulate both innate and adaptive immune
      responses.

      In the current project the investigators aim to test the central hypothesis that lenalidomide
      reduces inflammatory and AD-associated pathological biomarkers, and improves cognition. For
      this, the investigators designed an 18-month, Phase II, double-blind, randomized, two-armed,
      parallel group, placebo controlled, and proof-of-mechanism clinical study in early
      symptomatic AD subjects (i.e. amnestic mild cognitive impairment; aMCI). The effects of
      lenalidomide treatment will be assessed after 12 months of treatment and 6 months washout
      (month 18).
