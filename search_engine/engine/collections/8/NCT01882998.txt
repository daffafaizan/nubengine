        -  Aim 1: to assess the effect of an extended repeat HIV testing and enhanced counseling
           (ERHTEC) intervention on sexual risk behavior and sexually transmitted infections (STI)
           and HIV acquisition in HIV-uninfected pregnant and lactating women enrolled individually

        -  Aim 2: to assess the effect of ERHTEC on sexual risk behavior and the incidence of STI
           and HIV in uninfected pregnant and lactating women enrolled with their partner, and

        -  Aim 3: to assess the costs and estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      We will conduct a stratified randomized trial of 410 HIV-negative pregnant Ugandan women
      enrolled individually and 410 HIV-negative pregnant women enrolled with their male partners
      in Mulago Hospital, Kampala and St Joseph Hospital, Kitgum, Northern Uganda. In each site,
      205 women enrolled individually and 205 couples will be randomized to be either retested and
      counseled for HIV in late pregnancy only (>36 weeks) as per the WHO/Ministry of Health (MOH)
      recommendation, or to receive ERHTEC throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding.

      Individual women and couples randomized to the intervention arm will receive the ERHTEC
      intervention at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months postpartum. Follow-up will end at 24 months
      postpartum or 6 weeks after the end of breastfeeding, whichever occurs first.
