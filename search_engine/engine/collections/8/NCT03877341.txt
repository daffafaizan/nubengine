      vertebra,and there are two mean types degenerative and lytic : Degenerative spondylolisthesis
      is secondary to osteoarthritis leading to facet incompetence and disc degeneration.This
      condition allows anterior translation of one vertebra on another. Spondylolysis is the break
      in the pars interarticularis and is the precursor of lytic spondylolisthesis which associated
      with a pars fracture When nonoperative care fails and surgery is being considered, the type
      of fusion should be tailored to the specific pathology being treated.So there are different
      operations to correct this instability like postrolateral fusion (PLF) and posterior lumber
      interbody fusion (PLIF) PLF decreases segmental motion in the posterior column, which
      presumably reduces facet joint pain.Theoretical advantages of PLIF include decompression of
      exiting nerve roots by distraction of the collapsed disc space, achievement of optimal fusion
      in relation to the load-bearing capacity of the vertebral bodies and possibly attainment of a
      better fusion rate
