           progression of ONFH on either radiographs or MRI. A successful outcome is defined as no
           difference in ONFH staging according to the Ficat & Arlet or Steinberg classifications
           at last patient follow-up compared to initial radiological staging. This translates into
           lack of progression over the course of the study while the natural evolution is
           progression over time.

           The secondary objective is to evaluate the percentage of involvement of the femoral head
           on radiographs and/or MRI which measures the extent of the disease. We expect that the
           extent of the disease will be reduced at 2 years.

        2. STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION This study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized,
           double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that aims to test the efficacy of the proposed
           medical intervention (ASA). The design is intended to be parallel group where a total of
           114 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment (ASA) and the control
           (Placebo) arms.

      All patients presenting to the osteonecrosis clinic of one of the participating centres will
      be first evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon to confirm the diagnosis of early ONFH on at
      least one hip. Selected patients will be screened for eligibility according to specific
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Eligible patients who accept to participate in this study will be randomized to either a
      control arm (placebo) or a treatment arm (Aspirin). Recruited patient will take their
      assigned treatment daily at breakfast from enrolment and for a minimum of two years They will
      be followed over a period of 2 years. Evaluations will be taken at baseline and every 6
      months (5 visits in total).
