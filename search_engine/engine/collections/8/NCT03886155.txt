      finger were positive for Congo red staining but negative for ATTR and AL amyloid via
      immunohistochemistry. However, mass spectrometry is now the preferred method to type amyloid
      tissue. Trigger finger pathology involves the same flexor tenosynovium that passes through
      the carpal tunnel and has been biopsied to diagnose amyloidosis. Our recent study found that
      10% of older patients undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery were positive for amyloidosis,
      with 20% of that group presenting with cardiac involvement. 60% of the amyloid-positive group
      had a history of trigger finger. Surgical intervention for trigger finger could provide an
      opportunity to screen for amyloidosis through tenosynovial biopsy.

      This study will look at the prevalence of amyloidosis in patients undergoing surgical
      intervention for idiopathic trigger finger. The study hypothesis is at least 10% of such
      patients will be positive for amyloidosis.
