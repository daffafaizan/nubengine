    
      This is a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of
      JCAR015 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The study will have the
      following sequential phases: Part A (screening, leukapheresis, cell product preparation, and
      cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part B (treatment and follow-up). The follow-up period for
      each participant is approximately 12 months after the final JCAR015 infusion. The total
      duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 years. Long-term follow-up for
      survival, toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue under a separate long-term
      follow-up protocol per health regulatory authority guidelines, currently up to 15 years after
      the last JCAR015 infusion.
