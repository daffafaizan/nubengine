      effective in reducing recovery time and improving health and pain factors related to patient
      recovery. However, there has been limited research into how this translates into positive
      economic outcomes for both the hospital and the patient. In addition, it can be reasonably
      hypothesized that the use of the cryocompression therapy system before surgery will lead to
      an increased rate of reduction in swelling necessary to allow proper operative procedures to
      take place when compared to the standard ice and elevation (RICE) therapy techniques and
      cryocompression therapy applied only post-operatively. This should lead to decreased hospital
      costs and possible improved patient outcomes related to recovery.

      Study Objectives This study will examine the initial efficacy and cost-effectiveness of using
      the cryocompression therapy model both pre-operatively and post-operatively in patients that
      have recently suffered a traumatic calcaneus or ankle fracture compared to the standard
      pre-operative RICE therapy procedures.
