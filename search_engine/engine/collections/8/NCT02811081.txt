      dioxide gas after surgery. Both the intra-peritoneal normal saline instillation and pulmonary
      recruitment maneuver could effectively reduce post-laparoscopic shoulder pain. However, the
      efficacy and safety of combined intervention with normal saline instillation and pulmonary
      recruitment maneuver have not been investigated yet. The aim of this clinical trial is to
      estimate the effectiveness of combined intervention with the intra-peritoneal normal saline
      instillation and pulmonary recruitment maneuver for reducing post-laparoscopic shoulder pain.
