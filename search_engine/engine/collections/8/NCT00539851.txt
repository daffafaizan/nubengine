      successfully to cure patients with a variety of hematological malignancies. Graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) is an alloreactive immune phenomenon, where the activated donor T cells
      recognizes the recipient as being foreign and effects a cytotoxic response. GVHD occurring in
      the first 100 days after transplantation is termed acute GVHD and is characterized by
      hepatitis, dermatitis, and enteritis.

      High dose corticosteroids remain one of the cornerstone therapies to treat acute GVHD.
      However, an association between corticosteroid therapy and the development of diabetes
      mellitus after solid organ transplantation has become widely recognized. Similarly, post
      transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has been increasingly noted in the allogenic stem cell
      transplant population, however, to date, no systematic study has been completed to identify
      the incidence of PTDM and associated risk factors. We propose to investigate the incidence of
      PTDM as well as associated risk factors for the development of PTDM in patients undergoing
      allogenic stem cell transplantation.
