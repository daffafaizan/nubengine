      escalated in successive cohorts of patients. Using a standard dose escalation design,
      successive cohorts of 3 patients will be treated with escalating doses of clofarabine. At the
      MTD (or highest dose-level if the MTD is not reached), the cohort will be expanded to 10
      patients to better investigate correlative studies and give some preliminary idea of
      efficacy.
