      interferes with effective parenting and predicts poor child developmental and behavioral
      treatment outcomes. Based on the literature and our own pilot data, the study will randomly
      assign parents with ADHD and their young at-risk children to one of two conditions: (1)
      stimulant medication for parents with ADHD followed by a child treatment strategy (CTS)
      beginning with behavioral parent training (BPT) with the added recommendation of child
      stimulant treatment if the child remains impaired or (2) a CTS without treatment for parental
      ADHD. The study will compare treatment effects on child ADHD-related impairment (primary
      outcome), child ADHD and externalizing symptoms, and time to child stimulant prescription
      (secondary child outcomes). The study will also examine target mechanisms including
      improvements in parental ADHD-related impairment and symptomatology (attention, impulsivity,
      emotional regulation), parenting skills, and BPT engagement, as well as treatment moderators
      (baseline parental ADHD severity, parental impairment, and parenting skills). Moreover, in an
      effort to develop a model of treatment that has potential for widespread dissemination while
      also reducing barriers to receiving care, the study will examine an implementation model
      involving parent ADHD screening in primary care followed by collaborative care delivered by
      co-located mental health providers via telehealth. Further, the investigators will develop an
      implementation plan and associated toolkit using a stakeholder participatory strategy to
      enhance the ability to move efficiently to adoption of this approach. In addition, the
      investigators will study the care delivery context, assessing procedures for and rates of
      screening and participation as well as staffing, workflow, provider- and patient-level
      acceptability, readiness, and feasibility of implementation approaches. This hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation project will be achieved via a collaborative R01 across 2
      research sites in the US (N = 240 families), with 4-5 primary care partners at each site.
