      care ameliorates outcomes.

      In gout the primary target is the serum uric acid level (SUA). We intend to demonstrate the
      superiority of a structured nurse led patient management programme over standard of care in a
      randomized controlled study.

      The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients reaching the target SUA level at 6 months
      follow-up.
