      and the fluid needed to prime the extracorporeal circuit. Many studies have pointed to the
      benefits of using a hyperosmolar prime to counteract formation of tissue oedema. Rapid
      changes in osmolality may as a serious consequence lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome. At
      the Heart Centre of Ume√• University Hospital, Sweden, there is a tradition of using a
      hyperosmolar prime. This study aims to explore changes in osmolality during coronary artery
      bypass grafting surgery by repeated measurements of osmolality and concentration shifts of
      sodium, glucose and urea in plasma.
