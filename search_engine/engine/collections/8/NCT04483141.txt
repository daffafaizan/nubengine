      including 60 communicating and 60 non-communicating patients will be recruited.
      Epidemiological data will be collected at enrollment, as well as an initial assessment using
      the Abbey and Algoplus scales for non-communicating and communicating patients, and also the
      numerical scale for communicating patients. The HADS questionnaire will be completed by
      communicating patients only. Of the 60 patients in each group, 30 will receive a second
      concurrent assessment by an inter-rater, 30 will receive a test/retest reassessment after 30
      minutes, and 20 will be reassessed 90 minutes later by the same scales after pain treatment.
      For 30 of the 120 patients, an infrared pupillometry measurement will be performed before and
      after treatment of acute pain. All patients will be recruited from the neurovascular unit of
      the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital.
