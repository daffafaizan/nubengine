    
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injections
      versus Corticosteroid injections in treating patients that have failed noninvasive management
      for Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome (GTPS). We will be comparing in both the short term
      (0-6 months) and in the long term (6-12 months). It will be a Double-Blinded Randomized
      Clinical Trial. Patients with GTPS will be randomly assigned to either the Corticosteroid
      group or PRP group. There will be a total of 50 participants enrolled with 25 in each group.
      The PRP group will receive 3 mL of autologous plasma injection into the area of tendinopathy
      utilizing ultrasound guidance. One (1) injection per month will be administered for a total
      of three (3) injections. The Corticosteroid Group will receive 2.0 mL's injection of
      lidocaine and 40mg of Triamcinolone into the area of tendinopathy utilizing ultrasound
      guidance on their first injection. They will then receive 2.0 mL's of 1% lidocaine and 3.0
      mL's of 0.9% Sodium Chloride per month for a total of three (3) injections. Both groups will
      be referred to physical therapy. Participant's pain will be assessed using a Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) and the Nonarthritic Hip Score (NHS) for function at the beginning of the
      treatment and then again at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the initial injection.
