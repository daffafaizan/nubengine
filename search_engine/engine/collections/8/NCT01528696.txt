      on cesarean wound complications in obese women. It was initiated and 37 women were
      randomized, but because of logistical barriers, we were unable to gather outcome data either
      by the intended survey or by chart review. When it became clear that we would be unable to
      complete the study, recruitment was terminated and further attempts at data gathering were
      stopped. While a small number of photographs were taken as intended, they were lost due to a
      technological failure prior to any analysis. Therefore no outcome data could be analyzed.
      Nonetheless, as patients of the University of Michigan Health System, all research subjects
      received health care treatment appropriate to their medical condition and circumstances.
