      Jerusalem Center for the Treatment of Psychotrauma. Researchers plan to use the results of
      the study to better understand the demographics of those who come to the Center, and to
      improve the services offered to our clients. Before beginning treatment, every Meytiv client
      filled out a questionnaire in which information is requested regarding demographics, trauma
      history, symptoms, and various levels of functioning. Researchers administered a similar
      self-report questionnaire to all clients upon completion of treatment. The follow-up
      questionnaire contained the following several indices: the Traumatic Events Screening
      Inventory (TESI), which requests a client's trauma history; the Multidimensional Scale of
      Perceived Social Support, which measures level of family, friend, and other support; the
      Brief Symptom Inventory, which measures level of various psychiatric symptoms, including
      somatic complaints, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and paranoid or hostile thoughts; the
      Self-Efficacy Scale, which measures level of self-reliance and confidence in one's ability to
      cope with stressors; and PDS, which measures subjective response to trauma, symptoms, and and
      level of functioning. This questionnaire, which mirrors one completed by all Meytiv's clients
      before treatment, was administered to those clients who completed treatment within a year of
      the study. Clients completed the follow-up questionnaire on condition that if they were in
      need of further treatment, Meytiv would refer them to the appropriate provider. Responses
      will be coded and analyzed to check significance among potentially related variables,
      including demographic variables. Most importantly, results of the follow-up questionnaire
      will be compared to its parallel from the beginning of treatment in order to examine what
      effects our treatment has on one's symptoms, and whether our clients have been satisfied
