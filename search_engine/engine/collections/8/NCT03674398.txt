    
      Eligible participants will engage in 30 minute bouts of aerobic exercise three times per week
      followed by a 20-minute post-exercise activity. Randomization will place participants into
      one of three groups: (1) aerobic exercise + cognitive training, (2) aerobic exercise +
      videos, or (3) waitlist control. Post-exercise activities will be delivered via participants'
      smartphone device by downloading the appropriate cognitive training platform or online video
      link.

      Baseline and post-intervention assessments will consist of symptom reporting, cognitive
      measures, and psychosocial questionnaires. Physiological measures including heart rate and
      blood pressure will be assessed at baseline and at follow-up as well as during each in-lab
      exercise session. The wait-list control group is asked to complete all baseline and follow-up
      assessments and resume normal activity during the four weeks. The first week of exercise will
      take place in a lab-based environment, while weeks 2-4 will take place outside of the lab
      (participants must have access to exercise equipment at home or local fitness facility).
