    
      Kyphosis is usually a developmental deformity of the spine in the sagittal plane. Once
      diagnosed, serial X-rays are used for followup. These are usually required at yearly
      intervals.

      SPINESCAN® is a computerized digital inclinometer, design for evaluating angular spine
      deformities.

      Patients examined in the spine clinic with recent X-rays will be examined with SPINESCAN® and
      it's results compared with the classical radiological assessment.
