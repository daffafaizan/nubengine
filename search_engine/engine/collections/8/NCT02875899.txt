    
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter registry of the Surfacer System for patients
      with limited or diminishing upper body venous access or pathology impeding standard access
      methods. The need for long term access and lack of availability of veins has led to the
      development of the Surfacer System, which facilitates reliable and repeatable placement of
      central venous catheters and restores central venous access. Based on European legislation,
      this Registry is considered to be an observational study. No additional diagnostic or
      monitoring procedures as a result of the inclusion are applied to the patients. Available
      data will be collected in a protected database. Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in 5 sites
      in Europe. Patients requiring central venous access will be enrolled who meet inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and for whom the device is indicated.
