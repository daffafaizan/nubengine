      disorders of glycosylation (CDG). The study will look into the progression of the disease
      amongst the participants and also look at the clinical symptoms and how they vary amongst
      different diseased population groups. The participants will be asked to fill out
      questionnaires either on their own or with a provider that will grade the severity of disease
      and document symptoms and diet. Participants will have an opportunity to submit blood, urine,
      and stool samples that will be tested for biomarkers for CDG.

      Participants will also complete dietary food records, physical exams, CDG scores, and the
      PROMIS questionnaires to assess disease progression and severity.
