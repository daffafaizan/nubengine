      stimulation is applied at different times in relation to motor training. The nerve
      stimulation, called peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS), is non-invasive and painless.
      Subjects in the study may receive strong or mild PNS. Subjects will also vary by whether PNS
      is delivered for 2 hours before the 2 hours of motor training, or during the 2 hours of motor
      training. Which level of stimulation and its timing will be determined randomly for each
      subject.
