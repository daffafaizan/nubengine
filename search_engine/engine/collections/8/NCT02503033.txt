    
      There are two stages in this study: a dose-escalation stage (stage 1) and a dose-expansion
      stage (stage 2).

      Dose-escalation stage (stage 1). The conventional 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort,
      with the potential to add additional 3 patients to the same cohort to further evaluate
      toxicity) will be applied for dose escalation and maximum tolerated dosage determination.
      Approximately 18 to 27 evaluable patients will be enrolled. The actual number of patients
      depends on the dose limited toxicities situation as well as the maximum tolerated dosage
      reached at this stage.

      Dosing will include QD (quaque die) and bis in die (BID) cohorts. A cycle of study treatment
      will be defined as 28 days of continuous dosing.

      Dose-expansion stage (stage 2). In this stage, approximately 40 patients with B-cell
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia will be enrolled with 600mg once
      daily as starting dose. The tumor types of the expansion stage are restricted to Chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL),
      Follicular Lymphoma (FL) (Grade 1-3a), Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and Waldenstrom's
      macroglobulinemia / Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (WM/LPL). Subjects will receive HMPL-523 600mg
      once daily with every 28-day treatment cycle until disease progression, death, or intolerable
      toxicity, whichever comes first.
