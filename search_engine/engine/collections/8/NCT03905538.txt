    
      Primary Objective is to assess if percentage change in [18F]FLT PET/CT quantitative
      parameters (SUV max, or SUV peak or proliferative tumor volume) after 2 cycles of
      chemotherapy can predict progression free survival at 1 and 2 years in pediatric patients
      with newly diagnosed solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives are: (1) to assess if percentage change in [18F]FLT PET/CT quantitative
      parameters (SUV max, or SUV peak or proliferative tumor volume) after 2 cycles of
      chemotherapy can predict overall survival at 2 years in pediatric patients with newly
      diagnosed solid tumors; and (2) for enrolled patients that undergo tumor resection as part of
      their therapy regimen within one month of the FLT imaging, mitotic index of the tumor will be
      assessed as compared to initial biopsy specimen and correlate with FLT activity.
