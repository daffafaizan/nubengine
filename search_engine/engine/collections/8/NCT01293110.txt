      dyssynergia, voiding dysfunction, stress incontinence, or a combination of these and
      frequently has a negative impact on the patients' health related quality of life. In
      addition, the treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction is a challenge because
      conventional therapies may fail. Adequate treatment and long-term follow-up of lower urinary
      tract dysfunction is important to achieve/maintain continence and preserve renal function.
      Thus, we aim to prospectively collect clinical, video-urodynamic and radiological data of
      patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction treated at the University of ZÃ¼rich
      in a database.
