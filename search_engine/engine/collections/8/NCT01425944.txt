      focused on brain blood vessel malformations in three different rare diseases. The focus of
      this project is on Sturge-Weber Syndrome.

      We plan to improve the future understanding and treatment of Sturge-Weber Syndrome by 1)
      establishing a national consortium database which will gather lager amounts of clinical data
      and serve indirectly as a registry to foster future clinical trials and determine the
      usefulness of urine vascular biomarkers to determine the vascular remodeling of the SWS
      birthmark and choroidal angioma, 2) study vascular remodeling with retrospective and
      prospective neuroimaging to determine the vascular remodeling of the deep draining
      intraparenchymal vessels as it relates to SWS neurologic status, and 3) relate the GNAQ
      mutation to altered phosphorylation of pathway proteins and angiogenesis factors in SWS
      tissue.
