    
      At Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, in collaboration with the University at Buffalo
      School of Public Health and Health Professions and the University of Rochester, we are
      looking for adult cancer patients to participate in our new project designed to facilitate
      recovery from cancer and help cancer survivors lead better, more productive lives. The ideal
      subjects are individuals who have completed treatment for stage I-III cancer and speak
      English. Participants will be randomized into two groups: 8 weekly 1-hour long sessions of
      problem solving skills therapy delivered by a trained therapist vs. care as usual. Bright
      IDEAS Adult Cancer (Bright IDEAS-AC) therapy will be delivered in the most patient-friendly
      way. Sessions will be face-to-face at the location of patient choice (hospital, clinic, or
      participant's home) or over the phone. A supportive other or caregiver is also invited to
      participate in this study. This project does not involve any experimental drugs and does not
      affect the regular care or patient relationship with doctor(s).

      At the time of enrollment, after 3 months and after 6 months, all participants in the
      intervention and control arms, as well as any participating supportive others/caregivers will
      be asked about their healthcare utilization since the last assessment including primary care,
      specialist and emergency department visits and any hospital stays. During the same three time
      points, both patients and supportive others/caregivers will be asked to fill in 4 short
      questionnaires assessing their problem solving skills, health status, mood and function
