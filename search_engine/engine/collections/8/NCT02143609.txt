      a randomized cross-over field trial evaluating the hypothesis that exercise capacity during a
      2 day sojourn at moderate altitude is improved by nocturnal oxygen therapy via a nasal
      cannula. Outcomes will be assessed during 2 days in Zurich (490 m, low altitude baseline),
      and during 2 days at St. Moritz Salastrains (2048 m).
