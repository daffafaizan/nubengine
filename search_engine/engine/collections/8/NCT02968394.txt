      systemic reactions during immunotherapy - immunotherapy failure due to systemic reactions.
      High basophil allergen sensitivity is a risk factor for venom immunotherapy failure due to
      systemic reactions. Omalizumab decreases basophil sensitivity. Venom immunotherapy failure
      patients will be co-treated with omalizumab during another attempt of immunotherapy
      introduction. Patients will be clinically and immunologically followed up after the
      introduction.
