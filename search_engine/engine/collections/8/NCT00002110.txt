      dose of cysteamine is determined by titration of the dose over a 6-week period, after which
      the patient receives 24 additional weeks of treatment. An initial cohort of 36 patients will
      be enrolled in a 10-week pilot phase. Accrual will be temporarily suspended while data from
      the pilot phase is assessed.
