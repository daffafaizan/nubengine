      conservative measures only. Despite anticoagulation and consequent use of compression
      stockings, lower extremity venous hypertension affects patients quality of life and health
      status by causing venous claudication, swelling, skin changes, and venous ulcers. In the last
      decades venous stenting has become an accepted treatment for ilio-femoro-caval obstruction.
      Recently, novel self-expanding nitinol stents have been specifically designed for the venous
      system to account for the anatomical structure of ilio-femoro-caval veins.

      Gap of Knowledge: There are few data on short and long term outcomes of self-expanding
      Nitinol stent placement in ilio-femoro-caval veins.

      Objective: To study patency rates and clinical outcome data of self-expanding Nitinol stents
      that were specifically designed for iliofemoral and inferior vena cava residual thrombosis,
      obstruction or stenosis.
