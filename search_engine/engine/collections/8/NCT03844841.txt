      electroanatomic mapping aided catheter ablation (CA) is an established therapeutic option.
      The intervention may last several hours, during which patients are required to lie as still
      as possible, as inadequate patient movements disturb the electroanatomic map, prolong the
      intervention and increase its complication risks. Therefore patients are usually sedated and
      analgesized, most commonly by administration of Propofol combined with opioids under the
      supervision of the electrophysiologist. Despite its wide use, this regimen is not without
      risk, as Propofol has a pronounced depressive effect on the respiratory system.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha 2 agonist that demonstrates both analgesic and
      hypnotic properties with only weak respiratory depression. By reducing sympathetic activity
      it also reduces the stress response to an intervention. For these reasons, Dexmedetomidine is
      commonly used in intensive care units, where it has been shown to be well tolerated.
      Consequently, its range of application has been increasingly widened and good experience has
      been made with its use in transfemoral valve replacement procedures or gastroenterological
      interventions.

      The pharmacological profile of dexmedetomidine may be also advantageous for sedation during
      CA of AF. The aim of this randomized trial is to test this hypothesis and explore the safety
      and efficacy of Dexmedetomidine during CA of AF.
