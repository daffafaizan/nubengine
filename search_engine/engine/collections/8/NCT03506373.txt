    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy (as assessed by complete response [CR] rate) of the combination
      of ixazomib citrate (ixazomib) and ibrutinib in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR=partial response [PR] or better) in WM patients
      treated with ixazomib and ibrutinib.

      II. To assess the time to progression (TTP) in WM patients treated with ixazomib and
      ibrutinib.

      III. To further characterize the safety and toxicity of the combination of ibrutinib and
      ixazomib.

      IV. To assess the overall survival (OS) in WM patients treated with ixazomib and ibrutinib.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the role of members of the BTK signalosome in achievement or lack thereof of
      response to ibrutinib and ixazomib.

      II. To explore biologic effects of ibrutinib and ixazomib on microenvironment in WM and
      correlate with response to treatment.

      III. Effect of ibrutinib+ixazomib on platelet aggregation. IV. To evaluate the clinical
      pharmacokinetics of the drug combination.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 and ibrutinib PO daily
      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
