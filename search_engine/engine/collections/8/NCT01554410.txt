      The results of such trials indicate that gemcitabine has considerable activity against
      cervical cancer when given with cisplatin/RT, however, it is quite toxic. The predominant
      toxicities are gastrointestinal and hematologic. Methods to reduce gastrointestinal and
      hematologic toxicity during chemoradiotherapy could mitigate this toxicity and take advantage
      of the therapeutic benefits of gemcitabine

      IMRT is an advanced radiation therapy delivery technique that reduces the amount of radiation
      given to normal tissues and may therefore reduce unwanted side effects. IMRT tries to lower
      the amount of radiation that normal tissues receive, while still delivering the desired
      amount of radiation to the cancer cells and other areas, such as lymph nodes. IMRT does this
      by using computers to design the best way to aim radiation at the tumor(s), while still
      delivering a radiation dose comparable to standard radiation.
