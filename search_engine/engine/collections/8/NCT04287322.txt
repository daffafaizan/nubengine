      voice and tactile-kinesthetic stimulation on physiological parameters, physical growth and
      behavioral development of preterm neonates. Three groups were involved; auditory stimulation,
      tactile-kinesthetic stimulation and control.

      A quasi-experimental design was used to recruit 108 study subjects (36 in each group). A
      trained researcher conducted the stimulation in the intervention groups and two research
      assistants did the data entry. The research assistants were blinded to aim of study, group
      assignments, and interventions received by preterm neonates.

      Preterm neonates baseline characteristics and clinical data were obtained at initial contact.

      Physiological parameters (heart rate, oxygen saturation and body temperature) were monitored
      using a cardio-respiratory monitor (CODEC patient monitor CMS6000). Respiratory rate was
      measured by counting breaths per minute by the research assistant. The parameters were
      monitored and recorded before, during and after stimulation in the intervention groups. The
      control group had the measurement recorded in the morning, afternoon and evening.

      Physical growth was assessed using weight measurement. Neonates are weighed daily in the
      nursery and data on weight was entered by research assistants on alternate days.

      Neonatal behavioral assessment scale (NBAS) was used to assess behavior at initial contact,
      day 10, 17 and 24.
