      repository of blood, tissue, other biological samples and their associated data (survey data,
      medical records data, cancer registry data, and other related data) collected from thousands
      of patients 18 years of age or older who have cancer or are at risk of developing cancer. In
      this protocol, the investigators require the permission of patients to study their answers to
      survey questions that may be collected as part of their regular clinical care, permission to
      study their medical and related records, and permission to collect excess tissues removed at
      the time of planned surgery, an additional tumor sampling (needle passes) at the time of
      planned diagnostic biopsies, previously collected, stored tumor tissue (if available), blood,
      and/or other biological samples. Additional research tumor samples may be collected at the
      time of any diagnostic needle biopsy or endoscopic biopsy or, if available, patient tissue
      from a previous procedure will be obtained and utilized as needed. Clinical and related data
      will be collected on all patients from the time of initial entry into the study and will
      continue for life.
