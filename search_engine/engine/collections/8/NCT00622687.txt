      with overlap syndromes fulfilling the ACR criteria for systemic sclerosis) and suffering from
      severe Raynaud's phenomenon were included into the study after written informed consent to
      participate in this study. Severe Raynaud's phenomenon was defined by a high burden of
      disease, by trophic skin changes, or the presence of digital ulcers.

      Patients suffering from SSc related RP and/or digital ulceration were randomized 1 : 1 to one
      of the following groups that received either high or low dose infusions of iloprost for 21
      consecutive days given once or twice a year. High dose patients (n=25) started on 0.5ng per
      kg bw and min over 6 hours a day. Depending on the tolerability the dosages were increased in
      increments gradually every two days for 0.5 ng/kg x min. The maximum dose administered was
      2.0ng/kg bw and min. Low dose patients (n=25) were permanently treated with 0.5ng/kg bw over
      6 hours per day for 21 consecutive days.
