      Primary

        -  Compare the rate of clinical benefit in patients with tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
           treated with gefitinib with or without tamoxifen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine whether changes in fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake by positron emission tomography
           scan and changes in plasma DNA levels are indicators of an early response to gefitinib
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to population (intent-to-treat population comprising all patients who
      receive 1 dose of treatment vs a subset of the intent-to-treat population, excluding patients
      with nonmeasurable/evaluable only disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tamoxifen once daily. Beginning 14 days after the start of
           tamoxifen, patients receive oral gefitinib once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily. Beginning 14 days after the start of
           placebo, patients receive oral gefitinib as in arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues for 26 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients (23 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 23 months.
