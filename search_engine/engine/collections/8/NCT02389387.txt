      less likely to access each step of the kidney transplant process. Current national
      surveillance data does not capture information on transplant referral, and it is unclear to
      what extent dialysis facility-level factors may influence disparities in access to
      transplantation. Due to significant variability in the standardized transplant ratios
      observed at each facility, the investigators hypothesize that there may be facility-related
      reasons that impact disparities in access to the first step of the kidney transplant process
      -- referral to the transplant center to undergo an evaluation for the suitability for
      transplant.
