      women and 30 g for men) and added dietary carbohydrates on the level of function in patients
      with apoplexia. The study has an intervention group and a control group. The study is
      randomized, but not blinded. The primary outcome is level of function measured with
      Barthel-100. Secondary outcomes are: training intensity, duration and frequency; length of
      stay; self-training (training without a therapist) and patient's experienced fatigue; and
      patient's experienced pain. All patients are recruited from Rigshospitalet, Glostrup. The
      supplement will be administered before and after each training session with a therapist. The
      supplement is a powder desolved in a glass of juice. The nursing staff will add extra
      carbohydrates to the patient's meals in the form of potatoes, rice, bread, fruit or other
      carbohydrate rich food items. All meals will be noted daily and validated the following day
      by the primary investigators.
