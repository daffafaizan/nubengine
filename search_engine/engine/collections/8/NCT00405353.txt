      (MS). Possible causes for this include sex hormones and/or sex chromosome effects.
      Testosterone treatment ameliorates experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal
      model of MS, but the effect of testosterone supplementation on men with MS is not known.

      Design, Setting and Participants: Ten men with relapsing remitting MS were studied using a
      crossover design whereby each patient served as his own control. There was a six-month
      pretreatment period followed by a twelve month period of daily treatment with 100mg of
      testosterone gel.

      Main Outcome Measures: Brain atrophy and Cognitive testing
