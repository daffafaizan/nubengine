    
      In vitro and in vivo efficacy studies and clinical trials have shown that EC-18 has a mode of
      action of improving neutropenia by promoting neutrophil production from hematopoietic stem
      cells and at the same time, efficiently controlling STAT6/Complement 3(C3), suggesting its
      potential to be developed as an orally administered new drug for treatment of neutropenia
      resulting from decreased neutrophils caused by administration of an anticancer agent.

      This study is a Dose block-randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Single and Multiple
      Ascending Dose Escalation, Phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of single-dose and multiple-dose oral administration of the investigational
      product, EC-18 (study drug) in healthy adult male volunteers.
