      I. To determine feasibility of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in patients with locally
      advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing definite chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy.

      II. To measure exercise capacity and respiratory symptoms in lung cancer patients receiving
      chemotherapy and radiation before and after pulmonary rehabilitation.

      III. To compare if there are any differences in symptom relief, exercise capacity, and cancer
      treatment tolerability between performing pulmonary rehabilitation during chemo-radiation
      versus after completion of lung cancer treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Beginning within 2 weeks of starting chemoradiation, patients undergo an
      individualized rehabilitation program comprising aerobic exercise and strength training,
      including treadmill walking, stationary bicycle, NU-Step, upper body resistance training and
      breathing retraining, 3 times per week for 8 weeks (36 sessions).

      ARM II: Beginning 1 month after completion of chemoradiation, patients undergo an
      individualized exercise rehabilitation program as in Arm I.
