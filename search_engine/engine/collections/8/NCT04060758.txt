    
      This is a multi-centre, open label, interventional, comparative, phase Ib dose ranging study
      to identify a safe and efficacious dose (within the range of 14.7 to 35.5 microgram) of
      PA5108 Latanoprost FA SR Ocular Implant in adults who have Primary Open Angle Glaucoma
      (POAG).

      The proposed study is a single ascending dose design to determine the minimum effective dose
      that provides the target of >20% IOP lowering effect at 12 weeks with minimal adverse events.

      Up to three cohorts will be assessed from the following implant strengths:

        -  35.5 microgram

        -  26.6 microgram

        -  14.7 microgram

      A first cohort of participants will be recruited and dosed with the 14.7 mcg PA5108
      Latanoprost FA SR Ocular Implant. A second cohort of participants will be recruited after SMC
      review of 6-week data of the first cohort and dosed with the 26.6 mcg PA5108 Latanoprost FA
      SR Ocular Implant. A third cohort of participants will be recruited after SMC review of
      6-week data of the second cohort and dosed with 35.5 mcg PA5108 Latanoprost FA SR Ocular
      Implant.

      Prior to study registration, participants will have been medicated with intraocular pressure
      (IOP) lowering drop therapy, including a prostaglandin analogue, to manage their POAG. The
      IOP lowering drops will be stopped in the intent to treat eye within 29 to 43 days prior to
      the date of implant administration. Participants will be required to have an unmedicated
      (post wash-out) 8:00am IOP ≥ 24 mmHg and ≤ 36mmHg in the intent to treat eye at either of two
      screening visits 2-weeks apart. Additionally, the IOP at 12:00 noon and 4:00 pm must be ≥
      20mmHg and ≤ 36mmHg on the same screening visit where the 8:00am IOP was ≥ 24 mmHg and ≤
      36mmHg.

      The PA5108 Latanoprost FA SR Ocular Implant will be administered to one eye (unilateral) of
      each participant.

      IOP will be monitored and if after implant administration is found to rise ≥30% over baseline
      in the study eye, IOP lowering eye drops will be restarted.

      The study will recruit up to 10 participants per cohort/dose level. After screening, eligible
      participants will be administered a single PA5108 Latanoprost FA SR Ocular Implant by clear
      corneal injection to the anterior chamber of the eye, by means of a custom-built injector
      fitted with a 27G pre-loaded needle.

      The study will end at the later of Visit 7 (32-weeks) for the last participant in the study,
      or when the last of the study implants are no longer visible in the study eye and the IOP in
      the same eye has returned to a normal clinical care range, or 12-weeks has passed since the
      implant was no longer visible regardless of IOP.

      Participants will attend the study site for follow up on Day 1 post implant administration,
      and then Week 6, 12, (optionally 15), 18, (optionally 21), 26, 32 and if required subsequent
      6-week intervals until the implant has completely biodegraded and the IOP of the same eye has
      returned to normal clinical care range or 12-weeks has passed since the implant was no longer
      visible. Implant biodegradation will be confirmed by biomicroscopy and gonioscopy examination
      at Week 12, optionally 15, 18, optionally 21, 26 & 32, and if necessary, every 6-weeks
      thereafter.
