      quadratus lumborum block and subcostal transversus abdominis plane block in laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy. The primary outcome will be assessment of postoperative opioid analgesic
      requirements. The secondary outcomes will include assessing intraoperative analgesic
      requirements, stress of trocar insertion and insufflation, postoperative visual analogue
      scale (VAS), length of stay at post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), time of first request to
      analgesia, incidence of nausea, and vomiting.

      The study will hypothesize that quadratus lumborum block will be more superior than or equal
      to transversus abdominis block because it could cover all the dermatome segments from
      caudally L1 to cranially till T6 segments as the drug is expected to travel from the QL to
      the higher paravertebral spaces.
