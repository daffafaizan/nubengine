    
      Primary Objective is to provide access to therapy with 131I-MIBG for patients with
      relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma.

      Secondary Objective is to assess disease response to 131I-MIBG therapy for patients with
      relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma.

      Tertiary Objectives are to 1) gain more information about the toxicities of 131I-MIBG
      therapy; 2) assess improvement of symptoms, including pain and fatigue, for patients with
      relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma who are receiving 131I-MIBG
      therapy.

        -  The therapeutic dose of 131I-MIBG will be based on the following:

             1. Minimum dose of 10 mCi/kg for patients without a stem cell source whose renal
                function is above the upper limit of normal but still meets eligibility criteria.

             2. Dose of 12 mCi/kg for patients without a stem cell source with normal renal
                function and meets other eligibility criteria.

             3. Dose of > 12 mCi/kg to 18 mCi/kg maximum at investigator's discretion for patients
                meeting eligibility criteria with stem cells available.

        -  A urinary catheter and intravenous fluids will be used for bladder protection, and
           potassium iodide solution for thyroid Protection.

        -  G-CSF is recommended for patients with ANC less than 750 after MIBG infusion.

        -  hematopoietic stem cell infusion is recommended for patients with grade 4 hematologic
           toxicity following 131I-MIBG therapy that continues to have an ANC <200 on G-CSF without
           signs of recovery for >2 weeks and any patient requiring platelet transfusion more than
           two times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks.

        -  Follow-up will be done until disease progression, death or other therapies are
           initiated.
