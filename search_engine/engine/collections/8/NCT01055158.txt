      depressive disorder. Individuals with HIV and depressive disorders, compared to those with
      HIV alone, have been shown to have worse adherence to taking antiretroviral medication,
      increased HIV related morbidity and among women a higher mortality. Previous research
      suggests that mental health interventions may lead to improved depressive and HIV related
      outcomes. However because many HIV infected depressed individuals may have trouble accessing
      mental health services, there is an urgent need for treatment trials to assess whether
      treatment of depression targeting patients in urban HIV care settings will result in both
      improved depressive and HIV related outcomes. The goal of this project is to test the
      preliminary effectiveness of an adapted telephone-based, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      intervention targeting HIV infected depressed individuals receiving care in adult outpatient
      HIV clinics. A total of 60 HIV infected, depressed individuals receiving care at an urban,
      outpatient HIV clinic will be randomly assigned to receive either the telephone psychotherapy
      intervention or enhanced usual care with non-specific telephone contact. The results will
      provide preliminary data on whether the telephone psychotherapy intervention for HIV infected
      depressed individuals is effective in reducing depression. The results will also be used to
      determine feasibility, accessibility, and whether the intervention leads to improved
      retention and better satisfaction.
