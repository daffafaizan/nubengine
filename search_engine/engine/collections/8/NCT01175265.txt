      of a 4-week rehabilitation program including breathing retraining on pulmonary function
      (PFT), cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity (CPET), health related quality of life (HRQL) and
      cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM).

      A randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of a conventional 4-week pulmonary
      rehabilitation program with those of a 4-week pulmonary rehabilitation program plus breathing
      retraining on pulmonary function (FEV1), cardiopulmonary exercise capacity (6-minute walking
      distance, 6MWD), health related quality of life (chronic respiratory questionnaire, CRQ) and
      cardiac autonomic function (rMSSD) was performed.
