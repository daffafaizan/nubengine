      to bariatric procedure. After both procedures, a changed secretion of hormones from the
      gastrointestinal tract is believed to affect appetite and glucose metabolism. Studies have
      shown that after LRYGB, there is a significant increased secretion of GLP-1 and PYY. In
      contrast, a decreased secretion of ghrelin is a characteristic finding after LSG opposite
      post-LRYGB, where secretion of ghrelin is reported to be increased, decreased or unchanged.
      Ghrelin is primarily secreted from the gastric mucosa in the fasting state and decreases in
      response to food intake. Ghrelin stimulates food intake through appetite-regulating centers
      in the hypothalamus. Administration of exogenous ghrelin has been reported to stimulate
      appetite. In addition, ghrelin has recently been suggested also to affect glucose metabolism
      by inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore the markedly decreased
      secretion of ghrelin could be of particular important for the decreased appetite and improved
      glucose tolerance seen after LSG.
