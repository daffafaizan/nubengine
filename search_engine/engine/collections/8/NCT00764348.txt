      viable. Microscopic studies show that biofilm is present on chronic wounds yet does not seem
      to be prominent on the surface of acute wounds. Biofilm is able to neutralize our host
      defenses and commandeer host systems, and possesses an impressive array of defenses and
      virulence factors. Clinically we see a significant difference in the healing behavior between
      chronic and acute wounds. Also, suppression of biofilm using multiple simultaneous strategies
      including debridement, anti-biofilm agents, specific biocides, antibiotics and advanced
      technologies improves wound healing. This suggests biofilm plays an important role in delayed
      wound healing.
