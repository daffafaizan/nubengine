      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of reirradiation with the pulsed low dose
      rate technique.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the dosimetric tolerance of normal structures to reirradiation with the
      pulsed low dose rate technique.

      II. To determine the palliative efficacy and quality of life in patients treated on this
      protocol.

      III. To determine duration of response and time to progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo 3-dimensional CRT or IMRT once daily (QD), 5 days a week for 10-30 days.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 6 months and
      then every 12 weeks thereafter.
