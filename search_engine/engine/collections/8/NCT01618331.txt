      supplementation doing regular exercise in patients with FSHD. All patients are tested before
      and after 12 weeks of cycle-ergometer exercise. Maximal oxygen consumption and a functional 6
      min walk test(6MWT) is used as primarily effect goals. Secondary effect goals are risk of
      falls and daily activity level. We measure manuel muscle strength, a balance test, a
      5-time-up-and-down-chair-test, a 14 steps-stair-test, accelerometer measuring, daily activity
      level questionnaire and SP36.

      We use a blinded randomized controlled trail. The interventions are 12 weeks regular exercise
      and consumption of a post-exercise drink. The exercise consists of 30 session of 30 minutes
      moderate exercise on a cycle-ergometer. After each exercise session patients consume a
      protein or a non-caloric placebo drink.
