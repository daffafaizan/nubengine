      devices, human shields and suicide bombers in an urban setting. It is unclear whether this
      type of warfare cause more extensive abdominal injuries to civilians than combatants.
      Understanding of the correlation between the severity of abdominal injuries, type of warfare
      and population affected is of importance when planning for surgical care in a conflict
      setting.

      Aim To assess whether civilians obtain more extensive abdominal injuries than combatants in
      an urban battle characterized by the use of indiscriminate weapons.

      Study Design An observational retrospective cohort study with longitudinal data collection.

      All patients admitted with penetrating abdominal injury subjected to an exploratory
      laparotomy at Emergency Hospital, Erbil, between October 17, 2016 and July 16, 2017 will be
      included. Differences in demographics, injury mechanism, time since injury, clinical status
      on arrival, intraoperative findings, postoperative complications and outcome will be
      analysed.

      Primary Objective Differences in injury mechanism, organs injured, surgical treatment given,
      postoperative complications and outcome between civilians and combatants.

      Secondary Objectives Differences in surgical treatment given, postoperative complications and
      outcome between patients with prior surgical treatment of their injury and patients without
      prior surgical treatment.

      Differences in surgical treatment given, postoperative complications and outcome between
      patients who receive surgical treatment less than 24 hours from injury and patients who
      receive surgical treatment more than 24 hours from injury will be analysed.

      Statistical methods Differences between groups will be analysed using t-test and regression
      models.
