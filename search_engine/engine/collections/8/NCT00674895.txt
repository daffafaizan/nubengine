      characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement and, in extreme
      cases, a loss of physical movement. The primary symptoms are the results of decreased
      stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia, normally caused by the insufficient
      formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain.
      PD is both chronic and progressive.

      Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the
      body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the
      endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the
      level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain
      cells.

      It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20
      microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could
      prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people who have PD.
