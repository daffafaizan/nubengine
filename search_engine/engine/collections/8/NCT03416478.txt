      monitor of a short-term disease recurrence in surgical resective stage II and stage III
      colorectal cancer (CRC). The investigators will recruit newly diagnosed CRC patients,
      systematically collect their blood samples at the following time point: before surgery, one
      week after surgery, every three months for the first year and every six months for the second
      year, which are coincidence with the recommended clinical follow-up. Patients' outcome and
      survival will be tracked. These study will permit assessment of ctDNA as a predictive and
      surveillant method for a short-term (two years) tumor recurrence in comparison with other
      parameters.
