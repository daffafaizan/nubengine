      in many patients with various vascular and cardiovascular diseases over the past three
      decades. Randomized controlled trial data for SIL shows improvement in 6MWD, hemodynamics,
      and even evidence of cardiac remodeling in PAH and SSc-PAH patients. Based upon these data,
      SIL may be an effective therapy in SSc-MEP. This study will help determine whether sildenafil
      could be a good treatment for patients with scleroderma that have mildly elevated pulmonary
      pressures.
