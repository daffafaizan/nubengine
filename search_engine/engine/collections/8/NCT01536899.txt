      total involvement will be for about 1 year.

      The first interview will establish a baseline of current behaviors and health status; this
      will take about 3-4 hours. This interview will take place at the Tolan Park Medical Building,
      located at 3901 Chrysler Service Dr. The remaining 4 interviews - which will be shorter in
      length - will be conducted about 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the baseline interview; each
      follow-up interview will take about 2 hours.The purpose of the 4 remaining interviews is to
      assess changes in behaviors and health status over time.

      We will collect urine samples at each of the 5 interview sessions to assess health and
      illicit drug use.
