      effect of multiple doses of rabeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      vadadustat in healthy male and female subjects. Approximately twenty (20) subjects, with at
      least 30% female subjects, will be enrolled to ensure 18 evaluable subjects. Subjects will be
      on study for up to 66 days, including a 28-day screening period, 9-day clinic period, and a
      30-day follow- up period post last dose. Subjects who are confirmed eligible and receive at
      least one dose of study drug will be considered enrolled in the study. Blood samples for PK
      analysis will be collected at pre-defined time points throughout the study up to 48 hours
      post administration of vadadustat.
