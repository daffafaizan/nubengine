      ileo-colic anastomosis procedures through an education programme for surgeons and theatre
      teams.

      The programme has 3 main strategies: (i) enhanced pre-operative risk stratification (making
      sure it is safe to join the bowel together for each patient); (ii) harmonisation of surgical
      technique (making the join as good as it can be and checking it carefully after it is
      created), and (iii) implementation of an intra-operative anastomosis 'checklist' (focusing
      the attention of the whole theatre team at this critical stage of the operation). The
      investigators will use a novel scientific approach to assess the patient benefit that enables
      not only the quality improvement itself to be delivered to all participating hospitals but
      also enables collection and analysis of data to measure the effect of these measures. The
      best way of doing this is to embed the proposed quality improvement into a staggered
      implementation programme, allowing the effect to be assessed between the centres. The
      specific methodology proposed introduces the intervention in a step-wise fashion to all
      hospitals. By the end, all sites will have implemented the programme. Overall, the
      investigators hope to reduce the leak rate by 30% from 8.1% to 5.6% in about 4,500 patients.
