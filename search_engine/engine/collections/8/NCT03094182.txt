      bimaxillary prognathism. However, the complicated vascularity of the surgical site and
      limited visual field can lead to unexpected bleeding. Intravenous iron isomaltoside 1000
      (monoferÂ®) significantly increased the hemoglobin level and prevented anemia 4 weeks after
      cardiac surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Intravenous iron
      isomaltoside on maintaining hemoglobin concentration in patients undergoing bimaxillary
      orthognathic surgery. Fifty-eight patients, aged 19 to 40 years, scheduled for Bimaxillary
      orthognathic surgery will be divided into monofer (n=29) and control (n=29) groups. Randomly
      selected patients of the ulinastatin group are given intravenous iron isomaltoside. In
      contrast, patients in the control group receive an equivalent volume of normal saline as a
      placebo. The primary endpoints are postoperative hemoglobin concentration.
