      and Diagnostic Radiology, have demonstrated that ultrasound imaging can be used reliably to
      study speech and swallowing impairments in a variety of conditions and diseases. Since
      ultrasound is non-invasive with no reported bioeffects, it can be used repeatedly to follow
      the progression of a disease. Ultrasound imaging of the oral cavity during speech and
      swallowing allows easy visualization of the tongue/hyoid bone motion and transport of the
      bolus during swallowing and tongue surface configuration during speech. Images can be
      obtained in several planes for viewing muscular coordination and timing and specific measures
      can be obtained from digitized video images. Thus it has widespread clinical research
      implications for patients with disorders affecting the oral peripheral muscles, salivary
      gland flow and the central nervous system control of speech and swallowing. While ultrasound
      technology has been used extensively in Europe to evaluate tumors of the head and neck, its
      use in this country has been marginal. We plan to compare ultrasound evaluation of tumor
      staging, tumor volume, and tumor recurrence in patients with tumors of the larynx, oral
      cavity and hypopharynx. Currently, this is accomplished by CT or MRI scanning procedures. We
      plan to compare CT/MRI results with ultrasound to determine if this non-invasive technique
      can be utilized reliably for diagnosis and tracking of oropharyngeal tumors.
