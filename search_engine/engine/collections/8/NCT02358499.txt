      limited data in children. Posaconazole injection has been approved by the FDA for prevention
      or treatment of certain fungal infections in adult patients. In children, however, we don't
      have data on how best to give posaconazole or whether the dosing should be personalized to
      individual children. This study aims to determine pharmacokinetics of posaconazole aqueous
      solution for injection in children aged 2 through 17 years and explores differences in drug
      exposure by age, genetics, and disease state. Children will receive a single dose of
      posaconazole injection and have their blood levels of posaconazole checked. The study will
      also check for safety after giving the posaconazole.
