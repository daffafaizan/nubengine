    
      To establish the optimal imaging technique of PET/MR using multiple radioactive tracers for
      prostate cancer

        -  Recruiting 30 patients with prostate cancer ahead to radical prostatectomy

        -  PET/MR using 18F-choline with dedicated prostate MRI in all patients

        -  PET/MR using 18fluoride(F)-fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG)in all patients after 2-7 days

        -  PET/CT using 18F-FDG in all patient immediate after 18F-FDG PET/MR

        -  outcome assessment: comparison of scan time, image quality, tumor detection rate,
           standardized uptake values of lesions

        -  establishing optimal imaging technique for prostate PET/MR

      To establish the imaging biomarker using PET/MR for clinical assessment of prostate cancer

        -  comparison of findings on PET/MR, MRI and PET/CT with pathological mapping after radical
           prostatectomy

        -  outcome assessment: accuracy of PET/MR for localization and staging of prostate cancer
           compared with MRI only and PET/CT only

      To establish the imaging biomarker using PET/MR for early detection of recurrent prostate
      cancer

        -  Recruiting 15 patients with recurrent prostate cancer treated by surgery, hormone, or
           radiation therapy

        -  Recruiting 15 patients with treated prostate cancer without recurrence

        -  PET/MR using 18F-choline with dedicated prostate MRI in all patients

        -  PET/MR using 18F-FDG in all patients after 2-7 days

        -  PET/CT using 18F-FDG in all patient immediate after 18F-FDG PET/MR

        -  comparison of findings on PET/MR, MRI, and PET/CT with clinical data in two patient
           groups with or without recurrent prostate cancer

        -  outcome assessment: accuracy of PET/MR for early detection and localization of recurrent
           prostate cancer compared with MRI only and PET/CT only
