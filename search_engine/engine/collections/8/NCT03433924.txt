      •To investigate the prevalence of high PD-L1 expression in Chinese MIUBC patients. High PD-L1
      expression is defined as ≥25% tumor cell membrane positivity for PD-L1 at any intensity above
      background staining as noted on the corresponding negative control OR ≥25% tumor associated
      immune cell positivity for PD-L1 at any intensity above background staining as noted on the
      corresponding negative control.

      Note: PD-L1 High (>=25% tumor cell membrane positivity for PD-L1 or 1) IF IC area >1%: >=25%
      tumor associated immune cell positivity for PD-L1; 2) If IC area=1%: 100% tumor associated
      immune cell positivity for PD-L1). PD-L1 Low if criteria not met for PD-L1 High.

      The second objectives of this observational study are:

        -  To investigate the PD-L1 expression profile in TC or IC in Chinese MIUBC patients.

        -  To assess the concordance of PD-L1 testing results generated from the hospital labs with
           those from the central lab.

        -  To observe the initial treatment pattern for MIUBC patients in usual clinical practice
           in China.

        -  To observe 2-year OS of the Chinese MIUBC patients.

      The exploratory objectives of this observational study are:

        -  To explore the relationship between the demographic characteristics and expression of
           PD-L1 and other exploratory biomarkers including immune cell (IC) subset CD8+ T cells
           and tumor mutation burden (TMB).

        -  To explore the relationship between OS and the demographic characteristics as well as
           the expression of biomarkers.

        -  To explore the relationship between PD-L1 and TMB, PD-L1 and CD8 positive T cell
           respectively.
