      compared with the standard functional activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay. A
      PK study in seven study subjects with hemophilia A is being carried out using five different
      commercially licensed factor VIII concentrates and the blood samples drawn for the PK
      analysis are being measured for FVIII with the novel assay and compared with the standard
      APTT assay. The concentrates used in the PK studies are also being applied to the two assay
      systems to determine each product's specific activity.
