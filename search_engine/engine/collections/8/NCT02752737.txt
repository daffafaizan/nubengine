      registry (PMR). The purpose of this study is to evaluate and describe clinical performance
      and safety data in a broad patient population treated with a commercially available Arctic
      Front™ Family of Cardiac Cryoablation Catheters (hereafter referred to as "Arctic Front™
      Cardiac Cryoablation Catheter System"). The cryoballoon ablation(CBA) procedure will be
      performed according to routine hospital practice. The study is expected to have a 24 month
      enrollment period. The follow up period is intended to align with standard practice and
      subjects will be followed for a minimum of 12 months post-procedure.
