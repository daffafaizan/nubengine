      diseases can affect Quality of Life (QoL), but this is not easy to be assessed. Therefore, a
      valid instrument is necessary. Such an instrument is Thyroid-related patient-reported
      outcomes questionnaire (ThyPRO). ThyPRO has been recently translated and validated in Greek
      language. The questionnaire consists of 85 items grouped in 14 scales concerning goiter,
      hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and eye symptoms, tiredness, cognitive impairment, anxiety,
      depression, emotional susceptibility, cosmetic complaints and impaired social, and daily and
      sex life, as well as overall quality of life.

      A few studies have demonstrated that various thyroid therapies may improve some aspects of
      QoL. The aim of the present study is to address the impact of thyroidectomy in QoL in
      patients with benign thyroid diseases.
