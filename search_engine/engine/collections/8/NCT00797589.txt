      prospective study. Patients with preoperative coagulation disorders, or renal or hepatic
      failure, are excluded.

      Before admission to the operation theatre, the patients allocate in random order to receive
      one of the following solutions during the extracorporeal circulation:

        1. Ringer-acetate solution

        2. 6% HES solution (TetraspanÂ®) During the 1 postoperative day we register hemodynamic
           changes, fluid balance, fluid extravasation, plasma ion concentration, modified
           thromboelastography, and kidney function.
