      pregnant women who have an HBV DNA level higher than 200,000 IU per milliliter. Participants
      will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive tenofovir alafenamide (orally 25 mg per
      day) from the late pregnancy until the delivery date or postpartum 1 month. All the infants
      will receive standard immunoprophylaxis (100 IU of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and 10 μg of
      hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth; the second injection of 10 μg of HBV vaccine
      will inject at 1 month; and the third dose of 10 μg of HBV vaccine will give at 6 months).
      The pregnant women and their infants will be followed until postpartum month 7. The primary
      outcomes are the birth defects and rates of perinatal transmission of HBV. During the
      prenatal period or the postnatal period up to 7 months of age, cases of a structural defect
      in newborns or infants were reported as birth defects. The rate of perinatal transmission was
      defined as the proportion of infants who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen at 7
      months of age. The secondary safety outcomes are the occurrence of maternal or infant adverse
      events during the study period. Maternal safety evaluations mainly include any adverse events
      and complications, hepatitis B virologic breakthrough, alanine aminotransferase flare, and so
      on. Infant' safety profiles mainly included Apgar scores at 1 minute, any abnormal conditions
      during the study period, and anthropometric indexes at birth and 7 months of age. The
      secondary efficacy outcomes are the percentages of mothers with an HBV DNA level of less than
      200,000 IU per milliliter just before or at delivery, and the hepatitis B e antigen and
      surface antigen loss or seroconversion in mothers at postpartum month 7.
