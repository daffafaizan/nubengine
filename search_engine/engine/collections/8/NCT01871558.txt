      decision to start basal insulin has been taken, will compare vildagliptin+metformin versus
      the previously used SU+met combination (regimen kept unchanged) in association with basal
      insulin, up-titrated as per usual algorithms primarily based on FPG to obtain a similar
      improvement in glycemic control in both arms, on the incidence of hypoglycemic episodes over
      24 weeks.
