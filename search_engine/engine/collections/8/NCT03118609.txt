      caregiver is defined as a person who regularly provides unpaid care to another adult. The
      survey will ask about pain intensity, pain interference, and relation of pain to the
      caregiving role. The survey will also address which activities the caregiver assists with,
      and activities now lacking since becoming a caregiver. One focus group will be completed to
      refine the contents of the survey prior to dissemination. The results will be analyzed by an
      occupational therapist, with a focus on how pain may connect to assistance with daily living
      activities provided to the care recipient. The needs of caregivers within the community will
      be compiled to inform future involvement in remediation of needs.
