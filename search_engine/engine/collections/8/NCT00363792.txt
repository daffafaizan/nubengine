      of prim. headache types such as migraine. Previous studies have used different methods that
      have had limitations and none of them have had the opportunity to study neuronal activation.
      But that is possible with the application of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).

      Before we apply fMRI to our experimental headache models it is needed to determine how the
      BOLD response is influenced and changed by the infusion of different drugs such as the NO
      donor Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN) and Diamox (acetazolamide). It is known that GTN causes
      dilation of the cerebral arteries without having any effect on the regional cerebral blood
      flow. It is not known what effect GTN has on the BOLD response. Diamox (azetazolamide)
      increases the CBF but it is uncertain what effect the drug has on the BOLD response. Previous
      studies disagree gravely on this point.

      In this study we will be giving infusion of GTN and Diamox in healty subjects to determine:

        -  Blood-oxygenation-level-Dependent-signal (BOLD-signal) after visual stimulation.

        -  Changes in the diameter of a. cerebri media.

        -  Changes in the regional and global cerebral blodd flow (CBF) with the help of the
           arterial Spin labeling (ASL) methode.

      For the study we will be using a 3-Tesla MRI-scan.
