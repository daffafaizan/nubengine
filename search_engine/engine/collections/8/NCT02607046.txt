      quality of life (QOL) in nearly 20% of older Veterans and result in substantial VA health
      care costs. Revascularization addresses the anatomical pathology, but does not restore
      mobility function and QOL. Optimal therapy may require post-revascularization rehabilitation
      to address lingering defects in skeletal muscle that limit function; however, the current
      standard of care after revascularization does not include rehabilitation. Exercise training
      and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) may enhance function by increasing muscle
      perfusion to improve outcomes in older Veterans with PAD after revascularization.

      The investigators will enroll Veterans (50-80 years of age) with PAD who are planned for
      percutaneous revascularization. Participants will complete research testing consisting of: a)
      Assessment of mobility function and QOL; and b) Treadmill tests to assess ambulatory
      capacity, and calf muscle perfusion. Participants will undergo screening prior to
      revascularization and will have baseline testing 2-3 weeks after revascularization. After
      post-revascularization testing, patients will be randomized to Exercise-only or NMES-only.
      After completion of the 3-month intervention, participants will repeat all tests to determine
      the effects of the interventions.
