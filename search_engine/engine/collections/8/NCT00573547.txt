      psychiatric disorders. This study will test whether once-weekly Prozac leads to reduced
      symptoms of depression. Patients requiring dialysis often report symptoms of depression
      either due to the presence of major depression, a relatively common psychiatric disorder, or
      due to depression secondary to kidney failure.
