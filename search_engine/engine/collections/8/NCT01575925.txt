      POM + (LD-DEX) in subjects with RRMM and impaired renal function.

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of POM + (LD_DEX) in
      subjects with RRMM and impaired renal function.

      This is a 3+3 dose escalation design, with one cohort each for patients with severely
      impaired renal function patients (CrCl < 30 mL/min) requiring and not requiring dialysis
      respectively. There will also be one control cohort with normal renal function, these
      patients will receive 4 mg POM. Dosing will be 21 days out of a 28 day cycle.
