        1. No differences in survival of suprastructures and implants with the two treatment
           modalities.

        2. No differences in peri-implant MBL, PES, WES, and patient satisfaction using VAS with
           the two treat modalities.

        3. No differences in oral health related quality of life using OHIP-14 with the two
           treatment modalities.

      The secondary objective will include:

      1. Complications related to bone harvesting, implant installation, and MSFA.

      The primary outcome measures included:

        -  Survival of suprastructures.

        -  Survival of implants.

        -  Radiographic peri-implant MBL.

        -  Professional evaluation of suprastructure and soft tissue using PES and WES.

        -  Patient satisfaction using VAS

        -  Oral health related quality of life using OHIP-14 questionnaire.

      Secondary outcome measures:

      â€¢ Pre- and postoperative complications.
