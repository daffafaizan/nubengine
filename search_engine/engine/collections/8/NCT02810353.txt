      maxillary constrictions greater in the anterior region compared to the posterior region of
      the maxillary dental arch. The aim of this study is to evaluate the dentoskeletal effects of
      the expander with differential opening in orthodontic patients in the mixed dentition.
      Material and methods: Fifty patients with maxillary constriction in the mixed dentition will
      be prospectively and randomly allocated in one of two study groups. The experimental group
      will comprise 25 patients who will be submitted to rapid maxillary expansion with the
      expander with differential opening. The control group will be comprised by 25 individuals who
      will undergo rapid maxillary expander with the Hyrax expander. Digital dental models will be
      acquired immediately pre-expansion (T1) and six months post-expansion (T2). The
      Orthoanalyzerâ„¢ software will be used to measure maxillary and mandibular widths, arches
      perimeter, arches lengths, palatal depth, and inclinations of maxillary and mandibular
      canines and permanent first molars. The intergroup and interphase comparisons will be
      analyzed using t tests and paired t tests, respectively (p<0.05).
