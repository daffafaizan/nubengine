      they arrive at the random number allocation room.They have to undergoing physical
      examination, vital signs, blood routine, urine routine, blood biochemistry,
      electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, tuberculosis culture, tuberculosis smear, HIV antibody test
      and blood pregnancy（only women of childbearing age） during the screening period.
      Inverstigator absorb and inject 0.1ml drug into the upper and middle 1/3 of the left forearm

      48h and 72h after the skin test. Meanwhile, the transverse and longitudinal diameers of skin
      induration and redness were measured at 48h and 72h after the skin test.Vital signs are
      checked at 30min after skin test.Vital signs examination, injection site photography and
      reaction measurement are performed 48h and 72h after skin test.Physical examination, vital
      signs, routine blood test, routine urine test, biochemical test, electrocardiogram and blood
      pregnancy test are performed again 7 days after skin test.All AE occurred within 7 days after
      skin test were recorded by a diary card. AE related to the test drug should be followed up to
      the end of the event.Skin test of subjects aged 18-45 years shall be conducted first. After
      safety assessment, skin test of subjects aged 46-65 years old, 6-17 years old and under 6
