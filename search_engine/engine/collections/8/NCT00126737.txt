      is a leading chronic illness among older adults in the U.S. Approximately 40% of individuals
      above 60 yr of age have OA of the knee. The primary objective of the proposed study is to
      determine whether individuals who are overweight with OA of the knee and who complete a
      24-week home-based exercise program combined with a weight control intervention program will
      report significantly less pain (as measured by the WOMAC) than volunteers who participate in
      home-based exercise (Ex) only, weight control intervention (WC) only, or standard clinical
      care (C). The secondary objectives of the proposed research are to determine whether
      overweight individuals with OA of the knee who complete the Ex+WC program, when compared to
      subjects who are randomly assigned to a E, WC or C groups, demonstrate significant
      improvement in the following health risk profile variables: (a) improved physical function
      (measured by the Functional Performance Inventory), (b) improved capacity to perform stair
      climbing and descending, (c) improved strength, (d) increased lean body mass, (e) increase in
      physical activity at home (measured by pedometer step count). The proposed clinical trial
      will utilize a prospective, randomized two by two factorial design. Descriptive and ancova
      statistical method will be applied for data analyses.
