      women (168 still in fertile age; 274 menopausal) with HCV-positive CAH who underwent PEG IFN
      treatment in the last 5 years will be evaluated. For comparison, a group of 548 HCV-positive
      males with CAH will be evaluated. Liver biopsies before undergoing standard antiviral therapy
      will be scored for fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis. In women the presence, type and
      timing of menopause, associated hormonal/metabolic features and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels will be evaluated.

      The primary endpoint will be evaluation of SVR in females (in fertile and menopausal age) and
      in males.
