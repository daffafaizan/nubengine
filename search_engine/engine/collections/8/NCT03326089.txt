      hypoxemia may have significantly better short-term effects in patients with IPF. The study
      will take place in Corfu General Hospital, by the Departments of Pulmonary Medicine and
      Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, respectively. Study participants will be divided in two
      equal arms 1:1 in a double-blind manner. One of the investigators blinded to their clinical
      data will assign each participant to PR service either i) with constant supplementary oxygen
      supply FiO2 50% regardless of saturation status Group A) or ii) without oxygen supply unless
      upon resting or exercise induced hypoxemia (saturation <88%) (Group B).
