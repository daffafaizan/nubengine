      with desired results. Especially to improve the jowls and nasolabial folds, the thread lift
      is a simple and inexpensive technique for patients who do not wish to undergo the typical
      facelift surgery, but the weak points of it are less effective and shorter duration than the
      conventional facelift.The investigators propose the new method of the thread lifting the
      subdermal and subcutaneous layer with a fiberoptic needle by use of the retaining ligaments.

      Retrospective analysis was performed on 369 consecutive patients undergoing the suture
      suspension technique between January of 2012 and December of 2015, so called thread lift,
      using 3-0 V-Loc 180 device for facial rejuvenation with (n=305) or without additional facial
      procedures (n=64). The follow-up period ranged from 22 months to 43 months postoperatively,
      with a mean of 34.3 months. There are asymmetry(n=2), scar revision(n=1), revision(n=4),
      dimpling(n=1), suboptimal outcomes(n=9), and stitch abscess(n=1). The thread lift by use of
      the retaining ligaments with V-lock barbed sutures can be recommended as an alternative
      technique in the facelift.
