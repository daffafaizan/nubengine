      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved T-DM1 for
      pre-operative use in breast cancer but it has been approved for other uses in breast cancer.
      The FDA has approved pertuzumab as a pre-operative treatment.
