    
      Randomized single centre clinical randomized study will be performed on 50 participants. The
      inclusion criteria are participants (age more than 65 years) with proximal femoral fracture
      scheduled for lower limb surgery under spinal anesthesia.

      The Ethics Committee approved this prospective study. Informed consent will be taken from
      individual subjects. Participants are randomly allocated into one of the two study groups.

      Group A: participants who will receive intravenous 25 mg of ephedrine added to syringe with
      50 ml 0,9% sodium chloride solution during 20 minutes. Group B: Phenylephrine 5 mg will be
      added to syringe with 50 ml 0,9% sodium chloride solution, participants will receive
      intravenous 0,3 mg of phenylephrine during 20 minutes. Randomization is achieved with the
      help of Random.org.

      In order to reduce pain prior to spinal anesthesia an ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block
      will be performed using a volume of 30 ml ropivacaine 0,2%. After skin infiltration with 3 ml
      of lidocaine, a 25G Pencan spinal needle will be inserted at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 vertebral
      interspaces. After aspirating cerebrospinal fluid, participants will receive hyperbaric
      bupivacaine 0.5% at 0,11 mg/cm according to the participant height. Ephedrine and
      phenylephrine will be given intravenous immediately after injection of bupivacaine. Impedance
      cardiography will be used to measure hemodynamic parameters: cardiac output, stroke volume,
      cardiac index, stroke index, systemic vascular resistance, systemic vascular resistance
      index. Heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation will also be controlled. All these
      parameters will be measured and recorded every 5 minutes until 30 minutes after spinal
      anesthesia. The data will be statistically analyzed.
