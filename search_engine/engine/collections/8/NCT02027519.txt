      male partners and couples in order to engage them in HIV testing to enable identiﬁcation of
      discordant couples is an important ﬁrst step for any HIV prevention and treatment efforts.

      This is a feasibility study of the use of home-based HIV self-testing of partners and
      household members of individuals recruited from select Antenatal Care (ANC), Tuberculosis
      (TB) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinics in Lesotho. This study uses an observational
      design to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based self-testing for HIV
      testing of partners and the effectiveness of this intervention to identify HIV discordant
      couples. It is hypothesized that a home-based self-testing intervention will increase the
      number of partners testing for HIV and will result in increased identiﬁcation of newly
      diagnosed HIV-discordant couples, the target population of the planned Enhanced Prevention in
      Couples (EPIC) study.

      Primary objectives of this study include:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based self-testing for HIV testing
           of partners of index participants

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of home-based partner self-testing strategies to identify
           HIV-discordant couples

        3. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of home-based self-testing for HIV testing
           of other household members of index participants

      Seventy-ﬁve men and women (index participants) will be recruited from antenatal, TB and ART
      clinics. HIV testing teams will visit index participant households and offer home-based HIV
      testing to all adult household members.
