      disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy,
      and dementia with Lewy bodies. Parkinsonism can be difficult to diagnose, especially in the
      early stages of the disease. Skin punch biopsy could be a useful and way to diagnose and
      measure the severity of these conditions. Given that there currently is no proven way to
      determine that someone has a synucleinopathy such as PD and not a tauopathy, this is a novel
      study that may lead to better ways to diagnose people with parkinsonism. The purpose of the
      study is to identify changes on a skin punch biopsy, in which small samples of skin are
      removed and sent to the laboratory for examination. We are seeking to measure the amount of
      misfolded alpha-synuclein in someone's skin. Participation will last between 1 and 2 years
      and will involve between 2 and 4 visits. Visits will include a physical examination,
      questionnaires, a memory test, blood draws, and a single visit for skin punch biopsies. We
      will also be looking to enroll volunteers to serve as "controls," who do not have any
      neurological illness.
