      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) when combined
      with standard concurrent temozolomide and RT in subjects with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety, tolerance, and toxicity of DMF when combined with standard
      concurrent temozolomide and RT in subjects with newly diagnosed GBM.

      II. To obtain a preliminary estimate of the efficacy of DMF when combined with standard
      concurrent temozolomide and RT in subjects with newly diagnosed GBM.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dimethyl fumarate.

      CONCOMITANT THERAPY: Between 21 days (3 weeks) and 42 days (6 weeks) following the last
      surgical procedure, patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 42-49 days
      and dimethyl fumarate PO twice daily (BID) or thrice daily (TID) continuously. Patients also
      undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week over 6 weeks for a total of 30 fractions.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients continue to receive dimethyl fumarate PO BID or TID
      continuously. Four weeks after completing concomitant temozolomide and radiation therapy,
      patients also receive temozolomide PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 2
      months thereafter.
