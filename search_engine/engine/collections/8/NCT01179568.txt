      people in the United States alone. We conducted the first randomized controlled study to
      address this condition (MH60783) and confirmed efficacy of a targeted psychotherapy,
      complicated grief treatment (CGT). Participants in our prior study continued stable
      antidepressant medication while receiving CGT or Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT).
      Individuals taking antidepressants had better outcome in both treatments, though CGT was
      superior to IPT when administered with (60% responders v. 40%) or without (42% v.19%)
      antidepressants. Studies of antidepressant medication alone have shown mixed results with
      SSRIs appearing to be promising. However, there has been no randomized controlled study of
      SSRIs for CG. Determining the efficacy of SSRI treatment for CG, when administered with and
      without CGT, is of great public health importance.

      We assembled 4 groups of investigators with strong track records in bereavement research and
      extensive experience with intervention studies and multicenter projects, to conduct a study
      of citalopram (CIT) efficacy. We plan to enroll participants with a primary diagnosis of
      Complicated Grief and randomly assign them (n=480; 50 at Columbia) to receive treatment with
      CIT, Placebo (PBO), CIT + CGT or PBO + CGT over a period of approximately 16 weeks. We want
      to determine whether citalopram shows a better response than placebo, when administered
      either with or without CGT. We will also address the question of whether CIT performs as well
      when administered alone as it does when administered with CGT.
