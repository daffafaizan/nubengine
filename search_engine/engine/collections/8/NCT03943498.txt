      I. To evaluate whether fingolimod markedly improves symptoms in patients with established
      (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy) CIPN.

      II. To evaluate the tolerability of fingolimod in these treated patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fingolimod orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 3 months.
