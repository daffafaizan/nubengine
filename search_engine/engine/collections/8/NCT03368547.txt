      I. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET
      for the detection of regional nodal metastases compared to pathology at radical prostatectomy
      on a per patient basis, and on a per patient basis using nodal regional correlation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the positive and negative predictive value of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for the detection
      of regional nodal metastases compared to pathology at radical prostatectomy on a per patient
      basis, and on a per patient basis using nodal regional correlation.

      II. To assess sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 68Ga-
      PSMA-11 PET for the detection of extra-pelvic nodal metastases, visceral metastases and
      osseous metastases compared to biopsy and imaging follow-up.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and undergo PET/CT scan over 20-50 minutes
      on day 1.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2-4 days, then at 12 months.
