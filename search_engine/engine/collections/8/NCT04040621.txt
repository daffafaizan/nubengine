    
      This is a multicenter, multinational, open label single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study
      enrolling at least 32 subjects. The study aims to characterize the PK of CAZ AVI and assess
      its safety and tolerability following a single intravenous (IV) infusion. Subjects will be
      hospitalized pediatric patients who are receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for suspected
      or confirmed nosocomial pneumonia (NP), including ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). The
      study will consist of a Screening visit (Visit 1, Day 1), during which consent will be
      obtained and subject eligibility will be confirmed, a Baseline/Treatment visit (Visit 2, Day
      1) during which subjects will receive a single IV infusion of CAZ AVI, and then two follow up
      assessment visits at 24 hours (Visit 3, Day 2) and 48 hours (Visit 4, Day 3). Blood samples
      for PK analyses (0.5 mL per sample) will be obtained over 22 hours for Cohort 1 (7 samples),
      over 13 hours for Cohort 2 (6 samples), and over 6 hours for Cohorts 3 and 4 (4 samples).
      Additionally, for subjects who are undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for clinical
      purposes and for whom informed consent is obtained specifically for BAL, an epithelial lining
      fluid (ELF) sample will be collected for estimation of CAZ AVI concentrations.
