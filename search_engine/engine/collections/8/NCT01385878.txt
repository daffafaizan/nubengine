      adoption of smaller and smaller clear corneal incisions for phacoemulsification.
      Microincision surgery has many advantages, including reduced surgically induced astigmatism,
      faster visual recovery, and reduced intra and postoperative inflammation. In the recent
      times, microcoaxial phacoemulsification has gained popularity. The main advantage of this
      newer technique is that it uses the same methods as the conventional method but with smaller
      incisions. Curently, microcoaxial phacoemulsification is being performed through 1.8 as well
      as 2.2 mm incisions. However, there is still a debate as to which is the best absolute
      incision size for microcoaxial cataract surgery.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate incision stability following microcoaxial
      phacoemulsification performed through 1.8 and 2.2 mm systems, as well as compare
      intraoperative performance and postoperative outcomes following microcoaxial
      phacoemulsification performed through these two incision sizes.
