      contributing factor for increased morbidity. Despite the use of prophylactic systemic
      antibiotics, postoperative groin wound infection still occurs in some circumstances and it
      continues to be a serious problem after vascular surgical procedures. The incidence of SSI
      varies from 5 - 40%, and depending upon the depth of infection and type of vascular
      procedure, the morbidity could range from prolonged hospital stay to limb loss.

      Increased incidence of SSIs in patients is related to systemic factors like Diabetes,
      hypertension (HTN), history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and
      local factors like disruption of lymphatics, groin proximity to the perineum, previous
      surgery at the same site and the use of prosthetic graft material.

      Prophylactic systemic antibiotics have been routinely used in all vascular surgery
      procedures, and despite of gentle tissue handling, proper hemostasis and other technical
      points to minimize tissue trauma, SSIs do happen.

      The investigators hypothesize that using a closed dressing system with negative pressure will
      keep the surgical site protected from nearby contaminated field and decrease the risk of
      infection
