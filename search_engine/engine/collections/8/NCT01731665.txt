      colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of gut with uncertain etiopathogenesis.
      According to our previous study (Yang, et al. Inflamm Bowel Dis 2008; 14: 542-549), the
      incidence and prevalence of IBD in Korea are still low compared with those in Western
      countries, but are rapidly increasing. However, the long-term trends of epidemiology of CD
      and UC together with their characteristics and prognosis in Korea are uncertain yet. The
      investigators therefore aim to elucidate the incidence and prevalence of CD and UC over a
      30-year period, from 1986 to 2017, in the Songpa-Kangdong district of Seoul, Korea. In
      addition, the investigators also aim to reveal the clinical features at the time of diagnosis
      of IBD, long-term evolution of disease and prognosis.
