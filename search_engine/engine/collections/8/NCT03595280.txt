      health harms, addictiveness) of hookah tobacco delivered via mobile multimedia messaging for
      promoting hookah tobacco cessation. The study will also compare two messaging approaches, a
      standard untailored approach where all participants receive the same message content, and a
      tailored messaging approach where message content is personalized to baseline measures of
      hookah tobacco use behavior and beliefs and interactively to exchanges that occur via mobile
      messaging sent and received during the exposure period. The study includes young adults ages
      18 to 30 who are current hookah tobacco smokers. Eligible participants are young adults ages
      18 to 30 years who have smoked hookah tobacco at least once in the past month, smoke hookah
      tobacco on at least a monthly basis, and have access to the internet and a personal mobile
      phone to complete study procedures. Study participants will complete a baseline survey
      online, and all participants will receive standard information about the risks of hookah
      tobacco. Then participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group,
      untailored message group, tailored message group. Participants in the untailored and tailored
      message group will receive messages sent to their mobile phones communicating the risks of
      hookah tobacco for a 6 week period. All participants will complete follow-up surveys online 6
      weeks after baseline, 3 months later, and 6 months later.
