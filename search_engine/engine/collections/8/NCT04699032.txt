    
      A two stage design, open label, multi-center, non-randomized trial to evaluate the PK and
      safety of a single subcutaneous dose of 5 mg apraglutide in subjects with varying degrees of
      renal function. The renal function will be calculated by the estimated glomerular filtration
      rate (eGFR) according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Creatinine
      Equation.

      Part 1: 8 subjects with severe renal impairment (Cohort 1) and 8 subjects with normal renal
      function (Cohort 2).

      Part 2: 8 subjects with moderate (Cohort 3) and 8 subjects with mild (Cohort 4). Part 2 will
      be conducted if the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of AUC-inf or AUC_last for the severe renal
      impairment group compared to the control group is â‰¥2.
