    
      Strattera (atomoxetine) is a non-stimulant specific norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
      recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of child, adolescent
      and adult patients with ADHD. It is possible Strattera could be a viable alternative
      treatment for ADHD individuals. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness,
      safety and tolerability of Strattera in adults with ADHD NOS. If this initial study shows
      promise, we will follow-up with a randomized clinical trial.

      The study includes:

        1. use of a six-week design to document the response rate,

        2. weekly assessments to document the impact of Strattera NOS on functional capacities,

        3. careful assessment of safety and tolerability.

      Primary outcomes measure symptom reduction.
