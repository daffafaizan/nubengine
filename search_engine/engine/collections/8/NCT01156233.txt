      vocal cords, is of great importance in pediatric anesthesia. A not optimal laying tube causes
      life threatening consequences. Therefore, it is very essential to have reliable methods how
      to place the tube tip in regard of the precision of the localisation. There are no
      standardized methods how to accomplish a precise position. The study compares two most
      applied techniques. The first one is the cuff palpation technique (CPT), the second one the
      deliberate right mainstem intubation technique (RMT).
