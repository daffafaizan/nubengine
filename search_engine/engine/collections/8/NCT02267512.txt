      ATG-F compared with a five-day dose regimen of ATG-F in de novo kidney transplant recipients.
      The primary analysis of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the two regimens
      with regard to efficacy, defined as failure rate.

      The secondary objective of the study is the assessment of safety and further efficacy
      parameters in terms of incidence of acute rejections, graft/patient survival, DGF(delayed
      graft function) and renal function
