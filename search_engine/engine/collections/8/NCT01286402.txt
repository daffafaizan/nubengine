    
      A randomized, double-blind, parallel group design will be used to allow a rigorous
      preliminary assessment of the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of bupropion SR
      (sustained release; packaged as Zyban by GlaxoSmithKline) in promoting smoking cessation
      among women in their second and third trimester of pregnancy. Fifty pregnant smokers will be
      randomized to receive an 8-week course of either bupropion SR or matching placebo tablets.
      Both groups will receive evidence-based smoking cessation counseling. The primary smoking
      outcome will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence with cotinine validation at the end of the
      treatment. Secondary outcomes include enrollment, retention, and compliance rates; continuous
      abstinence from end of treatment through the 2 week followup; continuous abstinence from
      birth to 2nd week postpartum followup; self-reported reduction in number of cigarettes smoked
      per day; and maternal side effects and perinatal/neonatal outcomes. Preliminary smoking
      cessation and safety outcomes will be assessed for the generation of evidence-based
      hypotheses regarding clinical benefit of bupropion for pregnant smokers in preparation fo a
      larger trial.
