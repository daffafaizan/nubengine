      into routine pre- and post-transplant care (i.e., no extra visits are needed). Enrolling in
      this study will enable patients to accept offers of HCV NAT+ livers, in addition to the
      regular waitlist. All other transplant eligibility criteria have to be met per routine care.
      The multi-site project will establish a biorepository and prospective data collection with
      the goal of obtaining more generalizable results than single-center studies alone can.

      Patients who enroll in the study but receive an HCV- organ instead, will be (data collection
      only) as part of the study.

      Aims are to evaluate sustained virologic response (SVR) rates post-transplant with Direct
      Acting Anti-Viral (DAA) therapy, as well as long-term patient and graft outcomes.

      Evaluate the financial impact of timely transplant and DAA therapy compared to traditional
      wait time health care expenditure.

      Create a blood and tissue biorepository for future evaluation of HCV NAT+ allografts and
      their outcomes
