      gynecology. Historically, 30-40% of patients undergoing a hysterectomy develop a
      post-operative infection. The initiation of antibiotic prophylaxis for appropriate surgical
      procedures was a significant advancement in the prevention of surgical site infection.

      Antibiotic prophylaxis has been standardized and universally implemented. A remaining
      variable is the method of aseptic preparation of the vagina with substantial variation of
      technique being reported even within institutions.

      The most recent Committee Opinion by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      concludes there is insufficient evidence to render a strong recommendation for either
      povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine as the ideal agent for surgical preparation of the vagina
      and that further evidence is necessary.

      Povidone-iodine solution has been considered the standard for aseptic surgical preparation of
      the vagina for decades and is the only solution approved by the FDA for vaginal use. There
      are however specific qualities of the solution that suggest it may be less than ideal for use
      in the vagina. More contemporary efforts have begun to focus on chlorhexidine as a more ideal
      agent for aseptic efforts in surgical preparation of the vagina.

      The purpose of our study is to use a randomized controlled trial to determine if
      chlorhexidine gluconate surgical preparation maintains a lower rate of contamination to the
      surgical field.
