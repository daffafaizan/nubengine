      count, HIV-DNA is an emerging marker of viral reservoir, that seems to be associated with the
      risk of HIV-related diseases, especially in HCV coinfected patients. New antiretroviral
      drugs, particularly integrase inhibitors, are expected to decrease residual viremia and,
      consequently, viral reservoir. Monitoring of HIV-DNA dynamics during antiretroviral treatment
      could lead to a better management of HIV infected population.

      Also, the role of HCV in influencing HIV natural history requires careful monitoring. In
      particular, with a broader use of direct acting antiretroviral, the analysis of prevalence of
      HCV resistance associated mutation will be more and more important to manage patients with
      treatment failure.
