      Primary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival in patients with recurrent or stage IIIB or IV
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and enzastaurin with
           or without bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based
      on eligibility for bevacizumab therapy.

        -  Group 1 (bevacizumab-eligible): Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and
           bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1; gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes
           on days 1 and 8; and oral enzastaurin hydrochloride 3 or 4 times daily on days 1-21 in
           courses 1-6 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and oral enzastaurin
           hydrochloride 3 times daily on days 1-21 in all subsequent courses.

        -  Group 2 (bevacizumab-ineligible): Patients receive carboplatin, gemcitabine
           hydrochloride, and enzastaurin hydrochloride as in group 1 in courses 1-6 and
           enzastaurin hydrochloride alone 3 times daily on days 1-21 in all subsequent courses.

      In both groups, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 99 patients will be accrued for this study.
