      development and disease progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. It has
      been suggested that aging-related declines in function are accelerated in COPD due to
      recurrent cycles of inflammation, tissue injury and repair, associated with long-term
      exposure to cigarette smoke or other airway irritants. Here, the investigators aim to follow
      up on previous observations of impaired antioxidant responses in the lung of COPD patients,
      to establish the extent to which this reflects an accelerated aging phenotype, to
      characterize the molecular mechanisms resulting in this functional deficiency. The proposed
      studies will employ well-characterized patients with COPD of varying severity and smoking
      habits, as well as carefully age and smoking history-matched controls. Accelerated aging
      within the COPD lung will be assessed in endobronchial mucosal biopsies and airway
      macrophages by assessment of established senescence markers using immunohistochemical,
      biochemical and PCR-based methods. These markers of tissue age will then be related to the
      functional activation of transcription factors, known to be induced by oxidative stress and
      related to cytoprotection such as Nrf2 and AP1. The investigators will also examine whether
      COPD is associated with an enhanced secretion of inflammatory mediators from senescent cells,
      consistent with the accelerated aging paradigm and establish how this influences cell
      function. Deficiencies in metal handling, antioxidant defenses and diminished airway innate
      immune defenses at the air-lung interface will be assessed. The aim is to identify biomarkers
      for the risk of rapid lung function deterioration in COPD patients.
