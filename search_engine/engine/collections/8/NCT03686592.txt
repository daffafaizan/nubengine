      specificities of the pancr√©atectomy which can in particular include the feeling of
      strangeness and confusion at the sick person towards its own body.

      It will also be a question of estimating the relations of this experience with a possible
      state of post-traumatic stress. Indeed, the announcement of the cancer as well as the surgery
      in itself are two elements which can be considered as traumatic.

      For it a double methodology will be used, with a design cross-sectionnal: a quantitative
      shutter(sector) (auto-questionnaires) allowing to study aspects of the psychosocial
      functioning, and qualitative shutter with a semi-structured interview concerning the
      subjective experience of the participants. For the interpretation of the meditative data of
      the conversations, we shall use the phenomenological interpretative analysis ( IPA) which
      will allow us to investigate in a comprehensive way the subjective experience of the
      participants by studying the way the people give meaning to the fact that they live.
