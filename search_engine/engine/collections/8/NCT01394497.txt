      for liver transplantation (LT). In this randomized prospective study, we seek to study the
      impact on the post-LT outcome of the infusion of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during the liver
      procurement procedure.

      Potential grafts, assigned to adult candidates with chronic liver disease enlisted for first
      LT, will randomly be included in a one-to-one ratio with a sequential closed envelope
      single-blinded assignation procedure to either the NAC protocol or in the standard procedure
      (without NAC).

      The NAC protocol comprises: a systemic NAC infusion (30 mg/kg) one hour before the beginning
      of liver procurement; a loco-regional NAC infusion (300 mg through the portal vein) just
      before cross-clamping.
