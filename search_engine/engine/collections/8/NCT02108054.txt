    
      Objective:

      The purpose of this protocol is three-fold: 1) to develop tasks examining various cognitive,
      motivational, and decision-making behaviors outside the scanner; 2) to modify, refine, and
      verify the feasibility and applicability of tasks for functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) to measure intended concomitant brain activation; and 3) to examine equivalent or
      surrogate signals using other devices such as electroencephalograph (EEG) and near infrared
      spectrometer (NIRS) when the MR contraindication(s) are present in the participant.

      Study population:

      Healthy volunteers without an alcohol use disorder, and inpatient participants with alcohol
      dependence as determined by the DSM-IV-TR or at least Moderate Alcohol Use Disorder as
      determined by DSM-5.

      Design:

      The participants will pilot one or both aspects of this study depending on whether the task
      is de novo or a modification to previously verified or published task.

      Outcome measures:

      The outcome is to develop and examine tasks that reliably measure specific cognitive,
      motivational and decision-making behaviors and invoke associated brain systems and functions
      in our targeted subject populations.
