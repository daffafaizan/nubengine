    
      Study 1: A mix of elemental or semi-solid diet (300 kcal/300 mL ) and contrast medium (5ml)
      is administered using PEG, respectively. Using a plain CT, the distribution of the
      administered diet is assessed at the distal esophagus, proximal and distal stomach before and
      1 hour after the administration. The volume of the residual diet at the distal esophagus,
      proximal and distal stomach is compared between an elemental and semi-solid diet.

      Study 2: Either the elemental diet or semi-solid diet (200 kcal/200 mL) is labeled with 100
      mg [13C]sodium acetate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc, Cambridge, MA) and is
      administered in the first 15 min of the examination at the same speed using the PEG.
