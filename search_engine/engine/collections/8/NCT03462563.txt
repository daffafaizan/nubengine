    
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled study. The study population will include 220
      subjects scheduled to undergo laparoscopic radical resection of rectal carcinoma with
      preventive ileostomy (Phase 1 operation).

      During the Phase 1 operation, when the definite decision to create a temporary ostomy is
      made, patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to either the treatment arm (INTERCEED™) or
      the control arm (standard of care treatment: no adhesion barrier, no placebo). In subjects
      assigned to the treatment arm, the INTERCEED™ must be applied beneath the target incision
      site (the midline incision mainly for the removal specimen).

      The subjects will return 3-9 months after the phase 1 operation (colorectal resection with
      temporary ileostomy) for phase 2 operation, to have their diverting ostomy taken down
      (ileostomy reversal).

      During the phase 2 operation (ileostomy reversal), the incidence, extent and severity of
      adhesions will be evaluated through the laparoscope.

      An ad-hoc interim analysis is proposed based on feedback received from the investigators who
      observed very low rate of adhesions at the second procedure for ostomy reversal. The ad-hoc
      interim analysis is planned to be performed while at least 61% of the total number of
      participants with evaluable primary endpoints are available. If the conditional power (CP) is
      ≤ 60%, the observed adhesion rate difference magnitude is much less than the assumed
      difference magnitude of 0.25, therefore, the study will be terminated due to low adhesion
      rate and small effect size between INTERCEED and control arms. Otherwise, the study will
      continue until the study completion as planned.
