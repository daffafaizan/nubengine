        -  Determine whether high-dose tamoxifen with radiotherapy increases the median survival
           and overall survival of children with newly diagnosed brain stem gliomas.

        -  Determine the time to neurologic or radiographic progression in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of high-dose tamoxifen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Within 2 weeks after the
      initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive oral high-dose tamoxifen once daily. Tamoxifen
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
