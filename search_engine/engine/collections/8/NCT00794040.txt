      methylphenidate in decreasing irritability in youth with severe mood dysregulation.

      Study population: Youth ages 7-17 with severe mood dysregulation (SMD). SMD is characterized
      by nonepisodic, impairing irritability (defined as increased reactivity to negative emotional
      stimuli at least 3 times/week and angry or sad mood, most days, most of the time, noticeable
      to others) and hyperarousal (three of: distractibility, intrusiveness, pressured speech,
      racing thoughts, agitation, insomnia), with onset before age 12. Many of these children
      receive the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) in the community, although they do not meet
      DSM-IV criteria for BD because of the lack of distinct manic episodes.

      Design: Medication withdrawal, followed by a 5-week dose stabilization phase of
      methylphenidate and an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial of citalopram
      plus methylphenidate vs. placebo plus methylphenidate. There will also be optional open
      treatment at the end, so that all patients have the opportunity to have a total of up to 10
      weeks of citalopram plus methylphenidate. The target dose of citalopram will be 20-40 mg/day.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measures will be the Aberrant Behavior Checklist
      Irritability subscale and the CGI-I.
