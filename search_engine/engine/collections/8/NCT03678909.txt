    
      All neonates with congenital heart disease undergoing stage one palliation (Norwood
      procedure, Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure) at Texas Children's Hospital will be regularly
      monitored for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and Troponin level before the surgical
      procedure, on arrival to the cardiac intensive care unit after their surgical procedure,
      every 6 hours during the first 24 hours of the post-operative period, followed by daily
      levels for the first week, and then weekly during patient's regular laboratory work up
      schedule.

      These cardiac biomarkers are linked to demographic, hemodynamic, respiratory, pharmacological
      data available via Sickbay.
