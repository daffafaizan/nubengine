      life, and reduce the progression of disability in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      However, people with MS are less physically active than others. This is partly due to poor
      exercise tolerance and fatigue.

      Remote Ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is the exposure of a limb to brief periods of
      circulatory occlusion and reperfusion by inflating pressure cuffs around arms or legs to
      above systolic pressures (mmHg), to protect organs against ischaemic injury. RIPC has been
      shown to improve exercise performance and delay fatigue in athletes. However, there is little
      to no research examining the effect of RIPC on walking or exercise performance in MS
      patients. The aim of this trial is to assess whether RIPC can improve activity, gait and
      reduce fatigue in people with MS.
