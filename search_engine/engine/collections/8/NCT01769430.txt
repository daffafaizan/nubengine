    
      This study is a follow-on to earlier projects funded by the US Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
      that developed the sampler and studied the impact of surgical masks on reducing viral aerosol
      release by persons infected with influenza virus. The funding organizations have no direct
      control over the study design, execution, or reporting and no access to identifiable human
      data. The CDC IRB has determined that the CDC is not engaged in human subjects research in
      this cooperative agreement.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Fine particle aerosols will contain greater numbers of viral copies than will coarse
           aerosol particles.

        -  Clinical symptoms and signs, including fever can be used to predict viral aerosol
           shedding

        -  Fine aerosols will contain culturable virus indicating that the fine aerosols are
           infectious

        -  Aerosol shedding will correlate with virus load measured by nasopharyngeal and throat
           swabs

        -  Presence of active cough during sampling will be associated with increased aerosol
           shedding with a stronger correlation to be found with coarse than fine particle virus
           aerosols
