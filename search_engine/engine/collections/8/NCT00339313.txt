      and obesity in later life, effects partly mediated by the early environment experienced by
      the offspring of diabetic mothers in utero. In this protocol, we address why intra-uterine
      exposure to maternal diabetes might lead to later childhood obesity. Previous studies of
      children of diabetic mothers have not detected any alteration in energy expenditure, either
      as resting metabolic rate or physical activity. We will now examine whether they are at an
      increased risk of obesity due to differences in food intake. We will assess composition of
      the diet, patterns of eating, taste preference and physiological responses to a mixed meal.
      No previous work in human subjects has addressed these issues.
