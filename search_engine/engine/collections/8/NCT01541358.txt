      PET/CT scanning to detect and characterize lesions in patients who have suspected skeletal
      malignancy. We hypothesize that scanning with 18F-NaF (fluorine F-18 sodium fluoride) is more
      sensitive for skeletal abnormalities and may better characterize lesions than conventional
      imaging.
