      DLBCL, the toxicities associated with R-CHOP are substantial in the elderly population. This
      is one of several reasons the outcome of older patients is worse than the corresponding
      younger patients. Bendamustine is an alkylating agent which causes intra- and inter-strand
      cross-links between DNA bases. Ofatumumab is a fully human anti-CD 20 antibody well tolerated
      by elderly patients. Ofatumumab targets a novel epitope of the CD20 molecule on B cells and
      remains on the cell surface twice as long as rituximab. The combination of both agents allows
      for a potentially efficacious, less toxic regimen.
