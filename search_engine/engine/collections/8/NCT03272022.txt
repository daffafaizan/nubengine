      related aminoacids and markers of cellular immunoactivation in 160 fertile, unpregnant women,
      115 pregnant women from pregnancy week 18, throughout pregnancy and the first 6 postpartum
      months and their infant at 6 months. Infant gross motor development is associated with
      micronutrient status, so the investigators will relate gross motor development at 6 months to
      maternal micronutrient status during pregnancy and postpartum, in order to establish relevant
      cut off levels for micronutrients and related biomarkers.
