      brain metastases will be collected. The GliaSite RTS is a radionuclide applicator and liquid
      radionuclide (Iotrex) designed to deliver intracavitary radiation therapy for resected brain
      tumors. In this case, it will irradiate the resected margins. Brain metastases not surgically
      removed will be then treated with radiosurgery
