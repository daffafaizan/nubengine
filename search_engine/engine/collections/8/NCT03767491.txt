      for adults with OCD recruited nationally. Eligible subjects (N=58) will be randomly assigned
      to 12 weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for OCD either immediately, or after a 12-week long
      waiting period (50-50 chance). The investigators hypothesize that Smartphone-delivered CBT
      for OCD will be feasible and acceptable to individuals with OCD, and that it will lead to
      greater reductions in OCD symptom severity compared to the passage of time (waitlist
      control).
