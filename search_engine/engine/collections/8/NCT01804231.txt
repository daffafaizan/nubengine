      of prostate cancer post-prostatectomy or radiation with negative bone and CT scans. Hybrid
      PET/MRI using 18F-FCH will be obtained and a consensus staging report generated for the
      attending clinician. Clinical management questionnaires completed by the study investigator
      will be obtained pre and post imaging in order to gauge the impact of the hybrid imaging on
      clinical decision making.
