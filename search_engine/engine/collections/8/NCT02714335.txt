      be great interests to investigate the potential polymorphism of MAGE-A3 in NSCLC patients in
      Taiwan. Meanwhile, it is also interesting to study the expression of PRAME and EGFR mutation
      status as well as to find out significant factors which may affect their expression such as
      smoking status, histological types, tumour size and stages in Taiwan
