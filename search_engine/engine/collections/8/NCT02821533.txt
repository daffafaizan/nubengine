      become unresectable, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) has been widely accepted
      as a standard treatment for them in most international management protocols. The therapeutic
      effect of TACE in terms of objective tumor response is variable and modest (27%-40%),
      indicating that there is actually much room for improvement in the treatment.
      Internationally, high doses and combination of chemotherapeutic agents are being routinely
      and widely used for TACE in major medical centers. Locally, a low dose of cisplatin (10mg)
      has been used as the chemotherapeutic agent for TACE in Hong Kong. There is evidence showing
      that the component of chemotherapeutic agent in TACE does play a significant role in the
      treatment effect of TACE. In an attempt to improve the treatment effect of TACE, the
      investigators propose a formulation of TACE using a high dose of cisplatin as
      chemotherapeutic agent.
