      fasting condition.

      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical,
      serology parameters and urine analysis) at base line. Laboratory parameters of hematology and
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study. In addition serum electrolytes Sodium,
      Potassium and Chloride were measured on admission and at the discharge of each period.

      A total of 36 subjects were randomized to receive single oral dose of hydrochlorothiazide 50
