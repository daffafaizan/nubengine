      neurosurgeons prescribe antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to help prevent them. Although the
      American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines recommend that AEDs be stopped after the first
      post-operative week in patients without seizures, there is no standard length of treatment
      and some patients may stay on AEDs indefinitely.

      In an attempt to develop clinical guidelines for AED use in post-operative brain tumor
      patients, we will try to determine if taking levetiracetam extended-release (Keppra XR) for 1
      week results in less neurotoxicity than taking it for 6 weeks.
