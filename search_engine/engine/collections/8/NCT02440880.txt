      the hospital resources and the continuous need to decrease the costs, work load and medical
      stuff engagement. One of the most common problem is the need to control pain post
      operatively, this issue increase the work load over the pain management team and increase
      lead to patient in satisfaction.(1,2,3) The presence of the adjuvant which can be added to
      the conventional anesthetic medications can prolong the duration of action and decrease the
      need for frequent post-operative analgesics.(4,5) The idea of adding a catheter or placing an
      epidural catheter still have a quite limitation regarding the patients compliance, delayed
      ambulation and high costs, these limitations redirect the anesthetist again to the use of
      adjuvant with a single shot block to prolong the duration of it and decrease the need of
      subsequent analgesics.(6) Dexamethasone proved to be an effective adjuvant in prolongation of
      the nerve blocks with the question regarding the proper route and dose (7,8,9,10).

      This study will test the usage of dexamethasone with different doses (4 and 8 mg) either
      locally or intravenously (I.V.) with the local anesthetics in TAP (transversus abdominis
      plane) block to prolong the duration of the block and decrease the need of post-operative
      analgesics.
