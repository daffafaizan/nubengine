      minimally invasive, it is time consuming both for surgeon and pathologist, it may add a
      further scar and is not free from complications: seroma, limitation of shoulder movement,
      nerve injury, lymphedema. To date, patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS) with 1
      to 2 positive nodes can be treated with SNB alone (ACOSOG Z011 trial NCT00003855[2-4]) and
      researchers are evaluating within large randomized trials to even omit surgery at all when
      axillary imaging is negative (SOUNDSentinel node biopsy vs Observation after axillary

      Intergroup-Sentinel-MAmma trial NCT02466737.

      While the role of surgery is decreasing, the role of preoperative imaging is increasing. In
      the future, imaging might even replace surgery in the axillary staging of BC patients, still
      providing an appropriate level of information to guide medical treatments which are more and
      more tailored on biology rather than on nodal status. In this context, an unmet need is to
      achieve the most accurate preoperative imaging assessment of the axilla in order to decide
      the appropriate treatment for each patient.

      The hypothesis of this project is that PET/MRI might provide a single, one-stage,
      non-invasive, operator independent imaging modality in patients with small BC allowing to
      select the proper treatment for patients. PET/MRI is a relatively new imaging tool and its
      field of application is still object of scientific speculation.
