      help-seeking couples designed to promote individual and couple well-being. Within the United
      States, one-third of married couples are distressed and almost half of first marriages end in
      divorce/separation. Relationship distress is associated with a variety of negative health
      outcomes, including worsened mental and physical health problems in partners as well as
      internalizing and externalizing problems in children. Newly developed online intervention
      programs for distressed couples have shown to be efficacious, but their overall reach to the
      general population remains limited. The current research is designed to implement and
      evaluate the ePREP relationship intervention with couples throughout the state of Illinois.
