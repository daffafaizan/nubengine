      cesarean section will be enrolled. Before entering the operating rooms, the parturient
      enrolled receives the Doppler studies. The external iliac artery is identified and color
      Doppler is activated to locate the uterine artery crossed the external iliac artery. The
      probe is stabilized to obtain the maximum flow velocity waveform.The pulsatility index of
      these three waveforms is calculated and recorded as the baseline. Three minutes after the
      anesthetics are injected, the same procedures of color Doppler are performed again, and the
      PI after the spinal anesthesia is recorded.

      Tissue (cerebral) oximeter (INVOS Cerebral Oximeter Model 5100B; Somanetics, Troy, MI, USA)
      is used for the NIRS technique. Two adhesive sensor patches are attached to the parturient.
      One sensor patch is applied over the the biceps brachii of the upper limb while the other
      adhere to the medial side of the gastrocnemius muscle. After the oximeter shows a stable
      reading, the baseline data are recorded. The parturient then receive spinal anesthesia in the
      right lateral decubitus position. The intrathecal injection consists of 0.5% hyperbaric
      bupivacaine. NIBP is monitored at 2.5 minutes interval for 30 minutes. Tissue oximeter starts
      recording every minute right after local anesthetics are injected into the intrathecal space
      for a total of fifteen minutes.
