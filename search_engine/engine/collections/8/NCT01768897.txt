      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 when administered with
      high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of CPI-613 following intravenous (IV)
      administration in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

      II. To observe the response rate (complete response [CR], complete response with incomplete
      platelet recovery [CRi] and partial response [PR]) of CPI-613 in combination with high dose
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

      III. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with
      high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CPI-613.

      Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3
      hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 3, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over
      15 minutes after the 1st, 3rd, and 5th doses of cytarabine. . Treatment repeats every 14 days
      for up to 2 courses* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients undergoing a second course of therapy receive CPI-613 IV over 2 hours on days
      1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 2, and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the 1st and 3rd doses of cytarabine.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
