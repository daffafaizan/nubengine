      interventions requiring short hospital stays or even outpatient settings. Because of these
      factors, VATS did not raise as much interest as thoracotomy in its postoperative pain
      management. However, it is a fact that pain following VATS can be severe and long-lasting
      .According to Richardson and colleagues, 38% of VATS procedures present persistent pain two
      months after surgery as a result of acute nerve damage during the surgical procedure.
