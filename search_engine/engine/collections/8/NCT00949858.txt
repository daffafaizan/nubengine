      measure movement nearly continuously over several days. The American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine practice parameters report that actigraphy is a useful tool for detecting sleep in
      healthy individuals, assessing specific aspects in insomnia and restless legs syndrome,
      circadian-rhythm disorders, and excessive sleepiness. Concurrent with these recommendations
      is an increased interest in the use of actigraphy as a tool for objectively measuring
      fatigue. With improved high-end statistical methods for analyzing this data, actigraphy has
      the potential to become more important as an objective diagnostic tool for determining
      fatigue, sleep abnormalities and assessing response to treatment.
