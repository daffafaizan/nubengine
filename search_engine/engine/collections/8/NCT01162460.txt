      the total population vary from 4 to 8 per 1000 subjects. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are the
      major intervention and approximately 60% of newly diagnosed patients are seizure free on a
      single AED, but about 40% are not satisfactorily controlled and 25% suffer from significant
      adverse events (AEs). This lack of seizure control and unsatisfactory tolerability means
      there is still a need for new, effective AEDs that can be used as monotherapy.

      Given the efficacy of ESL in controlling partial onset seizures, the good tolerability and
      the convenience of QD dosing instead of twice daily (BID) dosing, ESL could offer a
      beneficial alternative as a first-line therapy in patients newly diagnosed with epilepsy
      experiencing partial-onset seizures. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy and safety
      of ESL as a monotherapy treatment for this patient population proving non-inferiority to a
      standard therapy, Carbamazepine controlled release (CBZ-CR).
