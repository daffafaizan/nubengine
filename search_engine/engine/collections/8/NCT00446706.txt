    
      Intrinsic PEEP (Positive-End Expiratory Pressure) was measured by end-expiratory occlusion
      method and estimated using formulas derived from measured expiratory flows and a postulated
      linear pressure-flow relationship during expiration in passive ARDS patients. Agreement
      between measured and estimated intrinsic PEEP was analyzed by Bland and Altman's method.
