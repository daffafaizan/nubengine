      Regenerative Medicine laboratory.

      Optimize cell viability of myeloma organoids to extend available time in culture by screening
      cell culture media cytokines and 3D extracellular matrix composition (current environment is
      able to maintain cells alive for up to 5-7 days to allow testing).

      Evaluate myeloma tumor markers at different time points of organoid life to confirm accurate
      tumor representation, identify genetic expression characteristics, unique mutations, and
      tumor-stroma interaction. This will give information of the tumor characteristics to learn
      about tumor biology and correlate with responses.

      Evaluate chemosensitivity on patient derived 3D organoids. Using myeloma patients marrow
      aspirate, evaluate live/kill rates of myeloma cells after being exposed to established
      regimen combinations after 24 and 36 hours of exposure at pre-determined concentrations.

      Using patient samples, evaluate differences in gene expression and cell markers of the
      myeloma cells that remained alive after chemotherapy exposure to better understand mechanisms
      of resistance.

      Validate the predictive value of the 3D organoid chemobiogram results compared with
      retrospective data of the donor s responses to the treatment used at that time point. This
      will compare in vivo/ex vivo responses and facilitate future personalized medicine.
      Chemobiogram is the report on chemosensitivity from the combinations tested much like an
      antibiogram.
