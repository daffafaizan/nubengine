    
      -  Design: Two groups randomized controlled trial

        -  Participants: 50 subjects diagnosed with CTS will be recruited from JUH physical
           medicine and rehabilitation department, diagnosis will be confirmed by a physician
           clinically and using nerve conduction test. Subjects will be randomized into treatment
           and control groups.

        -  Procedures: Participants will be recruited from the physical medicine department at JUH
           and the diagnosis and initial assessment will be performed by a physician. Baseline
           outcomes will be measured by an experienced physiotherapist.

      Treatment Group: Neurodynamics evaluation and treatment will be provided by an experienced
      physiotherapist. Each treatment session involves both manual therapy and median nerve
      mobilization exercise following the neurodynamics concept. Four 60 minutes sessions over a
      period of four weeks will be performed for each patient. Median nerve mobilization exercise
      will be continued as home exercise program and will be monitored by the treating
      physiotherapist using exercise diary.

      Control group: four sessions of exercise will be given to participants. CTS standard exercise
      brochure will be given for the patients to follow over 4 weeks. The brochure will include
      wrist joint strengthening, stretching and AROM exercise.

      Outcomes will be measured at the end of the 4 weeks treatment, 6 weeks and 6 months post
      treatment.

      â€¢ Data analysis: Microsoft Excel and SPSS will be used for data entry and analysis.

      Descriptive analysis: All obtained data will be tabulated, means, standard deviations and
      differences will be measured.

      Inferential analysis: Two way repeated measure ANOVA will be used to measure differences
      between the groups.
