      treatment the mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock still exceeds 50% and surviving
      patients mostly suffer from severe heart failure due to an impaired cardiac function.

      This study compares standard treatment plus Extra-Corporal Life Support (ECLS) versus
      standard treatment alone in patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction.

      The main study hypothesis is to explore if additional treatment with ECLS preserves cardiac
      function (left ventricular ejection fraction) in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating
      acute myocardial infarction.
