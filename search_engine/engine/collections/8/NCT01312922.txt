    
      This is an international, double-blind, centrally randomized (stratified), multicenter study
      in 555 patients suffering from moderate to severe MDD in up to 40 sites in the USA, Germany
      and Canada. Eligible out-patients will be treated once daily (QD) with a fixed dose of either
      PNB01 (PIP 15 mg / CIT 20 mg (Week 1) - PIP 15 mg / CIT 40 mg (Week 2-10)), CIT alone (CIT 20
      mg (Week 1) - CIT 40 mg (Week 2-10) or PIP 15 mg alone (Week 1-10) in a 1:1:1 ratio in a
      double-blind fashion for 10 weeks. Study visits will be conducted 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10
      weeks after study treatment initiation. Possible withdrawal effects will be assessed 1 week
      after study treatment withdrawal.

      A blood sample for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected when drawing blood for routine
      biochemistry. Patients who provided written informed consent to participate to the study will
      be asked to provide their consent to participate also to the non-mandatory pharmacogenetic
      study.

      Patient related outcomes will be collected electronically (ePRO) at study visits prior to
      visiting the investigator by using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) via telephone.
      Patients wishing or choosing to discontinue the study treatment prematurely will be
      encouraged to continue to provide their scores, safety data and medications taken, up to the
      scheduled study end, by telephone.
