      of visual loss. Standard systemic immunosuppressive medications for uveitis can cause
      significant adverse effects. Consequently, an effective treatment with a safer side effect
      profile is highly desirable.

      Aims: This protocol evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of subcutaneous (SC)
      efalizumab (anti-CD11a) treatments for uveitis while reducing or eliminating standard
      medications commensurate with the standard of care. If the therapeutic benefit was sustained
      using the SC formulation, then maintenance therapy was continued as clinically indicated.

      Methods: This was an open-label, non-randomized, clinical pilot study.
