      acids (in particular EPA and DHA). These fatty acids have several known health benefits,
      including improvements in heart health, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation. These benefits
      occur because omega-3 fatty acids can regulate a myriad of cellular functions. In order to
      increase the levels of these omega-3 fatty acids in the body, individuals must either consume
      more marine products or take an omega-3 rich dietary supplement, such as fish oil. While fish
      oil supplements are commonly consumed by people, it is now recognized that not everyone
      responds to these supplements in the same manner. Therefore this study aims to improve our
      understanding of why people respond differently to the same dietary supplement. The goals of
      this research will be accomplished using a number of approaches:

        1. The investigators will examine how fish oil supplementation leads to an enrichment of
           EPA and DHA in various cells throughout the body (erythrocytes, adipose tissue, etc).

        2. The investigators will determine the dynamic changes in EPA and DHA incorporation into
           different cell-types during distinct phases of our dietary intervention study (e.g.
           during supplementation and subsequent wash out periods).

        3. The investigators will study how fish oil supplements influence various blood markers of
           cardiometabolic health (e.g. triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, C-reactive protein,
           etc) and whether this is modulated by an individual's genotype.
