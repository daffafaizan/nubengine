      125% of the expected value depending on the size and the weight of the patient. However, this
      measurement requires an isotopic labeling of red cells and is not available in most of the
      hospitals. Therefore, the diagnosis of polycythemia, and particularly Polycythemia Vera (PV)
      is based on routine red blood cells parameters, i.e. hemoglobin level and hematocrit. If
      these parameters are efficient in marked polycythemia, discrepancies have been observed in
      milder cases. Two situations where a RCM evaluation is particularly required can be
      described:

        -  In patients with a hematocrit level between 52 and 60% (men) or between 48 and 56%
           (women) in order to limit invasive investigations to patients with a confirmed
           polycythemia diagnosis

        -  In JAK2V617F positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with hematocrit and hemoglobin
           levels under the PV cut-off in order to discriminate between masked PV and essential
           thrombocythemia CO-Rebreathing is a fast, non invasive alternative method for RCM
           evaluation. It is based on the high affinity of carbon monoxide (CO) for hemoglobin. The
           decrease in the HbCO percentage after CO inhalation is dependent on the total hemoglobin
           mass from which RCM can be obtained. The investigators propose a tri-centric study
           evaluating CO-Rebreathing as an alternative tool to measure RCM in the diagnosis of
           polycythemia in the two categories of patients described above.
