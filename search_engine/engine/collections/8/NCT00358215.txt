      correlation of increased risk for mortality and hospitalization with low hemoglobin in
      patients with HF. Earlier single-center interventional studies suggest that meaningful
      clinical benefits may be achieved by raising hemoglobin concentration in patients with
      symptomatic HF and anemia. Data from Amgen's completed phase 2 multi-center studies support
      this hypothesis and show that darbepoetin alfa is well tolerated in patients with symptomatic
      left ventricular systolic dysfunction and anemia and effectively raises hemoglobin. The
      pivotal phase 3 Study 20050222 RED-HF Trial is evaluating the effect of treatment with
      darbepoetin alfa on the composite risk of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for
      worsening HF in patients with symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction and anemia.
      This study also evaluates the effect of darbepoetin alfa treatment on all-cause death, on
      cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening HF, and on patient-reported
      quality-of-life outcomes.
