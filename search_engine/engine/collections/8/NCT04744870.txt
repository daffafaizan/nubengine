      turn an important factor in appropriate treatment decisions. In practice though, tissue
      perfusion measurements are not routinely undertaken as few practical solutions exist that are
      easy to use and fit in everyday clinical practice. Pedra has developed a novel, easy to use,
      non-invasive device that can be used in practice to better inform treatment decisions.

      This is a feasibility study to demonstrate the ability of the Xauron system to track tissue
      perfusion changes in patients undergoing endovascular intervention for the treatment of
      peripheral artery disease (PAD). The findings of this study are for research purposes and
      will also be used to help with the future education of physicians about the potential use of
      the Xauron system. In addition, this early pilot data will be used to help power larger, more
      definitive studies relating to the intra-procedural use of the Xauron system.
