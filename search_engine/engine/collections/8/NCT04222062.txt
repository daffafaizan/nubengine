      preventing local recurrence of a metastatic brain tumor compared to stereotactic radiosurgery
      (SRS) after resection.

      100 Adult subjects with one to four metastatic brain tumors with one tumor needing resection
      will be enrolled. Subjects with prior radiation, lymphoma, small cell, germ cell, unknown
      primary, or anaplastic thyroid diagnoses will be ineligible. Life expectancy should be
      greater than 3 months.

      Subjects will be randomized at the time of surgery to 1) GLIADEL placement at the time of
      resection or 2) SRS post-operatively to the resection cavity. Any other tumors (up to three)
      will have SRS as their primary treatment after surgery. SRS will take place within 6 weeks
      from surgery.

      Subjects will be evaluated pre-operatively with MRI brain and neuropsychological testing and
      will have immediate post-op MRI for extent of resection (EOR) determination. Subjects will
      have SRS to the resection cavity if no GLIADEL was placed and all will have SRS to any other
      lesions. They will be followed at set intervals to evaluate for local recurrence and
      neurocognitive changes. The genome of the metastatic brain tumor will be compared to their
      primary and germline for identification of alterations.
