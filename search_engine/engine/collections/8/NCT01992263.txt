      tuberculosis (TB; among whom 40 have HIV co-infections) at the time of TB diagnosis in S
      India. The intervention will include daily vitamin D supplementation in 3 treatment arms
      (600, 2000, and 4000 IU vitamin D), compared to placebo, for 12 months. The investigators'
      primary objectives are to assess how vitamin D supplementation affects immunity
      (immunological markers, immune competence) and serum vitamin D levels. Secondary outcomes
      include TB treatment outcomes (successful sputum smear conversion, relapse) in all patients,
      and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression among a subset of patients with
      HIV co-infection.
