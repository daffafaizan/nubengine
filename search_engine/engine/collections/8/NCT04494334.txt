      trajectory is not easily predicted based on clinical measurements. Biomarkers reflective of
      molecular pathways involved in IPF may help inform patient trajectory, but have been
      difficult to identify in circulation due to the disease manifesting in the lung. The study
      team will measure biomarkers from Probable IPF patients, sarcoidosis patients, and healthy
      volunteers using novel sampling methods involving absorption of upper and lower airway
      fluids. These novel sampling methods may enable less invasive and potentially more sensitive
      methods to detect disease activity and will be performed in IPF and sarcoidosis patients
      during a routine bronchoscopy procedure. The study team will compare the levels of biomarkers
      that have been shown to be predictive of disease course in airway fluids of probable IPF
      patients versus sarcoidosis and healthy controls. This study may help understand the
      molecular basis of IPF, and improve the understanding of diagnosis and treatment.
