    
      Objectives: Determine by DHPLC analysis the frequency of TPMT polymorphisms in mestizos
      mexican population with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  To do a clinical correlation between the presence of polymorphism and thiopurine
           related- myelotoxicity.

        -  Inclusion criteria: Healthy volunteers or patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
           age > 18 years, who attend to the National Institute of Cancerologia.

        -  Exclussion criteria: Patients with ALL, who are unable to have an adequate follow-up.

        -  Samples: Genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes was isolated by standard methods.
           Known (wild-type and polymorphic) sequenced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments of
           the TPMT gene were used as controls. TPMT gene fragments were amplified. PCR products
           were then analyzed by denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC).
