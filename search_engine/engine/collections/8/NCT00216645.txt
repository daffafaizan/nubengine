      conventional doxorubicin in the blood and to improve the safety and effectiveness of the
      drug. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride has been approved in many countries
      including US and EU, becoming a standard drug for 2nd-line therapy in ovarian cancer and
      AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma. This clinical study was planned to assess effectiveness and
      safety for Japanese patients with MÃ¼llerian carcinoma (including epithelial ovarian
      carcinoma, primary carcinoma of fallopian tube, peritoneal carcinoma), who had a prior
      history of receiving platinum-based chemotherapy such as Cisplatin (which is considered to be
      the standard chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma). In this study, at least two cycles of
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 will be intravenously administered to
      80 patients every 4 weeks. These patients include twenty 2nd-line "platinum-sensitive" and
      sixty "platinum-resistant" 2nd-line or 3rd-line patients. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 will be given by intravenous drip infusion on day 1. After this, a
      27-day drug-free period will be followed as one cycle. At least two cycles will be given as
      long as the patient does not meet the discontinuation criteria.
