    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Identify the safety and recommended phase 2 dose of ibrutinib in combination with
      idarubicin/cytarabine in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the induction response rate (complete remission [CR]/complete remission with
           incomplete count [CRi]) of ibrutinib in combination with idarubicin/cytarabine in
           relapsed/refractory AML.

        -  Assess overall survival of ibrutinib in combination with idarubicin/cytarabine in
           relapsed/refractory AML.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ibrutinib.

      INDUCTION: Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1 to 21, idarubicin
      intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on days 1 to 3 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1 to
      4.

      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving CR or CRi may receive ibrutinib PO QD on days 1 to 21,
      idarubicin IV over 15 minutes on Days 1and 2 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-3.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients maintaining a CR/CRi may receive ibrutinib PO QD on days 1 to 28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
