      status, an increase in lean body mass and a reduction in visceral adiposity. GH might also
      decrease visceral adiposity in obese adults that are not GH deficient.

      The objective of the study is to determine the effects of GH on the metabolic syndrome and
      visceral adiposity in men with low blood levels of IGF-1 and the durability of these effects
      after stopping GH therapy. We will use a double blind, placebo controlled 6 month
      intervention trial followed by a blinded follow-up period of 6 months. Thirty non-diabetic
      middle aged men with central adiposity (BMI > 27 kg/m2, waist circumference > 102 cm) will
      participate.
