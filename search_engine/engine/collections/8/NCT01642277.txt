      recommendation for OAB treatment with solifenacin and a comparator (control) group of women
      unaffected by OAB. All women will have a baseline urine assessment with bacterial genome
      sequencing. Solifenacin treated patients will also have urine assessments with bacterial
      genomic sequencing at 4 and 12 weeks on treatment.
