      experiments, skin sterility is assessed. Healthy adult subjects are prepared for mock
      injections of shoulders and knees. No injection is performed. Each site has a set of 3 skin
      cultures: 1) prior to the alcohol prep (pre-prep), 2) post-alcohol prep (pre-spray), and 3)
      after ethyl-chloride was sprayed on the site (post-spray). In the second set of experiments,
      sterility of ethyl chloride is tested directly by culturing the liquid from the spray
      bottles.
