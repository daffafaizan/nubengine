      Participants will be asked to take their supplement once/day for 14 weeks.Blood will be drawn
      to check on liver, kidney, thyroid, cholesterol,and prostate health. Urine will be collected
      to check on bone markers. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires to test memory,
      attention span, and vocabulary.Possible benefits may include increase in memory, decrease in
      hot flashes, and a general increase in quality of life.
