      I. To identify novel recurrent de novo germline mutations among rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
      case-parent trios.

      II. To identify the frequency of de novo germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes
      among RMS case-parent trios.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct deep phenotyping of children diagnosed with RMS utilizing questionnaire data
      and information from medical records.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients and their parents undergo collection of saliva or buccal mucosa samples for genetic
      mutational analysis. Germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from saliva or buccal mucosa is
      evaluated via whole exome sequencing.
