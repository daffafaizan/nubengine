      from RLS. Hemodialysis patients have a high oxidative stress status. Oxidative stress has
      been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RLS. Vitamin C and vitamin E
      are potent antioxidant agents that have already been shown to be effective in the treatment
      of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in hemodialysis patients. PLMD is closely
      associated with RLS in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      efficacy of vitamin C, vitamin E and their combination in the treatment of RLS in
      hemodialysis patients.
