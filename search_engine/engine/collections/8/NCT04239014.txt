    
      This is a Phase II, randomised, multicentre study to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of a second maintenance treatment in participants with PSR epithelial ovarian
      cancer, who have previously received PARPi maintenance treatment and who have benefit (CR or
      PR) or SD from further platinum based chemotherapy.

      Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 120 study sites in the USA,
      Canada, Middle East and Europe.

      Approximately 192 participants fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following 3 treatment arms (64
      participants per arm):

        -  Arm 1 (ceralasertib+olaparib): Ceralasertib 160 mg once daily (QD) orally or per os (PO)
           on Days 1 to 7 plus olaparib 300 mg twice daily (BD) PO continuous (28 day cycle)

        -  Arm 2 (olaparib monotherapy): Olaparib 300 mg BD PO daily continuous

        -  Arm 3 (placebo): Placebo to match olaparib BD PO daily continuous

      The olaparib and placebo arms will be double blinded, whereas the ceralasertib+olaparib arm
      will be open label. It is expected that approximately 320 participants will be screened.

      The study achieved First Subject In date, but enrollment equals 0 as 7 participants have
      signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and were later screen failed.
