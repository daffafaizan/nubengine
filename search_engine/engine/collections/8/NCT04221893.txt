      I. To determine whether radiation therapy can convert overall response rates from progressive
      disease to stable or responsive disease as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v.) 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define overall response rate by immune-Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (iRECIST) criteria.

      II. To determine time to progression. III. To determine overall survival. IV. To determine
      local control in radiated lesion(s). V. To characterize the effect of distant radiation on
      unirradiated target lesions.

      VI. To describe the incidence of new metastatic lesions. VII. To determine treatment safety
      by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5.0.

      VIII. To describe time to new systemic therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define radiation-induced effects on circulating immune cells. II. To describe
      remodeling of the circulating T cell repertoire by deep sequencing of variable, diversity and
      joining (VDJ) regions of T cell receptors (TCRs).

      III. To describe changes in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radiation therapy for a total of 5 treatments over 5-9 calendar days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 day, 6 months, and then
      up to 36 months.
