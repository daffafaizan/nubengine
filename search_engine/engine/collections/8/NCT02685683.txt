    
      Subjects will be screened to provide 20 enrolled subjects who complete 12 weeks of mongersen
      (GED-0301) 160 mg QD treatment as open-label therapy.

      The study will consist of 4 periods:

        -  Screening Period - up to 4 weeks

        -  Induction Period - 12 weeks (Week 0 Visit through Week 12 Visit)

        -  Maintenance Period - 88 weeks (after Week 12 Visit through Week 100 Visit)

        -  Follow-up Period - 4 weeks (ie, no IP taken)

      Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment from this study prior to Week 100 will have an
      Early Termination Visit and also enter the 4-week Follow-up Period.

      At the Screening Visit, all subjects who meet the entrance criteria will be eligible to enter
      the study. The number of subjects with previous exposure to Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha
      (TNF-Î±) blockers is targeted to be approximately 40% (ie, approximately 8 subjects).
