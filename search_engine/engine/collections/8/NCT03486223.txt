    
      AIM 1: We will test the hypothesis that the loss-of-function variant (287Gln) in EPHX2 is
      associated with insulin sensitivity using the gold-standard, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
      clamps, with stable isotope dilution to assess hepatic gluconeogenesis. We will assess the
      relationship between genotype and insulin-stimulated vasodilation in the forearm using
      plethysmography and in the renal vasculature using para-aminohippurate (PAH, IND#133828)
      clearance. We will obtain adipose and muscle tissue before and after clamp to assess insulin
      signaling in these tissues.

      During the Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, insulin will be infused for 2 hours at low dose
      (20 mU/m2/min) and 2 hours at high dose (80 mU/m2/min) to assess insulin sensitivity. The
      Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) will be adjusted to maintain glucose near 95 mg/dL. The average
      GIR during the final 30 minutes of the high dose period will be used as the measure of
      insulin sensitivity.

      AIM 2: Subjects are randomized to treatment with the sEH inhibitor GSK2256294 (10mg/day) or
      matching placebo for one week. On the seventh day of drug treatment, subjects will report to
      the CRC in the morning after an overnight fast to undergo a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp
      with adipose tissue biopsies.

      During the Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, insulin will be infused for 2 hours at low dose
      (20 mU/m2/min) and 2 hours at high dose (80 mU/m2/min) to assess insulin sensitivity. The
      Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) will be adjusted to maintain glucose near 95 mg/dL. The average
      GIR during the final 30 minutes of the high dose period will be used as the measure of
      insulin sensitivity.

      After completion of the study day, subjects will undergo a seven-week washout from study drug
      and then receive the opposite drug for one week. On the seventh day of treatment they will
      report to the CRC after an overnight fast and repeat the study day protocol.
