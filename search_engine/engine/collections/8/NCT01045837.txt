      in wheat, barley, and rye. Steroids affect proliferative responses of both B and T cells in
      vitro, and the production of lymphokines (migratory inhibitory factor) by cultured cells.
      Steroids inhibit the effect of gluten proteins through their action on elements of the immune
      system. Glucocorticoids are reserved for severely ill patients, who present with celiac
      crisis, gliadin shock, and refractory sprue. We hypothesized that addition of a short course
      of steroid to gluten free diet may enhance intestinal mucosal recovery and thus clinical
      manifestations.
