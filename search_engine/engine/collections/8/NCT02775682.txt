      from mechanisms to clinical manifestation. Stroke is one of the most common causes of
      epilepsy in adulthood. It was also reported that patients with epilepsy exhibited a higher
      risk of stroke. But its potential mechanism was never fully understood. Dynamic cerebral
      autoregulation(dCA), a mechanism to maintain the cerebral bold flow, has been proved to be
      critical for the occurrence ,development and prognosis of ischemic neurovascular disease. In
      this study, we hypothesis that impaired dCA play a role in epilepsy and subsequent stroke.
