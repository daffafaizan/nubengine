    
      This study is a pivotal Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled study to
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), anti-drug antibody (ADA) response, and
      descriptive efficacy for MEDI8897 in high-risk infants eligible to receive palivizumab when
      entering their first or second RSV season (Season 1 or Season 2, respectively). Approximately
      1,500 palivizumab-eligible infants entering their first RSV season will be enrolled into one
      of 2 cohorts : (1) preterm cohort, including approximately 750 preterm infants (≤ 35 weeks
      GA) without CLD/CHD, or (2) CLD/CHD cohort, including approximately 750 infants with CLD of
      prematurity or hemodynamically significant CHD. As minimum of 100 infants with
      hemodynamically significant CHD will be enrolled. Within each cohort, randomization will be
      stratified by hemisphere (northern, southern) and subject age at the time of Season 1
      randomization (≤ 3 months, > 3 to ≤ 6 months, > 6 months).
