    
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether the drug pegylated-interferon-alfa-2b
      (PEG-IFN)has any effect on a certain type of immune cell (called natural killer cells) in
      patients with eye melanoma. Because this drug is currently being investigated for use against
      skin melanoma, we think this drug might have some benefit in eye melanoma as well, and that
      natural killer cells might be important in how the drug works.

      Patients who choose to take part in the study will be randomized to receive either no drug,
      or PEG-IFN. Four days prior to the patient's surgery to remove the eye, 50cc of blood will be
      drawn. Patients who are randomized to PEG-IFN will be given the drug once, 4 days prior to
      surgery. Blood will also be drawn on the day of surgery (50cc), 1 week after surgery (50cc),
      1 month (500cc), and 6 months (50cc).
