      to be anti-angiogenic and to have activity against prostate cancer cell lines. ATN-224 has
      the potential to affect the progression of prostate cancer by mechanisms that include both
      antiangiogenic and antitumor pathways. ATN-224 may change the time to overt metastatic
      disease in patients with rising PSA as the only manifestation of disease after treatment with
      curative intent and delay the need for hormonal therapies.
