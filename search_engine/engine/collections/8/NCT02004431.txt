      whether patients with poor pain control on day 1 following surgery have higher levels of
      anxiety / depression or catastrophising than those without acute pain. The cases are patients
      with significant pain on day one after surgery and the controls are sex, age and operation
      matched individuals without pain.

      Several other variables are measured which may provide information for the design of future
      studies. The presence of pain or psychopathology prior to surgery will be recorded, as this
      is likely to impact on these variables in the post-operative period. Analgesic use pre and
      post surgery is also of interest as a surrogate measure of pain severity.

      In addition to day one data, pain severity will also be recorded on day 2 and 3
      post-operatively. This is of interest as although most patients will be expected to
      demonstrate reducing pain severity with time, a proportion will not improve and a small
      number will experience increasing pain with time. This adverse "pain trajectory" might be
      associated with an increased incidence of CPSP 28.

      Long-term outcomes such as pain and quality of life at 6 months post-discharge will also be
      assessed by postal questionnaire.

      The eventual aim of this series of studies is to assess the interaction between acute
      psychological problems and post-surgical pain and the impact that this has on longer-term
      outcomes such as CPSP, mood and quality of life. Short-term pre- and post-operative
      psychological interventions will then be developed to modify the impact of psychological
      factors on long-term surgical outcomes. Further studies will assess the efficacy of these
      interventions. Pre-study audit will be carried out to confirm the feasibility of matching.
