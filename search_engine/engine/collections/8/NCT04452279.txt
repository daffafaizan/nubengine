      medications who were scheduled to undergo phacoemulsification cataract extraction and
      trabecular micro-bypass stent(s) implantation (iStent or iStent inject). Study participation
      entailed measurement of key ocular surface data through 3 months postoperative including
      Ocular Surface Disease Index score (OSDI), corneal/conjunctival staining (Oxford Schema),
      fluorescein tear break-up time (FTBUT), and conjunctival hyperemia (Efron Scale); these
      measures were collected alongside standard postoperative glaucoma evaluations such as number
      of glaucoma medications and intraocular pressure (IOP).
