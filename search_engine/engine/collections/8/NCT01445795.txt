    
      Primary Objectives:

      To evaluate in chronically-infected, non-cirrhotic, genotype 1 treatment na√Øve-subjects dosed
      with Study Drug for 7 consecutive days

      Safety

      - The safety of each of the 4 dosing cohorts of INX-08189 (200 mg daily (QD), 100 mg twice a
      day (BID), 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with adjunctive ribavirin).

      Pharmacokinetic

      - To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of oral doses of INX-08189 (200 mg QD, 100
      mg BID, 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with adjunctive ribavirin) and the PK
      profile of the metabolite (INX-08032).

      Pharmacodynamic

      - To evaluate the relationship between the kinetics of the reduction from baseline in serum
      HCV RNA and PK parameters of INX-08189 and the metabolite INX-08032

      Efficacy

      - To measure the kinetics of viral load reduction in plasma HCV RNA by each of the 4 dosing
      cohorts of INX-08189 (200 mg QD, 100 mg BID, 100 mg QD with low-fat meal, and 100 mg QD with
      adjunctive ribavirin).
