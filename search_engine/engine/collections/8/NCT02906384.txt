      irradiation(PCI) is the standardized treatment. However, cognitive dysfunction like memory
      damage is observed in quite a number of patients after brain irradiation, which may due to
      the hippocampus being irradiated. Thus, the investigators conduct the study by reducing the
      dose to the hippocampal neural stem-cell compartment (HAZ) during PCI.

      Patient Population: Age: 18-65y; small cell lung cancer undergoing PCI; Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) score: 0-1.

      The patients are randomized to 2 arms:

      Arm Routine PCI: PTV(planning target volume) 25Gy/10F. Arm Hippocampus avoidance PCI(HA-PCI):
      PTV 25Gray(Gy)/10Fraction(F), HAZ Dmin<9Gy Dmax<16Gy).

      Measurements: Hopkins verbal learning test(HVLT) and functional brain magnetic resonance
      imaging.
