      preoperative fluid bolus prior to induction of anaesthesia is conducted in respective group
      at the day of surgery. Preoperative colloid fluid therapy (6 ml/kg LBW, Gelofusineâ„¢,
      Fresenius Kabi Ab, Sweden) is infused rapidly before non-invasive baseline blood pressure
      (NIBP) measurements in twenty individuals in each group. No other intravenous fluids before
      induction of anaesthesia.

      NIBPs, pulse frequency, peripheral saturation (SpO2) are registered and collected 20 minutes
      post induction.
