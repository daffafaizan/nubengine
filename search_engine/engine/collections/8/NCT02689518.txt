      degeneration using intravitreal aflibercept injection. This study seeks to determine if
      different genetic polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and HtrA
      serine peptidase 1(HTRA1) and other genes correlate to the response to intravitreal
      aflibercept injection therapy.
