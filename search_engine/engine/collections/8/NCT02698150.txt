      monitoring in patients with severe functional mitral regurgitation who have undergone
      transcatheter mitral valve edge-to-edge repair with the Mitraclip system may have the
      potential to guide treatment decisions at follow-up visits, and improve the quality of life.
      Candidates to the Mitraclip procedure on optimal medical therapy will be offered the
      opportunity to participate to the study by bringing home a tablet and a series of sensors and
      wearables to collect daily information on blood pressure, oxygen saturation, weight
      variation, heart rate, symptoms and compliance to therapy. These variables will be blinded,
      stored by the tablet and downloaded by the core institution at follow-up visits. Clinicians
      will be encouraged to use these data to guide their decisions, personalizing drug therapies
      and follow-up schedules to the individual patient's need. Patients that during the run-in
      phase (from enrollment to 30+-7 days) will have used the tablet for >66% of the days will
      undergo the Mitraclip procedure and continue to keep the tablet for up to 12 months (active
      group). Patients that during the run-in phase (from enrollment to 30+-7 days) will have not
      used the tablet for >66% of the days, will continue the study as a control group. Predefined
      clinical follow up assessments for collection of study endpoints will be at 1 month post
      Mitraclip, 6 months post Mitraclip and 12 months post Mitraclip. Quality of life, assessed by
      means of the SF36v2 questionnaire, will be assessed at enrollment, pre Mitraclip, at 1 month
      after Mitraclip and at 12 months after Mitraclip. A series of secondary endpoints, including
      6MWT assessments and consumption of resources will be also assessed.
