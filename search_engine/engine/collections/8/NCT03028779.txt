      project of the total knee (TKR) or hip (THR) replacement in a fast track setting. The
      specifics features of such a study are to introduce intervention modalities and care rapidly
      to minimize and prevent all known complications associated with THR or TKR.

      Following a total hip replacement (THR), the length of stay is usually 1 to 3 days and 3 to 5
      days for a total knee replacement (TKR). The investigators have developed a new protocol with
      intensive care giving the possibility to return home in less than 24 hours and want to
      evaluate the feasibility and security of such a protocol.

      To evaluate the security and feasibility of this protocol the investigators want to recruit
      150 participants who will agree to enroll in this study.The investigators will evaluate these
      variables; number of complications occuring within the 12 months fallowing the surgery,
      number of readmission post-surgery, pain control efficiency, number of blood transfusion
      needed, length of wound spread, patient satisfaction and the cost of the program
      implementation. The investigators want to identify the success and failure factors to
      optimise the program afterwards.

      In order to achieve the evaluation, the investigators will compare the data obtain from the
      150 patients to the data retrieved in the medical files of the patients that already had the
      same usual intervention in the past, with the standard length of stay.
