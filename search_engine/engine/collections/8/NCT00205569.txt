      functioning, functional status, and life satisfaction, and for increasing knowledge about TBI
      and compensatory strategies. The First Steps program was developed to address the
      neurobehavioral and emotional concerns of survivors of TBI during the course of inpatient
      rehabilitation. Program format and content reflects clinical experience and extensive
      research review. Input from survivors, family members, and rehabilitation staff trained in
      working with the TBI population has also helped shape the implementation protocol. The
      foundation of the protocol is a curriculum [Niemeier, J., Kreutzer, J., & Taylor, L. (2005).
      Acute cognitive and neurobehavioral intervention for individuals with acquired brain injury:
      Preliminary outcome data. Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 15(2), 129-146.] The First Steps
      curriculum consists of ten lessons and was developed to address the common needs, issues, and
      concerns of TBI survivors admitted acutely for inpatient rehabilitation.
