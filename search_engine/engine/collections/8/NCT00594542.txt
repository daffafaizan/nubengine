      performed with a lower total dose of local anesthesia (and greater patient safety) when using
      0.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine versus 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine.
      Mohs micrographic surgery is a multi-staged, same-day procedure used to remove skin cancers
      under local anesthesia. Reconstruction of the surgical wound is also performed under local
      anesthesia, usually immediately after achieving tumor clearance.

      This randomized, double-blind study will systematically compare the total dose of 1.0%
      lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine versus 0.5% of lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine
      needed to achieve local anesthesia during Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). All healthy adult
      volunteers (18 years or older) undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery at the Hospital of the
      University of Pennsylvania's Department of Dermatology and Dermatologic Surgery between June
      1, 2007 and August 31, 2007 will be eligible to participate in the study. Our primary
      intervention will be to record the total dose of lidocaine administered throughout all of the
      MMS stages and reconstructions using either of the two lidocaine concentrations. A secondary
      intervention will be to record each patient's level of pain control in order to demonstrate
      that patient comfort is effectively achieved with a lower total dose of local anesthesia.
      Pregnant or breast-feeding subjects, those with a history of allergic or other adverse
      reaction to lidocaine or epinephrine, and those who are cognitively impaired will be
      excluded. In addition, if the surgeon believes that a patient has a tumor which, due to size
      or anatomic site, may put him at risk for requiring a dose of lidocaine that approaches the
      threshold of toxicity, this patient will be excluded from the study.
