      examination, Vital signs, Urine pregnancy test (UPT)

      Visit 2 (day 0): Enroll, randomize and administer vaccine to eligible participants and assess
      participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs, Collect blood for immunogenicity
      assessments.

      participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs

      Visit 4 (day 28): Assess participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs, Collect

      Visit 5 (day 84): Assess participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs

      Visit 6 (day 168): Assess participant safety by physical examination and Vital signs, Collect
      blood for immunogenicity assessments, and fill in study completion form in the absence of any
      safety concern.

      This study is observer-blind: vaccine administrator and vaccine safety evaluator will be two
      distinct persons to avoid bias of safety assessment. Trial staff other than the vaccine
      administrator.
