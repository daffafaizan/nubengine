      plaque sutured to the sclera under general anaesthesia. The plaque is removed in a few days
      after delivering the required radioactive dosage to the tumour. While the plaque is in situ,
      patients require analgesia. The management of post-operative pain is generally not considered
      a high priority, more importance being given to the regression of the melanoma.

      This is indicated by the lack of any study addressing this aspect of care. The failure of
      patients in general, to complain, may perhaps be due to them having accepted that some degree
      of pain following 'major surgery for a malignant ocular condition' is the norm.

      As per current protocol, ibuprofen is being prescribed, unless contraindicated. Although many
      are comfortable, others request additional analgesics. Most opioid analgesics provide better
      pain relief but are associated with nausea, vomiting, constipation and respiratory
      depression.

      Tramadol is an opioid analgesic that is reported to have less of the above mentioned side
      affects.

      Comparisons: To compare the analgesic effect of oral tramadol versus ibuprofen in such
      patients.
