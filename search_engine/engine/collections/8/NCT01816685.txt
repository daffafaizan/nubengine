      surgical procedures all have an expected length of stay > 3 days. Immediately following
      enrollment, patients will be randomized to receive CPAP or routine peri-operative care.
      Patients in the CPAP group will be instructed to wear an autotitrating positive airway
      pressure (APAP) device any time they sleep prior to surgery and on postoperative days 0, 1,
      and 2.
