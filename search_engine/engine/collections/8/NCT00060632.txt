      ridaforolimus when administered once weekly for 4 weeks (4 week cycle). The secondary
      objectives of the study are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of ridaforolimus, to
      evaluate potential pharmacodynamic markers of ridaforolimus, and to obtain preliminary
      information on the antineoplastic activity of ridaforolimus.

      Protocol Outline: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive ridaforolimus over 30
      minutes by intravenous infusion once weekly for 8 weeks (two 4-week cycles). If tolerated, a
      total of at least 2 cycles will be administered (8-week treatment period). Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
