    
      This is a multicenter, single-arm pilot study incorporating brentuximab vedotin and dose
      attenuated rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) into initial
      therapy for elderly patients with DLBCL. Vincristine will be omitted from the standard R-CHOP
      regimen given the overlapping toxicities with brentuximab vedotin. CD30 positivity will be
      determined at enrollment and patients will be enrolled into a CD30 positive and negative
      group in equal numbers. Additionally, a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) will be
      performed on all patients, but this will not be used to guide treatment decisions.
