      knowledge about how to safely use their newly prescribed opioid pain relievers. Additionally,
      educational interventions have the ability to increase patient knowledge about medications.
      In this study, education interventions will be implemented at the level of the EHR and prompt
      increased provider counseling with a goal of improving patient knowledge and safe use of
      opioids after ED discharge.

      The investigators will conduct a three-arm provider randomized controlled trial among
      English-speaking adults prescribed hydrocodone-acetaminophen to evaluate the effectiveness of
      the EMC2 strategy, with and without Short Message Service (SMS) text reminders, to improve
      patient understanding and safe use of their medication compared to usual care. This study
      will be conducted at an urban, academic emergency department (annual volume >85,000 patient
      visits) in Chicago, Illinois. English speaking patients will be recruited and assessed in
      person at baseline, and by phone at 2-4 days, 7-14 days, and 1 month after recruitment.
