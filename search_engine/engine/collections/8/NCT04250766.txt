      being informed of the purpose of the research, its conduct and duration, benefits, potential
      risks and constraints of the study.

      During the inclusion check-up, exams must be performed within 30 days before the guided echo
      biopsy: clinical examination, gynecological examination, pain assessment (visual or verbal
      scale), biological and radiological assessment (Doppler ultrasound Pelvis and MRI pelvis).

      The echo-guided biopsy will be performed by a specialized radiologist by transvaginal and
      exclusive transuterine approach. Local anesthesia will be performed. A pain assessment will
      be performed during the biopsy (visual or verbal scale).

      Between the biopsy and the procedure, the patient will be reviewed by the investigating
      surgeon to check the outcome of the biopsy, any pain or complications of the biopsy.

      The surgical procedure will be performed by laparotomy and will consist of an extra-facial
      hysterectomy without fragmentation of the surgical specimen (extraction technique "in
      block"). During the procedure, the investigating surgeon will perform a description of the
      abdominal and pelvic cavity and perform a block excision of the tumor.

      At one month of the surgery, patient will be reviewed by the investigating surgeon for a
      postoperative visit with clinical examination, gynecological and histopathological results.

      Thereafter, the follow-up of the patients will be carried out according to the standards of
      care according to the histopathological results.
