      catheters in the operating room. However there are very few studies to support the safety of
      peripherally administered Norepinephrine.

      Norepinephrine of the concentration 8 respectively 40 microg/ml will be investigated. The
      primary aim of the study is to investigate complications from Norepinephrine administered in
      peripheral venous catheters. The secondary aim is to investigate if comorbidity, placement of
      the peripheral catheter or the duration of the infusion are associated with a higher rate of
      complications.

      The localisation and size of the peripheral venous catheter will be registered. The blood
      pressure will me measured every 5 minutes and every minute in case of systolic blood pressure
      over 220 mm Hg.

      The site of administration will regularly be monitored for complications. If subcutaneous
      infusion of Norepinephrine is suspected, the patient will be followed up for up to 48 hours
      or until hospital discharge.
