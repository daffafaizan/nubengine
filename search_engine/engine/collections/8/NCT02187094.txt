      diabetic subjects with gastroparesis. The length of study participation for a subject is up
      to 50 days. During screening, eligible subjects will complete an oral 13-C-spirulina breath
      test also known as the Gastric Emptying Breath Test (GEBT). During the treatment period,
      subjects will complete 4 overnight drug assessment visits (treatment arms) where they will
      receive a randomized single dose of study drug and the GEBT. Each overnight visit will be
      separated by approximately 7 days. At least 18 subjects will be randomized and complete all 4
      dosing arms (actual = 23 randomized subjects and 21 completing all 4 arms of the crossover).
