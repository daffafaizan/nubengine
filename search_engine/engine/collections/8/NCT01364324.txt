      malabsorption of anti-TB drugs in the gastrectomized patients. However, pharmacokinetics of
      recently used first line anti-TB drugs in the gastrectomized patients have not been well
      evaluated simultaneously. Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of
      gastrectomy on pharmacokinetic profile of first-line anti-TB drugs in patients with pulmonary
      TB through this study.
