      9 to 18 and Chinese speaking and allocate them into experimental and control group. The
      experimental group will receive a 15-minute hypnosis using virtual reality when they are
      experiencing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, sleep quality or pain. The control
      group will receive no intervention.
