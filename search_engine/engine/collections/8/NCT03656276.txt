    
      The ToPIC tool is a structured delivery of important treatment-related information. The
      oncologist remains entirely in charge of the information delivered (e.g. what are the
      treatment options, what are the potential benefits) and uses the ToPIC framework to organize
      the information and create a pen and paper diagram for the patient to assist in their
      processing and deliberation. The tool creates a forum for a clear presentation of options and
      facilitates a patient's ability to express their individual preferences.

      Oncologists are the intervention population and will be trained in how to use the ToPIC
      communication tool. Volunteer oncologists will be randomly assigned to immediate training or
      wait list control. Oncologists who are randomly assigned to the intervention group will
      receive training, and once they have demonstrated competence with the tool, they will begin
      using the tool with their patients. Data collection for any patient whom they present
      treatment options which include a clinical trial will be included for the primary analysis
      related to recruitment for clinical trials. This collection will begin once the oncologist,
      regardless of their assigned group, has signed consent and been randomized.
