      reverse cholesterol transport, inhibition of lipid oxidation and inflammatory cytokine
      secretion, endothelial repair, and antiapoptotic function, which all contribute to the
      regression of plague burden. Recent studies have shown that oxidative stress and chronic
      inflammation - both implicated in the process of diabetes - can contribute to an irreversible
      post-translational modification called carbamylation. Carbamylation levels reflect the burden
      of enhanced inflammation, oxidative stress, and renal impairment, and can serve as a
      biomarker of certain pathological conditions. Several clinical studies have demonstrated
      positive associations between cardiovascular risk, mortality, and serum carbamylation-derived
      product levels in the general population and particularly in patients with kidney failure.
      Increasing evidence also shows that carbamylated lipoprotein plays a pivotal role in
      atherosclerosis.18 However, most studies concerning carbamylation have been performed under a
      kidney disease background. Whether HDL particles in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) show enhanced carbamylation and whether this enhancement is associated with vascular
      complications remains unknown. Thus, in the present study, the investigators aim to test
      whether HDL experiences carbamylation in T2DM patients and investigated the pro-atherogenic
      effects of carbamylated HDL on endothelial-monocyte adhesion.
