      on enhancing infants' oral motor skills required for breastfeeding are needed. There is very
      limited evidence on early interventions aimed at maintaining rudimentary sucking skills
      needed for breastfeeding in this high risk population. The main objective of this study is to
      assess whether non-nutritive sucking on an emptied breast will enhance breast feeding
      performance in preterm infants.

      The target population will consist of clinically stable preterm infants born less born less
      than or equal to 34 weeks gestational age and whose mother's intention are to breastfeed.
      Infants will be randomized into the non-nutritive sucking on emptied breast or pacifier
      group. Both interventions will be administered by mothers. Time to transition to full oral
      feeding, breastfeeding acquisition at hospital discharge and breastfeeding duration at six
      months of age will be monitored.
