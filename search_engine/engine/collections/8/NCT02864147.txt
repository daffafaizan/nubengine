    
      The primary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To determine treatment efficacy defined as histologic regression to CIN 1 or less at
           weeks 20-24 (4 to 8 weeks after the end of imiquimod treatment) in the HPV Vaccine +
           Imiquimod group compared to control,

        -  To determine treatment efficacy defined as histologic regression to CIN 1 or less at
           weeks 20-24 (4 to 8 weeks after the end of imiquimod treatment) in the Imiquimod group
           compared to control.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To assess complete regression (i.e., histologic remission) at weeks 20-24 (4 to 8 weeks
           after the end of imiquimod treatment) in each group,

        -  To assess HPV clearance in each group,

        -  To assess treatment tolerability.

      In addition to the primary and secondary objectives of this study, there additional
      exploratory/correlative objectives. The exploratory/correlative objectives are as follows:

        -  To assess T cell infiltration in post-treatment cervical biopsies and endocervical
           cytobrush samples,

        -  To assess HPV16 E7 immunity in CD4/CD8 T cells.
