      period can enhance islet autograft survival and function in chronic pancreatitis patients who
      have total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation. This is a prospective, controlled,
      double-blind study. The primary endpoint will be area under the curve for the serum C-peptide
      level during the first 4 hours of an mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), normalized by the
      number of islet equivalents (IEQ)/kg at day 365Â±14 after the transplant.
