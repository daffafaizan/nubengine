    
      Background:

      The eukaryotic translation initiation factor - eIF4E - is a potent oncogene that is found to
      be dysregulated in approximately 30% of human cancers. Upregulation of eIF4E is an early
      event in colorectal cancer (CRC) and correlates with CRC progression. ISIS 183750 is a
      second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to inhibit the production of the
      human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) protein.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      To establish Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and establish safety for the combination of ISIS
      183750 and irinotecan in advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate Response Rate, Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) for
           the combination of ISIS 183750 and irinotecan in advanced irinotecan-refractory
           colorectal cancer.

        -  To perform correlative studies to evaluate the effect of eIF4E inhibition on relevant
           regulated proteins and immune cells.

        -  To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for ISIS 183750 in the
           absence and presence of irinotecan

        -  To characterize the plasma PK parameters for irinotecan in the presence of ISIS 183750

      Eligibility:

      -Adult patients with irinotecan-resistant colorectal cancer (or advanced solid tumor in phase
      I part).

      Design:

        -  This is a single-arm phase I/II study whereby all patients will receive the combination
           of ISIS 183750 and irinotecan. All cycles are 28 days.

        -  Cycle 1 only: ISIS 183750 will be administered intravenously on Cycle 1 Days 1, 3, 5, 8,
           15 and 22.

        -  Cycle 2 and beyond: ISIS 183750 will be administered as an intravenous infusion every
           week without break, i.e. Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients will be
           re-staged every 8 weeks.

        -  Irinotecan will be administered at a dose of 160mg/m^2 as an intravenous infusion every
           second week commencing on Day 15 of Cycle 1. The primary endpoint of the study will be
           to establish maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of ISIS 183750 and
           irinotecan in advanced solid tumors. The phase II portion of the study will be confined
           to irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer. Irinotecan-refractory will be defined as
           patients who have radiological evidence of disease progression whilst receiving
           irinotecan or within 3 months after completing it.

        -  Correlative studies will comprise: Mandatory pre- and post- dose biopsies for eIF4e
           messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein (IHC) analysis will be performed in the
           phase II portion of the study; Immune subsets; positron emission tomography (PET)
           responses (only in expansion cohort); Pharmacokinetic data regarding the interaction of
           irinotecan and ISIS183750 in 10-12 patients.
