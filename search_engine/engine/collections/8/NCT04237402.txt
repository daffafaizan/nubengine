      by binding to proteins, produce non-functional adducts inducing cutaneous aging. This
      mechanism is called "carbonyl stress".

      During pregnancy, estrogen increases massively, stimulates the whole body and prolongs the
      life of the hair (slower passage in telogen phase).

      After delivery, estrogen levels drop, resulting in a massive and simultaneous hair loss that
      should have "naturally" fallen earlier. In addition, birth is a stressful stage for most
      moms. This stress and excessive fatigue and possibly a return to work may also be responsible
      for hair loss.

      Is the carbonyl stress also present in the scalp and can it be one of the mechanisms involved
      in the occurrence of postpartum hair loss? To demonstrate this, samples of hair follicles are
      taken. The proteins are extracted from the samples and then assayed. The oxidized (carbonyl)
      proteins are labeled with specific fluorescent probes
