      The renin-angiotensin system is involved in the physiology of pregnancy in two ways.
      Circulating angiotensin II affects blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, and uteroplacental
      blood flow. Abnormalities in angiotensin II production rates in hypertensive pregnancy
      contribute to the hemodynamic changes seen in the disease. Additionally, there is a form of
      the renin-angiotensin system in kidney, ovary, and placenta whose function is regulated by
      prorenin. Prorenin, activated by a specific receptor, is involved in the regulation of
      steroid hormone biosynthesis and renal and uteroplacental blood flow.

      The study was conducted in response to a Request for Applications on Research on Hypertension
      in Pregnancy jointly released in 1986 by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and
      the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study was longitudinal in design. Measurements were made of glomerular filtration rate,
      renal plasma flow or uterine blood flow. To define first trimester changes, studies were
      conducted on in vitro fertilization and ovarian failure patients who had a broad spectrum of
      plasma prorenins. Since interrelated changes in renin and prostaglandins may participate in
      the pathogenesis of hypertensive pregnancy, RAAS, prostaglandins, and uteroplacental flow
      velocity profiles were monitored during a placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin in
      chronic hypertensives.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
