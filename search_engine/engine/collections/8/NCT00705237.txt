      studied using the light wire technology. This will be used as a guide for the surgeon to know
      when they are safely in the sinus by trans-illumination through the sinus wall prior to
      utilizing balloon dilation. Routine fluoroscopy will be used as well to verify the position
      of the wire, which is currently standard practice. The ease, time required, and accuracy of
      placement will be recorded for each case and compared to data previously collected when suing
      standard wire technology.
