      two-sequence,two-period, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study on loratadine
      formulation comparing loratadine 10 mg orally disintegrating tablets of Ohm Laboratories,
      Inc. (A subsidiary of Ranbaxy pharmaceuticals Inc. USA) with Claritin® Reditabs® 10 mg Tablet
      (containing loratadine 10 mg) of Schering- Plough Healthcare Product Inc, USA. in healthy,
      adult, male, human subjects under fed condition.

      A single oral dose of loratadine 10 mg orally disintegrating tablets was administered under
      low light condition during each period of the study under supervision of a trained medical
      officer.

      Subjects were instructed to completely dissolve the tablet on the tongue before swallowing
      the saliva and then, 240 mL of water was administered 30 seconds after drug administration.

      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical,
      serology parameters and urine analysis) at base line. Laboratory parameters of hematology and
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.

      A total of 80 subjects were randomized to receive single oral dose of Loratadine 10mg and
      Subjects were admitted in two groups of equal size. Group I: 1-40 Group II: 41-80 70 subjects
