2475. lupus erythematosus with fatal hemorrhage into the liver and lesionsresembling those of periarteritis nodosa and malignant hypertension.immunocytochemical observationsa firmly established case of lupus erythematosus with histologiccharacteristics of periarteritis nodosa and fatal hemorrhage is presented.immunocytochemical studies were done to explore the possibility of the vascularlesions being immunological in type.  by immuno-fluorescent techniquesy-globulin, human serum complement, albumin and fibrinogen were demonstrated inthe vascular lesions.  y-globulin in the renal glomeruli was associated onlywith complement.  the conclusion is that lupus erythematosus is primarily animmunological disease with complex auto-immune mechanisms operative.
