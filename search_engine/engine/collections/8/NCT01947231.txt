      addressing musculoskeletal pain and related functional deficits and the other to receive
      "usual care" manual PT which will be individualized to the patient's condition. Usual care
      will include techniques commonly used in clinical practice selected by the physical therapist
      after initial examination. After nine weeks of treatment, baseline measures will be
      re-evaluated. After conclusion of the first phase of the study, patients who were randomized
      to the "usual care" group will cross-over and receive GPR.
