    
      This study is composed of 3 phases: (1) A 24-month controlled treatment period (monthly
      treatment with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg, or sham injection) followed by (2) a
      12-month treatment period in which patients randomized to the sham group who had not
      discontinued from treatment (still masked) could choose to receive monthly ranibizumab 0.5 mg
      while the 2 ranibizumab treatment groups continued on the same treatment they received in the
      first 2 years. Patients who had not discontinued treatment by Month 36 were eligible to
      continue treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg as needed (pro re nata, PRN) in (3) an extension
      phase of the study for up to 2 more years, resulting in up to 5 years possible total
      treatment time for some patients.
