      cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death among
      patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Guideline documents for the treatment
      of heart failure have recommended defibrillator placement for patients with symptomatic heart
      failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¤ 35%. Despite these recommendations,
      observational studies have documented low ICD utilization among patients with heart failure.
      Recent studies have demonstrated patient specific characteristics that are associated with
      low ICD utilization (advanced age, female gender, black race, heart failure etiology,
      uninsured patients and patients cared for by general practitioners). Whether patient
      knowledge or attitudes regarding defibrillator therapy influence the rate of defibrillator
      placement is unknown. By carefully surveying populations of patients with systolic heart
      failure, we aim to further the understanding of the patient factors that determine why an ICD
      may or may not be used in the appropriate clinical setting. Additionally, 150 physicians will
      be enrolled into the study for the purpose of measuring attitudes and beliefs regarding
      defibrillator treatment for the physicians providing care to the patients in the study.
