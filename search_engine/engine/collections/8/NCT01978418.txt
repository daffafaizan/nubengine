      causes delayed clearance of lung fluid and thereby contributes to the risk for development of
      transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) in term infants born by Caesarean section (CS). The
      aim of this study is to evaluate whether the respiratory status, measured by a transthoracic
      ultrasound method and lung compliance, of newborns infants born by CS can be improved by
      inhaled salbutamol at 30-60 minutes of age. 62 infants will be included and randomized to
      receive salbutamol or placebo-inhalations in a double-blind manner.
