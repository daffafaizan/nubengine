      Syndrome. Previous coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS) led to pulmonary fibrosis in up to
      30%. Prospective evaluation of lung abnormalities and pulmonary fibrosis after COVID-19
      infection is crucial as novel treatments against lung fibrosis of different etiologies are
      available. No data on pulmonary longterm effects in COVID-19 survivors are currently
      available. The nation-wide Swiss COVID-19 lung group establishes a meticulously characterized
      prospective cohort study on pulmonary long-term sequela of patients living in Switzerland.
