    
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups (arm A or Arm B). Arm A will
      receive 1.25mg of Premarin once daily and arm B will receive 1.25mg of Premarin three times a
      day. Patients will also receive coumadin daily to help prevent thromboembolic disease.

      After reviewing the first 30 patients on Arm A, it was determined that arm A (low dose
      Premarin) was not effective. Arm A was then closed and patients on Arm A were given the
      choice to switch to Arm B.

      Treatment will continue until there is evidence of disease progression or unacceptable side
      effects.

      Every 4 weeks while receiving Premarin, a physical exam and blood work will be performed.
      Every 12 weeks a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and a bone scan will be performed.

      Patients will also be encouraged to undergo standard preventative breast irradiation prior to
      starting Premarin or up to 4 weeks after starting treatment.
