    
      Standard of care includes completion of a sexual dysfunctional questionnaire at every visit.
      This study will collect information from the questionnaires and office visit and follow the
      patient for outcomes of successful or non successful treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to collect and analyze data on the characteristics of women who
      present with sexual dysfunction, to evaluate what risk factors contribute to sexual
      dysfunction and to evaluate what factors contribute to successful treatment of sexual
      dysfunction.

      Upon a visit to the office participants will complete the Female Sexual Function Index
      (FSFI), this is standard of care for all patients. Research related procedures include:
      Review of questionnaires and collecting data from medical records regarding medical history,
      and treatment outcomes. If a participant does not return to the office for a follow up visit
      (or final visit) the final questionnaire will be sent by their preference (e-mail, phone, or
      mail) noted in the consent form.

      Participates will also be given the option of participating in a "future storage of data".
      Future testing will be in the area of female sexual dysfunction. Data will be identified by a
      code number and only the research staff at Saint Louis University will have access to the
      data.
