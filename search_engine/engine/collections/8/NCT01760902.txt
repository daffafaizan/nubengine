    
      A diet and physical activity intervention was developed to provide knowledge and skills to
      facilitate health behavior change in African-American Baptist Church members in South
      Carolina and promote healthy lifestyles to reduce colon cancer disparities. The intervention
      entitled, "H.E.A.L.S. (Healthy Eating and Active Living in the Spirit)" was used to train
      church education teams to deliver church and community educational activities promoting a
      diet rich in fruits and vegetables and an active lifestyle. The training focused leadership
      and empowerment skills to enable church lay leaders to become Church Education Teams (CETs) .
      The educational activities made it easier for church and community members to eat more fruits
      and vegetables, reduce fat intake, increase physical activity, and increase dietary intake of
      anti-inflammatory foods associated with colon cancer risk.
