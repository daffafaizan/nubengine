      or cervical spine sprain strain can be seriously debilitating. Currently available treatment
      options such as pain relief medication, ice pack, massage, physical therapy and chiropractic
      are typically of limited effectiveness. More permanent options such as surgery are invasive
      with long recovery periods and side-effects and complications of their own. Low level laser
      light therapy, with its proven anti-inflammatory ability, offers a simple non-invasive option
      for the reduction of chronic neck and shoulder pain.
