      I. Estimate the efficacy of GDC-0449 (vismodegib) treatment for pediatric patients with
      recurrent or refractory medulloblastoma, as measured by the sustained objective response
      rates for patients without (stratum A) and with (stratum B) evidence of activation of
      Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in their tumors.

      II. Characterize the pharmacokinetics (plasma) of GDC-0449 in children/adolescents with
      refractory medulloblastoma.

      III. To document pathologic and genomic methods to identify medulloblastomas with activation
      of the Hh signaling pathway.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Document and describe toxicities associated with GDC-0449 administered on a daily
      schedule.

      II. Estimate the duration of objective response and progression-free survival (PFS).

      III. Characterize the pharmacokinetics (cerebrospinal fluid) of GDC-0449 in
      children/adolescents with refractory medulloblastoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to evidence of
      activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway in their tumors (without vs with vs unknown).

      Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and
      other correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every other month for up to 12
      months.
