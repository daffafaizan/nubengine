      gland cancer treated with paclitaxel (Taxol, TAX) by 3-hour infusion. II. Describe the
      toxicity of TAX in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers), Taxol, TAX, NSC-125973.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 32 patients/histology will be entered. If no response is observed in
      the first 14 patients in a particular histology, accrual to that group will close; if after
      18 months annual accrual is less than 10 patients/histology, accrual to that group may close.
