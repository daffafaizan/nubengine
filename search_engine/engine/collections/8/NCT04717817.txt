      physiotherapy or daily inspiratory muscle training for a period of 2-3 weeks. One therapy
      session a week is supervised by a physiotherapist in the IMT group. Post-operative
      physiotherapy is standardized. Pulmonary function and clinical status are evaluated
      pre-operatively, and during the early post-operative phase, approximately on the 3th and 6th
      post-operative day, or when necessary. The occurrence of postopercenterative pulmonary
      complications is determined using a validated scale, the Melbourne group scale, based on
      clinical status, chest x-ray and blood tests. Frailty is defined based on the Fried criteria.
      Two Belgian hospitals are involved in this study: the University Hospital Brussels and the
      Jessa Hospital (Hasselt), the latter mainly focussing on patients referred for minimal
      invasive heart surgery (minimally invasive-aortic valve replacement (mini-AVR) and Endoscopic
      - Atraumatic Coronary Artery Bypass (endo-ACAB).
