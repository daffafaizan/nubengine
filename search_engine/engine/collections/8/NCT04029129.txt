      adverse health effects. There is growing evidence that ultrafine particles (UFP, <100 nm in
      diameter), which are elevated near major roads and highways, contribute to such risks. We
      assessed the efficacy of high efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filtration and
      building envelope adjustment at reducing exposure to and health effects of air pollution next
      to major highways.

      We used a randomized three-period crossover trial design to assign 77 participants (aged
      40-75 and without diagnosis of hypertension) to three two-hour exposure sessions. Sessions
      were conducted in one of two rooms immediately adjacent to highways. High, medium and low
      exposures were attained by varying the degree of air exchange and amount of HEPA filtration
      in the room. During high exposure sessions, the room was ventilated with outdoor air and no
      filtration was used. During low exposure sessions, leakage of outdoor air into the room was
      minimized and HEPA filtration was maximized. During medium exposure sessions, a moderate
      amount of HEPA filtration was used (less than half of that used in low sessions). Indoor
      particle number and black carbon (BC) concentrations (i.e., markers of traffic-related air
      pollution) were monitored continuously.

      During each session participants sat quietly and wore noise-cancelling headphones, while
      their BP was monitored every ten minutes using an ambulatory BP monitor. We monitored pulse
      and oxygen saturation continuously.
