        -  Determine the clinical efficacy of oblimersen, thalidomide, and dexamethasone, in terms
           of complete and partial response rates, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
           myeloma.

        -  Determine the time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate disease response (clinical outcome) with changes in Bcl-2 levels in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction therapy comprising oblimersen IV continuously on days
      1-7, 22-28, and 43-49, oral dexamethasone on days 4-7, 25-28, and 46-49, and oral thalidomide
      daily beginning on day 4. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with stable disease after induction therapy receive maintenance therapy comprising
      oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-7, oral dexamethasone on days 4-7, and oral thalidomide
      daily. Courses repeat every 35 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.
