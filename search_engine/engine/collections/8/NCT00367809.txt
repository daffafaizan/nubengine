      interactions, and may reduce adherence by complicating an already challenging medication
      regimen. In contrast, mind-body based complementary therapies may be ideal to treat
      distressing symptoms and negative emotions after transplantation. Our long-range objective is
      to develop evidence-based recommendations for non-pharmacologic strategies that provide
      symptom relief to transplant recipients, and are safe, practical and cost-effective.

      Potential participants are recruited by mail, screening by clinic staff and provider
      referrals. Interested persons are screened by telephone and mailed informational study
      brochures. Informed consent is conducted by face-to-face interview, where a diagram of the
      study design is used to explain the 2-stage randomization and study requirements.
