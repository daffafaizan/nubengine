    
      The overall goal is to study the effectiveness of SPECT imaging prostate cancer and breast
      cancer patients Using technetium-99m labeled RM26.

      Phase I of the study:

      Biodistribution of 99mTc-RM26 in patients with prostate cancer and breast cancer.

      The main objectives of the study:

        1. To evaluate the distribution of 99mTc-RM26 in normal tissues and tumors in patients with
           prostate cancer and breast cancer at different time intervals.

        2. To evaluate dosimetry of 99mTc-RM26 based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug
           after a single intravenous administration.

        3. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug 99mTc-RM26 after a single
           intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.

      Additional research tasks:

      1. To conduct a comparative analysis of the diagnostic information obtained in the
      visualization of prostate cancer and breast cancer by SPECT using 99mTc-RM26 with data
      obtained by CT and/or MRI and/or ultrasound examination and immunohistochemical (IHC)
      research of postoperative material.

      Methodology:

      Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of
      the labeled tracer.
