    
      Radioimmunotherapy represents a significant advance over unlabeled immunotherapy for the
      treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The radiobiological effects
      associated with Yt90-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) include the induction of
      apoptosis and cell-cycle redistribution.

      The response rate tend to be higher in patients who have been treated with fewer prior
      therapies and Yt90-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan may be suitable for use early in the course
      of therapy.

      Yt90-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan has less non hematologic toxicity than chemotherapy, with
      only minimal alopecia, mucositis, nausea, or vomiting, and a lower incidence of infections.

      Yt90-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen is routinely and safely given in an outpatient
      setting and is completed in 7-9 days and is thus more convenient to be used.
