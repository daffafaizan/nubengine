      I. To provide comprehensive long-term follow-up care to prostate cancer survivors at the City
      of Hope who underwent definitive surgical therapy.

      II. To use the information obtained from follow-up of prostate cancer survivors who underwent
      definitive surgical therapy to serve as a resource that will help answer clinical questions,
      generate and test hypotheses, describe the incidence of long-term complications, and
      facilitate future studies focusing on interventions for long-term complications of prostate
      cancer and its therapy.

      III. To use the information gained from follow-up of prostate cancer survivors who underwent
      definitive surgical therapy to describe health-related quality of life (HRQL) concerns and to
      serve as a resource to facilitate future studies focusing on interventions to improve health
      status and HRQL in prostate cancer survivors.
