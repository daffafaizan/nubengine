      acute/chronic hospitalization, daycare centers (adolescents, adults, and the elderly),
      community mental rehabilitation institutions, psychiatric nursing home, and outpatient
      assessment/treatments. OT provides holistic and continuous mental rehabilitation services at
      each stage of mental health care. During the acute hospitalization and based on the Model of
      Human Occupation (MOHO) model, the occupational therapist provides daily activities to assist
      acute patients with mental illness to develop occupation adaptation to enable and prepare for
      discharge.

      However, the lack of a client-centered OT service model limits the interpretation of the
      treatment effect and the process of change. This will seriously affect the integrity and
      continuity of OT services and will limit the development of OT professions. Thus, the purpose
      of the study is to develop and validate Client-centered Occupational Therapy Service at
      Taipei City Psychiatric Center (OT@tcpc) service model to assist clinicians to provide and
      integrate comprehensive OT services.

      This project consists of 2 stages. First, based on the MOHO model we use 5 stages with 6
      weeks program to develop the OT@tcpc service model. Second, validate the to indicate the
      occupation identity and competence to validate the OT@tcpc service model. We will recruit 70
      inpatients with schizophrenia and divided into intervention group, based on MOHO theory, and
      control group.
