      bovine bone grafting material (Cerabone® 1-2 mm, Botiss Biomaterials GmbH). In ten patients
      randomly selected (control sties), a native collagen membrane made of porcine dermis
      (Collprotect®, Botiss Biomaterials GmbH) will be placed on the antrostomy. In ten patients of
      the test group, the antrostomy will be left without the membrane. The flaps will be sutured
      and anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics will be administrated to the patients. The
      sutures will be removed after 7 days.

      CBCTs will be taken for all patients before surgery (T0), after 1 week from sinus floor
      augmentation (T1) and after 9 months of healing (T2) and evaluation of dimensional variations
      over time of soft and hard tissues will be performed.
