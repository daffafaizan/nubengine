    
      Each subject will undergo a Lapidus Arthrodesis combined with a supinating reduction
      technique.

      The subjects will undergo 3 weight-bearing CBCT scans of their foot and ankle, one
      pre-arthrodesis, one two weeks post-arthrodesis, and one 12 weeks post-arthrodesis. These
      scans will be used to determine change in frontal plane rotation of the 1st metatarsal from
      pre to post arthrodesis of the 1st TMT joint, change in angular/positional alignment of the
      1st TMT joint using various measurements (1-2 IMA, Meary's Angle, HVA, MAA, Sesamoid
      Position, and Sesamoid Frontal Plane Rotation), maintenance of correction of the 1st TMT
      joint, and union status.

      The subjects will also complete three surveys, the Pain and Satisfaction Survey, the AOFAS
      Hallux MTP-IP Scale, and the FAOS Foot and Ankle Survey, at the Pre-Operative Visit, 2 Week
      Visit (post-op), 6 Week Visit (post-op), and 12 Week Visit (post-op). Furthermore, the
      subjects will be asked about their willingness to undergo the procedure again at the 12 Week
      Visit (post-op). All of these scores will be considered in the secondary objectives.

      Aside from the study activities listed above, all procedures, visits, and instructions for
      the subject are to follow the standard of care.
