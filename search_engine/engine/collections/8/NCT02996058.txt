      and interventions. The ideal sedative agent for use in critically ill children has to be
      effective and short-acting, of rapid onset of action, lacks active metabolites, does not
      accumulate in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, has minimal to no cardiovascular or
      respiratory adverse effects, and has few drug interactions.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective Î±2-agonist with hypnotic, analgesic, and anxiolytic
      properties. Despite off-label administration, dexmedetomidine has found a niche in critically
      ill mechanically ventilated neonates and infants because of its minimal effects on
      respiratory function at sedative doses, facilitating early extubation and fast-track
      postoperative care.

      The only FDA approved indication of dexmedetomidine is sedation of intubated mechanically
      ventilated adults for less than 24h. However, the literature is full of many research studies
      that investigated the use off-lable use of dexmedetomidine for sedation more than 24h in both
      adult and pediatric population and proved its safety and effectiveness.

      The aim of this study will be to investigate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine in
      two different doses in sedation for critically ill mechanically ventilated infants with
      respiratory failure for 72h duration.
