      child has not eaten enough, or how to get them to eat more. There is a need to understand the
      child characteristics that predispose to undereating and the how these operate, in order to
      design more effective treatment and prevention programmes. The Glasgow feeding clinic (GFC)
      looks after a range of children with severe feeding problems who commonly have low appetite
      and extreme thinness. The investigators want to find out if these children are more likely to
      carry genetic markers of thinness.

      The investigators will invite up to 60 families to complete a standardised online
      questionnaire (ICFET) about their child's eating behaviour and collect a saliva sample from
      their child, sent by post. The investigators will identify how many genetic markers for
      thinness each carries and relate this to their ICFET appetite scores and existing growth
      measurements as well as their feeding history.
