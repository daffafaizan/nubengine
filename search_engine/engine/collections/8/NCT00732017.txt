      was identified. The studies had showed that HVPC had some advantages for controlling edema in
      animals but there are not yet conclusive results on the effect of this intervention in
      humans.For this reason, we proposed a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial
      with three groups of intervention. In our study compared the effects of standard physical
      therapy treatment with the HVPC with negative and positive polarity.
