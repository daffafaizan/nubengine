        -  Evaluate the ability of the microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay to predict the outcome of
           patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma treated with
           first-line chemotherapy.

        -  Evaluate the ability of the MiCK assay to guide chemotherapy in a third-line, refractory
           treatment setting (exclusive of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy (no [stratum I] vs yes
      [stratum II]).

      Tumor tissue and/or effusion specimens are collected at baseline. Specimens are examined by
      the microculture kinetic (MiCK) assay and immunocytochemical or flow cytometry assay.

      MiCK assay results do not influence treatment for stratum I patients. Stratum II patients may
      receive treatment based on MiCK assay results for tumor sensitivity to specific chemotherapy
      drugs.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
