    
      Patients with diagnosis of LGEA(gap distance>3.5cm) will be accepted to the program.

      After accepted to our center, the patients will feed by gastrostomy tube to keep nutritional
      status remain well controlled. Continuous suction in the upper pouch will be applied to avoid
      aspiration pneumonia.

      We will design a bouginage with baroreceptor. Then the stress function will be performed as
      following steps. The designed bouginage will be inserted into the upper esophagus pouch
      through oral cavity with a certain downward longitudinal force to increase esophageal length
      by tissue stretch and growth, it will be performed 10-15 minutes each time once/twice a day.
      While the elongation of distal pouch will be achieved via the gastrostomy using the same
      bouginage to give upward pressure, the program will be operated under X-ray firstly to avoid
      injury or false passage formation,it can be performed in the ward thereafter. The gap length
      and the diameter of the pouch will be evaluated every 1-2 weeks. During the elongation
      period, continuous upper pouch suctioning and nutritional support were maintained.

      When the gap distance is short enough，the method of surgery will be decided，including
      end-to-end anastomosis、Livadites、flip-flap and choice of thoracoscopy use. The purpose of the
      program is to achieve the exact management and treatment for patients with LGEA and help
      promoting the use of the new technology.
