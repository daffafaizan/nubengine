    
      Bronchiectasis is an airway disease with many etiologies characterized pathologically by the
      abnormal permanent dilatation of bronchi, caused mainly by the perpetuation of inflammatory
      processes induced by frequent episodes of bacterial infections, with consequent change in the
      ciliated epithelial lining and compromising the effectiveness of mucociliary clearance that
      can favor the hypersecretive state found in these patients.

      In addition to drug therapy or surgical treatment, patients with bronchiectasis also have
      physiotherapy, which is an important part in treatment. The patients present impaired mucus
      transport, and can enjoy the benefits provided by respiratory therapy, which features
      intended to increase the removal of airway secretions and thus reduce the obstruction to
      improve ventilation and oxygenation.

      One of the instruments commonly used in respiratory therapy is the Flutter Â® VRP1 (VarioRaw
      SA, Switzerland), which is a simple equipment, small, similar to a pipe that combines two
      techniques: positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and high-frequency oscillations.

      Some previous studies have shown beneficial effects after use of this device in patients with
      bronchiectasis. However, it is unclear whether the mechanism of action is related to the
      combination of PEP and the techniques of high frequency oscillation, or just one of those
      components.
