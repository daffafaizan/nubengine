      surgical reduction and stable osteosynthesis. Good long-term results have been reported in
      these patients. At present, the mobilisation of these patients after surgery is generally
      restricted for several weeks ranging from 6-12 weeks touch-down- or non-weight-bearing with
      no uniform protocol. However there is no scientific evidence for limiting post operative
      weight-bearing. Accordingly the need of studies on weight-bearing surrounding periarticular
      fractures has been advocated.

      Acetabular fractures in the elderly population are becoming more common and pose significant
      challenges for treatment including postoperative rehabilitation. Our aim is to investigate if
      patients benefit of a more liberal weight-bearing regime postoperatively. The primary outcome
      is measured at 1 year, secondary outcomes are followed up to 10 years postoperatively
