      risk stratification tools, e.g. Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), only have a moderate
      ability to identify these patients. International guidelines, like Canadian Cardiovascular
      Society on perioperative cardiovascular risk assessment, advocate that all patients 45 yrs
      and older or patients >18y rs who have significant cardiovascular disease and who are coming
      for intermediate to high-risk surgery, should get natriuretic peptide (NP) testing. This is
      because raised preoperative B-type natriuretic peptides have a strong association with
      postoperative cardiac complications according to observational studies and meta-analyses.

      However, in these patients with significant cardiovascular disease coming for intermediate to
      high-risk surgery it is unknown how many patients will actually have raised B-type
      natriuretic peptides. That is, which group of patients have an even higher risk in this
      already high-risk group. Natriuretic peptide (NP) testing is also expensive.

      Further identification of patients that need NP testing will reduce costs and focus efforts
      on those patients who really need it.
