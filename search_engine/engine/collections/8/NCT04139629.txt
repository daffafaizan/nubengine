    
      At the first day of stimulation blood analyses for immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A
      (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) to major chlamydial antigens (anti-C.trachomatis), major
      outer membrane protein (MOMP) and plasmid-encoded protein (pgp3) will be performed for
      patients found eligible for the study.

      According to the result of chlamydial antibody test (CAT) participants will be divided into
      two groups: group A - women with at least one of antibodies detected (CAT+); Group B -
      seronegative subjects (CAT-).

      Women of both groups will undergo a conventional ovarian stimulation (COS) with GnRH
      antagonist and daily gonadotropin administration at the dose of 150-300 international unit
      (IU).

      Retrieved oocytes following fertilization (conventional IVF or ICSI) will be cultured to Day
      3-5 in vitro; ultrasound guided single or double embryo transfer will be performed; remaining
      embryos of eligible quality will be vitrified.

      Patients will be followed up to live birth. Frozen/thawed embryo transfers (FET) will be
      performed until at least one live birth (â‰¥20 weeks of gestation) occurred or all embryos
      resulting from the mentioned assisted ovarian stimulation were used.
