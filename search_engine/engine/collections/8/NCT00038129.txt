      unreamed nail will be randomized via telephone to one of the two groups. These patients then
      will be followed for a year with clinical, as well as subjective, outcome follow-up
      questionnaires. Time to healing, as well as repeat interventions and adverse events, will be
      tracked. The rationale for doing a large sample size multi-center trial is the hope that a
      clear answer to whether or not one of these two methods is significantly better than the
      other will become apparent and thus aid surgeons in making a more informed operative
      treatment choice.
