    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if blood flow restriction (BFR) therapy is superior
      at increasing strength of the shoulder (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, posterior deltoid, and
      middle deltoid) and increasing tendon size of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus (as
      determined by diagnostic ultrasound) while performing the sidelying external rotation
      exercise compared to those who only perform the sideyling external rotation exercise without
      BFR.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: exercise with BFR or exercise
      alone. Recruitment will be a sample of convenience consisting of healthy adults (age range 22
      to 45). Subjects will perform the sidelying external rotation exercise 2 times a week for an
      8 week period.
