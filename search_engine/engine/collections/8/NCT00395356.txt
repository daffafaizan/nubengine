      increased risk of coronary heart disease (CAD). It is presently unclear as to the magnitude
      of weight loss needed to accrue metabolic benefits. Despite the effectiveness of weight loss
      to reduce obesity levels, studies have shown that only minor decreases in body weight (5-10%)
      are needed to clinically improve CAD risk factors. Our data suggested that a 10% reduction in
      body weight is as effective in improving the metabolic profile as a 20% decrease in body
      weight. Thus, the question are : " Is it possible to further improve the metabolic profile
      over that 5-10% weight loss threshold?" and "Could several 5-10% body weight loss
      (intermittent weight loss approach) have additive effects on the metabolic profile?". We
      would like to follow-up on these observation to better understand 1) the association between
      weight loss and improvements in the metabolic profile and 2) why minor decreases in body
      composition and body fat distribution are as effective as more important reduction.
