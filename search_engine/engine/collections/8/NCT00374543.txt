      pharmacotherapy strategy for the treatment of comorbid generalized anxiety (or any comorbid
      anxiety) in patients with bipolar disorder. Our hypotheses are:

        1. Ziprasidone flexibly dosed from 40 to 160 mg/day will reduce anxiety symptoms
           significantly more than placebo in patients with bipolar disorder who have a full or
           subsyndromal diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

        2. Ziprasidone will be well tolerated in patients with generalized anxiety based on the
           incidence of treatment emergent adverse effects during 8 weeks of therapy, and based on
           a lack of worsening of bipolar depression, mania or hypomania compared to placebo.

        3. Treatment with ziprasidone will have a significantly greater positive impact on measures
           of quality of life and resilience than placebo.
