      satisfactorily decontaminated the silicone mask as measured by viral culture. The timing to
      eradicate bacteria was 60 minutes longer due to the tolerability of the bacteria .70% alcohol
      effectively decontaminate the virus and bacteria deposited on the masks and filters. Good
      level of fit can be maintained following UVC treatment. The tensile strength of the strap was
      retained over multiple decontamination cycles using UVC and dry heat upto 60 cycles.Given the
      efficacy of the disinfection by UVC and 70 % alcohol ,these types of decontamination method
      could potentially be used for the new type of silicone masks half-piece respirator in the
      setting of a crisis with inadequate supplies of PPE.
