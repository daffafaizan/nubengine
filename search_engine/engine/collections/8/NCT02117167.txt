    
      Screening phase:

      New frozen biopsy or an archived frozen sample or ctDNA sample will be sent to the genomic
      platforms for DNA extraction and genomic analysis (DNA microarrays and Next generation
      sequencing).

      Patients can be considered as pre-eligible for the targeted substudy 1 randomisation phase
      when both following mandatory conditions have been met : stable or responding disease has
      been observed after 4 cycles of chemotherapy (investigator judgment) and targetable
      alteration has been identified by the Molecular tumor board (MTB).

      If not eligible for the substudy 1 randomisation phase, patients can be considered as
      pre-eligible for the immune substudy 2 randomization phase when both following mandatory
      conditions are met: stable or responding disease (investigator judgment) is observed after 4
      cycles of a platinum-based chemotherapy AND not eligible to randomization in the substudy 1
      (because patient had no targetable alteration identified by the Molecular Tumor Board, or
      failed to have a genomic profile for the tumor [low tumor cells percentage, technical issue
      during genomic analysis, etc.], or a non-inclusion criteria that precluded entry into the
      substudy 1)

      Randomization phase:

      The mandatory post-chemotherapy 28-day wash-out period following cycle 4 of chemotherapy will
      provide time to achieve all the required tests and examinations.

      The randomization program will allocate the following treatments with a 2:1 ratio in favor of
      Arm A of the considered substudy:

      Substudy 1 : targeted therapies versus standard maintenance therapy

        -  Arm A1 / targeted arm: targeted maintenance from a list of 6 targeted drugs guided by
           the genomic analysis, or

        -  Arm B1 / standard arm : standard maintenance (pemetrexed in non-squamous and standard
           practice in squamous NSCLC).

      Substudy 2 : immunotherapy versus standard maintenance therapy

        -  Arm A2 / immunotherapy maintenance arm: MEDI4736 or

        -  Arm B2 / standard arm : standard maintenance (pemetrexed in non-squamous and standard
           practice in squamous NSCLC).
