      to evaluate the safety, tolerability, EEG effects, and preliminary efficacy of two fixed oral
      doses of evenamide of 7.5 mg and 15 mg bid (15 and 30 mg/day) in outpatients with chronic
      schizophrenia who are receiving treatment at constant doses of one of the following atypical
      antipsychotics: aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, paliperidone or risperidone.
