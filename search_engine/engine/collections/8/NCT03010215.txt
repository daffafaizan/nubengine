      January 2010 and September 2016. Clinical evaluation was assessed pre-operatively, as well as
      at 3 months after surgery and at final follow-up, using the American Orthopaedic Foot and
      Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Scale. The recurrence of the
      ulcers and complications were recorded. All the ulcers were evaluated with the University of
      Texas Diabetic Wound Classification. We used the radiological Maestro's criteria to evaluated
      the radiographs before and after the operation. Also, the bridging bone/callus formation was
      evaluated at the different radiographic follow-ups, while the articular surface congruency.
      The global disability was evaluated with the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the
      satisfaction's level with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Statistical analysis was carried
      out using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
