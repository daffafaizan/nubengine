      approach. By soft manual palpation of the craniosacral and fascia system sensory, motor,
      cognitive, and emotional processes can be influenced. In the prevention and treatment of
      chronic pain syndromes Craniosacral Therapy is demonstrated to be effective in clinical
      practice and quite a few scientific trials. But yet there are no randomized controlled
      studies concerning to chronic neck pain. So the aim of this study is to investigate whether a
      total of 8 CST units of 45 minutes will be effective in patients suffering from chronic
      nonspecific neck pain in contrast to sham therapy of the same extent. The prospective study
      design includes measurement points at baseline, post treatment, and 3 months follow-up.
