      and paclitaxel plus/minus daily oral OSI-774 in patients with potentially resectable NSCLC
      that is stage IIIA and IIIB (T4 satellite nodules or invasion into T4 structures but no
      malignant effusion.) N3 disease is excluded. Patients will be required to have pathologically
      demonstrated N2 disease via mediastinoscopy. Forty patients will be treated with 3 courses of
      chemotherapy followed by surgery. Ten of these patients will be randomized to chemotherapy
      alone and 30 patients to chemotherapy plus OSI-774. The 10 patients will serve as a
      chemotherapy alone control for molecular endpoint analysis. OSI-774 will be stopped the night
      before surgery. At the time of surgery, pathologic response will be determined. Following
      surgery, patients will be treated with consolidation radiation therapy if there are positive
      margins or N2 lymph nodes at the time of resection. Patients who have no N2 disease at
      surgery will have the option of consolidation radiation therapy but will not be required to
      have it done. Patients not able to tolerate radiation even if they have N2 disease or
      positive margins at surgery may continue on this study. This will be followed by maintenance
      OSI-774 for patients from both arms of the study. OSI-774 will be continued as maintenance to
      a maximum of 2 years following surgery. Tissue for molecular studies will be obtained
      pretreatment either at the time of diagnostic biopsy or mediastinoscopy. Post-treatment
      tissue will be obtained at the time of surgery. This tissue will be assayed for defined
      molecular endpoints using immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation and mRNA expression
      analysis. Blood, urine, hair follicles, and skin samples will also be collected from patients
      who consent to provide these.
