    
      This is an optional substudy of a multi-centre, parallel-group, three-arm randomized
      controlled trial - ENTAiER trial - to compare the changes in cardiovascular and sleep quality
      parameters under Eurythmy Therapy and Tai Chi in comparison to Standard Care in chronically
      ill elderly patients with increased risk of falling (see DRKS-ID: DRKS00016609). Subjects who
      consent to enroll in ENTAiER will be asked to participate in this substudy. The main focus of
      this substudy is on assessing the effects of Tai Chi and Eurythmy on the vegetative nervous
      system by measuring various parameters of heart rate variability and pulse wave analysis. In
      addition, the effects on sleep quality will be assessed. Participants of the substudy will
      undergo a measurement of heart rate variability with a long-term-ECG (Bittium Faros 360 TM),
      a pulse wave analysis, recorded with a vital function monitor (VitaGuardÂ® 3100 monitor,
      getemed, Germany), and a blood pressure measurement and they fill in a sleep quality
      questionnaire (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI) at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12
      months.
