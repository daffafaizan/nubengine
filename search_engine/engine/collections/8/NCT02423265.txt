      minimum of 2 conventional anti-anginal agents in patients with chronic total occlusions would
      be required. To be sufficiently powered, this would require a significant number of patients
      recruited in a multi-center trial. This study is an initial pilot study with inactive
      placebo, not addition of a conventional anti-anginal agent, as the control using MRI imaging
      data as the primary end-point.
