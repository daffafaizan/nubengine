      lavage volume in the middle lobe and the lower lobe of critical patients by exploring the
      differences between the concentration of alveolar proteins among BALF samples of every
      participant. Several BALF samples are seperately collected from every single participant
      through sequential lavage(an initial 20 ml saline lavage at main bronchus and 5 aliquots of
      20 ml saline lavage at the subsegment of the right middle lobe or 6 aliquots of 20 ml saline
      lavage at the lower lobe) . The concentration of Alveolar proteins including Surfactant
      protein B (SP-B), Surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Human typeⅠprotein (HTⅠ-56) will be
      determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Meanwhile, the amount of living
      cells as well as the proportion of squamous cells and columnar cells in BALF samples will be
      counted. Secondly, to confirm the optimal lavage volume through quantitative bacterial
      culture of BALF and sputum samples of participants. And BALF samples will also be tested by
      next generation sequencing（NGS） to identify microorganism. Thirdly, to observe the effect of
      BAL on respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The Vital signs, arterial gas analysis,
      ventilator parameters and respiratory mechanical parameters of patients before and within 24
      hours after the BAL procedure will be recorded.
