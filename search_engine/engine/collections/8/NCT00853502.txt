      shown to persist even after weight gain. Peak bone mass accrual occurs during the adolescent
      years, and a disruption in this critical process increases the risk for developing persistent
      deficits in bone density, and possibly increased fracture risk. Multiple variables contribute
      to the bone mass accrual process in puberty including adequate levels of sex hormones and
      puberty specific changes in levels of these hormones. Teenage boys with anorexia nervosa have
      lower bone density than normal weight boys of comparable maturity, and also have decreased
      levels of testosterone, as well as estradiol, when compared with healthy controls. Although
      testosterone is an important predictor of bone density in males with anorexia nervosa, the
      effect of testosterone replacement on bone mass accrual and bone microarchitecture in
      hypogonadal teenage boys and young adult men with anorexia nervosa is unknown. We hypothesize
      both bone mass and bone microarchitecture are abnormal in anorexia nervosa and that
      testosterone replacement in adolescent males with anorexia nervosa will improve both bone
      mass and microarchitecture.
