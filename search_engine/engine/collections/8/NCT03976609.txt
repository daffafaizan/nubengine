      the orthodontic treatment, being able to improve the maxillary transverse dimension, that is
      an essential condition for alveolar bone grafting. The primary aim of the secondary graft
      surgery is to restore the function and structure of the maxillary arch at the cleft side,
      providing support to arch width, minimizing its transverse collapse. However, since RME exert
      heavy forces to separate the two maxillary helves, it may significantly widen the alveolar
      cleft defect, possibly compromising bone graft success.

      Moreover, RME has an important impact on the geometry and function of the nasal cavity,
      providing a lateral displacement of the walls and facilitating the airflow through the upper
      airways. These effects are very important to CLP patients, since they usually present reduced
      upper airway dimensions, adenoid hypertrophy, sleep disorders, oral breathing, and a marked
      nasal septal deviation. The nasal septal deviation is one of the major causes of nasal
      obstruction in non-cleft patients, and often results in blocking of the nasolacrimal ducts,
      sinusitis, ear infections and mouth breathing. However, nasal septum deviation in CLP
      patients commonly persists even after surgical repair of the cleft, leading to a chronic
      obstruction of the air passage, until the septorhinoplasty, at the age of 14-18 years.

      Each expander was cemented with a fluoride releasing cement, and the activation regimen was
      established at 2 turns/day until the tip of the lingual cusps of the maxillary teeth touched
      the tips of the buccal cusps of the mandibular teeth. After the 3-month retention period, the
      expander was removed, and a post-expansion CBCT scanning (T1) was acquired for adequate
      secondary bone graft surgical planning.
