    
      Elimination of cariogenic bacteria is to be determined in this study - Mutans streptococci,
      Lactobacillus spp. and Actinomyces spp.

      After manual preparation of the cavity with an excavator and taking a sample for a microbial
      analysis with a rose bur on micro motor (size 014) the cavity undergoes the procedure of
      photodynamic disinfection:

        -  application of photosensitizer 'Fotosan Agent' (CMS Dental, Denmark) for 5 minutes,

        -  radiation with low power laser, wavelength 635 nm power 200mW 120 s. ('Lasotronix',
           DiodeLX model SMART)

        -  rinsing with water and drying

      After photodynamic disinfection another sample for microbial analysis is taken form the
      neighboring area to get the material for a comparison analysis.

      Filling the cavity with a material for permanent fillings (glass-ionomer cement)

      Samples are inoculated on:

        -  Mitis-Salivarius ('Difco') for Streptococci

        -  Rogosa SL 2% aqar ('Oxoid') for Lactobacillus

        -  Columbia with blood for Actinomyces (2 dilutions - 1:10 and 1:100)
