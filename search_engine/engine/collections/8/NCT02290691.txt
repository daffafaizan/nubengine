    
      Primary:

      To evaluate the non-inferiority of flu vaccine administered by needle-free intramuscular (IM)
      injection versus needle and syringe IM injection as determined with serum hemagglutination
      inhibition (HAI) reciprocal titers in healthy adults between 18-64 years.

      Secondary:

      To compare tolerability and safety of the vaccine in the same population based on
      specifically solicited local and systemic reactions occurring through 7 days
      post-immunization and adverse events spontaneously reported through approximately 28 days
      post immunization.
