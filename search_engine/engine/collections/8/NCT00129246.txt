    
      This is an open label smoking cessation clinical trial of 25 mg naltrexone with 300 mg
      bupropion sustained-release (SR) in six male and fourteen female participants. This pilot
      study is being conducted to determine:

        -  effect size estimates for smoking cessation and post-cessation weight gain, which will
           be used to compute the sample size needed for a large-scale clinical trial; and

        -  compliance with a combination of 25 mg naltrexone and 300 mg bupropion SR. In addition
           to examining the sample in this study, the investigators plan to compare this sample to
           a sample of matched controls.
