      and risk factors of the operation will be enrolled in this clinical trial. Two weeks before
      transplantation, the investigators first take 1-2 mm2 of limbal tissues from the healthy eye,
      digest the tissue with collagenase, and get an epithelial cell cluster. The cell cluster will
      be cultured on amniotic membrane with SHEM medium which contains Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
      medium/F12 (1:1), 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 5μg/ml
      insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1 nM cholera toxin, 50μg/ml gentamicin, 1.25μg/ml
      amphotericin B. Seven to ten days later after successful culture, transplantation will be
      performed after the cells reaches 1.5-2 cm2 compact confluent epithelial sheets without
      evidence of contamination. During the operation, lamellar keratectomy will be performed to
      remove the abnormal corneal neovascularization and scar tissue. The cultivated epithelial
      sheets will be transplanted to denuded corneal surface with fibrin glue and suture technique.
      The patients are planed to be admitted for 2 weeks. After discharge, follow up of the
      patients will be performed on one week, two week, one month, two months, three months, six
      months and one year later. Pictures of external eyes will be taken and the extent of corneal
      epithelium regeneration, visual acuity, and complications will be recorded during follow-up
      visits. The investigators plan to collect 10 patients.
