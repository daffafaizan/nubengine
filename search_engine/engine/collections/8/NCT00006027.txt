        -  Compare the relapse-free survival in patients with stage I or II endometrial cancer
           treated with adjuvant radiotherapy with or without cisplatin and paclitaxel after total
           abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

        -  Compare the patterns of recurrence and the acute and late toxicity profiles associated
           with these treatment regimens in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (IC-IIA vs IIB). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients receive radiotherapy once daily 5 days a
           week for 5.5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients receive radiotherapy as in arm I
           concurrently with cisplatin IV over 2-4 hours on days 1 and 28. After completion of
           radiotherapy, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by cisplatin IV over
           2-4 hours on days 56, 84, 112, and 140.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 436 patients (218 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
