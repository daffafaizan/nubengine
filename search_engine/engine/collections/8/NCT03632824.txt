      mortality. Hemorrhage in pregnancy is characterized by activation of the fibrinolytic system.
      Tranexamic acid is a potent pharmaceutical agent that suppresses fibrinolysis, and thus can
      be used for managing hemorrhage in pregnancy. The FDA's pregnancy category for tranexamic
      acid is category B. Tranexamic acid has been used to decrease blood loss and treatment of
      intra partum blood loss in cesarean section also it has been used for prevention and
      management of postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal bleeding, regardless of whether the
      bleeding is due to genital tract trauma or other causes.
