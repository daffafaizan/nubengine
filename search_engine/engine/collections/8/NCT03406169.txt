    
      Evaluation of erectile function with the International Index of Erectile Function
      Questionnaire (IIEF) and measurement of penile length any time between the prostate biopsy
      and 3 days prior to RALP will be performed.

      Patients will undergo a unilateral or bilateral nerve sparing-RALP.

      Patients will be randomized to receive either 25mg Viagra twice daily, 400mg pentoxifylline
      twice daily or placebo twice daily, starting on the first postoperative day after surgery and
      continuing for one year. The biostatistician generates a table of random numbers. 120
      subjects anticipated to enroll at Brooke Army Medical Center will be divided into 3 groups,
      sildenafil, pentoxifylline or placebo. The randomization table will be given to the research
      pharmacist.

      Patients will have their erectile function evaluated at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12
      months with IIEF and sexual intercourse diary. These visits are routine for post-operative
      care following a RALP, however, completion of the IIEF and sexual intercourse diary are being
      performed for study purposes.

      Patients will stop therapy at 12 months and penile length will be re-measured. Measurement of
      penile length will be done for study purposes at the standard 1 year post-operative follow up
      visit.

      Patient will undergo a 6 week washout period during which neither drug will be used, then
      repeat analysis of erectile function with IIEF will be performed, after which they may
      restart standard erectile dysfunction therapy as desired. This washout period and follow up
      will be for study purposes.
