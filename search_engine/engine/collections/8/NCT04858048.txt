      or regional anesthesia. The Wide Awake Local Anesthesia No Tourniquet (WALANT) technique is a
      local anesthesia technique used since 1980s in Canada for hand surgery. WALANT uses a
      combination of a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor to induce anesthesia and hemostasis in
      the area of the surgical procedure in order to allow surgeries to be done without the use of
      tourniquet. This practice eliminates the need for the tourniquet due to the hemostatic effect
      of the vasoconstrictor. The administration of the local anesthetic is done as close as
      possible to the surgical site, which allows the mobility of the joint to be maintained, while
      having complete anesthesia. The retention of mobility and the absence of a tourniquet improve
      patient comfort.

      The main objective of this prospective study is to evaluate the perioperative pain level with
      WALANT anesthesia compared to general anesthesia during forefoot surgery.
