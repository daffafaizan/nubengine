      cardiovascular risk. The causes of CAC include dysregulated matrix metabolism, epitaxial
      mineral deposition, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Melatonin is the main
      indoleamine produced by the pineal gland; it is known recently to have anti-inflammatory,
      anti-cancer and antioxidant activities. Several studies have shown that melatonin protects
      against inflammation and apoptosis in vascular calcification. Melatonin also inhibits
      oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and calcification in endplate chondrocytes. The
      investigators planned to determine the efficacy of melatonin on progression of coronary
      artery calcification (CAC) in patients with moderate calcified coronary atherosclerosis. This
      study may shed light as to whether oral melatonin supplementation can be an adjunct therapy
      in CAC patients.
