      morbidity. BP disproportionally affects the elderly population and the current, non-specific
      immunosuppressive therapies, in addition to patient comorbidities, are associated with a high
      risk of infection related mortality. Neutrophils and their proteases have been shown to play
      a major role in the cleavage of Bullous Pemphigoid 180 Antigen (BP180) in BP. Mast cells and
      other cellular mediators also contribute to the pro-inflammatory environment within and
      surrounding blisters of BP. However, the prior targeting of mast cells and basophils has
      resulted in unpredictable disease control. Recently, IL-17 has been identified as a key
      driver of chronic inflammation in BP. With the increasing aged population in the United
      States, BP will increase in prevalence and the development of a more targeted approach will
      be necessary to decrease morbidity and mortality. IL-17 inhibition with Ixekizumab may have
      targeted, disease-modifying effects on BP. The primary objective is to test the effect of
      Ixekizumab in the treatment of the autoimmune blistering disease, BP.
