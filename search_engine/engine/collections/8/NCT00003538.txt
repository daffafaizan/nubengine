        -  Determine whether stem cell augmented, elutriated grafts prevent graft versus host
           disease in patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive elutriated CD34+ augmented donor bone marrow on day 0.

      Bone marrow samples are obtained before day 100, around 6 months, and 1 year after
      transplant.
