    
      72 patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) who have been selected
      to receive an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (ICD) or Cardiac Resynchronization
      Therapy Pacemaker or Defibrillator (CRT-P/D) will undergo pre-implant assessment with an
      echocardiogram, B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) level, 6 minute walk test, Minnesota living
      with heart failure and Epworth sleepiness questionnaires. The patients will then have the
      device implanted. 6 to 8 weeks later the patent will undergo an Embletta home sleep study and
      download of the ApneaScan data from the device. The mean Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) from
      the ApneaScan download will be compared with that derived from the sleep study. The patients
      will also have a repeat 6 minute walk test, echocardiogram and BNP level.

      2 years after device implantation, all patients will be followed up to document deaths,
      hospital admissions, Atrial Fibrillation (AF) burden and appropriate therapies from ICD
      devices.
