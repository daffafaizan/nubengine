      favour of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery which was organized in 2016 within the public
      hospitals in Paris (Assistance Publique - HÃ´pitaux de Paris).

      The study aims to document and compare the compliance with fast track modalities and its
      impact for the year before (2015) and the year following (2017) the awareness-raising phase.
      Durations of hospital stay, compliance with recommendations, benefits on lowering
      complication rates and cost reductions will be studied for three types of interventions:
      total knee arthroplasty, left colectomy and hysterectomy.

      Preoperative information provided to patients, counselling and physical optimisation will be
      evaluated through a survey among physicians whereas compliance with pre-, intra- and
      postoperative patient management guidelines will be retrospectively retrieved from the
      medical records of randomly selected patients. Survival and hospital trajectories will be
      obtained through the centralised national medical data system.

      Three groups of patients having underwent total hip prosthesis, ovariectomy or gastrectomy in
      the same years (2015 and 2017) will serve as control groups, as for these surgeries no
      specific program has been implemented toward any practice change.
