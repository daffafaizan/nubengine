      plus chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with previously untreated stage II, IIIA, or
      IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of phosphorus P32
      colloid in these patients. III. Determine the response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of phosphorus P32 colloid. Patients receive
      vinblastine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29; cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and
      29; and phosphorus P32 colloid interstitially on day 50. Patients with tumor size less than
      8.0 cm receive radiotherapy following phosphorus P32 injection 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks.
      Patients with tumor size greater than 8.0 cm receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4.5 weeks
      prior to phosphorus P32 injection, and for an additional 2.5 weeks following injection.
      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of phosphorus P32 colloid until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
