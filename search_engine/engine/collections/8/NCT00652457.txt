      in dementing conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease; however, the effects of memantine on
      cognitive and behavioral function in HD are unknown. Our hypotheses are that HD patients who
      are administered memantine will show improved performance on psychometric tests of memory and
      executive functions in addition to behavior and that patients treated with memantine will
      show more improvement after six months than after three months of treatment.
