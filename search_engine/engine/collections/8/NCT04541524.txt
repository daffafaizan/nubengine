      beginning of the surgery, the conjunctiva is opened and the Tenon capsule is getting
      dissected from the sclera. In the first group of patients (group 1) we made a fornix based
      conjunctival opening, prepared a 1mm wide and long scleral pocket in 3mm distance from limbus
      and placed the PMS in the anterior chamber via a 25G needle track. In the second group (group
      2) the conjunctival opening was 3.5 mm from the limbus, the scleral pocket was prepared at
      3.5 mm distance from the limbus and a 27G needle was used. The outcomes of these two groups
      will be compared.
