      and splanchnic vein thrombosis: Mascot Protocol No. MPN-SVT v11; 02/Dec/2013 Study Design
      Prospective observational longitudinal study of patients with MPN related splanchnic vein
      thrombosis(study group) and patients with MPN without SVT (control group) Study Participants
      Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT),
      patients with MPN and splenomegaly.

      Number of subjects 40 patients Follow-up duration 5 years Study duration January 2014-
      January 2019. Primary Objectives 1. To describe morbidity/portal circulation in the patient
      group over the 18m from baseline 2. To examine if there are changes in endpoints from
      baseline to 18m 3. To compare patients with MPN related SVT and MPN without SVT Secondary
      Objectives 1. To describe morbidity/portal circulation in the patient group over 5 years from
      baseline 2. To examine if there are changes in endpoints from baseline to 5 years 3. To
      assess the impact of treatment including cytoreductive therapy, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition
      and antithrombotic treatment on end points.

      4. To assess adequacy of anti-thrombotic agents with reference to recurrence, recanalisation
      and extension of splanchnic thrombosis, non-splanchnic thrombotic events and bleeding
      frequency.

      Exploratory objectives 1. Assess the utility of endothelial colony assay as marker of disease
      2. Assess the utility of adhesion molecules as markers of disease

      Primary Endpoint Composite end point comprising occurrence or change in morbidity or portal
      circulation over 18 months Secondary Endpoint Occurence or change in morbidity or portal
      circulation over 3-5 years
