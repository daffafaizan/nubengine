      parameters, subjective effects, behavioral parameters, including puffing topography
      parameters of P4M3 with four different variants of P4M3, in experienced e-cigarette users
      after a single-use experience with fixed puffing regime and after ad libitum use of P4M3.

      Four variants of P4M3 will be evaluated together with subjects' own e-cigarettes to evaluate
      the relationship between the e-liquid composition (nicotine concentrations and presence of
      lactic acid) and the amount of nicotine absorbed, the speed of absorption, and the puffing
      topography.
