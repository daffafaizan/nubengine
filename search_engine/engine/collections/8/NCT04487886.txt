    
      This randomized placebo-controlled phase 2 study will evaluate whether a two-week exposure to
      duvelisib, a gamma/delta phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, reduces inflammation in
      the lungs in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      infection and COVID-19 who do not require mechanical ventilation at study initiation. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of duvelisib treatment in
      preventing death or the need for mechanical ventilation among patients with World Health
      Organization (WHO)-defined severe COVID-19. Key secondary endpoints will be reductions in
      oxygen requirements of patients and improvements in their performance status, safety and
      tolerability of duvelisib in the setting of COVID-19, biomarkers of inflammation, duration of
      viremia, and generation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody
      responses to SARS-Cov-2 spike protein. The study will determine if a two-week exposure to
      duvelisib beginning soon after presentation with severe COVID-19 warrants further evaluation
      in a larger clinical study.
