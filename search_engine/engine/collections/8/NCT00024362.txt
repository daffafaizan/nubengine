      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with BBR 3464. II. Determine the response
      rate, duration of response, time to disease progression, and duration of stable disease in
      patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the incidence and severity of the toxic
      effects of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the disease-related symptoms in
      patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BBR 3464 IV over 1 hour on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for a minimum of 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 9 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
