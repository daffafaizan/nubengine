    
      Prospective, non-randomized, multi-center study of adult subjects referred for
      echocardiography. Total of 200 enrolled subjects at 3 sites. Up to 10 roll-in subjects per
      site. Enrolled subjects will undergo: Vivio data capture, Eko stethoscope capture of heart
      sounds, Standard of care transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Vivio analysis will not be
      available to non-Avicena personnel. Recorded sounds from the FDA-approved Eko stethoscope
      will be presented to an independent expert physician review panel blinded to Vivio and TTE
      results, to compare diagnosis of severe AS using Eko (auscultation) vs. Vivio (algorithms).
