      refractory stage III or IV ovarian epithelial cancer who have failed platinum in combination
      with paclitaxel chemotherapy. II. Determine the toxicities of this treatment regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with complete response after receiving 3 courses receive 3-6 additional courses.
      Patients with partial response or stable disease after receiving 3 courses receive 3-12
      additional courses. Patients with complete response are followed every 2 months for 2 years,
      and then every 3 months thereafter. All other patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-39 patients will be accrued for this study.
