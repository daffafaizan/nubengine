    
      This is a Phase II, non-randomized trial. Eligible subjects will be treated with panitumumab
      plus carboplatin, paclitaxel and radiotherapy followed by surgical resection of the
      esophagus.

      Panitumumab administration schedule: Panitumumab will be administered as a 60-minute ± 15
      minutes IV infusion, prior to administration of chemotherapy at a dose of 6 mg/kg on day 1,
      15 and 29. If the first infusion is well tolerated (without any serious infusion related
      reactions) all subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes ± 10 minutes.

      Chemotherapy regimen: Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 and Carboplatin AUC = 2 will be given by
      intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Both drugs will be infused over one hour.

      Radiotherapy treatment: A total dose of 41.4 Gy will be given in 23 fractions of 1.8 Gy, 5
      fractions per week, starting the first day of the first cycle of chemotherapy. All patients
      will be radiated by external beam radiation, using 3-D conformal radiation technique.

      Surgery: Surgery will be performed preferably within 6 weeks after the completion of the
      chemoradiation and panitumumab. For carcinomas distal of the tracheal bifurcation but
      proximal to the gastro-esophageal junction, a transthoracic approach is preferred. For distal
      tumors involving the gastro-esophageal junction a transhiatal esophageal resection is
      preferred. A wide local excision including the N1 lymph nodes is carried out in both
      techniques including a standard excision of the lymph nodes around the coeliac axis. The
      continuity of the digestive tract will be restored by a gastric tube reconstruction or
      colonic interposition procedure with an anastomosis in the neck.
