      dual-modality positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging systems
      for assessing treatment response in patients with metastatic prostate cancer in comparison to
      conventional imaging. PET-CT is not employed here for staging; all men in this study will
      have stage IV metastatic prostate cancer. We believe that the combined anatomic and in-vivo
      metabolic imaging information provided by PET-CT allows accurate objective assessment of such
      critical clinical issues as early prediction and evaluation of response or resistance to
      various therapeutic interventions, including the novel chemotherapy regimen, as well as the
      prediction of key clinical outcomes such as time to hormone-refractoriness and survival. Our
      intermediate-range objective is therefore to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic
      utility of PET-CT with the most commonly available PET tracer, [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose
      (FDG), in metastatic prostate cancer. We plan to correlate the treatment-induced changes of
      glucose metabolism in metastatic prostate cancer lesions to the changes in various
      conventional clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic imaging parameters such as serum
      prostate-specific antigen level, lesion size, time to androgen independence, and survival.
      This objective is motivated by our preliminary basic science and clinical data as well as the
      published reports of other investigators demonstrating the pragmatic potential diagnostic and
      prognostic utility of FDG PET-CT in men with metastatic prostate cancer.
