      BMI, between 40 kg/m2 and 85 kg/m2), who have undergone gastric bypass procedures under
      general anesthesia hypoventilate during the initial twenty-four hour postoperative period,
      and if so, to what degree. Adequacy of ventilation will be assessed by serial arterial blood
      analyses. Patients will be monitored for SpO2 in the preoperative holding area, in the
      operating room, and the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) by conventional and study pulse
      oximeters. SpO2 data will be collected continuously and recorded on the study pulse oximeter
      for the entire study period. Arterial blood samples will be drawn for analysis every four
      hours by in-dwelling arterial catheter, using standard sterile technique. Hypoventilation is
      defined as an increase in PaCO2 five or more mm Hg above patient's baseline.
