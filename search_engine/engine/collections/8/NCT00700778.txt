      Primary

        -  Determine whether the genomic profiles of breast epithelial cells of high-breast
           cancer-risk women, as defined by their positive BRCA1 status and nulliparous condition,
           express a signature indicative of high-risk.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether women identified to express a "high-breast cancer-risk" signature will
           revert it to a "low-risk" signature after a 90-day treatment with r-hCG, which should
           have induced breast differentiation and genomic changes that would serve as biomarkers
           indicative of decreased breast cancer risk.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin subcutaneously three times
      weekly. Treatment continues weekly for 90 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Benign breast tissue specimens are collected by core needle biopsy at baseline, day 90, and
      day 270. Tissue samples are analyzed by cytopathology for epithelial normality, Ki67
      immunohistochemical staining for cell proliferation, cDNA microarray for gene expression, and
      serum studies for hormone levels and biomarker determinations.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 24 weeks.
