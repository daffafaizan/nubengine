      activity and healthy eating promotion program, in hypertensive from Recife-PE- Brazil. As
      secondaries goals, the study attempts to:

        1. evaluate the effectiveness of VAMOS program with regard to physical activity, the
           sedentary behavior and eating habits in hypertensives;

        2. analyze whether self-efficacy, stages of self-change and social support mediate the
           possible effects of VAMOS program on physical activity, sedentary behavior and eating
           habits in hypertensives;

        3. evaluate the effectiveness of VAMOS program with regard to clinic and home blood
           pressure, arterial stiffness, blood flow and flow-mediated dilation, heart rate and
           heart rate variability in hypertensives;

        4. evaluate the effectiveness of VAMOS program on anthropometric and body composition
           variables in hypertensives;

        5. analyze whether the possible result changes brought from VAMOS program in behavioral and
           biological variables promote changes in quality of life of hypertensives;

        6. assess the implementation of VAMOS program in nonpharmacological treatment of
           hypertension in Recife, northeastern of Brazil;

        7. identify whether the possible effects achieved from VAMOS remain three months after the
           end of the program in hypertensives.
