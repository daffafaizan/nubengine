      Family empowerment interventions provide important support for many patients with CF and
      their families. However,there is a lack of research exploring the effects of such empowerment
      programs on coping, and Problem Solving among parents, and Quality of Life in Children with
      CF. The present study aimed to assess the effect of a family empowerment program-based
      nursing intervention on parents coping with stress and problem solving, and quality of life
      children with CF.

      A single-blinded, parallel group pretest and posttest design randomized controlled trial was
      used.

      Data were collected over 5 months (January 2017-May 2017) from 48 participants in a medical
      faculty hospital. They were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 24) and control (n =
      24) groups. Nursing interventions applied to the experimental group for ten weeks with the
      intent of strengthening families consist of; providing individualized training and booklet
      concerning disease management and providing phone calls and consultancy services for the
      purpose of reinforcing the training and increasing the motivation. A routine polyclinic
      follow-up was applied to the control group. Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), Scale of Ways of
      Coping with Stress (SWCS), and The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised scale (CFQ-R) were
      used reliable and valid instruments. The data were evaluated using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks
      test in evaluating dependent groups and the Mann-Whitney U test in independent groups.
