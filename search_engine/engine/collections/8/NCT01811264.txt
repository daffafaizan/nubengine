      literacy and encourage women to be active in the decisions that are being made about their
      healthcare which will lead to their satisfaction with healthcare and improves their
      psychosocial well-being. The paper-based PPA uses adult learning principles to limit and
      sequence plain language messages that have been framed from a patient's perspective. The PPA
      uses theory-based design to increase patients' involvement in the medical visit by modeling -
      through text and images - how a patient can: 1) set the visit agenda, 2) formulate questions,
      and 3) assert personal preferences. The specific aims of this study are to: 1- Assess the
      effectiveness of the PPA to increase patient involvement during clinical encounters. 2-
      Evaluate the effectiveness of the PPA to improve patient psychosocial outcomes. 3- Explore if
      the effect of the PPA varies by patients' literacy skills. To achieve this aims, the
      investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the PPA among patients
      with a new diagnosis or progression of metastatic breast cancer at two cancer centers that
      serve diverse patient populations.
