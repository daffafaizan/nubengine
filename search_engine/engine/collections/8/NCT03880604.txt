      myomectomy. The study was unable to demonstrate any significant impact on blood loss,
      duration of surgery or need for blood transfusionHemostatic tourniquets to reduce
      intra-operative bleeding have long been available, but data on their efficacy from controlled
      trials are lacking. The investigators set out to evaluate the use of triple tourniquets plus
      tranexamic acid in controlled conditions and for the first time to investigate the hypothesis
      that adding tranexamic acid to tourniquet around the uterine artery reduces postoperative
      bleeding from the uterine incisions, a well-recognized sequel to surgery
