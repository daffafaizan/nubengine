    
      The purpose of this study is to examine in stimulated cycles a) whether there is a difference
      in expression of steroid receptors in stroma and glands of endometrium between different days
      during the follicular phase b)whether there are secretory changes detected by endometrium
      histology before ovulation c)whether there is an association between expression of steroid
      receptors in endometrium and exposure to oestradiol and progesterone during the follicular
      phase.
