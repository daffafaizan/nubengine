      quality management and hospital efficiency. A dedicated valve coordinator, interfering with
      all stages of patient handling throughout the hospital may increase the efficiency of the sAS
      patient flow, accelerate decision making and clinical outcomes while at the same time
      decreasing resource consumption.

      The hypothesis is that the implementation of a dedicated valve coordinator will improve the
      patient flow of sAS patients scheduled to undergo TAVI, their outcome, patient and physician
      satisfaction and will optimize costs.

      In total, three centers across Germany (Munich, DÃ¼sseldorf, Bad Bevensen) will participate.
