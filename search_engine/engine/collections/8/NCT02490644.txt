      is systemic inflammation. Valvular heart surgery requires cardiopulmonary bypass and
      cardioplegic arrest, which can arouse the ischemic/reperfusion injury causing myocardial
      damage and inflammatory response. These myocardial damage and inflammatory response can cause
      multi-organ failure or even death.

      High-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) is a protein which is encoded by the HMGB1 gene in
      human. HMGB1 is secreted by immune cells (like macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells).
      Activated macrophages and monocytes secrete HMGB1 as a cytokine mediator of Inflammation.
      There are many studies suggesting the relationship between HMGB1 and acute coronary syndrome,
      myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, heart failure and other cardiac
      disease as a marker for inflammatory response. However, there are no other study evaluating
      HMGB1 as a prognostic factor after valvular surgery, so far.
