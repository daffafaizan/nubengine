      therapy, exercise training and combined rosiglitazone and exercise training. We hypothesize
      that rosiglitazone will lower blood sugar, insulin, blood fats, muscle and liver lipid
      content and composition in HIV-infected people. Exercise training will induce the same
      benefits, but will also reduce abdominal fat mass. We hypothesize that combining exercise
      training with rosiglitazone therapy will be most effective at reducing blood sugar, insulin,
      lipids, muscle and liver lipid contents, and restoring body fat distribution than either
      intervention alone. At baseline and after 12 wk of treatment we will measure: the ability of
      insulin to promote the clearance of sugar from the blood, the clearance rate of blood sugar,
      the rate of glucose production by the liver, blood fat and cholesterol concentrations, body
      fat content and fat distribution in the arms, legs, trunk regions, muscle and liver lipid
      content and composition.
