      sleep has been found to be associated with increased rates of delirium, non-invasive
      ventilation failure, and may serve as a stressor to patients. The use of earplugs and eye
      masks to improve sleep quality has been described in the critically ill patient population
      and outcomes have suggested that such interventions have resulted in longer sleep time and
      Rapid Eye Movement sleep, shorter sleep onset latency and less awakenings, with an enhanced
      perceived sleep quality. In the post-anaesthesia care unit, these interventions have also led
      to significantly preserved sleep quality in patients. The primary outcome of this randomized
      control trial is to evaluate if the use of eye masks and earplugs in patients undergoing
      major abdominal surgery, and who will be admitted to a monitored unit postoperatively, will
      lead to improved sleep quality. Secondary outcomes evaluated include the level of noise
      intensity in the various monitored units (Intensive Care Unit/Intermediate Care Area/High
      Dependency Ward), incidence of delirium, nursing demand, length of hospitalization and
      anaesthetic techniques. With these findings, we hope to be able to improve patients' overall
      satisfaction with the healthcare received.
