      curative treatment. Only 30% of recurrent HCC (RHCC) patients are resectable when diagnosed.
      Neoadjuvant treatment may reduce tumor burden and recurrence rate after surgery for RHCC
      patients. Immune treatment, like PD-1 inhibitors, have already been reported effective in
      advanced HCC patients as first-line therapy and in several early-stage solid tumors as
      neoadjuvant therapy. According to several preclinical results, immune infiltration and the
      expression of PD-1 was higher in RHCC tumors than paired primary tumors. So, we designed this
      single-arm phase II clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of Tislelizumab (PD-1
      inhibitor) as neoadjuvant treatment for resectable RHCC patients.
