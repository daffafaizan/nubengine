      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo alloHCT.

      ARM B: Patients receive CPX-351 intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5.
      Treatment may repeat for an additional cycle for a total of 2 cycles (on days 1 and 3 only of
      cycle 2) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 60 days after
      completion of CPX-351, patients undergo alloHCT.

      After completion of study enrollment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
