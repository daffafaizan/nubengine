    
      Patients with confirmed or suspected primary hyperparathyroidism or complications therefrom
      (such as postoperative hypoparathyroidism) will be admitted for diagnosis and treatment. The
      principal diagnostic components are calcium in serum and urine, parathyroid hormone in serum,
      and mutation tests on germline or tumor DNA. Patients with moderately to severe primary
      hyperparathyroidism will be treated. Treatment will be mainly by parathyroidectomy.
      Preoperative testing to localize parathyroid neoplasm(s) will be used usually and with more
      extended methods in cases with prior neck surgery. Other options are medications or no
      intervention. Patients with a hyperparathyroid syndrome may be managed for their
      extraparathyroid features (medical management or surgical treatment). Preoperative tumor
      localization tests will be selected according to clinical indications from the following:
      ultrasound, technetium-thallium scan, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging,
      somatostatin receptor imaging, fine needle aspiration for parathyroid hormone assay,
      selective arteriogram, selective venous catheterization for parathyroid hormone assay.
      Options for management of postoperative hypocalcemia include calcium, vitamin D analogs,
      parathyroid autografts and synthetic parathyroid hormone. Research specimens may consist of
      blood or tumors. In addition, a substudy for patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type
      1 (MEN1) will assess the utility of two PET/CT scans with radiotracers (68Gallium-DOTATATE
      and 18F-DOPA).
