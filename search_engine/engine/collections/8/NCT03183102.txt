      suppression. Specifically, the investigators will test whether gut microbial diversity and
      abundance change in response to estrogen suppression and consumption of dietary flaxseed. To
      test this possibility the investigators will recruit premenopausal women (age 20-40 years
      old)and collect fecal samples before and after 1 month of estrogen suppression with GnRH
      agonist. The investigators will analyze the gut microbiota in response to estrogen loss and
      whether this differs with the consumption of flaxseed.
