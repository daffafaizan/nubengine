      facilitate identification of HIV-infected individuals truly at risk for CMV disease in whom
      targeted prophylactic interventions to prevent CMV disease would be indicated. These studies
      would also further the understanding of the natural history of CMV disease within the context
      of AIDS. Natural history studies conducted prior to the advent of highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART; i.e., 3-drug regimens that include HIV reverse transcriptase
      and protease inhibitors) have demonstrated that the risk for developing CMV disease increases
      with progression of HIV disease and with declining CD4 counts. Presently the need exists to
      define the natural history of CMV disease in patients with AIDS within the context of HAART.

      In this prospective observational study, HIV-infected patients who are CMV-seropositive with
      no clinical symptoms of CMV disease at entry are followed for three years or until the
      diagnosis of CMV end-organ disease or death, whichever comes first. Clinical evaluations are
      performed at baseline and every 8 weeks. Blood samples for virologic studies are taken every
      16 weeks.
