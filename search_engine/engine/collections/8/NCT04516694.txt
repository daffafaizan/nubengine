      manage their diabetes from a pre-defined list of self-care targets. A randomized 3
      (treatment) x 3 (occasion) crossover design will be used to compare treatments that are
      administered to participants in a predetermined sequence. The intervention arms include
      financial incentives administered in a gain- and loss-frame for adherence to daily self-care
      goals. The control arm is usual care. Participants can also earn additional incentives for
      meeting clinical care goals such as an improvement in the percentage of time glucose levels
      are consistent with hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL). The primary outcome will be HbA1c at 12 weeks
      compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes will include frequency of insulin administration,
      engagement in diabetes self-care (SCI-R), patient-reported outcomes (Problem Areas in
      Diabetes - Teen version and Diabetes Family Conflict Scale).
