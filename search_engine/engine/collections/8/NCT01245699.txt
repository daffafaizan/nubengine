      (Chelmsford, MA). These units are equipped with an accelerometer-based system that allows for
      measurement of chest compression depth and rate. These units are also equipped with
      RealCPRHelp, and FDA-approved technology that provides real-time audiovisual feedback to
      providers on the quality of chest compressions.

      In the first phase of the project, the ED providers will utilize the E-series units to treat
      all patients requiring chest compressions.
