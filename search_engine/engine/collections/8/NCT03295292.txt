    
      In this pilot clinical trial, patients undergoing Photo Therapeutic/Refractive Keratectomy
      (PTK/ PRK) and Collagen Cross Linking (CXL), will be given human Limbus-derived Corneal Stem
      cells to assess the safety of these cells. Cells will be cultivated in a cGMP laboratory
      using standardized culture technique; from the limbal rims of cadaveric corneoscleral donor
      tissues that are therapeutically accepted and serologically tested. Briefly the limbal tissue
      will be cut up into small pieces and digested overnight using an enzyme (Collagenase L). The
      cells obtained from the digest will be cultured on a petri-dish using 2% serum and growth
      factors. A mixture of limbal epithelial cells and limbal stromal cells obtained from these
      cultures will be used in surgical procedures in a ratio of 2:1, after all the sterility
      checks. Mixed suspension of the limbal epithelial and the stromal cells at a concentration of
      50000 cells/uL diluted in the thrombin component of fibrin sealant (TISEEL, Baxter) will be
      applied. The primary outcome measure is safety of this treatment and the secondary outcome
      measure is their efficacy that will be assessed at 1 month time points by (1) Clinical
      photography using a standard method where multiple blinded observers will grade the
      clinically apparent change in haze and (2) Objective quantification of the amount of light
      scattering using densitometry analysis function in Oculus Pentacam (OCULUS Optikger√§te GmbH).
