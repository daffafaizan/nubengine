    
      This is a 12-month maintenance treatment study for patients who have responded to a 6 week
      course of acute TMS treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The study will seek to
      assess the change in depressive symptomatology across the duration of maintenance treatment
      using observer and self-administered efficacy measures. Describe the efficacy of TMS
      re-introduction in patients not receiving maintenance pharmacotherapy who show a recurrence
      of depressive symptoms. Assess the safety and durability of acute TMS therapy followed by
      maintenance TMS treatment for up to 12 months.
