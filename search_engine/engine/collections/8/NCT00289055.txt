      Cordis SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent as compared to balloon angioplasty only. Patients
      will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. It is anticipated that a total of 120 patients will be
      entered into the study.

      The study population will consist of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease patients with
      SFA occlusions. The disease will consist of symptomatic, long de novo or restenotic
      occlusions (5 - 14.5 cm) on diagnostic imaging with a history of at least 6 months. The
      occlusions must not extend beyond the proximal popliteal artery. For the purpose of this
      protocol, no lesion within 3 cm of the upper part of the patella may be treated. The distal
      popliteal artery must be patent with no hemodynamic stenosis as well as two calf vessels.
      Reference vessel diameter must be >= 4.0 to <= 6.0 mm.

      Trial participants will be randomized to the SMART™ nitinol self-expanding stent or to
      balloon angioplasty only.

      Patients will be followed for twelve months post-procedure. Study examinations will be done
      at screening, procedure time, discharge, six, and twelve months post procedure.

      This study will be conducted at 8 investigational sites in The Netherlands.
