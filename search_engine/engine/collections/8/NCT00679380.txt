        1. One budesonide MMX® 6 mg tablet plus three placebo Entocort enteric-coated (EC®)
           overencapsulated capsules, or

        2. One budesonide MMX® 9 mg tablet plus three placebo Entocort EC® overencapsulated
           capsules, or

        3. Three placebo Entocort EC® overencapsulated capsules plus one placebo budesonide MMX®
           tablet, or

        4. Three Entocort EC® 3 mg overencapsulated capsules plus one placebo budesonide MMX®
           tablet, daily for eight weeks.

      Hence, each patient is to take four tablets/capsules per day of active or placebo study
      medication as per the randomization schedule. Placebo tablets of Budesonide MMX® and placebo
      overencapsulated capsules of Entocort EC® will be used to maintain the study blind using a
      double-dummy technique.

      During the study, five visits to the clinical center are scheduled: one at Screening and
      three in the double-blind treatment period (Day 1, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 56). A safety
      follow-up visit will take place about 2 weeks after the final study visit. If a patient is
      withdrawn from the study before Day 56, they will be asked to attend the study center as soon
      as possible thereafter so that the Final visit assessments can be conducted.
