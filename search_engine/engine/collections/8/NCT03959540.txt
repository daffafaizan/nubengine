      patients with PD. Approximately 100 patients with PD will be recruited by specialists from
      approximately 37 sites in European countries. The total enrolment period will be one year,
      and each patient will be followed for up to one year after enrolment.

      PD patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations suitable for additional treatment
      optimization will be included in the study and split into 2 cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: 50 patients; standard of care (including L-DOPA) + starting opicapone

        -  Cohort 2: 50 patients; standard of care (including L-DOPA Data will be collected at
           baseline (date of enrolment), 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after
           enrolment.

      This non-interventional study does not recommend the use of any specific treatments. Use of
      opicapone and of standard of care are only driven by the physician's decision.
