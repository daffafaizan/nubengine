      hyaluronate, has recently been studied as a promising mediator for periodontal regeneration.
      It has a significant role in mineralized and non-mineralized periodontal tissues for the
      functioning of its extracellular matrices. It has a multifunctional role in periodontics
      including the stimulation of cell migration, proliferation and differentiation and the
      acceleration of wound healing by stimulating angiogenesis. It is used in surgical procedures
      due to its osteoinductive potential. HA is a key element in soft periodontal tissues, the
      gingiva and periodontal ligament, and in hard tissue, such as alveolar bone and cementum. It
      has many structural and physiological functions within these tissues.

      This research proposes two experimental groups to whom one of them will be applied
      cross-linked hyaluronic acid at 1.8% and another group with enamel matrix derivative, and a
      control group.

      The investigator's hypothesis is that the hyaluronic acid shows potential for periodontal
      regeneration when evaluating its clinical and radiographic variables and when compared with
      the use of Enamel matrix derivative.
