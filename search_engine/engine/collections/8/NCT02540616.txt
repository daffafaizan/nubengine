      participate in the study. If TES is used as add-on treatment to repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS), the training for TES application will be done on-site. However,
      in a portion of the study that does not involve rTMS, remote training will be performed via a
      webcam provided that a suitable "Study Buddy" is available to assist the participant.

      Participants will maintain web-based diaries of their symptoms for up to four weeks prior to
      treatment with TES. Before the actual treatment sessions are started, the subjects will
      complete baseline questionnaires online which will be repeated once a week for up to 12
      weeks. Over the course of the study, the subjects will also keep a daily log of their
      sessions such as how many sessions they performed, for how long, and whether they had any
      side effects with each session.

      The studies will include a sham arm, allocated at a ratio of 1:1. On-site studies will
      involve the application of EEG, MRI, balance, cognitive, and visual/auditory stimulation
      tests.
