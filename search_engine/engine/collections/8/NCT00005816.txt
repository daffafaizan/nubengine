      with autologous total tumor RNA in patients with stage III or IV renal cell carcinoma. II.
      Assess the toxicity and feasibility of this treatment regimen in these patients. III.
      Evaluate this regimen in terms of cellular immune response, clinical response, and overall
      survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients undergo nephrectomy for tumor RNA
      extraction followed by leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells for
      dendritic cell (DC) production. Patients receive autologous DC transfected with autologous
      renal cell carcinoma RNA both IV and intradermally on weeks 0, 2, and 4. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of DC IV until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6
      months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study over 24 months.
