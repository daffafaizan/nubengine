      radiotherapy in patients with stage I-IVB squamous cell cancer of the head and neck at high
      risk of recurrence following curative resection. II. Determine the efficacy of this regimen
      in these patients. III. Determine the survival of these patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days
      1-5 and 43-47 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 2, 23, and 44. Concurrent radiotherapy is
      administered 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44-68 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
