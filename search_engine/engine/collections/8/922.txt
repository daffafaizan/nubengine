the influence of organic and emotional factors on the origins, natureand outcome of childhood psychosis.a group of 65 children diagnosed as 'childpsychosis' (or one of its synonyms)was followed up for an average of 15 yr.none of the parents were schizophrenic;6 (10%) had a parent who had psychiatrictreatment for neurosis.  only 2 childrenhad a sib with transient autistic episode.none had sibs with the adult type ofschizophrenia.  these findings are felt tomilitate against the view that childpsychosis is part of the schizophrenic group.among the 65 children: 40% had ani.q. below 50, 40% between 50 and 80 andonly 20% above 80.  the i.q. was foundin general to be a good predictor of laterperformances.  mental retardation isregarded as a primary component of theclinical picture.  evidence of brain damagewas conclusive in 15 children (24%) who showedepileptic attacks (developing in 10of them during the follow-up).  speech disorderswere the most outstanding manifestation.five children had confirmed receptiveaphasia and 14 others show someevidence of it.  in 75% of the speaking childrenecholalia was noted; 11% had abnormalitiesof delivering spoken words.  theview that reduction of speech is dueto social withdrawal is rejected.  psychogenicfactors and parental attitude werenot found to be relevant to the etiology.  thepsychosis is not considered primarilyemotional in origin, although emotionalrelationships as well as educational managementhave considerable influence on theoutcome of the disease.
