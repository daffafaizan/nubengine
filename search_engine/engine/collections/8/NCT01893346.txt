      pharmacokinetics of CAZ-AVI and assess its safety and tolerability following a single IV dose
      given to hospitalized pediatric patients receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for suspected
      or confirmed infection. This study will include 4 cohorts, each consisting of at least 8
      evaluable pediatric patients, aged â‰¥3 months to <18 years, who are hospitalized with
      infections.
