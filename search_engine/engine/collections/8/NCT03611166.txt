      unconscious for many years. Although behavioral assessment and functional imaging are
      currently used as diagnostic tools, the molecular basis underlying chronic condition has yet
      to be explored.

      Objective:To explore the molecular basis and identify novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and
      prognosis of patients with chronic disorder of consciousness.

      Method: Plasma samples were obtained from patients with chronic disorder of consciousness,
      and healthy volunteers. A coupled isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation
      (iTRAQ)-based proteomics approach was used to screen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs)
      between patients and controls. Potential molecular mechanisms were further discussed through
      bioinformatics analyses. Candidate proteins were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA).
