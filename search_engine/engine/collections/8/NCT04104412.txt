      of lumbar discogenic pain (endogenous pain of the disc) to evaluate its safety and efficacy.

      This experimental is mainly aimed at over 18years old people, regardless of gender, with
      refractory and persistent back pain for more than 6 months.

      The straight leg elevation test was 70 degrees negative. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of
      the lumbar spine showed herniated disc < 6 mm, no obvious compression of spinal cord and
      nerve roots. T2-weighted mri of the lumbar spine showed decreased single/multisegment signal
      in the intervertebral disc (black disc sign) or High intensity zone (HIZ) in the posterior
      part of the intervertebral disc annulus. The clinical signs of nerve localization were
      consistent with MRI changes.

      The efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCS) were evaluated by low-temperature
      plasma ablation and intravertebral disc injection, which were divided into treatment group
      and control group.

      The safety evaluation including:physical examination, vital signs, routine hematuria and
      faeces, liver and kidney function, blood lipids, electrolytes, coagulation, rapid virus
      detection, tumor markers, electrocardiogram and adverse reaction records at the 3, 6, 12 and
      24 weeks before and after treatment.

      The prime efficacy evaluation is VAS( visual analogue scale) at the 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks
      before and after treatment.
