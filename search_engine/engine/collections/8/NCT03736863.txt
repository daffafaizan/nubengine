      ranks sixth in the world. At present, the first-line treatment of advanced esophageal cancer
      is mainly based on the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil. After the
      failure of first-line treatment, there is no standard second-line treatment. We designed a
      single-arm, open phase II clinical trial of anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 plus arpatinib as
      second-line treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell. The purpose of this study is to
      observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 plus apatinib as
      second-line treatment of advanced esophageal squamous cell.
