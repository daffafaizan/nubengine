    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study evaluating oral
      administration of CAD-1883 in the treatment of adults with a genotypic diagnosis of SCA using
      multiple dose levels. The study will include multiple cohorts of 16 patients each where 12
      patients will be randomized to CAD-1883 and 4 to matching placebo.

      Potential subjects will undergo a screening period (14 to 28 days), a baseline (Day 1) visit,
      and a 12-week treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the end of the
      treatment period. The total duration of individual subject participation may be up to 20
      weeks, depending on the duration of the screening period.

      The study will assess safety by adverse events, vital signs, laboratory parameters (including
      chemistry, hematology and urinalysis); pharmacokinetics of CAD-1883; and efficacy measures by
      Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), clinician/patient rating of ataxia and
      symptoms, patient quality of life measures and wearable sensors to capture falls and gait
      measurements.

      For planning purposes, the anticipated study completion date assumes evaluation of 3 cohorts.
