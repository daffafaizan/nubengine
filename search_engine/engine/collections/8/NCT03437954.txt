      after a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Traditional standard of care is to recommend that
      patients be restricted to a soft diet post-operatively. However, the investigators believe
      that there may be benefit in allowing patients to eat a restriction-free diet. In this study,
      the investigators will compare the current standard of care verse a non-restricted diet. The
      purpose of this study is to determine how diet after tonsil/adenoid surgery affects bleeding,
      pain, and oral intake.
