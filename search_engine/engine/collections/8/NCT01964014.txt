      subjects who had kidney transplantations at least 3 months earlier will participate in the
      study. All enrolled subjects will discontinue the existing Tacrolimus preparations for 6
      months from enrollment and be converted to Extended Release Tacrolimus at a biologically
      equivalent dose. They will also discontinue enteric-coated mycophenolate sdium or
      mycophenolate sodium and be treated with Sirolimus and observed.
