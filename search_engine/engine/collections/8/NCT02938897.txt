      program for men with obesity and at least one additional risk factor for cardiovascular
      disease. The primary aims are to:

        1. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the male-targeted telenutrition weight
           loss program in terms of recruitment, retention and satisfaction and

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the telenutrition program compared to usual care
           (informational only) with regard to primary and secondary outcome measures at 12 weeks.
           We hypothesized that men receiving virtual and telephonic support from a registered
           dietitian nutritionist would have greater weight loss and greater improvements in diet
           quality than men who were only provided educational materials.
