        -  Assess the rate of disease stabilization in patients with metastatic melanoma when
           treated with interferon alfa, dacarbazine, cisplatin, and interleukin-2.

        -  Assess toxicity, overall response rate, and response duration in these patients when
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive dacarbazine IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 3 hours on days
           1-3. Patients also receive interferon alfa subcutaneously (SQ) on days 1-5 and
           interleukin-2 by continuous IV infusion on days 4-9. Treatment continues every 28 days
           for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive dacarbazine IV on day 1 and 22 every 28 days for 2 courses.
           Patients then receive treatment as in arm I for a maximum of 4 courses.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42-90 patients will be accrued for this study.
