      pregnancy.

      Buprenorphine has many preferential characteristics over methadone including decreased risk
      of maternal overdose, lower incidence of preterm labor, less frequent clinical visits,
      shorter duration of neonatal hospital stay and treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome.
      Recent studies have found that increasing the dosing frequencies of buprenorphine is more
      efficacious to prevent maternal withdrawal symptoms, improve compliance, and theoretically
      produce better pregnancy outcomes.

      Buprenorphine/naloxone, a combination opioid of buprenorphine and naloxone, has also been
      investigated as an alternative to treatment and maintenance for opioid use disorder. The
      advantage of the combination of buprenorphine with naloxone is that it reduces the potential
      for abuse. As a partial mu opioid agonist, buprenorphine alone has the capacity to induce
      typical opioid effects such as euphoria, which are enhanced when the drug is taken
      intravenously. By combining buprenorphine with naloxone, an opioid antagonist, the capacity
      for buprenorphine to be abused is reduced.
