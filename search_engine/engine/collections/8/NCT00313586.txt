      I. To estimate the overall response rate (complete, partial, and hematologic
      improvement-major by International Working Group [IWG] criteria) in response to azacitidine
      and entinostat.

      II. To estimate the major response rate (complete and partial responses by the IWG response
      criteria) to a 10-day regimen of azacitidine and to the same regimen of azacitidine in
      combination with entinostat administered orally on days 3 and 10 of each cycle in patients
      with de novo myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL)
      (dysplastic) and acute myeloid leukemia with trilineage dysplasia (AML-TLD), as well as in
      patients with treatment-induced MDS, CMMoL (dysplastic) and AML-TLD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of azacitidine and entinostat in this patient population.

      II. To identify changes in gene promoter methylation and gene expression which may be
      associated with response to azacitidine and entinostat.

      III. To identify other molecular mechanisms (such as deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] damage)
      which may be associated with response to azacitidine and entinostat.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-10.

      ARM B: Patients receive azacitidine as in Arm A and entinostat orally (PO) on days 3 and 10.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 6-24 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
