      They will be even more essential to address when large birth cohorts grow older and life
      expectancy increases. Number of elderly persons is constantly rising. When in 2010 there was
      1730 000 over 65-year olds in Sweden, the prognosis for year 2060 is 3221 000 persons. Hence,
      it is important to find solutions for preventing falls. The aim of this project is to study
      the relation between movement patterns, balance performance, inner ear function and future
      falls. After measuring movement patterns, inner ear function and balance at baseline, falls
      will be monitored through falls diaries, collected every third month during a twelve month
      period in a group of older persons, recruited through the non-profit association
      "Friskis&Svettis" in Malm√∂, Sweden. The study population will consist of senior members in
      the association, invited to workshops about balance.
