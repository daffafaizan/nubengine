      collects all incident CD cases and data from CD multiplex families (families with 3 or more
      CD affected patients) in the Nord the Pas de Calais the Somme and the Seine Maritime. If the
      investigators could demonstrate that most CD cases from multiplex families were related to
      high frequency of NOD2 gene mutations, the investigators found some CD multiplex families
      without any NOD2 gene involvement. Thus in these families high prevalence of CD cases may
      rely on other major genetic susceptibility variant(s) that remain to be determined.

      this clinical research Whole Exome Sequencing protocol, aiming to highlight genetics
      mutations with major effect in CD has been initiated.

      This study is a familial genetic study with intra-familial controls. The genetics analyses
      are:

        -  Ascertain of no significant NOD2 mutation in the family members by Sanger DNA sequencing

        -  WES (CD patients and family controls unaffected subjects)

        -  Genotyping of all mutations found, case control and segregation analyses to validate
           their implication in CD.
