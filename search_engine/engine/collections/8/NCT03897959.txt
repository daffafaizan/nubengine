      of the conventional urinary catheter will reduce problems with catheter blockage or
      catheter-associated discomfort. By eliminating the extended tip, the bladder wall will no
      longer be subject to the tip rubbing on the bladder wall. This could lead to fewer problems
      with blockages and less irritation and trauma to the bladder lining. A reduction in trauma to
      the bladder wall could reduce pain, bladder inflammation/irritation and the risk of urinary
      tract infections.
