      metabolic) determine the development of two trends in the treatment of glaucoma. One
      treatment modality is aimed at reduction of intraocular pressure, the other at therapy of
      hemodynamic and metabolic disorders. General and local drug therapy and physiotherapy,
      including electro- and laser stimulation of the retina and optic nerve and magneto-therapy,
      are used to correct these disorders. Modern ocular hypotensive agents are myotics and
      beta-adrenoblockers, adrenergic drugs, alpha 2-agonists, carboanhydrase inhibitors, some
      prostaglandins, osmotic agents. The progress attained in conservative therapy of glaucoma
      should by no means be overstated. In many cases only a combination of conservative and
      surgical methods of treatment helps preserve vision in a glaucoma patient.

      During the following investigation we will demonstrate that the use of Magneto therapy Ocular
      (MTO) reverses the symptomatology in Glaucoma patients. The use of Eyeglass magnetic prevents
      the development of Glaucoma disease.During the following investigation we will demonstrate
      that the use of MTO reverses the symptomatology of Glaucoma patients; the use of seawater as
      drops prevents the development of Glaucoma disease and the combined use of MTO and seawater
      is an effective therapy against Glaucoma disease that will cure a grand percentage of the
      patients.

      We will randomized 100 glaucoma patients and will treat them with MTO (group 1) and seawater
      drop (group 2) and combined group 3 and will compare results
