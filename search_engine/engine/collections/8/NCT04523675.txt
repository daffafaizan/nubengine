      oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is a key regulator of important transcriptional pathways that
      control the inflammatory response and recovery of skeletal muscle.

      The objective was to examine how thiol-based antioxidant supplementation affects the muscle
      damage, oxidative stress, inflammatory and immune responses, as well as the level of
      post-game fatigue and muscle's recovery kinetics in response to three soccer games within a
      week. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: i) Experimental-NAC
      [EXP-NAC, N=10, participated in daily training sessions and three games and received NAC (20
      mg/kg/day)], ii) Experimental-Placebo (EXP-Pla, N=10, participated in daily training sessions
      and three games and received Placebo), iii) Control-NAC [CON-NAC, N=10, participated in daily
      training sessions only and received NAC(20 mg/kg/day)] and iv) Control-Placebo (CON-Pla,
      N=10, participated in daily training sessions only and received Placebo). Blood samples were
      collected at baseline, post-games and daily during recovery. Performance was assessed at
      baseline and daily during recovery.
