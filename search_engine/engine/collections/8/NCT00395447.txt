      manufacturer advisory, and upgrade.

      Recently pacemaker and implantable cardioverter (ICD) advisories have created a dilemma for
      both physicians and patients. While the risk of device malfunction is low, replacement rates
      following an advisory are usually high and complication rates following device replacement
      are not widely known. One retrospective analysis of ICD advisories in Canada reported an
      18.3% replacement rate, and subsequent 8.1% complication rate directly related to the
      replacement.

      Device replacements also occur in order to upgrade an existing system. Clinical studies have
      shown that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) significantly reduces all-cause mortality
      and hospitalization in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). As a result of expanding
      indications for this therapy, many standard ICD patients are being upgraded to CRT-D systems.
      Complication rates related to upgrades of these systems are also not widely known.

      To our knowledge, the risk of complications following a device replacement has not been
      studied prospectively in any patient population. Limited data are available to guide
      physicians when weighing the risks and benefits of device replacement.

      This is a prospective multi-center study. 1750 patients at 100 clinical sites will be
      enrolled prior to generator replacement. Patients will be implanted and followed for 6 months
      to assess any complications related to the replacement procedure.

      Patients with any legally marketed device for explant can be enrolled. The replacement device
      can be from any manufacturer.
