    
      The primary purpose of this multicenter, randomized controlled study is to evaluate the
      impact of a physical activity program on fatigue in older patients (≥60 years) undergoing
      adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. The investigators also plan to evaluate physical
      function and quality of life as secondary objectives. The investigators' hypotheses are that
      people who undergo the physical activity intervention compared to those who do not, will: 1)
      report less fatigue, 2) report higher health related quality of life, and 3) have less
      decline in physical function. Additionally, The investigators will characterize ≥grade 3
      adjuvant chemotherapy associated toxicities in this older population, and describe the
      changes reported in fatigue, physical function, and HRQOL over the course of chemotherapy.
