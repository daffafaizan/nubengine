      lungs and diaphragm such as ventricular induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). Research
      has shown that after being on mandatory MV and sedated the diaphragm begins to atrophy within
      as short as 18 hours. The Lungpacer Diaphragm Pacing Therapy System (DPTS) is a temporary
      therapy that consists of the Lungpacer IntraVenous Electrode Catheter (LIVE Catheter) and the
      Lungpacer Control Unit system. The LIVE Catheter is a proprietary central venous catheter
      that incorporates pacing electrodes in strategic areas that align with the left and right
      phrenic nerves. The LIVE Catheter can also be used for fluid delivery like any other central
      venous catheter. The randomized clinical trial will investigate the safety, effectiveness and
      performance of the Lungpacer DPTS. By stimulating the diaphragm through daily therapy
      sessions, with the intention of exercising and rehabilitating the diaphragm muscle so the
      patient may be able to be more quickly liberated from MV. The patient population includes
      those who have been mechanically ventilated for greater than or equal to 96 hours (4days),
      have failed two or more spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and were not hypervolemic during
      the latest spontaneous breathing trial. Patients must have resolution of the initial
      indication for placement on mechanical ventilation before entering the trial.
