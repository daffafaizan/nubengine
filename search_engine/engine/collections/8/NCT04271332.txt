      bp4-bp5 deletion. Subjects will be randomized to treatment with either placebo or arbaclofen.
      Subjects and study staff will be blinded to treatment assignment throughout the study. Both
      placebo and arbaclofen will be administered as orally disintegrating tablets. Dosing will be
      flexible, with subjects titrating up to the highest tolerated dose, with maximum permissible
      dose dependent on age. The treatment period is 12 weeks, after which subjects will taper off
      of study drug. Subjects will be required to attend multiple study visits, and to communicate
      with the study staff by phone multiple times throughout the study.

      The primary efficacy assessment focuses on speech. Secondary and exploratory endpoints assess
      motor, memory, general cognitive, and other neuropsychological abilities, and brain
      electrophysiology. The safety evaluations include blood tests, physical exam, and assessment
      of adverse events.

      Subjects who complete study participation through the end of the Withdrawal Period may be
      eligible to enroll in a subsequent open-label study.
