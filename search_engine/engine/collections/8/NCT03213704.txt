      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) with advanced solid tumors
      (including central nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic
      disorders harboring NTRK 1/2/3 fusions.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with LOXO-101
      (larotrectinib) with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or
      histiocytic disorders with NTRK 1/2/3 fusions.

      II. To obtain additional information about the tolerability of LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in
      children with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      III. To provide preliminary estimates of the pharmacokinetics of LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in
      children with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive larotrectinib sulfate orally (PO) or via nasogastric (NG)- or gastric
      (G)-tube twice per day (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then periodically
      thereafter.
