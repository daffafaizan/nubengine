      I. To determine the overall survival of patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab,
      irinotecan and radiosurgery

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities of the combination of bevacizumab, irinotecan and radiosurgery.

      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients treated with bevacizumab,
      irinotecan and radiosurgery.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive
      irinotecan hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 15 beginning in course 2. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo radiosurgery 10-14 days after beginning bevacizumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 18 months.
