      a virtual reality device or to listen to music of their choice. Patients will still get the
      standard lidocaine/novocaine numbing agent. Patients will be asked questions about their
      anxiety level and pain level. Heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored as measures of
      anxiety and pain.
