      groups: 1) Acute kidney failure without hemodialysis, 2) Acute kidney failure (AKI) with
      intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) and 3) Acute renal failure with continuous renal replacement
      therapy (CRRT). All patients will be assessed for efficacy of the dose. Efficacy will be
      assessed by following clinically for any evidence of VTE, either deep venous thrombosis (DVT)
      or pulmonary embolism. In addition, lower extremity duplex studies will be performed at
      baseline and at the end of the study period to assess for DVT.

      Secondary objectives will be safety and accumulation. Safety will be determined by assessment
      of clinically significant bleeding, defined as a drop in Hgb of > 2 grams (gm) in 24 hr, or
      the need for red blood cell transfusion related to bleeding. Accumulation may occur in renal
      failure and will be studied throughout the intensive care unit (ICU) stay through
      reevaluation of levels over time.
