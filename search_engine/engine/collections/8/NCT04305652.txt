      frequency of diseases seen in old age has increased due to this situation. The most common of
      these diseases is Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative
      disease which causes cognitive decline and various neuropsychiatric behavioral disorders and
      disorders in daily living activities. The emergence of these symptoms of Alzheimer's disease
      leads to an increase in the costs of care provided and a great distress for caregivers. In
      the literature, it is recommended to use nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in
      the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. One of the non-pharmacological
      approaches is the interventions according to the Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold
      Model. In this method, taking into account the individuality of the patient, focusing on the
      interaction of the Alzheimer's patient with the environment and the rearranging of the
      environment for the reduction of cognitive abilities, focuses on creating a less stressful
      environment. Since this model uses the steps of the nursing process, home visits are made.
      This study will be carried out with Alzheimer's patients and caregivers from Aksaray
      University Education and Research Hospital's Home Health Services unit. In this study, it is
      aimed to determine the effect of interventions according to Decreased Stress Threshold Model
      on the level of neuropsychiatric symptoms and agitation of Alzheimer's patient and caregivers
      care satisfaction and life satisfaction.
