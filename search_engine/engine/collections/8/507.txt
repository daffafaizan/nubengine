1972. structural studies of a-crystallina-crystallin has been isolated from the cortexof ox lens by isoelectric precipitationfollowed by chromatography on deae-cellulose.the amino acid composition is inagreement with that reported for a-crystallinprepared by a different method.  thereis one thiol group/20,000g. of protein(20,000 is the order of magnitude of the sub-unit molecular weight), and disulphidebonds are absent.  the thiol group has beenalkylated with radioactive iodoacetatein the presence of urea.  partial acid hydroly-sis of the alkylated protein gives,according to the conditions, mainly 3 radioactivepeptides or nearly exclusively oneradioactive dipeptide.  the dipeptide is n-seryl-(s-carboxymethyl) cysteine, ser-cmcys.the 2 other peptides are probably the tri-peptides related to ser-cmcys.  thesimplest interpretation of these results is thatthe sequence around the cysteine residueis a common structural feature of the sub-units of a-crystallin.
