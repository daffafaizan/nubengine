      menstrual bleeding problems, infertility, and poor obstetric outcomes. No matter how
      excellent and standard surgical technique is applied, scar defects may develop after cesarean
      section. However, when cesarean operation decision is taken, the existing operational
      conditions can affect the formation of cesarean scar defect in the future. Although the
      surgical technique is the same, a planned cesarean operation and an emergency cesarean
      section may differ for a future cesarean scar defect that may develop in the future.
