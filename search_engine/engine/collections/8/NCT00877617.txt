      in a poor QOL, it may not be considered a reasonable option. To assess this critical issue,
      QOL surveys have been developed to determine the post-therapy impact of a given treatment.

      In prostate cancer, one of the most widely used validated survey instruments is the Expanded
      Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) .8 It contains 4 primary domains that elicit details
      regarding urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal function. The EPIC questionnaire has been
      widely applied, although it has not been administered to patients undergoing neoadjuvant
      investigational therapies prior to radical prostatectomy for HRCLPC. Obtaining this
      information will be important for counseling patients considering similar trials in the
      future since it will reflect long-term outcomes for functional recovery and mental health-two
      key concerns of patients deciding whether to enter clinical trials. Furthermore, researchers
      will be able to stratify these outcomes based on the specific treatment arm to possibly
      determine how to optimize outcomes while reducing negative impacts of a given therapy.

      This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of the QOL of prostatectomy patients who have
      received neoadjuvant treatment. Anticipated 131 patients will receive a brief survey by to
      complete and return by mail to M. D. Anderson.
