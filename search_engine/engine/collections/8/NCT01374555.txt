      ultrasensitive acoustic technology. The CardioSond produces a flow micro bruit score which is
      used to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease.

      The CardioSond exam will be given to patients two times: once prior to administration of
      vasodilators and potential beta blockade agents as part of the normal cardiac CT angiography
      protocol and again immediately post CT angiography. No other data will be taken on the
      patient and the patients involvement in the study will cease after data collection.

      CT angiography data will be analyzed at a core lab at Medstar Research Institute and withheld
      from SonoMedica until all CardioSond acoustic data is analyzed and flow micro bruit scores
      are determined.

      A data review panel lead by the principal investigator will examine the results of both the
      CardioSond and CT angiography data to determine the comparative accuracy of the CardioSond in
      detecting CAD in the study population.
