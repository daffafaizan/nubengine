      major impact on quality of life. More than 85,000 patients each year see their general
      practitioner (GP) with Achilles Tendinopathy (AT) which affects the lower leg in young and
      middle aged adults. The main treatment is physiotherapy, although surgery is eventually
      considered in 25-45%of patients, an intervention that requires several months of
      immobilisation and has unpredictable outcomes.

      Other treatments include, shockwave therapy, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) (a blood injection of
      platelet rich plasma) and steroid injections, but other than physiotherapy non have been
      shown to be better than placebo. There is a need for improved nonsurgical treatments. There
      is an established treatment in horses that involves injection of the horses own stem cells
      into the tendon, which has been shown to be effective but has never been used in man. We wish
      to translate the technology to humans and propose a pilot phase II trial to establish the
      safety of stem cells implanted in diseased human tendon. We aim to study 10 patients with
      chronic mid substance achilles tendinopathy to assess safety as our primary outcome measure.
      In addition we capture clinical outcomes scores and ultrasound appearances. Other than the
      stem cell injection, all assessments will be non invasive. Participants will be otherwise
      healthy adults, aged 18-70 and recruited from routine outpatient clinics at the Royal
      National Orthopaedic Hospital, presenting with a painful heel, diagnosed by a specialist as
      Achilles tendinopathy, and having already undergone a minimum of 6 months of physiotherapy.
      Each participant will have 6 months follow up. This study will help inform a larger clinical
      trial in the future for which a further ethics application will be made.
