      a 6 week screening/run-in and 12 week double-blind treatment period (composed of 2 phases;
      each 6 weeks in duration). Only those participants who do not meet low density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goals at the end of Phase I (Week 6), were eligible to
      continue into Phase II (Week 12).
