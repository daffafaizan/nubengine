      first 3 years of life. There are significant social and health care costs associated with
      RSV-LRIs. More than 3% of US children are hospitalized each year due to RSV and 500 die
      annually. Several longitudinal studies have also suggested that children who have RSV-LRIs
      are at substantially increased risk of developing asthma in the first 3 years after infection
      and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) many years after the primary infection. Mechanisms
      involved in RSV disease are not well understood. Recent reports suggest that RSV may initiate
      the innate immune response through the pattern recognition receptor, Toll like receptor-4
      (TLR4). In this project we will study the capacity for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
      in TLR4 gene to induce varying levels of inflammatory chemokine and cytokine production. It
      has been suggested that such a mechanism may result in altered immune responses to RSV
      infection and different clinical outcomes. This research has direct application to improving
      our understanding of bronchiolitis in early childhood, particularly those factors that
      influence severity of the disease, and may have implications for possible therapy of patients
      with bronchiolitis in the future.
