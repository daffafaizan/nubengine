      side-lying positioning (SLP) during bottle-feeding of preterm infants.

      METHOD: The study included forty two neonates (n=42) born ≤34 weeks of gestational age. Four
      bottle-feeding sessions were tested in each of the newborns: two in the SEP and two in the
      SLP. The position for the first study was randomly assigned, then positioning changed after
      each feeding session. In one day, only two consecutive feeding sessions which were included
      to the study in order to minimize fatigability as a disrupting factor. The levels of
      saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) were measured as the parameters indicative of the
      newborn's physiological stability. The factors determining the qualitative aspect of feeding
      included the total time of declines of SpO2 ≤85%, level of the newborn's alertness according
      to the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS), and the occurrence of choking episodes.
      The proportion of milk consumed (volume of milk eaten relative to the expected volume) and
      the duration of the feeding and feeding session were also recorded.
