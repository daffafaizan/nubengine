    
      Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or pathological stimuli or
      conditions.

      RFR is calculated as the difference between the measured maximum GFR achieved through a renal
      stress test and the baseline GFR measured in rest conditions. In clinical practice, the most
      common renal stress test is performed as a standardized protein loading test. Recently, in a
      pilot study, the investigators demonstrated a significant correlation between RFR and the
      intra-parenchymal renal resistive index variation (IRRIV) during an echo renal stress test in
      a cohort of healthy volunteers. IRRIV test has proven to be rapid, safe, bedside and easy to
      perform and it might represent a preliminary test in screening patients' RFR.The present
      pilot study is designed to explore the correlation between IRRIV and RFR under pathologic
      conditions.
