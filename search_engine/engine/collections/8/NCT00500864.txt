      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Twenty five
      patients are going to be included. They are going to come to the laboratory to receive IV
      placebo or IV Mg sulfate at two distinct occasions about 48 hours apart. Half of the patients
      are going to receive Mg first and Placebo at the second day, while the other half are going
      to receive the treatments in an inverse order. Tests are going to be performed before and
      about 40 minutes after the IV infusions. Tests to be performed are: spirometry, arterial
      blood gases, Mg plasma level measurements, and a maximal exercise test protocol in
      cycloergometer.
