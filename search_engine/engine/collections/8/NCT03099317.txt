    
      Objective:

      The proposal aims to examine the efficacy and safety of sinew acupuncture for knee
      osteoarthritis (KOA).

      Hypothesis to be tested:

      Sinew acupuncture can reduce pain intensity, and improve knee function and health-related
      quality of life without significant side effects for KOA subjects compared to a sham
      acupuncture.

      Design:

      A randomized, subject- and assessor-blind, sham acupuncture-controlled clinical trial

      Participants:

      Subjects (N=86) will be randomized into sinew acupuncture or sham acupuncture group (in 1:1
      ratio).

      Study instrument:

      Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC), Timed up & Go Test (TUG), 8-step Stair Climb Test (SCT) assessment, and the Short
      Form-36 (SF-36).

      Intervention:

      Sinew acupuncture group will receive 10 sessions of needling in 4 weeks. Sham group will
      receive the non-invasive intervention with the same procedures. All subjects are followed up
      for 6 weeks.

      Main outcome measures:

      VAS for knee pain intensity at week 4 serves as the primary outcome. VAS at other time
      points, WOMAC score, TUG, SCT and SF-36 will be analyzed as the secondary outcomes.

      Data analysis:

      Analysis will be on the 'intention to treat' principle. T-test and mixed-effect model
      analysis will be used to measure primary and secondary outcomes respectively.

      Expected results:

      Sinew acupuncture treatment can significantly reduce knee pain intensity, and improve knee
      function and quality of life without obvious side effects.
