      proliferation, programmed cell death and senescence, that ultimately control the number of
      cells in a population. The genetic damage that underlies the development of cancers has a
      diverse etiology and loss of DNA repair mechanisms also may play a role in allowing mutations
      to accumulate. Cancers are also characterized by the ability to invade surrounding tissues
      and to metastasize. Many of the molecular alterations involved in this process have yet to be
      elucidated.

      Gynecologic cancers afflict women of all ages. Cervical cancer is the most common gynecologic
      malignancy worldwide, accounting for over 400,000 cases annually. Endometrial cancer is the
      most common gynecologic malignancy with approximately 33,000 new cases being diagnosed
      annually in American women. Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer related
      mortality in American women, with approximately 14,000 deaths occurring from it in 2000.

      The creation of a tissue repository containing tissue specimens, blood/serum, and molecular
      extracts (DNA, RNA, protein) will provide a rich source of tissue for future gynecological
      disease research studies.
