      any improvement of the patients' status.

      In this study, an investigation of a possible method of optimization through speckle tracking
      of cardiac strains is attempted.

      Patients not responding to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy-Defibrillators (CRT-D) after 3
      months are randomly divided into control and intervention groups. Atrioventricular interval
      is adjusted so that E and A waves do not overlap and the interventricular interval
      subsequently optimized to yield maximum improvement of the sum of
      longitudinal+radial+circumferential strains. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
      and NYHA (New York Heart Association Classification improvement 3 months after optimization
      are evaluated and use of other strain combinations assessed.
