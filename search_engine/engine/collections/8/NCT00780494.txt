    
      Primary Objectives:

      To investigate if the addition of Bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy for metastatic or
      unresectable GEJ and gastric adenocarcinoma will improve PFS by 90% over historical controls.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assess toxicities using CTCAE v3.0

        -  Evaluate overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis

        -  Evaluate objective response rate (RR) by RECIST criteria

        -  Explore biomarkers of tumor response: CEA, CA 19.9, and serum VEGF

        -  Bank serum and tissue for future correlative studies

        -  Evaluate CT Perfusion to predict early therapeutic response to combination chemotherapy
           and anti-angiogenic therapy (OPTIONAL).
