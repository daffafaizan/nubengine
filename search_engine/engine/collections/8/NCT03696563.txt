    
      It is a single center study in Ottawa, Ontario Canada.

      This will be a single centered prehospital multi-period cluster crossover feasibility trial,
      enrolling patients in Ottawa, Ontario, who are treated by paramedics from the Ottawa
      Paramedic Service, who have been trained in the use of the automated oxygen delivery device.
      We will be using the FreeO2 device. Patients requiring oxygen therapy during prehospital
      transportation will be enrolled. No randomization will occur within this single centered
      feasibility study

      Patients requiring oxygen therapy during the prehospital transportation will be enrolled and
      will be included as soon as they are placed into the ambulance, until handover and transfer
      of care at receiving hospital.

      In both groups, SpO2 will be collected continuously every second with FreeO2 monitoring, in
      addition to the collection of vital signs carried out by the staff according to the
      standards.
