      of non-surgical periodontal therapy in patients with chronic periodontitis and uncontrolled
      type 2 diabetes.

      Regarding clinical and metabolic parameters at baseline, no differences were displayed
      between two groups. However, at 3-months follow-up period the patients within a test group
      were demonstrated better clinical outcomes than patients in a control group
