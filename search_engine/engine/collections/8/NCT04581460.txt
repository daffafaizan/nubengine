      origin which can associate, to varying degrees, an increased susceptibility to infections and
      immunopathological manifestations: allergy, inflammation, autoimmunity, lymphoproliferation,
      tumors malignant.

      Although their prevalence remains underestimated, there has been an increase in the number of
      cases diagnosed in the past 10 years. The national average prevalence is 8.6 patients per
      100,000 inhabitants and the diagnostic incidence is 400 new cases per year in France. Major
      improvement in the management of primary immunodeficiencies have drastically changed patients
      outcome. Most patients now reach adulthood and the possibility of carrying out a pregnancy
      project, that has already reported for patients suffering from hypogammaglobulinemia or
      variable common immune deficiency, is now increasingly reported for other types of inherited
      immunodeficiencies. Whereas the management of patients with hereditary immunodeficiencies is
      increasingly codified, contraception and pregnancy have not yet been the subject of
      recommendations: medical monitoring and the prevention of infectious complications thus
      remain at the discretion of the practitioner.

      The aim the research is to study the obstetric experiences of patients with a primary immune
      deficiency, paying particular attention to infectious complications.
