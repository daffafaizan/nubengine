      unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or
      antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that Interleukin-1
      (IL-1) plays a pathogenic role in several of these diseases. This exploratory study aims to
      examine the utility of anakinra in the treatment of adult subjects with Behcet s Disease
      (BD), a disease which shows similarities to the known anakinra-responsive autoinflammatory
      disorders, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS).
      Anakinra is a recombinant form of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that has been
      studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the autoinflammatory disorders. It has a half life
      of 4 to 6 hours with a FDA approved recommended dose of 100 mg/day subcutaneously for the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

      This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility of anakinra in the treatment of BD;
      2) the effect of anakinra on laboratory biomarkers in BD; and 3) an exploratory assessment of
      the safety of anakinra in individuals with Behcet's Disease.

      Subjects with oral or genital ulcers will receive anakinra for three to six months. If five
      of the initial seven patients have a positive response, up to 20 patients with oral or
      genital ulcers will then be randomized to withdrawal or continuation of drug for six months
      once placebo is available. Patients with eye disease will be treated with anakinra for a
      total of twelve months without randomization to withdrawal. Clinical and biochemical
      correlates of inflammation will be measured at appropriate intervals to assess response and
      to further understand disease mechanisms.
