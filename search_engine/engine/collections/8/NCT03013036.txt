      genitourinary surgery or inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia, were included in
      study. Patients with head or neck anomalies, syndromic patients, patients undergoing
      emergency surgery and patients with a history of difficult airway were excluded from the
      study. Patients were grouped according to their ages; Group I (1-2 years,n=38), Group II (3-5
      years,n=46) and Group III (6-8 years,n=35). USG measurements were performed following
      sevoflurane induction in groups I and II. In group III, USG measurements were performed
      following premedication with intravenous midazolam 0.05 mg/kg . Thyrohyoid distance, glottic
      and subglottic diameters were measured with ultrasonography. The size of the endotracheal
      tube according to Bae's formula ( internal diameter of Endotracheal tube = 0.705 x subglottic
      diameter - 0.091) was calculated and recorded. Before intubation, endotracheal tube
      (cuffed/uncuffed) was selected using age-related formulas. In group II, anaesthesia induction
      was achieved with propofol 2 mg/kg. In all groups, endotracheal intubation was achieved with
      fentanyl 2μg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. Endotracheal tube size was considered as optimal
      when a leak was detected at 20-30cmH₂O inflation pressures. If a resistance was felt in the
      subglottic region, the tube was exchanged with a smaller and was exchanged with a larger (0.5
      mm) size if a leak occurred at inflation pressures lower than 20cmH₂O. Intubation duration ,
      Cormack-Lehane scores and Intubation Difficulty Scale scores were recorded. For comparison of
      age related formula and Bae 's formula, only patients who were intubated with un-cuffed
      endotracheal tube were evaluated.
