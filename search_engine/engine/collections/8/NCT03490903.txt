      hypothesis that the use of VR will decrease patient anxiety and pain via validated scoring
      systems, as well as show a low rate of vasospasm of the radial artery.

      Patients will be eligible if they are greater than 18 years of age and undergoing an elective
      outpatient coronary angiogram with or without percutaneous intervention. Exclusion criteria
      will include patients with claustrophobia, seizure disorder, motion sickness, stroke within
      the past year, dementia, nausea, isolation status for infection control or those who do not
      wish to participate.

      Outpatients undergoing routine coronary angiography with or without possible percutaneous
      intervention will be screened for enrollment criteria. Those who agree to participate will be
      randomized to either the intervention or control arm. Those randomized to the intervention
      arm and agree to participate in the study will wear a VR Headset and headphones; those who
      are randomized to the control will receive the standard of care, which is moderate sedation
      for patient anxiolysis and pain control during the case. In both arms, the patient and
      operator will still be able to communicate verbally if needed to assess for pain, to ask
      questions, or to ask for anxiolytic or analgesic medications as needed. The procedure will be
      completed when vascular sheaths are just about to be removed.
