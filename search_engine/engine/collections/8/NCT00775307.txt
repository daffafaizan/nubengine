    
      The study will be conducted in two phases as follows:

        -  The Phase II component of the study will be a randomized, double-blind,
           placebo-controlled, multi-centre study performed in France only. After undergoing NSCLC
           resection, 140 patients will be randomized to receive either pazopanib 400 mg per day or
           placebo for 24 weeks.

        -  The Phase III component of the study will be a randomized, double-blind,
           placebo-controlled, multi-centre study performed internationally. Patients who have
           completed the Phase II component of the study will be followed and included in the Phase
           III. Additional patients will also be recruited to a planned total of 355 patients per
           treatment arm. New patients will be randomized to receive either pazopanib 400 mg per
           day or placebo for 24 weeks.
