      determined to be candidates for elective cerebral arteriography will be screened for
      inclusion in this study. Patients consenting to participate and enrolled in the study will
      first undergo their standard cerebral angiogram procedure, as clinically indicated. Once the
      procedure is completed, enrolled subjects will then undergo the study intervention.

        1. Insertion of an additional catheter in the femoral vein.

        2. Navigation of the catheter into the internal jugular bulb and then catheter navigation
           into the superior sagittal sinus will result in additional fluoroscopic time (requires
           ~60 seconds of additional fluoroscopy time; carries a minimum risk of vessel perforation
           or other untoward event [incidence of complication associated with this procedure in the
           PI patient series is 0%]). There is additionally some ear pain that can happen with this
           Venogram.

        3. 5-10 minutes of additional procedure time. Much of this time period is merely a waiting
           period while the pressures stabilize and are recorded.

        4. An additional venogram injection through the catheter which exposes subjects to an
           additional 1-2 ml of contrast dye and 3-4 seconds of additional fluoroscopy time and its
           associated radiation dose.
