      period followed by 6 weeks on stable dose). Then they will be reassessed for response during
      Period A; study drug will be discontinued and washed out over the following 2 weeks. They
      will then begin Period B on the alternate blinded treatment with similar titration and
      assessment, initially weekly and then every other week for a total of another 8 weeks. The
      purpose of the study is to determine whether Iloperidone is effective in the treatment of
      some symptoms in patients with PTSD, particularly difficulty falling or staying asleep,
      trauma dreams and daytime irritability or outbursts.
