      among the population. Studies estimate the prevalence of current chronic leg ulcers at
      approximately 1%. The most common cause (approximately 80%) is thought to be chronic venous
      insufficiency disease. Recurrent cellulitis is an additional common cause. The ulcers cause a
      significant morbidity and negative impact on the patients' quality of life. The care of
      chronic vascular ulcers places a significant burden on the patient and the health care
      system. Additionally, these nonhealing ulcers place the patient at much higher risk for lower
      extremity amputation.

      Natural Matrix Bio polymer Membrane (NMBM) is a novel topical cosmetic cream containing a mix
      of natural waxes, sugars and lipids. The aim of this study is to test whether of Natural
      Matrix Bio polymer Membrane (NMBM) is effective as an adjunctive therapy to the treatment of
      venous stasis and post-erysipelas leg ulcers.
