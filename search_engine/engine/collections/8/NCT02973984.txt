    
      The main objective of this observational study is to evaluate in a "real world" population of
      older hospitalized patients with AF, the clinical benefit/risk ratio of the anticoagulant
      treatments in terms of:

        1. mortality (all-cause and vascular mortality);

        2. thromboembolic events, i.e. stroke, systemic embolism;

        3. bleeding side-effects, especially intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding Secondary
           objective of the study is to evaluate whether a different prognostic profile, as
           determined by the MPI, is associated with 1) different kind of treatments for AF (no
           treatment vs anticoagulants, i.e. Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) or novel oral
           anticoagulant (NOACs); and 2) differences in the main outcomes (i.e. mortality, major
           thromboembolic events and side effects including bleeding events).
