      two groups. The first group are pregnant women in the second or third trimester. These women
      have definite rupture of membranes diagnosed by visual leaking of the amniotic fluid from the
      cervix during speculum examination. The second group are pregnant women with intact
      membranes. Assessment of both the qualitative and quantitative beta subunit of human
      chorionic gonadotropin will be done
