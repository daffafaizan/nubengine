      the safety and performance of a Class III medical device (GreenBone Implant) for the
      treatment of long bone defect. Bone defects can result from malformation, high-energy
      traumatic events, bone resection due to different pathologies such as tumors or infections,
      or from the treatment of complex non-unions. Current treatment of bone defects usually
      implies the use of bone grafts and/or biocompatible materials, to create a scaffold that
      bridges the defect. Autograft and Allograft are the treatments most currently used for large
      bone loss, but both treatments have significant disadvantages. These types of treatment carry
      the risk of transferring disease from animals and/or humans to the patient; there is also a
      risk of host local allergic reaction. Bone substitutes are devoid of the above risks and
      therefore they could be used alternatively to xenografts and allografts. GreenBone is a
      ceramic resorbable bone scaffold that has very similar structure to bone. It can be produced
      in large quantities, shaped easily and sterilised without losing its properties.
      Consequently, it is an ideal substitute that could be used to fill bone defects. This study
      will assess the safety of using GreenBone treatment of long bone defects up to 6 cm. Moreover
      it will assess its capacity of promoting new bone formation. The investigators will recruit
      25 patients with long bone defect and instead of bovine xenograft we will use the GreenBone
      implant for the long bone reconstruction. Patients will be followed up for 12 months in
      total.
