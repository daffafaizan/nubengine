    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability (toxicity profile) of EphA2-targeting
      DOPC-encapsulated siRNA (EphA2 siRNA) delivered via neutral liposome
      (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine or DOPC) administered intravenously in
      patients with advanced/recurrent malignancies.

      II. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) or maximal administered dose (MAD) using a
      modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine efficacy (EphA2 expression modulation) at the MTD or MAD. II. To evaluate the
      effect of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on tumor and endothelial cell apoptosis.

      III. To record the clinical activity (objective response, duration of response, and time to
      treatment progression) of intravenous (IV) EphA2 siRNA -DOPC.

      IV. To describe the symptom burden of patients receiving siRNA-EphA2-DOPC treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of siRNA-EphA2-DOPC in blood. II. To determine
      the effect of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on tumor perfusion, apparent diffusion, and metabolism by
      radiographic imaging (dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging [DCE-MRI],
      diffusion weighted [DW]-MRI and fludeoxyglucose F-18-positron emission tomography
      [18FDG-PET]).

      III. To determine the impact of EphA2 siRNA-DOPC on surrogate biomarkers in blood (cell-free
      deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA], plasma/serum markers [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      caveolin 1 (CAV1), soluble EphrinA1], and exosomes).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive EphA2-targeting DOPC-encapsulated siRNA IV over 120 minutes on days 1 and 4.
      Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
