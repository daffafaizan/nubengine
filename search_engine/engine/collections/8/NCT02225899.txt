      (the measurement of thousands of small chemicals in the blood), magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI, to assess energy capacity and thigh fat), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, to
      assess total and regional body fat and muscle), and indirect calorimetry (to assess resting
      energy expenditure and whole body fat oxidation). Clinically-relevant data, such as lung
      function, CF genotype, and diabetes status will be obtained from the electronic medical
      record and the CF Registry.
