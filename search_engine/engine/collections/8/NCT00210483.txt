      with or without aura in adults. Other studies have shown that almotriptan is effective and
      well tolerated in adults. Migraines in teenagers/adolescents are very similar to migraines in
      adults, except that the duration is usually less in adolescents (they last 1 to 24 hours in
      adolescents). This study will evaluate the usefulness of almotriptan malate (AXERT速) in
      treating acute migraine headaches in adolescents. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, and placebo-controlled study. During a 30-day run-in period, patients will
      treat their migraines as they normally would. During this time, the frequency and severity of
      headaches will be recorded. At the second visit, patients will be randomized (like with the
      toss of a coin) to a treatment group to receive one oral dose of almotriptan malate (AXERT速)
      6.25, 12.5, or 25 milligrams or placebo. Approximately the same number of patients will be
      assigned to each of the four treatment groups. Patients will take this one-time dose when the
      next migraine of at least moderate severity occurs. Patients will record assessments in a
      diary for up to 24 hours after the study drug is given to help determine the drug's effect on
      headache pain intensity. Patients will return for a third visit within 2 to 14 days from
      taking the study medication. A physical examination, electrocardiogram (a painless test of
      the heart), and laboratory tests will be performed at the first and third visits. The
      objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of 3 dosage
      strengths of almotriptan malate (AXERT速) in adolescents with migraine headaches.
