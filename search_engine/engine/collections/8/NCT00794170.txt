      knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; psychosocial predictors of compliance; health literacy;
      race and culture; and prescribed medication regimen. The intervention calls utilize
      interactive voice recognition technology to facilitate interest, participation, and
      interaction with call recipients. We evaluated the intervention in a randomized controlled
      trial with telephone interviews administered to all participants at baseline, 6, 9, and
      12-months
