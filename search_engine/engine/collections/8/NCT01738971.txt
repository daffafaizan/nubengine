      effective contraception after EC:

        1. Pharmacists would provide one packet of progestogen-only pills to women, so that they
           would have 28 days to arrange an appointment with contraceptive services to get a supply
           of ongoing contraception.

        2. Rapid access to a family planning clinic upon presentation of their empty(used) packet
           of EC. Women would be seen as a 'walk-in' (without appointment) and ongoing
           contraception discussed and provided.

      These interventions would be compared with the status quo, i.e. pharmacists give verbal
      advice and written information on local contraceptive services where ongoing contraception
      can be accessed.

      The interventions that we are testing are low cost i.e one packet of progestogen-only pills
      (£3 for most costly brand) plus additional consultation time with the pharmacist (estimated
      20 mins@ £1 per minute), versus the staff consultation time in a family planning clinic. In
      the family planning clinic, women would be seen as a 'walk-in' and so this may not add costs,
      since staff are already present.These interventions could, if shown to be effective, offer
      huge costs savings to the NHS, by reducing the costs of unintended pregnancies (abortion,
      miscarriage, birth).
