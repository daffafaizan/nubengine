    
      Tongji Hospital of Tongji University has developed an investigational approach for treating
      patients with CD19 positive B cell malignancy that involves taking white blood cells from the
      patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these
      specific cells with lentivirus to attack CD19 positive cells, and then giving the cells back
      to the patients.The main purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the
      treatment with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in the patients with chemotherapy resistant or
      refractory CD19 positive B cell malignancy including leukemia and lymphoma.
