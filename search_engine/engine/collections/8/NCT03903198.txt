    
      Prospective observational national multicentric study in 26 centres. Between june 2014 and
      october 2018 The investigators collected data about baseline characteristics, first recourse,
      in-hospital places of care and places of hospitalizations. Lengths of care and lengths of
      hospitalization.

      Collected data of each patient were reported on a specific assessment tool. The investigators
      ran a univariate analysis and logistic regression between steps of the care pathway and
      in-hospital mortality. The main result was validated by an analysis with a propensity score:
      association between a hospitalization in cardiology and in-hospital mortality.
