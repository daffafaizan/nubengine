    
      Prospective registry including patients accepted by the heart team for a TAVI procedure.
      Patients will undergo a prolonged continuous ECG monitoring using the CardioSTAT® device
      after hospital discharge. Following the TAVI procedure, continuous ECG monitoring will start
      just before hospital discharge and prolonged up to 4 weeks. There won't be any restriction
      regarding the type of valve and approach used for the TAVI procedure.

      All type of arrhythmic events will be recorded, as well as the specific therapeutic measures
      implemented upon the diagnosis of the arrhythmic event.

      Analyses of the CardioSTAT will be done at 2 and 4 weeks following hospital discharge.
      Clinical follow-up will be performed at 14 days (analysis of CardioSTAT® record), 28 days
      (analysis of CardioSTAT record), 1 year post-TAVI and yearly thereafter up to 5-year
      follow-up.
