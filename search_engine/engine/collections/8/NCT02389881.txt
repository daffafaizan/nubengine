      This study will enroll approximately 32 healthy non-elderly and 8 healthy elderly
      participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one
      of the five treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor
      during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Cohort 1 Non-elderly Healthy: TAK-058 25 mg

        -  Cohort 2 Non-elderly Healthy: TAK-058 75 mg

        -  Cohort 3 Non-elderly Healthy: TAK-058 150 mg

        -  Cohort 4 Elderly Healthy: TAK-058 25 mg

        -  Cohort 5 Non-elderly Healthy: TAK-058 300 mg

        -  Cohort 1-4 Non Elderly Placebo (dummy inactive solution) - this is an oral solution that
           looks like the study drug but has no active ingredient.
