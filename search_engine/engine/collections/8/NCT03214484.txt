    
      Our aim is to compare the evolution curves of the Visual Acuity (AV) measured in each patient
      on Electronic Tablet (TE)/ computer(O) and on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy
      Study (ETDRS) scale, in order to check the reliability of the measurements performed by TE /
      O by comparing them with a well-known reference measure And is routinely practiced routinely
      in ophthalmology centers.

      Measurement of visual acuity on TE / O will be carried out on an ETDRS AV scale, the size of
      the letters having been adapted to the reading distance (80 cm by 0.40 cm on the tablet). An
      ETDRS intermediate vision (EVI) or meadow vision (TEU) score according to the group will be
      established in the same way. The VA measurement will be supervised by a CRA trained to the
      extent of the VA, without the orthoptist or ophthalmologist being informed of the results
      obtained.
