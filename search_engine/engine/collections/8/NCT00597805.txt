      population of male and female patients treated with total, anterior or posterior pelvic
      exenteration. This unique approach to QOL assessment which is both domain-centered and able
      to emphasize individual differences through the C-SHIP model has the potential to set the
      standard for evaluating QOL in patients who undergo extensive pelvic surgery. The
      longitudinal design of this study facilitates the documentation of patients'responsiveness to
      change. By analyzing participants' responses at intervals we will be able to document the
      redefinition of life goals which occurs as patients adapt to their new health status. The
      data and analysis completed in first three years of this study will be used to generate
      further hypotheses for future investigation.
