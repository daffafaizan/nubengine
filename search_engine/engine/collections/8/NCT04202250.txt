      planned to include 90 adult patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty at GÃ¼lhane Training
      and Research Hospital between 10 December 2019 and April 2020. Continue femoral nerve
      catheter for postoperative analgesia will be included in the patients included in the study.
      These patients will be randomized to the catheter tip configuration as CEMP (closed-ended
      multiport catheter) group and OESP (open-ended single port catheter) group. Patient
      controlled analgesia device will be attached to the peripheral nerve catheter of these
      patients. Demographic data of the patients who have placed an femoral nerve catheter and used
      the catheter successfully for three days postoperatively, the number of pushing the button,
      the amount of bolus dose given and the total dose given in the patient controlled anesthesia
      device,the amounts of need for additional analgesia and pain scores(Numeric rating Scale),
      complications will be recorded for three days postoperatively. Records will be compared
      statistically.
