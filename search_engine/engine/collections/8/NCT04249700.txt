      38.5 C (101.3 F) using an infrared heating device is associated with significant reductions
      in clinical depression. This prior work utilized a Heckel WBH device, a medical device
      manufactured in Germany that is not FDA-approved and that is not widely available. The goal
      of this pilot project is to ascertain whether the Curve Sauna Dome, an infrared sauna that is
      readily accessible (i.e., can be purchased by consumers in the US) can be used to conduct WBH
      that achieves an internal body temperature of of 38.5 C (101.3 F) in healthy volunteers.
