      as it reduces recurrences by a third. The drug is administered intramuscularly (IM) but that
      creates discomfort and in many instances requires repeated office visits as the drug is
      administered weekly from 16-20 weeks until 36 weeks or delivery. AMAG Pharmaceuticals
      obtained FDA approval to administer the drug subcutaneously (SC) based on demonstration of
      bioequivalence of a dose of 275 mg SC to a dose of 250 mg IM. That bioequivalence study was
      performed in postmenopausal women who received a single dose. This study will be performed in
      pregnant women with repeated injections both to demonstrate that equivalent exposure is seen
      and to assess the side effects and acceptance of each route of administration.

      A pharmacokinetic (PK) study will be performed after participants have reached steady state
      (after 9 injections). Participants will receive their injections from research personnel up
      until the time of completion of the PK study. Home injections will be an option for all
      participants after the PK study is completed.
