    
      Women aged 20 and above, diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian cancer (FIGO stage II~IV), who
      had received debulking surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (either dose-dense or
      intraperitoneal) at our institution between 01 January 2006 and 31 December 2018 were
      included in the study. Patient characteristics, any treatment related side-effects
      (peri-operative and post-operative complications, chemotherapy related adverse events),
      treatment response (complete or partial response, stable disease or progressive disease),
      post-treatment surveillance (disease status: disease-free, recurrence or cancer-related
      death) will be recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis will be
      employed to evaluate the survival benefit of the two different chemotherapy methods.
