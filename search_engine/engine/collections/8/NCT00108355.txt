    
      This prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial compares the effect of a
      combination of vasoconstrictors (octreotide plus midodrine) to albumin on the time to
      recurrence of ascites in patients with refractory ascites treated with large volume
      paracentesis. The treatment allocation ratio for the two treatment arms is 1:1 using a
      stratified random permuted block design. Subjects are patients 18-80 years old with cirrhosis
      and ascites who are stratified according to the presence or absence of renal dysfunction at
      the time of randomization. Measurements include blood pressure, weight, girth, abdominal
      ultrasound, forearm blood flow, plasma renin activity, angiotensin, and aldosterone, repeated
      during a 6 month period.
