      and late onset intrauterine growth retardation.A total of 46 patients with severe early onset
      intrauterine growth retardation will be enrolled in a prospective case control study .

      Patients will randomly be allocated to two groups with 23 patients in each group.Sildenafil
      citrate therapy may increase the likelihood of increased growth velocity [measured by
      abdominal circumference (AC) (ultrasound)] for fetuses of pregnancies complicated by severe
      early-onset IUGR .Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific
      phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP which results
      in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Placental disease,
      consequent on deficient uteroplacental blood flow, includes FGR, pre-eclampsia, and placental
      abruption and has been implicated in more than 50% of iatrogenic premature births .For this
      reason, the problem of severe FGR forms a substantial portion of the population that tertiary
      care centres care.
