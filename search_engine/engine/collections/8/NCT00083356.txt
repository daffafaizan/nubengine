      tissues by a variety of inflammatory stimuli. Preclinical evidence, demonstrating that
      interruption of B1 receptor function causes analgesia under a variety of conditions, has been
      well established using selective antagonists and genetically modified mice. Accordingly,
      efforts are underway in several laboratories to develop novel B1 receptor antagonists as
      potential novel analgesic agents. The proposed studies will examine the kinetics of local
      induction of B1 receptors and kinin formation in a common situation of acute inflammatory
      pain in humans - tooth extraction. In addition, an examination of expression of additional
      genes of interest under these conditions using microarray analysis will be conducted.
