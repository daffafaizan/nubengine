      repair of cutaneous surgery wounds with full-thickness skin grafts improves scar cosmesis
      compared to wound closure with sutures. Our aims are to compare outcomes using a split wound
      model, where half of the wound is treated with 2-octylcyanoacrylate and the other half is
      repaired with sutures, per the standard of care. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be
      measured via the physician observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar instrument. Our
      hypothesis is that 2-octylcyanoacrylate will result in cosmetically superior wound outcomes.
