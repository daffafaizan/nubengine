      preserve pelvic organ function as much as possible.

      Fujii method has advantage of preserving pelvic autonomic nerve with radical resection of
      tissue under parametrium. And ontogenetic surgery has advantage of reducing need of radiation
      therapy by radical resection of tissue above parametrium.

      This study is prospective study for fusion ontogenetic surgery that has the advantage of both
      Fujji method and ontogenetic surgery.
