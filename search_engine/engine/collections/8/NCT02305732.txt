      practices. Each patient will be supported with platelets as clinically indicated in a manner
      that is consistent with the local standard of care. The study will be conducted in two
      phases. During the pilot phase, patients will sign informed consent to have study data
      collected following transfusion with conventional PCs. The objective of the pilot phase is to
      evaluate study logistics and data collection methods. During the INTERCEPT Treatment Use
      phase, patients will sign informed consent to receive INTERCEPT PCs, provide blood samples,
      and collect study data (demographics, transfusion data, and safety data).
