      compared with aspirin monotherapy respectively for the 1-year primary efficacy end point of
      vein graft patency. The primary comparison includes two separate parts. One is to demonstrate
      T+A better than A and the other is T better than A.

      One year rate of vein graft patency in the aspirin group is estimated as 80%. The assumed
      rate of ticagrelor plus aspirin is 90%. With a two-sided alpha level 0.05 and 80% power, 199
      grafts to each group are required. On the other hand, if we assume the rate of ticagrelor
      monotherapy has the 1-year vein graft patency rate of 87%, under the same two-sided 0.05
      alpha 441 grafts in each arm will offer 80% power to show the superiority of ticagrelor along
      for the primary efficacy end point.

      Combined the above two assumptions, if the allocation rate is 1:1:1, this study needs to
      recruit 1,323 grafts in total (441 in each) to achieve the pre-specified power for both the
      two comparisons (T+A vs. A and T vs. A).

      The principle investigator assumes that the average number of the vien grafts in one patient
      is 2.7-3.0. With this assumption, 500 patients are to be recruited, which will provide us a
      total of 1350 - 1500 grafts.

      According to the above, this study will be a confirmatory clinical trial to the primary
      endpoint.
