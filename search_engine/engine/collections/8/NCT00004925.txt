        -  Determine the safety, especially the cardiac safety, of doxorubicin HCl liposome and
           trastuzumab (Herceptin) as first- or second-line therapy in women with metastatic,
           inflammatory, or locally advanced breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior anthracycline therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour followed 30 minutes later by
      trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every
      21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed for at least 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
