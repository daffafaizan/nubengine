      (ESCC) is the predominant type in China, accounting for over 90% of all esophageal cancer.
      Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) remains the standard therapy of locally advanced
      ESCC. However, the outcome remains poor.

      The aberrant activation of Hedgehog (HH) signaling is associated with a variety of human
      malignancies. Previous studies found that the reactivation of HH pathway occurs in 60% of
      esophageal cancer. Targeting the Hh pathway for cancer therapy was expected to work wonders
      in Hh-dependent cancers. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been shown to inhibit the Hh
      and AKT signaling pathways.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      combined with Itraconazole in patients with locally adcvanced esophageal squamous cancer
