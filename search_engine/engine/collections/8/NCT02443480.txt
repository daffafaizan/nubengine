      and follow up of patients at risk of developing colorectal cancer. With the increasing demand
      for colonoscopies, the number of procedures performed in recent years has increased
      dramatically (Bjorkman & Popp Jr., 2006). Given that performance of a high quality
      colonoscopy is dependent on the expertise and technical skills of the endoscopist,
      quantitative and reliable methods for measurement of the quality of colonoscopy are needed.
      Although other colonoscopy quality indicators, such as adenoma detection rate, have been
      studied comprehensively (Rex, et al., 2006), patient comfort as a measure of endoscopic
      quality performance has not been thoroughly assessed.
