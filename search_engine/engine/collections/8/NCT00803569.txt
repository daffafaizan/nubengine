      Day 1 and 100 Î¼g of the GM-CSF sargramostim on Days 1 through 4 in continuous 28-day cycles
      for up to 6 cycles. No dose escalation of either vaccine component was permitted. Patients
      received study vaccinations until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Safety was evaluated by continuous monitoring of adverse events (AEs), concomitant
      medications, and vital signs, as well as through hematology and chemistry laboratory testing
      and physical examinations. Efficacy was determined through tumor response evaluations, cancer
      antigen (CA)-125 levels, and cellular and humoral immune responses (i.e., NY-ESO-1-specific T
      cells, antibodies to NY-ESO-1 and ALVAC, and delayed-type hypersensitivity [DTH] testing).
