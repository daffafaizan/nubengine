    
      Primary carpal tunnel release (CTR) is the most common surgical procedure of the hand, but
      reported rates of symptom recurrence are not uncommon. Many surgical techniques have been
      proposed and reported for management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptom recurrence,
      however there is a paucity of data on flexor tenosynovectomy for management of recurrent CTS.

      This study will evaluate clinical and functional outcomes using information from pre- and
      post-operative physical exams, surgery data, patient-reported satisfaction and symptoms, and
      scores on functional measures, such as the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH)
      questionnaire.
