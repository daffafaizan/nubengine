    
      CANInform, the Canavan disease natural history study, will be the first multinational effort
      to rigorously gather both retrospective and prospective data from this patient population.
      Data collection will include extraction of retrospective data from medical records of living
      patients and deceased patients, and collection of prospective, longitudinal data from living
      patients and their parent(s)/caregiver(s). Motor function assessments will be performed in
      the home by qualified study team members. In addition, families will be invited to attend
      clinic visits or will be followed by the clinical site remotely for up to 3 years.
