      LEM.

      II. Measure the blood pharmacokinetics of LEM following IV administration.

      III. Observe any anti-tumor effects of LEM.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open-label study for patients with advanced and/or metastatic,
      histologically-documented solid tumors considered to be unresponsive to available
      conventional treatment.

      LEM will be administered IV over 45 minutes. At least three patients will be studied at each
      dose level and at least three patients will complete one 21-day course before any patient is
      enrolled at the next dose level. Study drug administration will continue on an every 3-week
      schedule in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. A subsequent course
      of treatment may be administered at least 21 days after a prior LEM dose has been
      administered when study criteria are met.

      Cohorts of 3 patients per dose level will be studied. This will be expanded to 6 if a DLT
      occurs, followed by a total of 6 patients at a possible MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 21 to 30 patients will be entered into the study to
      determine the MTD: 3 per dose level, expanded to 6 if DLT occurs, followed by a total of 6
      patients at a possible MTD. The dose level identified as the MTD may then be expanded up to
      12 patients to permit additional safety assessment.
