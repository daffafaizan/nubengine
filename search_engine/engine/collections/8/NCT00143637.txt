      controlled variations of dust spiked with Glucan. Their responses are monitored before, after
      minutes and hours of exposure and later the same evening.

      Two groups of subjects are selected in a pre-investigation using strict selection and
      exclusion criteria. The two groups are atopic persons and responders to Histamine in a RSM
      nasal provocation test.

      The groups are exposed under controlled conditions in a climate chamber at IMA to office dust
      spiked with Glucan (same procedure and amount as in DAMOS) at clean air level (less than 20
      micro-g/m3 (TSP) and at 150, 300 and 700 micro-g/m3 (TSP). In the pre-investigation and
      during the exposure sessions a number of personal characteristics are measured or registered
      to be used in the statistical analyses as explaining variables for the responses of the
      subjects.

      The dust exposure will be characterized both though its size distribution and gravimetrically
      using up-to-date analytical instruments. To optimise the exposures several pilot studies are
      made. Only effects measures, which previously have shown clear indications of responses to
      dust exposures, are included in the study.

      The timetable includes pre-investigations, two repetitions of the exposure design (run 1 and
      2), analyses of the bio-samples, statistical analyses, and reporting.

      The study includes a main study and several additional work-packages, which will be activated
      when funding become available.
