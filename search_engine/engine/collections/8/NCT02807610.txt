      been an important component of anaesthetic management.The ability to deliver safe and
      effective anaesthesia with minimal side effects and rapid recovery is critically important to
      ensure safe and early discharge. An ideal intravenous (IV) anaesthetic agent should, have
      rapid onset, rapid recovery, be without undesirable cardiac and respiratory depression and
      lesser untoward effects like pain on injection, nausea, vomiting etc.No single drug is ideal.

      Propofol (propofol 1%) has a smooth and rapid induction, rapid recovery, cerebro-protective
      effect but it causes hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression pain on
      injection.Etomidate is a hypnotic agent causing minimal histamine release and very stable
      hemodynamic profile. In the present study, investigators evaluated the induction
      characteristics and side effect profile of this newer lipid formulation of etomidate and
      compared it with propofol in same lipid formulation.

      Material and Methods: Hundred ASA I & II patients in the age group 18-60 yrs, scheduled for
      dilatation and curettage procedure were randomly allocated in two groups based on induction
      agent Etomidate lipuro or Propofol.

      Both groups received intravenous midazolam 0.02mg /kg and fentanyl 2 Âµg /kg as premedication.
      After induction with the desired agent titrated to bispectral index Entropy 40, the time to
      achieve BIS values to 40 (BIS 40 time) were measured. Heart rate, mean arterial pressures
      were recorded at baseline, induction and upto 10 minutes. Patients were asked for pain at the
      injection site, postoperative nausea and observed visually for myoclonus, apnea and
      thrombophlebitis.
