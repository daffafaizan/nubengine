      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on vascular smooth muscle responsiveness to the
      nitric oxide pathway that we have observed in an animal model of Congestive Heart
      Failure(CHF) can be exploited in humans with PAH. Furthermore, we have identified a group of
      genes TAO kinase I, IL-10, Rho kinase, Raf1, bile acid coenzyme A and Fmr1 that are modulated
      by long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in our animal model, and
      therefore may also be modulated by ACEI in patients with PAH
