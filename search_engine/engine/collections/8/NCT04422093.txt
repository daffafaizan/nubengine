      elastics are inserted between the upper and lower jaws to adjust the position of the jaws in
      relation to each other. The wearing time of the elastics determines the duration of the
      treatment and the quality of the treatment results. While micro-sensors are increasingly used
      for removable appliances to monitor patient compliance, there is still no such possibility
      for fixed appliances. This gap is to be closed with the planned 'OrthoKontrol' (intraoral
      mini-sensor). This is intended to measure and record the wearing time of the elastics.
