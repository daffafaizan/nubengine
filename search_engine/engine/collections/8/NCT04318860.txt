    
      This study aimed to quantify pain after elective colorectal surgery and to identify risk
      factors for postoperative pain.

      Patients: This prospective cohort study includes all consecutive patients undergoing elective
      colorectal surgery at Ume√• University Hospital in Sweden between March 2013 and April 2017.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients who do not score pain at any of 4 postoperative days.

      Primary outcome:The primary outcome measurement is the Numeric rating scale (NRS), graded
      from 0-10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst imaginable pain [18]. Moderate pain is
      defined as NRS 4-6 and severe pain as NRS 7-10. The patients are questioned by nurses each
      morning after day of surgery, postoperative day. 1, postoperative day 2 and postoperative day
      3 to score the maximum pain during the previous 24 hours using the NRS.

      All data are registered in Enhanced recovery after surgery database (EISA)

      Clinical variables: Baseline clinical variables are assessed preoperatively. They included
      age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking, a diabetes mellitus diagnosis and American
      Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class. The postoperative course is registered prospectively in
      Enhanced recovery after surgery register (EIAS) and include preoperative oncological
      treatment, a histopathologically verified cancer diagnosis, the length of hospital stay and
      complications, including any complication, Clavien-Dindo 3b or more and anastomotic leakage
      within 30 days after surgery High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) is measured every
      postoperative morning.
