      injection of cultured autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) to the
      ankle joint in patients with severe ankle osteoarthritis. Patients will undergo bone marrow
      aspiration and will receive cultured BM-MSCs one month later. Patients will be assessed
      clinically with scoring system (FAO, VAS, WOMAC) preoperatively as well as 2 and 6 months
      postoperative to measure pain reduction and joint function improvement. Paraclinical studies
      (X-Ray and MRI) will be performed before and 6 months after treatment.
