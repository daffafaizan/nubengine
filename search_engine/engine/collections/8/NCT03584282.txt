      disproportionate impact among cisgender men and transgender persons who have sex with men and
      transgender persons (MSM/TG), with methamphetamine (meth)-users being at particularly high
      risk. Despite apparent high levels of PrEP knowledge and exceptional insurance and medication
      coverage, few meth-users in Western WA have enrolled in local PrEP programs. The
      investigators' preliminary work with meth-using MSM/TG has identified both traditional
      barriers to PrEP and barriers specific for meth users, including competing priorities (e.g.,
      getting high); lack of regularity in daily schedules leading to difficulties complying with
      appointments and medication adherence; and concomitant wellness and social concerns, notably
      depression and meth-related stigma. Additional work is needed to develop new strategies to
      increase PrEP uptake and support persistence and adherence among meth-using MSM/TG. Building
      on their preliminary work, the investigators will pilot text messaging and peer navigation
      interventions to support PrEP use among meth-using MSM/TG with potential to be
      cost-effective, scalable, and easily adaptable. The first, peer navigation, has been studied
      in ARV treatment and has been proposed for PrEP. The second, text messaging, has been shown
      to increase ARV and PrEP adherence.
