      (RDS) received 100 mg/kg of porcine surfactant preparation via an intratracheal catheter
      during spontaneous breathing. In the control group infants treated with InSurE procedure were
      intubated and ventilated to receive surfactant and placed on nCPAP rapidly after surfactant
      administration. The procedures were compared for short-term efficacy and possible
      complications.
