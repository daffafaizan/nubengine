    
      The trial proposed is a three arm phase II treatment protocol designed to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of risk-adjusted chemotherapy-based cytoreductive regimen plus a CD34+
      selected T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) stem cell transplant for the
      treatment of patients with Fanconi anemia and severe hematologic disease. Candidates for this
      trial will include patients with Fanconi anemia presenting with severe marrow failure
      (transfusion dependent) or myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myelogenous leukemia for whom
      an allogeneic stem cell transplant is indicated.
