      adaptable brief motivational intervention for perinatal drug abuse via embedding motivational
      principles in a self-contained interactive computer system. The Motivation Enhancement System
      (MES) will utilize a touch-screen, audio enhancement, and an interactive narrator to guide
      women in the immediate post-partum period through evaluation (thus facilitating self-report)
      and a one-time motivational intervention. A taxi voucher will be provided to further
      facilitate entry into treatment, and multiple tailored self-help mailings will be issued
      following discharge. If validated, this intervention could offer a highly cost-effective,
      replicable, and prescriptive method for increasing self-change and treatment involvement in
      drug abusers. Following development of the MES, a preliminary pilot phase will study the use
      of the MES with post-partum drug-using women and make necessary modifications, using data
      from participant debriefings and a single-case research design. After optimization of the
      MES, a clinical trial will randomly assign 120 post-partum drug-using women into treatment or
      assessment only conditions, with a 3-month blinded follow up to evaluate intervention effects
      on drug use and treatment involvement. Toxicological and self-report measures, as well as
      objective analysis of infant development, will be utilized. Participants will be lower
      socioeconomic status urban women.
