      genome of human scabies that can be utilized to identify the parasite through polymerase
      chain reaction or PCR. The goal of the project is to design an assay that can distinguish
      samples from skin scrapings containing scabies mites, eggs, or fecal material confirmed by
      clinic based microscopic evaluation (gold standard) from negative controls (i.e. scrapings
      for tinea and/or demodex folliculitis) that do not contain Sarcoptes scabiei. We hypothesize
      that specifically amplifying the unique regions of the Scabies genome using PCR can serve as
      a means to diagnosis infestations in humans. To address this question, we will optimize PCR
      amplification of known scabies samples then apply our procedure to DNA extracted from patient
      samples.
