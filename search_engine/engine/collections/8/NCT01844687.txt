      marijuana's psychoactive effects is called THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Another
      cannabinoid in marijuana is cannabidiol. It is found in smaller quantities than THC.
      Cannabidiol is thought to interfere with the effects of THC. Therefore, synthetically
      produced cannabidiol is given to healthy marijuana users in this study to test its capability
      to reduce the high of THC and, thereby, help to relieve addiction to marijuana.
