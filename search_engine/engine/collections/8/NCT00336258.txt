      of the most common complications seen in cancer patients Early detection of VTE can identify
      patients who may benefit from anticoagulant therapy and prevent morbidity and mortality.

      There are recommendations for hospitalized cancer patients who are bedridden with an acute
      medical illness to receive prophylaxis, but in practice this is not clear cut.It has been
      shown, in other selected groups of patients that Ultrasound Doppler can be used in order to
      diagnose asymptomatic DVT (deep vein thrombosis). Hematological coagulation tests, including
      procoagulant microparticles will be performed for the evaluation of coagulation profile, in
      order to evaluate the possible correlation between the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT and
      these laboratory parameters.
