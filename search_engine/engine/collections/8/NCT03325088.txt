        -  15 patients with severe asthma, without oral corticosteroids treatment.,

        -  6 patients with mild to moderate asthma without treatment,

        -  21 controlled samples from smooth muscle cells of non-asthmatic deceased donor Bronchial
           endoscopy with bronchial biopsies will be assessed in all asthmatic patients, Control
           samples will be obtained from tracheobronchial rings of cadaveric donor. Expression and
           activity of Rac1 in airway smooth muscle will be determined by immuno-staining on
           paraffinised biopsies.

      Patients will undergo two study visits (D0: inclusion visit, D15: exploratory visit) and one
      phone call at D21.
