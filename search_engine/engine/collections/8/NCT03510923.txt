      of pathology for histopathological examination. This is most likely not necessary in
      appendices and gallbladders that are not suspicious for a tumour when inspected visually or
      by palpation. If not detected by visual inspection or palpation, the tumour is usually of
      early stage and already treated with the resection of the organ. A policy of selective
      histopathological examination based on the intraoperative findings of the surgeon can
      probably reduce the amount of appendices and gallbladders that have to be examined by the
      pathologist, without a risk of undertreatment, with less risk of overtreatment and huge
      savings annually. In the FANCY study, a nationwide prospective multicenter observational
      cohort study, all appendices and gallbladders will be evaluated for tumours by visual
      inspection and palpation by the operating surgeon. The operating surgeon will report his or
      her findings and also write down whether he or she thinks there is an indication for
      histopathological examination. Subsequently, all specimens are sent to the pathologist for
      histopathological examination. Therefore, no aberrant findings will be missed due to this
      study. The prospective cohort can be compared through modelling to a hypothetical situation
      where appendices and gallbladders are only examined by the pathologist on indication. The
      primary outcome is the number of patients per 1000 examined appendices/gallbladders with a
      neoplasm requiring additional therapy benefitting the patient that would have been unnoticed
      in the policy of selective histopathological examination.
