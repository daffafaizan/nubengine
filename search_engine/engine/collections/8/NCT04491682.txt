      circumstances, blood pressure, basic history of infertility and blood pressure will be
      collected. Blood tests, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), OGTT
      2h blood glucose and insulin, blood lipids, SHBG, sex hormone levels, anti-m√ºllerian
      hormone(AMH), creatine kinase(CK) and renal/liver function tests will be performed before
      treatment to evacuate their basic conditions. Each subject will receive body fat testing by
      Inbody 520.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Patients will receive MA (megestrol
      acetate) 160 mg by mouth daily for at least 6 months on Arm I. Patients will receive MA 160
      mg plus rosuvastatin 10mg by mouth daily for at least 6 months on Arm II. Then hysteroscopy
      will be used to evaluate the endometrial condition every 3 months, and intra-operative
      findings will be recorded. Complete response (CR) is defined as the reversion of endometrial
      atypical hyperplasia to proliferative or secretory endometrium; partial response (PR) is
      defined as regression to simple or complex hyperplasia without atypic; stable disease (SD) is
      defined as the persistence of the disease; and progressive disease (PD) is defined as the
      appearance of endometrial cancer in patients. Continuous therapies will be needed in PR or
      NR. Patients with PD will be recommended for hysterectomy.

      Two months of maintenance treatment will be recommended for patients with CR, and
      participants will be followed up for 2 years.
