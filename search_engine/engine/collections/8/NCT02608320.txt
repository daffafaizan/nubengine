    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), single-center,
      parallel-group single-application, modified 3-way crossover study. Each participant will
      receive the marketed reference formulation (DURAGESIC) or the JNJ-35685-AAA-G016 or
      JNJ-35685-AAA-G021 fentanyl transdermal system (TDS). The study consists of a screening phase
      within 21 and 2 days before the first TDS application of the first period; a
      partially-blinded treatment phase consisting of 3 single-application treatment periods; and
      end-of-study or withdrawal assessments done upon completion of the 72-hour adhesion
      assessment on Day 5 of Period 3 or upon withdrawal. A 7- to 16-day washout period will
      separate the treatment periods, commencing at transdermal patch removal. The duration of
      participation in the study for an individual participant will be 31 days to a maximum of 68
      days (including screening and follow-up visits). Participants will be primarily evaluated for
      cumulative adhesion percentage. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
