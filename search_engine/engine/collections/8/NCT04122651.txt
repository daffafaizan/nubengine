      of toric intraocular lenses, with a focus on suitability for NHS cataract surgery. This study
      will involve the use of standard, "off-the-shelf" toric lenses rather than having them
      specifically tailored and ordered for each individual patient. Eligible participants (>1.25 D
      of corneal astigmatism) will be randomised, receiving a toric IOL with either a 2.00 or 4.00
      diopter (D) correction, depending on the degree of pre-operative astigmatism, or a toric IOL
      individually tailored to and ordered for each patients' precise degree of corneal
      astigmatism. With the "off the shelf" toric IOL group the correction of the astigmatic
      refractive error will be refined with the use of adjunctive limbal relaxing incisions LRIs
      and/or off axis rotation of the toric IOL (based on a standardized protocol) so the full
      amount of corneal astigmatism can be targeted for correction for each patient. The clinical
      outcome will then be measured and compared between the 2 groups. Independent safety
      monitoring will be performed.
