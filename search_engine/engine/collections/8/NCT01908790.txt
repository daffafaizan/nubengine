      hemodynamic monitoring, which only measures arterial blood oxygenation. The clinical
      application of venous oximetry is numerous, including severe sepsis and septic shock, severe
      trauma and hemorrhagic shock, and heart failure and cardiac arrest.

      The existing method for venous blood oxygenation monitored is either through an invasive
      fiber optic catheter, or intermittently by blood sampling and CO-Oximetry. However,
      catheterization can be costly and can include inherent risks. Therefore, due to the inherent
      risks of catheterization, venous oximetry is limited only to critically ill patients.

      By non-invasively monitoring venous blood oxygenation, the Mespere Oximeter provides more
      complete information on patient hemodynamics.
