      capacitation, and function. Elevated ROS levels, from processes such as infection or
      inflammation, can be associated with male infertility and also decreases the overall ICSI
      success rates[1][2]

      Several techniques are available for measuring ROS, but only Mioxsys can measure the
      imbalance between production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activity of the antioxidant
      defense system in semen in terms of sORP. Mioxsys is a robust test that gives the result in a
      very short time, so it became applicable to test sORP on day of ICSI [2]

      Injection with sperm selected by PICSI dishes or testicular sperm aspiration (TESA) is
      thought to decrease or eliminate the unwanted ROS but none of them was reported to be more
      efficient than the other with regards to the clinical outcomes.

      A sperm selection technique based on sperm membrane binding to hyaluronic acid (PICSI Dish),
      the main substrate of the oocyte zona pellucida, could improve the likelihood of obtaining
      better sperm for ICSI. It is thought that excessive ROS damages sperm membranes, reduces
      sperm motility, and induces sperm DNA damage [3]

      The topographic assessment of sperm chromatin integrity throughout the male genital tract
      suggested that there is a disruption in DNA packing during spermiogenesis that does not allow
      sperm chromatin to withstand oxidative stressors, possibly compounded by a compromised total
      antioxidant capacity in the seminal fluid [4]. The utilization of testicular spermatozoa may
      represent a viable option for men with high ROS level in their ejaculates.
