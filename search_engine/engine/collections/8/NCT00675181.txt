      Melatonin, a natural hormone of the pineal gland exclusively released during the dark phase,
      exhibits vasodilatatory effects in distal skin regions and reduces core body temperature.
      This study investigates whether exogenous melatonin (5mg p.o. at 2p.m.) in the afternoon,
      when no endogenous melatonin is secreted, increases not only distal skin blood flow, but also
      choroidal blood flow and changes oxygen consumption. Two subject groups were studied, women
      with vasospastic syndrome (VS) and controls. The main hypothesis is: melatonin normalizes
      distal vasoconstriction in VS.

      Further questions will also be answered:

      Does melatonin affect basal metabolic rate, increase choroidal blood flow and reduce the
      vasospastic syndrome (VS)?

      Do women with VS exhibit:

        -  a different basal metabolic rate

        -  a reduced choroidal blood flow

        -  a reduced increase of oxygen consumption after intake of ice-water

        -  a different oxygen consumption after melatonin intake

        -  a different choroidal blood flow after melatonin intake

        -  a different oxygen consumption after melatonin intake and after intake of ice-water....?
