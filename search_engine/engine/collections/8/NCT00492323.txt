    
      Postherpetic neuralgia is a distressing syndrome of neuropathic pain that continues for at
      least 3 months after the resolution of the varicella-zoster rash (shingles), can last up to
      years later, and for which therapies are often limited by incomplete pain relief and side
      effects. This is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      the Investigator or the patient know the name of the assigned study medication),
      placebo-controlled, crossover, parallel-group, multicenter study to determine the
      effectiveness and safety of 200 mg of RWJ-333369 given twice daily for 4 weeks compared with
      placebo in patients with Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN). The study hypothesis is that 200 mg of
      RWJ-333369 given twice daily for 4 weeks will be more effective than placebo in reducing pain
      due to PHN, as measured by average daily PHN pain scores. Patients will receive 200 mg of
      RWJ-333369 or matching placebo tablets, given in equally divided doses twice daily by mouth,
      with or without food, for 4 weeks in each of the 2 treatment periods.
