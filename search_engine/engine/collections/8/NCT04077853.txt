      delivery of the fetus along with the placenta. Progesterone supplementation in the form of
      17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) is currently used obstetrically to prevent
      recurrent preterm birth in patients with pregnancies not complicated by preeclampsia.
      Previous studies reported that patients with severe PE had significantly lower serum
      progesterone concentrations than gestational age- and race-matched non-preeclamptics.
      Moreover, supplementation of placental ischemic rats with 17-OHPC decreased blood pressure,
      inflammatory cytokines, and ET-1 within 24 hours of treatment
