      surgery via an open abdominal approach will be randomized into two arms:

        1. Control Group: Morphine patient-controlled-anesthesia (PCA) for the initial 24 hours
           post-operation with a low-dose basal rate (0.5mg/hr) and patient administered boluses
           prn. Oral oxycodone from 24-48 hours post-operation will be used prn for pain and then
           patients will be transitioned to oral combined oxycodone/acetaminophen for the remainder
           of their hospital stay. Normal saline 100cc IV will be infused as placebo every 6 hours
           for a total of eight doses with the first dose being given at time of anesthesia
           induction.

        2. Experimental Group: Morphine PCA for the initial 24 hours post-operation with low-dose
           basal rate (0.5mg/hr) with patient administered boluses prn. IV acetaminophen 1,000mg
           will be given every six hours for a total of eight doses with the first dose being given
           at time of anesthesia induction. Oral oxycodone from 24-48 hours post-operation will be
           used prn and then patients will be transitioned to oral combined oxycodone/acetaminophen
           for the remainder of their hospital stay.

      Outcomes that will be analyzed include the amount of opioids used; time to return of bowel
      function designated as passage of flatus; time to first bowel movement if it occurs while
      inpatient; duration of hospital stay; and patient symptoms and satisfaction at the 24 and 48
      hour marks as well as at time of discharge.
