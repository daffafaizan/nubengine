      extracorporeal circuit, was one of the key advances that led to the rapid development and
      expansion of hemodialysis use, and remains the mainstay in hemodialysis practice today.

      However, anticoagulation during hemodialysis of the patient at high risk for bleeding remains
      a frequently encountered problem in the nephrology practice. The need for anticoagulation to
      prevent clotting of the extracorporeal blood circuit and the need to prevent anticoagulation
      related bleeding complications in the patient has led to the development of numerous
      strategies; the safest from a bleeding standpoint being anticoagulant-free hemodialysis.

      Streamline® bloodlines (Medisystems® Corporation, Lawrence, MA) are designed to eliminate
      blood-air contact. A pressure pod measures arterial and venous pressures without any
      blood-air contact. The venous chamber is run without an air gap. It is also designed so that
      blood flows in a circular vortex manner. This airless system is thought to provide several
      benefits: improved dialysis efficiency and blood flow rates, reduced heparin use and clotting
      rates.

      The goal of this study was to prospectively examine the Streamline® airless tubing system in
      an inpatient setting and its association with clotting rates, and dialysis efficiency.
