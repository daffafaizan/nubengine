      Immediate Training, or 2) Delayed Training groups. The Immediate Group will train for 3 mo
      shortly after recruitment. The Delayed Group will go through the same measurements from the
      time of recruitment and at 3 mo later (with no training in between) to obtain a 3 mo change
      score which will serve as a control measure for the Immediate Group. The Delayed Group will
      also train after the 3 mo delay, when all control measures have been taken. Comparison of the
      improvements made by children who started training <2 yr old with those >2 yr old will answer
      the question if training at <2 yr old is better than >2 yr old. Finally, to determine if
      there are long term effects of this training, we will compare outcomes of these trained
      children with another group of children with the same injuries but no intensive training
      (i.e., too old for the training study), when all children turn 4 yr old. Clinical, kinematic
      and electrophysiological measures will be taken to help us understand not only the efficacy
      of the treatment, but also the neural mechanisms that might underlie improvements in outcome.

      We are measuring outcomes at multiple times because change scores are of most interest. All
      children change as they age, so it is critical that we compare the change score with and
      without intervention.
