    
      Wounds represent a frequent reason for admission to emergency department (5 to 7% of visits),
      inducing pain and anxiety due to the trauma itself and also to the treatment, stitches being
      the most frequently used procedure.

      Alternative, non-pharmacologic strategies may help reduce pain and anxiety associated with
      painful bedside procedures. Music is one of them, easy to use and without any side effects.

      Music therapy has already been shown to reduce pain and anxiety levels in children during
      medical procedures (blood test, vaccination, lumbar puncture) and in adults during surgical
      or anaesthetic procedures.

      Our objective is to apply this technic to adults in emergency departments during stitches
      wound management.

      This is a study before / after the implementation of a music therapy protocol during stiches
      wound management. During the music period, the participant will choose and listen to one of
      the five playlists (vocal jazz, instrumental jazz, piano, world music, Mozart) created by a
      professional music therapist, via headphones. There will be no change in stitches wound
      management.

      Pain and anxiety levels will be measured by visual analog scale before, during and after the
      stitches procedure.
