      abdominal cavity to perform NOTES procedures has been obtained by transgastric, transvaginal,
      transvesical and transrectal approaches. The first successful NOTES procedure in humans was
      an appendectomy in India. Transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy has been successfully performed
      and reported in a handful of cases in the US, Europe and South America. However, to date,
      there is lack of clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and feasibility of Transvaginal
      NOTES cholecystectomy in a larger group of patients.
