      anticoagulation. The new European guidelines recommend that anticoagulation should be started
      already before cardioversion in all patients with CHADS2VASC score indicating need for
      long-term oral anticoagulation. The evidence behind these guidelines is, however, scarce. In
      this retrospective study we collect data on the safety of acute AF cardioversion from
      emergency rooms of two university hospitals and one secondary referral center from the years
      2003-2010.

      Inclusion criteria:

      All patients admitted to emergency room because of acute AF in whom electrical or
      pharmacological cardioversion was attempted <48 from the beginning of the symptoms.
