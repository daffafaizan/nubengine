      less than 12 weeks, usually 6 to 8 weeks, provided blood samples for measurement of
      thyrotropin, free thyroxine(FT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb). Women were assigned
      to a screening group in PUMCH (in which measurements were obtained immediately) or a control
      group in HMCHH (in which serum was stored and measurements were obtained shortly after
      delivery). Each group enrolled 1000 pregnant women separately. Women with positive findings
      in the screening group were given individualized levothyroxine treatment and regular
      follow-up. Compare the pregnancy outcomes, IQ at 2-3 years of age in children of women with
      subclinical hypothyroidism between two groups.
