      receiving) long-term extension study. The study will consist of 2 open-label Phases: 4-week
      Induction phase (if applicable) and Open-Label Optimization/Maintenance phase (variable).
      Participants will enter the study Induction Phase from ESKETINTRD3001 (NCT02417064),
      ESKETINTRD3002 (NCT02418585), ESKETINTRD3003 (NCT02493868), ESKETINTRD3005 (NCT02422186) and
      ESKETINTRD3006 (US sites only). Participants will enter the study Open-Label
      Optimization/Maintenance phase from ESKETINTRD3001 (NCT02417064), ESKETINTRD3002
      (NCT02418585), ESKETINTRD3003 (NCT02493868) (if appropriate at week 16) or ESKETINTRD3006 (US
      sites only). In the Open-Label Induction Phase, participants will self-administer
      flexibly-dosed esketamine nasal spray. During first 4 weeks in Optimization/Maintenance Phase
      responder participants from the induction phase of study 54135419TRD3008, will continue on
      the same dose of esketamine nasal spray from the induction phase and have a weekly intranasal
      treatment session frequency. Participants entering the optimization/maintenance phase from
      study ESKETINTRD3005 will also have a weekly intranasal treatment session frequency. However,
      as the ESKETINTRD3005 intranasal study medication is blinded at the time of entry into the
      current study, the dose of esketamine nasal spray will be administered as outlined in
      protocol. Participants entering the optimization/maintenance phase from study ESKETINTRD3003
      (Direct Entry) or ESKETINTRD3004 who were ongoing in the Optimization, Maintenance, or
      Optimization/Maintenance phase, respectively, will have the option to have their current
      intranasal dosing frequency adjusted at the time of entry into 54135419TRD3008 study and
      should remain on the selected frequency from week 1 to week 4. A one-time dose change will be
      permitted at study entry. After 4 weeks, esketamine nasal spray treatment sessions will be
      individualized to either once weekly or once every other week at the fixed 2-week interval
      (based on clinical global impression - severity [CGI-S] performed at that visit), and every 4
      weeks for participants dosed at the 4 week interval. Participants safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
