      the clinical management of underlying vascular lesions, especially when they are found in
      asymptomatic individuals or individuals with symptoms not related to the disease. Therefore,
      there is an urgent need for the development of reliable biomarkers based on hemodynamic
      parameters, which can then enable improvements in risk assessment in patients presenting with
      these lesions. This need can be met by non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      techniques that provide information on high resolution vascular anatomy, visualization of
      cerebral hemodynamics and quantitative information about blood velocity. However, such
      techniques as presently employed at 1.5 or 3 Tesla are limited by spatial resolution and
      prolonged data acquisition times.

      The primary goal of this proposal is to overcome these current limitations by exploiting
      Ultra-High Fields (UHF, i.e. â‰¥ 7 Tesla (7T)) to attain significantly higher spatial
      resolution, faster acquisitions and increased lesion conspicuity utilizing

        -  Qualitative exploration of intracranial blood hemodynamics,

        -  Quantitative imaging of the spatiotemporally resolved blood velocity vector,

        -  Derivation of hemodynamic parameters.
