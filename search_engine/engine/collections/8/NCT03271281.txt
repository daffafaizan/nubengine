    
      The radioligand 68Ga-NODAGA- E[c(RGDyK)]2 targets the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence known to
      bind with the αvβ3 integrin that is expressed on the surface of angiogenic blood vessels or
      tumor cells. The radioligand can be used to visualize tumor angiogenesis using PET/CT.

      A total of 120 NET patients will be subjected to an angiogenesis-PET/CT scan. Follow-up will
      be performed (from the time of the angiogenesis PET/CT) at 6 months for disease specific
      survival (DSS) and a 1 year follow-up for PFS and OS. The uptake of 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2
      (Standardized Uptake Values, SUVmax) in tumor lesions will be quantified as Standardized
      Uptake Values (SUVmax/SUVmean) and compared with PFS, DSS and OS (dichotomized above/below
      median SUVmax and analyzed by Kaplan-Meier).
