      performed one procedure so this study was observational. All patients with a chronic anterior
      instability requiring bone grafting (Instability Severity Index Score>3) were included. The
      Latarjet procedure was performed by mini-open approach (set Arthrex, Naples, FL) in the first
      group, and by arthroscopic approach (set Depuy-Mitek, Raynham, MA) in the second group. The
      analgesic postoperative protocol was standardized (paracetamol, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory, tramadol).
