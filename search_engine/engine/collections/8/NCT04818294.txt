      with rheumatic disease or traumata. The electric charge is created by a generator which can
      produce a high electrostatic field. The electrical voltage is delivered to the hands via a
      metal handle and is spread over the entire body surface. After the short treatment, the
      patient is completely discharged and earthed again.

      Over 100 patients in eight pain centers are to be included into this trial in order to show a
      statistically significant reduction of pain.
