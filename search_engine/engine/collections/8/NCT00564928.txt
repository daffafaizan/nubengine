      role in the cell is to control the proper folding, function, and viability of various
      "client" proteins. Many of these client proteins (such as AKT, Her-2, Bcr-Abl, PDGFR-Î±, and
      c-Kit) are oncoproteins or important cell signaling proteins. Inhibition of HSP-90 leads to
      the proteasomal degradation of these proteins.

      In patients with HRPC,there are several proteins that are important in the progression of
      HRPC, including AR, AKT and Her-2. All of these are client proteins of Hsp90 and in response
      to Hsp90 inhibition are degraded by their proteasome. Preclinical studies have shown that
      Hsp90 inhibition causes a dose dependent degradation of these client proteins and growth
      inhibition of prostate cancer in xenograft tumors.
