      receiving surgery followed by sunitinib therapy comparing with surgery followed by imatinib
      Secondary Endpointï¼šTo evaluate the overall survival of the patients with progression
      receiving surgery followed by sunitinib therapy comparing with surgery followed by imatinib
      the relationship of c-kit secondary mutation and progression free survival of surgery
      followed by TKI therapy the safety and tolerability of the two therapy.

      Statistics:All the statistical analysis is performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM
      corporation, United States). Pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare categorical
      variables. PFS and OS analyses were estimated with Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test and
      multivariable analyses were performed to assess survival difference. A two sided p-value of
      <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
