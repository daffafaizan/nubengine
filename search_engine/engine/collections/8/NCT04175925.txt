      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which will investigate the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of single and multiple oral doses of BMS-986322 in healthy
      subjects. The trial consists of three parts: Part A - a single ascending dose (SAD) safety
      and pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation; Part B -a multiple ascending dose (MAD) safety, PK, and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluation; and Part C - effect of food and pH on PK and safety.
