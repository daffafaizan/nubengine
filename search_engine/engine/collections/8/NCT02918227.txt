      (BPH). This surgery is accompanied by a change or even a loss of ejaculations externalized
      what constitutes the main constraint for patients. Empirically, the investigators talk to the
      patient "retrograde ejaculation" to explain a possible loss of ejaculation. Yet the
      underlying mechanism of this modification or loss of ejaculation remains completely unknown.
      No study could not determine whether the predominant mechanism was a real retrograde
      ejaculation or aspermia. Moreover, technical changes are sometimes tempted to preserve
      antegrade ejaculation but no scientific rationale can not validate.
