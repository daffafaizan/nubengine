      depressed and remitted states, frequently leaving patients with decreased quality of life and
      impaired psychosocial function. IT solutions has during recent years emerged as a possible
      way to optimize treatment, but the effects of digital health interventions are rarely
      investigated scientifically in health care services.

      This is an application from the entire Mental Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark
      including all psychiatric centers in the region. The Smart Bipolar randomized controlled
      trial is a pragmatic trial aiming to investigate the effects of smartphone-based add on
      treatment in large scale clinical practice (N= 1000 patients). Findings from the study will
      have great impact on future IT monitoring and treatment in bipolar disorder.
