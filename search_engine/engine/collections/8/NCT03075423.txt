      CAncer of non-clear cell SubTypes) is a Phase II, randomized, open-label investigator
      initiated trial (IIT) of Nivolumab (BMS-936558) combined with Ipilimumab vs standard of care
      in subjects with previously untreated and advanced (unresectable or metastatic) non-clear
      cell renal cell carcinoma (nccRCC). In the Phase I setting, Nivolumab combined with
      Ipilimumab has demonstrated substantially greater clinical activity, as measured by objective
      response rate (ORR), than either agent alone in metastatic RCC (mRCC). Given the durability
      of responses associated with immunotherapies, Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab is
      hypothesized to lead to greater clinical benefit, as measured by overall survival (OS) rate
      at 12 months as primary endpoint and OS at 6 months and 18 months, progression-free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) as secondary endpoints compared
      to standard of care in this patient population. This study will allow for direct comparison
      of OS rate at 12 months between both arms.
