      groups. Patients in the intervention group will have the stoma closed 8-13 days after stoma
      creation and will be compared to patients in the control group where the stoma is closed
      after a minimum of 12 weeks (standard treatment in Denmark and Sweden).

      Before randomization the eligible patients undergo a CT of the rectum to visualise the
      anastomosis and possible leakage. Furthermore, the local investigators may choose to
      supplement the CT with a rectoscopy.

      The research group includes 89 patients over an expected period of 4 years. Both groups are
      examined for postoperative complications as well as stoma-related complications at discharge
      and 3, 6 and 12 months after stoma creation.

      The research group also examines the impact on patientsÂ´ health-related quality of life at 3,
      6 and 12 months after stoma creation.

      Finally the socio-economic effect in both groups will be analyzed and compared 6 and 12
      months after stoma creation.

      An interim analysis is planned for safety as well as recalculation of statistical power.
