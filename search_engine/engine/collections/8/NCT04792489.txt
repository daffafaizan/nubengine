    
      A prospective, single arm, open label, multi-center, phase II study of autologous T cells
      engineered against both CD19 and CD20 antigens for subjects with relapsed or refractory DLBCL
      after receiving at least two lines of therapy. The investigational agent is the MB-CART2019.1
      cells. After successful screening, subjects will undergo leukapheresis to collect product for
      manufacturing. In preparation for the fresh product infusion, subjects will undergo a
      lymphodepleting regimen with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Cell infusion will be
      administered intravenously at a dose of 2.5 x 106 CAR+ cells/kg body weight. The study will
      start with enrollment of 3 subjects in the lead-in safety phase, and after safety is
      evaluated, the study will continue with enrollment of the remaining subjects. Subjects will
      be followed for up to 2 years, for efficacy and safety outcomes as well as health-related
      quality of life (HRQol). Additional long-term follow-up will be conducted for participants
      under a separate long-term follow-up protocol.
