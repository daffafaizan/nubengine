    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of abiraterone (abiraterone acetate) and prednisone with
      luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist given as neoadjuvant and concurrent therapy
      with external beam radiation in patients with localized prostate cancer.

      II. To determine whether pharmacologic suppression of the prostatic androgen axis by
      inhibition of androgen production with abiraterone can decrease tissue androgen levels to
      below those observed with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist suppression of
      testicular androgens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether treatment with abiraterone acetate with luteinizing releasing hormone
      agonist will be more effective than agonist with bicalutamide in inducing inhibition of
      androgen-regulated gene expression and increased apoptotic cell death as assessed by
      immunohistochemistry, complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray analysis and
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

      II. To evaluate time to prostate-specific antigen progression in patients treated with GnRH
      agonist with abiraterone acetate.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally and prednisone once daily for 24 weeks. Patients
      also receive leuprolide acetate or goserelin in weeks 1 and 13. Patients undergo external
      beam radiotherapy starting in week 15 for 8.5 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.
