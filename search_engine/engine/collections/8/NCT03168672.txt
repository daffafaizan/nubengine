      up at similar intervals to reflect the standard clinical practice and intended population for
      wider use of the device.

      157 non-randomised subjects will be recruited from approximately 15 sites. A maximum of 30
      subjects may be recruited from one site. More than one implanting surgeon may recruit
      subjects at each site as a designated sub-Investigator.

      The primary objective of this PMCF study is to confirm device survivorship of the GLOBAL ICON
      stemless humeral component at 24 months post-operative.

      The secondary objectives include the evaluation of clinical performance, radiographic
      performance and safety outcomes at 3, 12, 24, 60 and 120 months post-operatively.

      Tertiary endpoints in the study will include a mean change from baseline for the Adjusted
      Constant-Murley Score, the Oxford Shoulder Score, the EQ-5D-5L dimension score and EQ-VAS
      scores. Radiographic evidence of aseptic loosening and periprosthetic fracture survivorship
      of the GLOBAL ICON stemless humeral component will be assessed.
