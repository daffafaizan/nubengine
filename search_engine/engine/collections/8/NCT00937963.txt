      amounts of DAG and monoacylglycerol. TAG consists of 3 fatty acid ester, whereas
      diacylglycerol oil has 2 fatty acid esters linked to a glycerol backbone. Recently, Watanabe
      et al., developed a process by which the ratio of glycerides found in plant oils such as
      soybean, canola (rapeseed), or corn can be shifted from TAG to DAG, leading to the formation
      of oil composed largely of DAG. Commercially, DAG oil is produced by esterification of fatty
      acids derived from natural edible plant oils in the presence of lipase enzyme. Commercially
      produced vegetable DAG oil contains >80% DAG, <20% TAG, <5% monoacylglycerols, and small
      amounts of emulsifiers and antioxidants to maintain quality. The main constituent fatty acids
      of DAG oil are oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), and linolenic (C18:3) acids, present as 1,3-
      and 1,2 (or 2,3)-DAGs in a ratio of 7:3, respectively. These structural differences may be
      responsible for the purported metabolic effects of DAG compared to TAG oil, DAG oil has fewer
      fatty acids than TAG, and DAG-oil with a greater proportion of DAG in the sn-1,3 versus
      sn-1,2 form may be more readily oxidized. Thus, the effects of DAG oil on increasing LDL-C
      would be expected to be less than TAG oil.
