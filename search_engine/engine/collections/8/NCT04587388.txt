    
      Patients with histologically confirmed follicular lymphoma are registered in the study at the
      time of the first event after first line treatment. An event is defined as
      refractory/relapsed disease documented by biopsy, imaging, or clinical evaluation.
      Registration is based on the locally established histological diagnosis, with exclusion of
      cases diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology, while tru-cut core-needle biopsies are
      permitted in the study. Registration will be done on-line on a key restricted accessible
      web-database: the Investigator must complete the on-line registration form after obtaining
      informed consent dated and signed by the patient.

      Investigators are requested to register consecutive cases diagnosed at each participating
      Institution (all patients satisfying Inclusion criteria without any further selection). A
      patient number (Patient ID) will be assigned strictly sequentially in ascending order as
      patient's eligibility is verified. In case a patient's eligibility is not confirmed and the
      patient is withdrawn from the study, the patient number will not be reused. The assigned
      number will be used as the identification code for the subject.

      Every registered case has to undergo histopathology review by a panel of experts. The
      reference pathologist will collect and review the pathology material sent by the
      participating centers, without knowledge of the clinical outcome of the patient. Both
      material obtained at diagnosis, and at relapse will be reviewed. Classification will be
      performed according to the World Health Organization recently published.
