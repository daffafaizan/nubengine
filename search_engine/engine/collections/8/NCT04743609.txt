      outpatient syndromic surveillance by adding laboratory multiplex testing of LRTI samples
      (RSV, Influenza, SARS-COV-2) 2. Follow all bronchiolitis through the PARI RWE database and
      document "patient journey" for 5 years after first medical visit 3. Review the electronic
      PARI data of three previous seasons in order to document the impact of LRTI attributable to
      RSV in children < 2 years in France prior to enhanced surveillance
