      who undergo the minimally invasive repair of a pectus excavatum deformity with bar placement.
      This is intended to be a definitive study.

      Power calculations based on the known length of hospitalization listed above with Î± = 0.05
      and power of 0.8 show the need for 55 patients in each arm. The primary end point will be
      reached during the hospital stay; therefore, we expect a very small amount of attrition and
      will intend to recruit 110. One group will undergo an attempt for epidural regional analgesia
      (epidural) for post-operative pain control. The other groups will receive patient controlled
      intravenous systemic analgesia (PCA).

      Both groups will have the same management algorithm. All data will be analyzed on
      intention-to-treat basis.
