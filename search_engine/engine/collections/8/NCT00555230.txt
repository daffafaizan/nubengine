      Hospital will be recruited for this double-blind, randomized, placebo-control trial. Patients
      were matched to 150 controls on the basis of age (within 5 years), sex, body mass index
      (+/-5Kg) and ethnicity for the cross sectional study on the prevalence of subclinical
      atherosclerosis. Controls were healthy individuals recruited from the same community who
      underwent similar imaging protocols of the IMT and PWV assessments.

      Primary outcome is the improvement of atherosclerosis by Rosuvastatin therapy, evaluated by
      IMT and PWV.

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  Prevalence of premature atherosclerosis in RA patients compared to healthy controls in
           terms of the presence of plague and PWV.

        -  Correlation between clinical parameters, inflammatory markers (CRP/hsCRP, TNF-alpha and
           IL-6) and atherosclerosis (evaluated by IMT, the presence of plaque and PWV).

        -  Relation among PWV, ABI and AI in RA patients, and clinical significance of their
           combination.

        -  Determine which segment's PWV has a better relation with RA disease activity.
