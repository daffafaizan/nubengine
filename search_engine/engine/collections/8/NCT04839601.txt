      17 with partial (focal) onset seizures who have undergone diagnostic testing that localized
      no more than 2 epileptogenic foci, are refractory to two or more antiepileptic medications,
      and currently have frequent and disabling seizures. For the purposes of this study, disabling
      seizures are defined as motor partial seizures, complex partial seizures, and/or secondarily
      generalized seizures. The RNS System is currently approved by the FDA for use in patients 18
      years and older with hard-to-treat partial-onset seizures. The same device will be used in
      the RESPONSE Study.

      The study is a prospective open label single arm pivotal study and participants will be
      followed for 2 years after placement of the RNS System. The study will enroll a maximum of
      200 subjects within the United States to ensure that at least 150 subjects are implanted with
      the RNS System.

      The study design includes one interim analysis which will occur after the 75th implanted
      patient reaches 12 months post-implant. If the study achieves its primary safety and
      effectiveness endpoint goals at the interim analysis, the study will be considered successful
      and enrollment will be stopped.

      If the interim analysis does not achieve the primary safety and effectiveness endpoint goals,
      the study will continue enrolling up to the maximum of 200 patients. A final analysis will be
      conducted after the 150th implanted patient reaches 12 months post-implant.
