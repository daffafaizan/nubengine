      expression posttranscriptionally by degrading messenger RNA (mRNA) targets and by blocking
      their translation Secondary endpoints will include The adverse cardiac clinical events (MACE)
      in terms of cardiac death,periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI),spontaneous MI and target
      vessel revascularization(TVR). Related parameters of qi and blood are the material basis of
      blood conversion and objective performance is used to evaluate the effect on Tongguan capsule
      on patients with blood stagnation, which can be either interpretation theory of qi deficiency
      and blood stagnation and mutual transformation between qi and blood can find targets through
      Tongguan capsule on blood . Routine laboratory tests are used for screening patients basic
      situation and ensure the safety of the experiment The traditional Chinese medicine syndrome
      scale Including the the score of deficiency of qi and score of blood stasis syndrome mainly
      used to identify patients with the traditional Chinese medicine syndrome type Approximately
      100 patients in Coronary Heart Disease Patients with Blood Stasis Syndrome undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention will be enrolled and randomized to divided into Qi
      -stagnation and blood stasis, Qi- deficiency and blood stasis, after the PCI surgery, Qi
      deficiency and blood stasis group were randomly divided into Tongguan capsule group and the
      control group, and qi stagnation and blood stasis group, too ,giving patients through
      Tongguan capsule 3 pills three times a day(1.5g/day), once every three months follow-up,
      after have been followed up to six months
