      women experience appreciable pain at some time during their menstruation. An estimated 600
      million work hours are lost annually to this affliction with an average loss of time of two
      or more workdays per year per female employee. Treatment of dysmenorrhea may include either
      non-pharmacological or pharmacological measures. Pharmacological treatments include oral
      contraceptives to treat hormonal imbalances, over-the-counter analgesics or non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs. The Vipon is a tampon with a small motor unit within, which produces
      vibratory stimulation. This study aims to provide information on the safety and efficacy of
      the Vipon in a randomized controlled clinical trial.
