      it starts as a relapsing-remitting disease with distinct attacks and no symptoms between
      flares. Over years or decades, virtually all cases transition into a progressive disease in
      which insidious and slow neurologic deterioration occurs with or without acute flares.
      Relapsing-remitting disease is often responsive to immune suppressive or modulating
      therapies, while immune based therapies are generally ineffective in patients with a
      progressive clinical course. This clinical course and response to immune suppression, as well
      as neuropathology and neuroimaging studies, suggest that disease progression is associated
      with axonal atrophy. Disability correlates better with measures of axonal atrophy than immune
      mediated demyelination. Therefore, immune based therapies, in order to be effective, need to
      be started early in the disease course while MS is predominantly an immune-mediated and
      inflammatory disease. While current immune based therapies delay disability, no intervention
      has been proven to prevent progressive disability.The investigators propose a randomized
      study of autologous unmanipulated peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
      comparing two different conditioning regimens: (1) cyclophosphamide and rabbit
      anti-thymoglobulin (rATG) versus (2) cyclophosphamide, rATG, and Intravenous Immunoglobulin
      (IVIg).
