      It also will be investigated whether the referees prioritize one of the performances, motor
      or cognitive, during the dual-task and whether their role in the competition makes a
      difference compared to athletes. For this purpose, appropriate motor and cognitive tasks were
      determined by considering the roles of the referees during the competition.

      After completing the Demographic Information Form respectively; Edgren Side Step Agility Test
      as motor performance assessment, Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) as cognitive performance
      assessment, and finally Dual-Task evaluation using MOT and Edgren Side Step Agility Test will
      be applied simultaneously. Dual-task costs will be calculated as a percentage of single-task
      for both motor and cognitive tasks.
