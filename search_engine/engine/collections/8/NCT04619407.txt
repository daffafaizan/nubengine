      This study aims to collect information on teachers and childcare educators as well as on
      pupils and preschoolers in the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern

      Over a 5 month period, 5 study visits per participant are planned. At each visit,
      nasal/throat swabs (for PCR testing) will be collected and participants will be asked to fill
      in a questionnaire (asking for SARS-CoV-2 risk factors, perceived risk, and impact of the
      pandemic on their quality of life). In adults, additional blood samples (for SARS-CoV-2
      antibody testing) will be collected at the first and the last study visit. This will help to
      gain a better understanding of viral load and antibody development over time.

      The remaining blood samples will be stored in a repository for future research.

      The study is part of a modular SARS-CoV-2-research programme of the University Medicine
      Greifswald.
