    
      This is a 2-part, non-randomized, open label, multi-site Phase 1 study. the study design
      consists of 2 parts: Part A (Dose Escalation), in which the RP2D is determined, and Part B
      (Expansion Cohorts), in which subjects are treated with the determined RP2D.

      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (bb2121).
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to bb2121 infusion. All subjects who have received
      bb2121 infusion will be followed for up to 60 months on CRB-401.

      All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the study after
      receiving bb2121 for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination criteria, will
      be asked to continue to undergo long-term follow-up in a companion study for up to 15 years
      after their last bb2121 infusion, with a focus on long-term safety and efficacy.
