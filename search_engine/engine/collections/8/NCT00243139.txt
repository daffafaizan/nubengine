      2-4% of the adult population. The repetitive obstructions are located in the pharyngeal
      airway, leading to sleep fragmentation and resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness with
      consequences for ability to work, road safety and quality of life. Furthermore, OSA is an
      independant riskfactor for cardiovascular disease. The treatment of choice today is
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) but a main problem with CPAP is an unsatisfactory
      compliance. An alternative conservative more user-friendly treatment could be oral
      appliances, intending to increase the pharyngeal airway directly by tongue retaining devices
      or indirectly by mandibular advancing devices. Though several randomized studies on oral
      appliances have come recent years, all giving some evidence for effect on OSA, they all had
      some shortcomings, such as using crossover design, small sample sizes, under-reporting of
      methods and data and lack of blinding.

      In this study of a mandibular advancement device was used a parallel group design with an
      inactive device and no intervention as controls. Beside the effect on sleep, daytime
      sleepiness and quality of life, the study aimed to find objective factors to be used as
      predictors of the outcome.
