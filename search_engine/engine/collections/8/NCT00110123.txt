      Primary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients with surgically incurable or unresectable liver
           metastases secondary to uveal melanoma treated with fotemustine administered as an
           intravenous infusion vs an intra-arterial hepatic perfusion.

      Secondary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Compare the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Compare the duration of objective response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Compare the patterns of progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Compare treatment-related toxic effects and catheter-related complications in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, lactic dehydrogenase level (normal vs abnormal), and WHO
      performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive fotemustine IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 (induction
           course). Beginning on day 50, patients receive maintenance courses of fotemustine IV
           over 1 hour every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive fotemustine by a 4-hour intra-arterial (IA) hepatic perfusion
           on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (induction course). Beginning on day 57, patients receive
           maintenance courses of fotemustine by a 4-hour IA hepatic perfusion every 21 days in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 9 weeks for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 262 patients (131 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
