    
      A total of 20 participants (men or women) between the ages of 18-50 years with asthma will be
      enrolled. Participants will remain on their usual asthma treatments as prescribed by their
      usual asthma care provider. Current asthma treatments and any changes will be recorded at
      baseline and each subsequent visit. The primary outcome measures are correlation of
      microvesicle patterns with atopic state and variation from baseline with episodes of poor
      asthma control. Secondary outcomes include correlations between microvesicle patterns and
      spirometry, eNO levels, and glucorcorticoid sensitivity.
