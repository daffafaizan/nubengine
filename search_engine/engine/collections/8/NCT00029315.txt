      subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. Evidence supports a strong contribution of IVH to morbidity
      and mortality after cerebral hemorrhage. External ventricular drainage (EVD) is required
      clinical management; however, EVD via intraventricular catheter alone fails to prevent much
      of the morbidity and mortality of IVH. This study seeks to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy of intraventricular thrombolysis, using rt-PA, as a method of removing this blood
      and altering morbidity and mortality. Patients will receive intraventricular injections of
      rt-PA or placebo every 12 hours. They will be followed prospectively with daily head CT scans
      during the acute-treatment phase and again between Days 28 and 32.
