      for in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) each year. Maternal stress exposure related to
      infants' NICU stays is an under-appreciated public health problem with negative implications
      for maternal and child health and wellbeing. Flexible, effective intervention strategies have
      potential to improve maternal mental health and parenting, promoting positive emotional and
      behavioral outcomes for both mothers and infants.

      In the investigators' successful pilot research, the investigators developed an
      audio-delivered mindfulness program to help NICU mothers reduce rumination and worry,
      cultivate a state of calm awareness, and promote self care. In this small randomized pilot
      study, the investigators will randomly assign mothers with an infant in the neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) to receive either the mindfulness intervention or an active
      control program (audio-delivered education on infant care and development).

      This study will evaluate feasibility of all key research aspects, including recruitment,
      randomization, intervention and control conditions, and assessments, in preparation for a
      future larger-scale study. This study will also assess preliminary intervention outcomes to
      identify potential program benefits.
