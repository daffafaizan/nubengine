      implanted as with traditional approaches, but with subsequent noninvasive distractions. The
      implanted growing rods are magnetically controlled and adjusted outside the body using an
      external remote controller (ERC) following initial surgical insertion. No incision or
      anesthesia are used for rod lengthening procedures and they are performed by the surgeon in
      an outpatient or office setting. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a
      6-week lengthening interval compared to a 16-week lengthening interval on spinal growth in
      Early Onset Scoliosis patients between 5 and 9 years of age with a major coronal curve over
      50 degrees undergoing MCGR treatment within 3 years.
