      single-center, double-blind (participants and study personnel will not know the identity of
      the treatments), randomized (treatment will be assigned by chance), single- and multiple-dose
      study. There will be 3 groups in Part 1, and the dosing will be as follows: Group A will
      receive a single oral dose of 30 mg JNJ-38518168 (given as three 10-mg tablets of
      JNJ-38518168) or placebo (a treatment identical in appearance to JNJ-38518168 but not
      containing active drug) (Period 1), and multiple oral doses of 30 mg JNJ 38518168 (given as
      three 10-mg tablets of JNJ-38518168) or matching placebo once daily for 14 consecutive days
      (Period 2); Group B will receive a single oral dose of 10 mg JNJ-38518168 or placebo (Period
      1), and multiple oral doses of 10 mg JNJ-38518168 or placebo once daily for 14 consecutive
      days (Period 2); and Group C will receive a single oral dose of 3 mg JNJ-38518168 or placebo
      (Period 1), and multiple oral doses of 3 mg JNJ-38518168 or placebo once daily for 14
      consecutive days (Period 2). At least a 20-day washout period will separate the dose
      administration in Period 1 and the first dose administration of Period 2. The duration of
      Part 1 will be approximately 78 days. Part 2 of this study will be a single-center,
      open-label (participants and study personnel will know the identity of the treatments),
      non-randomized, multiple dose, drug-drug interaction study. Eligible participants will
      receive a single oral dose of 2.5 mg of midazolam as oral solution on Day 1, three 10-mg
      tablets of JNJ-38518168 (30 mg) once daily for 14 consecutive days (Day 2 through Day 15);
      and another single oral dose of 2.5 mg midazolam on Day 15. The duration of Part 2 of the
      study will be approximately 42 days. Following an interim safety and PK data analysis, one
      additional treatment group may be studied to evaluate the effect of JNJ-38518168 at a dose
      lower than 30 mg once daily on the PK of midazolam. During Parts 1 or 2, participants may be
      admitted to the clinical unit for periods of up to 7 and 18 days, and follow-up return visits
      to the clinic will also be required.
