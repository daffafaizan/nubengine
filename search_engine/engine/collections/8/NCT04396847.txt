      burdens associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Developing targeted treatments for
      specific AUD subgroups is a key objective. Among those with AUD, cigarette smokers comprise a
      sizable and critical subgroup with disproportionally high long-term health risks, making it a
      key priority to advance therapies for concurrent AUD and cigarette smoking. The serotonin
      (5-hydroxtytryptamine; 5-HT) system is broadly implicated in addictive behaviors, in part
      reflecting the role of 5-HT in modulating dopamine function. Preclinical studies of 5-HT
      receptor drugs have shown that targeted modulation of the 5-HT2C receptor (implicated in
      5-HT-related inhibition of DA function) alters the consumption and reinstatement of addictive
      drugs, including alcohol and nicotine. Of the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists, lorcaserin
      has superior near-term potential for repurposing as an AUD therapy, having been approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration for weight management. Human laboratory medication trials
      offer a time- and cost-effective option for validating preclinical findings prior to larger
      randomized controlled trials, and for testing candidate treatment mechanisms. This Phase II
      human laboratory screening trial will evaluate lorcaserin as a novel candidate therapy for
      smokers with AUD. Effects of lorcaserin vs. placebo will be evaluated in a double-blind,
      within-subjects, crossover study with human laboratory endpoints. This study will provide
      early human data on the effects of a 5-HT2C receptor agonist in relation to alcohol-related
      outcomes, informing its potential for further evaluation as a candidate treatment for AUD.
