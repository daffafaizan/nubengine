      relationship (allowing titrated inductions), its anti-emetic effect, as well as its delay and
      its short duration of action. Among its side effects, the pain during its injection occupies
      a significant part in pediatrics (60% in adults, up to 85% in children).

      It is most often described as an unpleasant sensation, discomfort or even a burn at the point
      of puncture, going up along the path of the vein and can extend to the whole arm. The
      mechanism of this pain is still poorly understood at this time. Several mechanisms have been
      mentioned such as activation of the bradykinin cascade, a direct stimulation of the free
      nociceptive venous nerve endings.A meta-analysis concludes in adults that the two most
      effective techniques are a puncture site on the ulnar vein and a pretreatment of the vein by
      Lidocaine. In children, the anatomical differences, the notion of protection of the venous
      capital from the first vascular approach, whatever the prognosis of the patient and the
      competence of the operator will influence the choice of the material, the choice of the site
      and the puncture technique. Several pediatric studies have attempted to reduce this injection
      pain by other techniques. A panel of products has been tested with different drug
      orientations or not. The suggestion centered on analgesia of the hand is a powerful
      technique, adapted to acute pain. The pain sensation will thus be partially or completely
      replaced by a sensation of a different nature, thus attenuating the nociceptive process. This
      technique has not been studied during injection with propofol.
