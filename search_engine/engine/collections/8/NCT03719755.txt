      media of normal saline with maximum injection of 40 cc of 50% dextrose plus 300 cc of normal
      saline washout versus normal saline after hysterectomy for benign indications.

      A pre-operative urine culture will be obtained via mid-stream clean catch prior to
      administration of routine pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics.

      At 6-9 days post-operatively, a repeat urine culture will be obtained via mid-stream clean
      catch. Appropriate treatment will be administered if the urine culture is positive.Primary
      outcome will be rates of urinary tract infections at 6-9 days post-operatively. This will be
      defined as a urine culture yielding greater than 100,000 gram-negative colony-forming units
      per milliliter.
