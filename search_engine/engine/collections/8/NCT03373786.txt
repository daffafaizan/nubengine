    
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center study of the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics
      of RG-012 administered to subjects with Alport syndrome. During this open-label study, all
      eligible subjects will receive RG-012. The study consists of two parts (Part A and Part B).
      During Part A, half of the participants will receive a single dose of RG-012 and half will
      receive 4 doses of RG-012 (one dose every other week for 6 weeks). All subjects will undergo
      two renal biopsies, one before and one after receiving RG-012, to assess the effect of RG-012
      on the kidney. After completing Part A, subjects will be able to enter Part B of the study.
      During Part B, all subjects will receive RG-012 every other week for 48 weeks.
