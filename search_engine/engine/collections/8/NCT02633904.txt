      in China is about 9 â€°.There are many different methods in the treatment of DDH. Although
      older children and high dislocations may be more likely to require a femoral shortening
      osteotomy, the ultimate decision about whether or not to shorten a given femur should depend
      on the ease of femoral head reduction in that specific patient. Adding a femoral shortening
      procedure increases operating time and blood loss, adds a second incision, and necessitates
      future hardware removal. In addition, an unnecessary femoral shortening osteotomy could
      overly decrease the soft tissue tension around the joint, putting the hip at risk for
      redislocation. This study was designed to explore an algorithm based on strict age and
      radiographic criteria that identify those without the need of femoral osteotomy. From the
      investigators'clinical experiences and the published papers, younger patients (<24 month of
      age) and low dislocations (Tonnis level I or II) were more likely to avoid a femoral
      shortening osteotomy.
