      musculoskeletal shoulder pain were allocated to two groups. Patients in group 1 (n= 41)
      received a five-series Isometric Contraction of shoulder external rotators at 20% maximal
      voluntary isometric contraction, while patients in group 2 (n= 41) received similar protocol
      but the intensity of contraction was set at 80% maximal voluntary isometric contraction. In
      both cases, each series of IC was done until exhaustion or up to a maximum of 5 minutes.
      Patients received five sessions of treatment during a two-week period. Outcome measures
      included muscle pain sensitivity (pressure pain thresholds) and pain intensity (pain
      intensity numerical rating score), and shoulder function (Constant Score).
