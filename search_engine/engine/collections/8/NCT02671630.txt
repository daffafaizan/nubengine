      dementia patients' health. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a
      community-based computerized cognitive training program.However, most of these studies were
      not randomized controlled trial and the samples of these studies were mostly healthy older
      persons, patients with brain injuries, or with moderate and severe dementia. A lack of
      studies for effects of these programs on patients with mild dementia using randomized
      controlled trials was found. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a
      community-based computerized cognitive training program.
