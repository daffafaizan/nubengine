      during colonoscopy. LSLs have an increased risk of harbouring invasive cancer and can be
      challenging to excise endoscopically. Wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection (WF-EMR) is
      widely used in treating LSLs. In the East, meanwhile endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)
      is the dominant technique due to its ability to achieve en bloc resection in over 80% of
      cases. Many papers have demonstrated that selective-esd has the highest economic benefit. The
      key is to find a reliable way to select.
