    
      Data of mechanical power will be collected prospectively in three different times:

        1. In supine positioning (T0).

        2. After 15 minutes of having implemented prone positioning while maintaining the same
           ventilatory settings that in supine (T1).

        3. In prone positioning after 15 min of having adjusted an individualized ventilatory
           setting (T2).

      Besides, the investigators will take an arterial blood sample in T0 and T2 to calculate
      changes in oxygenation status and ventilatory ratio.

      In case that esophageal manometry is available, the investigators will collect data regarding
      to transpulmonary and esophageal pressure in order to calculate the mechanical power applied
      to the lung parenchyma.
