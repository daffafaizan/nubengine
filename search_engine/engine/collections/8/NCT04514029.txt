      dexamethasone and simvastatin on treating Neurotoxicity (NT) in the patient population. The
      rate of patients completing all required study treatments and the rate of NT will be
      determined.

      Simvastatin 40 mg/day will be started at least 5 days prior to apheresis and will be
      continued until day +30 after infusion. Intrathecal dexamethasone 8 mg will be administered
      on days (related to CAR-T infusion) -1, +6, +13, (+/- 2 days). CSF samples (3 ml) will be
      collected at these time points. Peripheral blood samples of 4 ml will be collected on days
      -1, +1, +6, and +13. The care team will check weekly CK and LFTs to ensure safety of
      simvastatin. Patients who develop NT will be allowed to continue treatment if feasible along
      with standard of care management.
