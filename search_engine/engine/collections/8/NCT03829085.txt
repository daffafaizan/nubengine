    
      This is prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentre trial. Patients with mild and
      moderate acute pancreatitis (AP) will be randomly in two groups: group A: with early oral
      refeeding (EOR) with low fat solid diet (LFSD), started from the first day of admission in
      the hospital, and group B: with Nil Per Oral (NPO), until the symptoms, signs, inflammatory
      parameters of AP have resolved.

      The primary and several secondary endpoints will be obtained and EORF with LFSD will improve
      the following measures of outcome:

        1. Length of hospital admission (the primary endpoint)

        2. Serum amylase, lipase, electrolytes, calcium, urea, creatinine, liver function tests,
           C-reactive protein (biomarker of inflammation), nutritional parameters (albumin,
           prealbumin, cholesterol, triglycerides) and full blood count - routine blood tests
           performed daily until normalization of serum lipase or until discharge.

        3. Weight, at hospital admission and discharge, and at day 30 post-discharge clinic
           follow-up.

        4. Systemic complications including hemodynamic instability, renal failure, intensive care
           admission, surgery, radiological and endoscopic procedures.

        5. Pain and Analgesic requirement.

        6. Local complications including pancreatic necrosis, abscess, pseudocyst.
