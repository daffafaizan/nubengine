    
      The primary end-point of the study is to evaluate the glucocorticoid function of the adrenal
      glands in women with nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency (= patients) by comparing the
      maximal cortisol concentrations obtained during insulin tolerance test (ITT) in the patients
      and in the healthy volunteers.

      The secondary end-point of the study is to determine the % of patients with a maximal plasma
      cortisol concentration greater or equal to 18μg/dL during ITT; compare the maximal plasma
      ACTH and salivary cortisol concentration during ITT in the two study groups; to evaluate the
      mineralocorticoid function of the patients by comparing the variations (changes from
      baseline) of the plasma renin, aldosterone, urinary aldosterone, systolic and diastolic blood
      pressure and pulse wave velocity in response to sodium depletion in the patients and in the
      healthy volunteers.

      Women with nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency followed in the Endocrinology and
      reproduction illnesses Service of the BICETRE Hospital, LE KREMLIN-BICETRE, France and female
      healthy volunteers will be proposed to participate.

      Before inclusion patients must be genotyped and both patients and healthy volunteers must
      undergo an ACTH (Synacthen 250 μg IV) test for plasma cortisol and 17-hydroxyprogesterone
      concentration assessments.

      After inclusion:

        -  ITT: IV injection of 0.10-0.2U/kg of insulin (ACTRAPID) at 09h00, dose adapted to BMI,
           with repeated measures 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after insulin injection for
           assessment of the glucocorticoid function, at the One Day Hospital of the Endocrinology
           and reproduction illnesses Service of the BICETRE Hospital, LE KREMLIN BICETRE.

        -  Sodium depletion test: obtained by PO administration of 40 mg of furosemide (LASILIX) at
           09h00 in combination with low sodium diet (20mmol of Na/day) with repeated measures for
           assessment of the mineralocorticoid function during 24 hours after the drug
           administration at the Clinical Investigation Center of The George POMPIDOU Hospital,
           Paris.
