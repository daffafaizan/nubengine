      supplementation of alpha lipoid acid to improve clinical and electrophysiological recovery
      after carpal tunnel release surgery. This research is designed as a double blinded clinical
      trial, with a calculated sample size of 40 patients, divided in two groups of 20 (A placebo,
      B alpha lipoid acid). All patients will undergo open carpal tunnel release surgery, the
      procedure will be performed by an expert surgeon. A total of four visits will be performed as
      follows: T0. baseline 4 weeks before surgery, T1 immediately before surgery, T2: 4 weeks
      after surgery, T3: 8 weeks after surgery, T4: 12 weeks after surgery. The assessment to be
      perform on each visit includes: physical examination, Boston Questionary for Carpal Tunnel
      Syndrome. Nerve conduction study and ecographic evaluation will be performed on visits T0, T1
      and T4. Statistical Analysis: Categorical variables will be assessed as counts and percent
      frequency and compared using the chi-squared test. All statistical analyses will be performed
      using the SPSS 21.0 package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A two-tailed P value < 0.05 was
      considered statistically significant.
