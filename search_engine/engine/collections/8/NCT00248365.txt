      allogeneic stem cell transplantation. While improvements in immuno-suppressive regimens have
      reduced the frequency and severity of acute GvHD, the incidence of chronic GvHD (cGvHD)
      remains unchanged ranging from 30% after sibling matched related donor transplants to over
      70% after unrelated donor bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Factors
      associated with cGvHD include increased donor and recipient age, prior acute GvHD, and the
      use of alloimmune female donors. Conventional therapeutic approaches for cGvHD, including
      corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, have demonstrated limited efficacy in patients
      with extensive disease and are associated with high toxicity.

      Iterative extracorporeal photopheresis has demonstrated clinical and immunomodulatory
      activity in subjects with acute and chronic GvHD. The currently available process of ECP has
      not been controlled for cell number, exposure time, or specific cell populations targeted due
      to the nature of the procedure. Using the Theralux procedure, defined populations of cells
      may be targeted, and the intensity of photoactivating agent and exposure can be modulated to
      achieve the maximal immunomodulatory effects in the treated subjects. This study will attempt
      to explore the effects of the Theralux procedure under two defined conditions. Response and
      toxicity will be determined at each intensity level and the dose associated with clinical
      response and immunomodulatory effects on DC and NK cell populations will be defined as the
      optimal intensity level for subsequent larger trials.
