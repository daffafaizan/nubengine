      to improve physical functioning in older homebound adults with chronic mobility disability.
      Unfortunately, little is known about the feasibility and utility of pragmatic home-based
      exercise rehabilitation in older adults with severe mobility limitations.

      The Specific Aims and Hypotheses of this proposal are:

      Specific Aim #1: Using human-centered design methodologies, work with providers and patients
      to develop a feasible multi-component home exercise program targeting mobility, strength, and
      performance of task-oriented ADLs. Feasibility will be determined by assessing adherence and
      retention to the developed exercise program.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize that a task-based exercise intervention can be
      feasibly delivered in the homes of homebound, older adults.

      Specific Aim #2: Perform a feasibility study to better assess feasibility and determine the
      effect(s) of the home-based intervention created in Aim 1 on functional outcomes (primary
      outcome SPPB), mobility, and QOL changes in homebound older adults with mobility disability.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize that the developed 12-week multi-component
      exercise intervention will improve performance of basic ADLs, functional mobility, and QOL;
      as well as outcomes related to patient satisfaction, emergency department visits, and
      hospitalization.
