      malignant tumors, multinodular goiter and Graves disease. However, because of the rich
      vascular structure of the thyroid gland, serious complications including hemorrhage, hematoma
      and hematoma-related dyspnea can develop after thyroidectomy. The American Thyroid
      Association also suggested to keep the patient in a head-up at 45Â°-Fowler's position in the
      post anesthesia care unit following thyroidectomy to prevent hematoma formation on the
      incision site by facilitating venous return from the head and neck. The mentioned guideline
      does not offer any recommendations regarding the position that should be given to the
      patients at surgical clinic after thyroidectomy. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the
      effects of different degrees of head-of-bed elevation on respiratory pattern including
      respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation and dyspnea, and drainage including amount of
      drainage and hematoma formation.
