      applications, including the effect of QUTENZA on sensory function in subjects diagnosed with
      different types of Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (PNP). In order to adequately assess the
      long-term safety QUTENZA in well defined patient populations the current study will enroll a
      minimum of 100 patients each with HIV-Associated Neuropathy (HIV-AN) and Postherpetic
      Neuralgia (PHN).
