    
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial is going to be carried out in
      24 patients of both sexes aged between 30 and 60 years, with diagnosis of metabolic syndrome
      according to the modified International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria (without diabetes
      and without previous treatment for metabolic syndrome components).

      The patients will be assigned randomly into two groups of 12 patients each. The patients will
      receive 150 mg of Irvingia gabonensis before breakfast and dinner (300 mg per day) or placebo
      during 12 weeks.

      Waist circumference, triglycerides, high density lipoproteins (HDL-c) and blood pressure will
      be evaluated before and after intervention in both groups.

      First phase of insulin secretion (Stumvoll index), total insulin secretion (Insulinogenic
      index) and Insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) will be calculated from the concentration of
      glucose and insulin obtained from an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.

      Data from statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and
      dispersion, mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables and frequencies and
      percentages for qualitative variables. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2. The
      inter group differences will be analyzed through Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Test for
      intra-group differences. Statistical significance will be considered with a p<0.05.

      This protocol was approved by a local ethics committee and written informed consent will be
      obtained from all volunteers.
