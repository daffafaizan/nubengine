    
      This is a multi-center open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of MN-166 (ibudilast) and Temozolomide combination treatment in patients with
      newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas. To be eligible, subjects are histologically
      confirmed GBM (glioblastoma) or gliosarcoma, or astrocytomas with molecular features of GBM,
      WHO Grade 4. Recurrent GBM patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70 or
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma GBM, gliosarcoma, or astrocytomas with molecular features of GBM must have a KPS
      ≥60 and ECOG score 0-1.

      This is divided into a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) followed by a fixed-dose phase (Part
      2).

      Part 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of MN-166 (ibudilast) when given in
      combination with TMZ, and determine the dose of MN-166 (ibudilast) to be used in Part 2 of
      the study. Up to 18 adult subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part 1.

      Part 2 will evaluate the efficacy of MN-166 (ibudilast) and temozolomide combination
      treatment as measured by the proportion of subjects who are progression-free at 6 months.
      Other outcome measures include the evaluation of overall survival, response rate, and median
      six-month progression-free survival and up to 32 subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part
      2.
