      If you agree and are eligible to take part, you will receive perflutren protein type A by
      injection under the skin near the nipple. After you receive the injection, the radiologist
      will take more ultrasound images and videos of the tumor and lymph nodes in the underarm
      area.

      You will have a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node that was identified in the ultrasound and a
      titanium clip marker will be inserted into the node. The clip helps distinguish the biopsied
      node from other nodes. You will be told the results of biopsy. After the biopsy, a
      radioactive seed may be inserted into the node to allow the surgeon to find and remove it
      during your surgery, an extra node may be removed at that time.

      You will still have standard of care sentinel lymph node biopsy during your already scheduled
      surgery. You will sign a separate surgical consent form that explains this procedure and its
      risks.

      You will be called by phone 30 days after the seed is removed to check for any side effects.
      This phone call should take about 10 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation in this study will be over the follow up phone call.

      This is an investigational study. Perflutren protein type A is FDA approved and commercially
      available for use in contrast-enhanced echocardiograms. Its use in this study is
      investigational.

      Up to 21 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
