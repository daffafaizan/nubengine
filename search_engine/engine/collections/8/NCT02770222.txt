      are substrates for cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8), the present clinical study aims at
      investigating the effect of a strong inhibitor (gemfibrozil) and a moderate inducer
      (rifampicin) of CYP2C8 on the pharmacokinetic of selexipag and ACT-333679 as recommended by
      the FDA's Guidance for Industry Drug Interaction Studies (FDA, 2012).
