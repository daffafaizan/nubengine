      fractures are displaced and need to be reduced.

      According to the Dutch National Guidelines, displaced distal radius fractures, after adequate
      reduction confirmed on X-ray, are best treated nonoperatively with cast immobilization.
      Moreover, the AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline only suggest surgical fixation when the
      articular step, after reduction, exceeds 2mm. However, both recommendations are based on
      studies who did not differentiate between intra- and extra-articular distal radius fractures.
      So, no clear consensus about the best treatment for patients with displaced intra-articular
      distal radius fractures can be made. Despite this lack of consensus and the lack of available
      literature on comparative data to guide treatment for this patient population, a rise in use
      of volar plating has been observed.

      The goal of open reduction and plate fixation is to restore articular congruity and axial
      alignment, and to enable early post-operative movement. Several studies show good
      radiological and functional results using the volar locking plate in unstable displaced
      distal radius fractures.

      No studies have been carried out to assess whether operative treatment with plate fixation is
      superior in displaced complete articular distal radius fractures to nonoperative treatment in
      patients with these fracture type. Therefore, with this randomized controlled trial the
      investigators wish to determine the difference in functional outcome, assessed with the
      Patient Related Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), after open reduction and plate fixation compared to
      nonoperative treatment with closed reduction and cast immobilization.
