      validated IC/BPS symptom questionnaires for baseline screening. Once participants meet
      eligibility requirements and give written informed consent they will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to peppermint oil (200mg TID) or placebo (also TID). Participants will complete
      validated IC/BPS questionnaires and follow up surveys over 8 weeks.
