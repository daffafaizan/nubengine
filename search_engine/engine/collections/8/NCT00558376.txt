      phosphate as purgative for colon preparation to colonoscopy, after the failure of preparation
      with sodium phosphate for first colonoscopy. The hypothesis tested is whether there is
      advantage for substituting the purgative used, as compared to repeating the colonoscopy with
      the same purgative.Briefly, the study will be composed of patients whose preparation was
      judged to be inadequate in a first colonoscopy by an endoscopist independent of the current
      study. They will be allocated randomly to a group that will receive 3L Polyethylene glycol
      versus a group that will receive sodium phosphate(45ccX2). Both groups will be instructed to
      extend low-fiber diet to 5 days. Cleanliness of the colon at colonoscopy will be assessed
      blindly by an experienced endoscopist.
