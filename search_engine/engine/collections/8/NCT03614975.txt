    
      This is a non-blinded, randomized controlled trial analyzing influenza vaccine immunogenicity
      response in children/adolescents/young adults aged 4-20 years given one of two FDA approved
      and licensed influenza vaccines: Flucelvax (egg-free inactivated flu shot) and Fluzone
      (egg-based inactivated flu shot). This study will enroll 120 healthy participants, 60 per
      vaccine arm. Participants will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation to receive either
      Flucelvax or Fluzone. Blood work will be conducted on all participants at baseline prior to
      vaccine receipt and post-vaccination at Day 7 (range 6-9 days) and Day 21 (range 21-35 days).
      The primary objective of the study is to determine pre and post serologic,responses to each
      vaccine type.
