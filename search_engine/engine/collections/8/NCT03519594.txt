      to 40%. Therefore, early detection and treatment are important in unstable pelvic trauma. We
      investigated the early predictive factors for possible embolization in patients with
      hemodynamically unstable pelvic trauma.

      Methods: From January 2011 to December 2013, 46 patients with shock arrived at a single
      hospital within 24 h after injury. Of them, 44 patients underwent computed tomography (CT)
      after initial resuscitation, except for 2 who were dead on arrival. Nine patients with other
      organ injuries were excluded. Seventeen patients underwent embolization. A single radiologist
      measured the width (longest length in axial view) and length (longest length in coronal view)
      of pelvic hematoma on CT scans. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data were reviewed
      retrospectively.
