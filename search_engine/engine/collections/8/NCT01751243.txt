    
      The main objective of the study is to determine the safety of transplantation of
      hematopoietic progenitors from haploidentical donor with in vitro allo-depleted lymphocyte
      infusion.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the immune reconstitution pre and post-infusion of allo-depleted lymphocytes.

        -  To analyze the incidence of infections (CMV and aspergillus) post-transplant.

        -  To analyze the impact of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

        -  To optimize the dose of allo-depleted lymphocytes to reconstitute an immune response
           against pathogens without causing GVHD.

        -  To assess the rate of graft and myeloid and platelet engraftment time.

        -  To assess the rate of relapses, event-free survival and overall survival. It is hoped to
           recruit 20 clinically evaluable patients for safety purpose.

      The inclusion period is not more than 2 Â½ years. Study duration shall not exceed three years
      from the inclusion of the first patient. The minimum follow-up of patients is 6 months after
      transplantation.

      The first 5 patients (group 0) will receive haploidentical transplantation of hematopoietic
      progenitors without subsequent infusion of allo-depleted lymphocytes and then in cohorts of 3
      patients, infuse +4 post-transplant day at doses of: 1x105 cluster of differentiation 3
      (CD3)/kg(group 1), 3x105 CD3/kg (group 2), 5x105 CD3 / kg (group 3), 1x106 CD3/kg (group 4)
      and 3x106 CD3/kg (group 5).

      Donor: it is performed one leukapheresis at least 30 days (4 weeks) prior to the scheduled
      progenitors infusion (day 0), in order to obtain effector T cells.
