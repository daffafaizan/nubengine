      the advent of Lucentis™( which provides improved vision rather than simply stabilization) is
      common; however, monthly injections may be required to maintain this effect. The use of the
      glucocorticoids such as triamcinolone acetonide as adjunct treatment for exudative
      age-related macular degeneration has been reported to enhance the efficacy of photodynamic
      therapy with Visudyne® (verteporphin for injection). It is hypothesized that sustained
      release fluocinolone acetonide will allow maintenance of the improved vision with fewer
      Lucentis injections. This study is a pilot phase 2b study to test this hypothesis. The safety
      assessments will continue through 36 months.This study will compare the safety 2 doses of
      FA/Medidur in conjunction with Lucentis (as needed) in patients with neovascular AMD who have
      have been treated with Lucentis for at least 6 months and have reached a plateau.
