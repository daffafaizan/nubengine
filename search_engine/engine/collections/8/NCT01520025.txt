      18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) with exercise or dipyridamole stress and positron emission
      tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This approach with
      "hot-spot" imaging may have greater diagnostic accuracy for ischemia than conventional
      "cold-spot" myocardial perfusion imaging.

      Recent advances in multi-modality imaging permit fusion of CTA images with PET or SPECT
      perfusion images and functional assessment of anatomical CAD. Registration of the 2 data sets
      can be optimized using the CT acquired with the PET or SPECT15. 18FDG uptake as a marker for
      ischemia can be directly related to the coronary anatomy and guide revascularization.
