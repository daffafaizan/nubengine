      its effects on erectile function continue provoking controversy. Data obtained in animals
      under experimental or surgical castration, explains how this condition can cause a
      veno-occlusive dysfunction and therefore an erectile dysfunction. In a model of animal
      flebogenous erectile dysfunction, the intracavernous vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF), together with testosterone, reestablishes the balance between the muscle and the
      conjunctive tissue, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of endothelial cells and regularizes the
      diameter of dorsal nervous cells, thus preventing the veno-occlusive dysfunction. Castration
      also induces the apopthosis in the erectile tissue of the penis; the treatment with
      testosterone provokes a new DNA synthesis.

      There are certain indicators that the treatment with testosterone could help patients with
      erectile dysfunction and low testosterone base line amounts. Likewise, androgens could
      control the expression and the activity of type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) of the cavernous
      body of the penis.

      Pharmacological treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors, administered orally fails in certain cases
      of erectile dysfunction, even more in hypogonadal males. Some studies show that the
      combination of testosterone with a PDE-5 inhibitor helps the recovery of sexual function in
      patients; therefore, giving the possibility of a combined pharmacological treatment with
      testosterone in erectile dysfunction.
