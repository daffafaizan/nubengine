    
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study. A complete cardiac
      exam will be conducted by the pediatric cardiology team at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical
      School. All participants will remain on their existing, pre-study medication throughout all
      phases of the study.

      Once admitted to the study, a baseline period will begin. During the baseline period,
      cognitive and adaptive information will be collected. The participant will then be randomly
      assigned to propranolol (Phase A) or placebo (Phase B). The titration schedule will be
      flexible and the dose can be held steady for an extended period. Dose reduction to manage
      side effects are allowed at any time. Each week the family will complete behavioral forms
      online and meet with the study psychiatrist via telemedicine. Following the initial Phase (A
      or B), participants will undergo a washout period (whether propranolol or placebo). Then,
      they will crossover to the other Phase (A or B). Upon completion of the crossover phase, the
      study blind will be broken. The participant will then continue in the open label phase.
