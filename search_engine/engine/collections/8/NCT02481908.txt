      electromechanical activation time (EMAT), left ventricular ejection time and EMAT/LVET ratio.
      These were performed at baseline and during the first strain phase of the VM using a
      computerized phono and electrocardiographic method. The diagnosis of LVD was determined on
      the basis of clinical examination, echocardiography and brain natriuretic peptide. The values
      of STIs were compared between patients with and without LVD ; their diagnostic performance
      was assessed using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC).
