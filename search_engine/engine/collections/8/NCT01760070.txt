      to surgery for localized early upper gastrointestinal neoplasms recently. However, the
      procedure remains to be technically challenging and time consuming. Many modified methods or
      newly developed devices were developed to simplify the procedure. A new insulated tip
      dissecting knife (O-type Hybrid knife) has been recently developed with both injection and
      lateral cutting capability. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ESD procedure
      could be shortened with this new device.
