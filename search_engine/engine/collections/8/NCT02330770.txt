      (COH). Transvaginal sonography (TVS) scan will be performed regularly for monitoring of the
      follicular growth (folliculometry). When there will be at least 3 leading follicles > 18 mm
      in diameter, women will be randomized into 3 groups; group A (dual trigger group), group B
      (single low-dose HCG group) and group C (multiple low-doses HCG group). In group A, final
      oocyte maturation will be triggered by dual administration of 0.2 mg of GnRHa preparation
      (Triptorelin) SC and 1500 IU of HCG preparation IM. In group B, final oocyte maturation will
      be triggered by administration of 0.2 mg Triptorelin SC then a single IM bolus of 1500 IU HCG
      will by administered 35-37 hours after GnRHa trigger (1 hour after oocyte retrieval). In
      group C, final oocyte maturation will be triggered by administration of 0.2 mg Triptorelin SC
      then 3 IM boluses of 500 IU HCG will be administered day 1, day 4 and day 7 after oocyte
      retrieval. In all women, oocyte retrieval will be performed 34-36 hours after trigger and
      endometrial preparation for embryo transfer (ET) will be started on the day of oocyte
      retrieval by giving 400 mg vaginal natural progesterone supplement once daily plus 4 mg oral
      estradiol valerate once daily.
