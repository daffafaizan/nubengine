      pharmacokinetics of MK-8226 for a period of 12 weeks followed by a 20-week off-treatment
      follow-up period.

      Part 2 of the study is an assessment of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MK-8226 for
      12 weeks followed by a 20-week off-treatment follow-up period.

      In Part 3 of the study, participants will be treated with MK-8226 for a period of 12 weeks
      followed by a 20-week off-treatment follow-up period to evaluate pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacokinetic correlations to assist with modeling the dose range planned for further
      studies.
