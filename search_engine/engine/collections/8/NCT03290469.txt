    
      This is a prospective, multi-site, randomized study to evaluate the clinical utility of cWGS
      in each proband. Throughout this study, each proband will receive SOC testing as determined
      by the site clinical team. Upon enrollment in the study, each proband will be randomly
      assigned to the 15 day cWGS group or the SOC group. SOC is defined as the management of the
      proband's care under the same or similar conditions as if the proband was not enrolled in
      this study. A blood sample from each enrolled proband will be collected and shipped to the
      Illumina Clinical Services Laboratory ("ICSL"), which is Clinical Laboratory Improvement
      Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited. ICSL will
      conduct cWGS testing with the TruGenome Undiagnosed Disease Test ("TruGenome Test"). The
      TruGenome Test cWGS results will be provided to the Principal Investigator (PI) or designee
      who will evaluate each proband test outcome based on the aggregate medical information,
      informed by the cWGS or SOC results.
