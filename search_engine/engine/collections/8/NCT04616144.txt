      implant that will be taken from myopic patients to implant in hyperopic patients with high
      astigmatism using VisuMax Femtosecond laser - Smile module surgery with primary objective to
      assess (increase) visual acuity (far, intermediate, near vision) and secondary objective to
      stabilize (decrease) high astigmatism by reducing K-values.
