      (ANCA), is the most frequent cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Renal failure
      at presentation often progresses to end stage renal disease despite immunosuppressive
      therapy. We investigated whether the addition of plasma exchange was more effective than
      intravenous (IV) methyl prednisolone in the achievement of renal recovery for ANCA associated
      systemic vasculitis presenting with a serum creatinine above 500umol/l (5.8mg/dl).

      137 patients with a new diagnosis of ANCA associated systemic vasculitis, serum creatinine
      above 500umol/l (5.8mg/dl) and a renal biopsy demonstrating a focal, necrotizing
      glomerulonephritis were randomized to receive seven plasma exchanges or IV methyl
      prednisolone 1000mg/day for three days. Both groups were treated with cyclophosphamide and
      oral prednisolone. The primary end-point was dialysis independence with a serum creatinine
      below 500umol/l (5.8mg/dl) at three months. Secondary end-points included renal and patient
      survival at 12 months and severe adverse event rates.
