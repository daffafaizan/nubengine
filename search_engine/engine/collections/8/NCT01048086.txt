      in childhood solid tumors and the history of cis-Retinoic Acid (cis-RA) use in children with
      neuroblastoma. This study will combine these two agents in a randomized Phase II trial. The
      safety and feasibility of using individual dosimetry measurements to maximize the
      90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide radiation dose to tumor while limiting the renal radiation dose to
      23 Gy will be rigorously tested.

      Fixed dosing will allow each subject to receive three cycles of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide at
      50 mCi/m2. Dosimetry will be performed at each of these cycles; the combined dosimetry
      measurements will be utilized to determine whether or not a fourth cycle will be administered
      and, if so, what that dose will be. The administration of this additional cycle is
      conditional upon a) a subject not experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity during any previous
      cycle and b) meeting all criteria required at study initiation prior to the fourth dose.
