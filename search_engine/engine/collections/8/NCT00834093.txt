      therapy product. This will take about 16 weeks during which time they will receive
      chemotherapy for their nasopharynx cancer. When the immune product is ready the chemotherapy
      will be stopped and the immunotherapy product will be given to the participant by infusion.
      On the first day of the research treatment, participants will receive infusion #1 of the EBV
      immunotherapy product. Fourteen days later, the participant will receive infusion #2. Eight
      weeks after infusion #2, the research doctor will do some tests to determine the effects that
      the EBV immunotherapy product has had on the participants tumor. If the research doctor
      thinks that they would benefit from a third infusion of the EBV immunotherapy product and
      there is sufficient immunotherapy product remaining, the participant my be given infusion #3.

        -  Before each infusion of the EBV immunotherapy product participants will have a physical
           exam, blood work and fiberoptic exam of the nasopharynx if needed.

        -  Within 28 days of receiving the EBV immunotherapy product for the first time, we will
           evaluate the participants tumor by using CT scan and/or MRI.
