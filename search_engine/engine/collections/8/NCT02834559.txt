    
      Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a common cause for postoperative failure after
      vitreoretinal surgery for primary RRD. There is no standard-therapy to prevent PVR. Several
      attempts using chemotherapeutic agents have been undertaken to prevent this
      proliferation-process, but none of these was introduced into routine clinical practice.

      Until recently, it has been challenging to identify patients with high risk for postoperative
      PVR formation. This is especially important, because in this trial treatment with the trial
      drug will be restricted to patients at high risk for PVR only.

      Patients are assigned to the following treatment arms (1:1):

      (A) Intraoperative adjuvant application of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and low molecular weight
      heparin (LMWH) via intraocular infusion during routine pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in
      high-risk patients for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) with primary rhegmatogenous
      retinal detachment (RRD).

      Versus:

      (B) Routinely used intraocular infusion with balanced salt solution (BSS) during routine PPV.
