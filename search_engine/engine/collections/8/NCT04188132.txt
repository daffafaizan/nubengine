      recovery in stroke. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Noninvasive Sensorimotor
      Rhythm (SMR) based EEG based BCI using motor execution and Motor Imagery tasks can aid in
      rehabilitation of upper limb movements in chronic stroke.

      The project aims to explore an SMR-based BCI system that can exploit the sensorimotor rhythm
      voluntary modulation to play a virtual game as neurofeedback using motor executory tasks and
      imagined hand movements by stroke patients, who suffer from upper limb disability. Studies
      have shown that movement and motor imagery (MI) (i.e., the mental rehearsal of a movement
      without any activation of the muscles) induce similar EEG patterns over the motor cortex.

      Movement execution, preparation and even observation are usually accompanied by a decrease in
      µ- and β-rhythm in the cortical area representing the involved body segment. Such a reduction
      is called event-related desynchronization (ERD).The increase in µ-rhythm, i.e. event-related
      synchronization (ERS), is observed in the regions of the brain representing body segments,
      which are not involved in the task.This study is a pilot study to examine the feasibility of
      a SMR based EEG BCI using motor task and motor imagery and involve a gaming feedback for
      same.

      The first two days will be used for calibrating the BMI using commands in computer screen
      followed by further two days for testing the BMI and feedback control during gaming in
      computer to move the ball in the computer screen.
