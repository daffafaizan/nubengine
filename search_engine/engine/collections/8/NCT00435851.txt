      26 French centers. It aims at comparing four strategies of management of postoperative
      radioiodine ablation, each strategy combining a method of TSH stimulation (thyroid hormone
      withdrawal or rhTSH (ThyrogenÂ®, Genzyme)) and an activity of 131I (low-dose (1GBq, 30 mCi) or
      high-dose (3,7GBq, 100 mCi)).
