      parallel stripes arranged along the long axis of the tendon, reflecting the arrangement of
      collagen fiber bundles in the tendon. The micro-structure of tendons can be quantified by
      analyzing the speckle pattern of ultrasonic images. A research team used fast Fourier
      transform to convert ultrasound images of tendons into two-dimensional spatial frequency
      spectra, and used linear discriminate analysis to calculate multiple spatial frequency
      parameters. The results indicated that there were 5 parameters with the highest accuracy in
      discriminating Achilles tendinopathy. There is a significant difference in the spectrum
      frequency parameters of whether the tendon was loaded and whether there was a tendinopathy
      tendon. Past studies using spatial frequency analysis in patients with shoulder pain, and
      they found that there was no significant difference between the asymptomatic control group
      and shoulder pain patients. The risk factors of rotator cuff tendon injury is related
      advanced age, dominant hand, and repeated overhead activities. Therefore, in this study, we
      will recruit participants of different ages and investigate the results of spatial frequency
      analysis of bilateral shoulders ultrasound images. The aim of this study is to know whether
      these factors may affect the micro-structure of the rotator cuff tendons and establish the
      reference norm of spatial frequency analysis parameters in those without obvious tendon
      degeneration or injury. In addition, we aim to compare the differences between spectrum
      analysis parameters with several instruments by using different ultrasonic equipment. This
      study could provide a reference for the clinical application of spatial frequency analysis in
      tendon ultrasound images.
