      vasculature and its consistency. Specifically, the investigators will assess the consistency
      of the quantitative data by measuring hepatic blood Inflow (hepatic artery + portal vein) and
      outflow (inferior vena cava differential flow). According to the mass conservation physical
      property, blood inflow must equals blood outflow. The relative gap between the measured
      values will characterize the consistency of the acquisition.
