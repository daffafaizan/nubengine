      standard" for management of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). We will compare the efficacy
      and safety of a novel surgical approach with short interval of 2-3 weeks ("fast-track")
      compared to the standard long interval of 6-10 weeks. Included will be patients with hip,
      knee or shoulder PJI, in whom all prosthetic components are removed; excluded will be
      patients treated with prosthesis retention or one-stage exchange and PJI caused by
      difficult-to-treat organisms. Patients will be randomized into short versus long interval
      surgical procedure, using a standard antibiotic regimen of 12 weeks in both study arms. The
      recruitment period of this multicenter treatment/outcome trial is 24 months, follow-up period
      12 months and the calculated sample size 418 patients (i.e. 209 patient for each study arm).
      Primary endpoint is the infection outcome, secondary endpoint is the functional outcome,
      defined by established scores for joint-specific scores, pain and quality of life scores. The
      expected outcomes in the short interval ("fast-track") arm are (i) improved infection outcome
      (i.e. longer infection-free period and less treatment-related adverse events); (ii) improved
      functional outcome, and (iii) reduced healthcare expenses. In addition, pharmacokinetic
      studies will be performed and a biobank of microbes and biological samples will be
      established. This study has high clinical relevance for an increasing public health challenge
      related to device-associated infections.
