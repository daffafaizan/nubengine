      University Guro Hospital from April 2015 to January 2017. Based on the CD4 T-cell counts at
      the time of study enrollment, HIV-infected subjects aged ≥ 18 years were divided into two
      groups, group 1 (subjects with CD4 T-cell counts ≥350 cells/µL) and group 2 (subjects with
      CD4 T-cell counts <350 cells/µL).

      The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that the immune responses to PCV13
      serotypes in Group 2 (CD4 T-cell counts <350 cells/µL) were not inferior to those in Group 1
      (CD4 T-cell counts ≥350 cells/µL) at one month after vaccination. In addition, the safety
      profiles of PCV13 were compared between two study groups.

      HIV-infected subjects aged ≥ 18 years with stable underlying diseases (≥ 4 weeks on HAART)
      were eligible for this study. All available subjects with low CD4 T-cell counts (<350
      cells/µL, group 2) were recruited, and age/visit day-matched controls with high CD4 T-cell
      counts (≥350 cells/µL, group 1) were enrolled. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) a
      history of pneumococcal infection within the recent five years, 2) previous pneumococcal
      vaccination, 3) current opportunistic infections, 4) known immunodeficiency other than HIV
      infection and 5) coagulation disorders.

      The study was approved by the ethics committee of Korea University Guro Hospital (IRB No.
      2014GR0014) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
      Clinical Practice. Informed consent was taken for all participants before enrollment. Venous
      blood samples of 10 mL were collected on day 0 and post-vaccination day 28 ± 7.
