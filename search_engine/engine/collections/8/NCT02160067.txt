      mg and 12.6 mg, compared to 1st generation patches at 2 strengths: 5 mg and 20 mg, to assess
      dose proportionality and relative bioavailability before proceeding to a definitive program
      of studies. Determination is by measurement of drug concentrations in the blood at serial
      collection time points pre-dose until 288 hours post-patch application.
