      eating behaviours.

      The research question will be approached using a combination of methods. The first is the
      experience sampling method, where data is gathered from participants as they are going about
      their day-to-day lives. This method comprises two sub-sections - a correlational study, and
      an experimental study. The second approach is the experimental laboratory method, where
      participants will be randomly assigned to different conditions while given the opportunity to
      eat. This registration describes the experimental laboratory method.

      Upon arrival at the lab, participants will first be required to fill in some online
      questionnaires (e.g. demographic information, mood rating scales). They will then be
      randomised to one of two conditions - to engage in food photography, or to engage in non-food
      photography - while eating some food and completing some rating scales. These photos will be
      taken with the intention of sharing on social media. Participants will then fill in some more
      online questionnaires, before leaving the lab. After the session, the amount of food consumed
      by the participants will be weighed.

      As a control, all participants will be required to come back to the lab for a second visit
      one week later, where they will all complete the same eating and rating task, but without any
      phone use.

      The expected outcome of the project is to collectively evaluate the data from the various
      methods to conclude how social media use, and in particular the act of food photography,
      influences the various aspects of eating behaviours.
