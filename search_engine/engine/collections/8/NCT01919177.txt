      effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice and nitrate-depleted beetroot juice will be assessed
      in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (n=20). A total of 20 subjects
      will be enrolled over a 1.5 year period and randomized in a cross-over design to a single
      dose of nitrate-rich beetroot juice and nitrate-depleted beetroot juice. The order of the
      interventions will be randomized; thus, all subjects will receive the nitrate-rich and
      nitrate-depleted juice, with a 4-7 day washout period in-between studies.
