      an approved monofocal or Toric intraocular lens. Fellow eyes will receive an approved
      monofocal or Toric IOL (no Omega capsule).

      Eyes randomized to receive the Gemini capsule will be eligible to have a secondary procedure
      (post 1-month postoperative visit) to correct refractive error.
