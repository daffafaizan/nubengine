    
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two primary forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD). Recent studies have shown that TNF- α may play a major role in the
      etiopathogenesis of UC, justifying the use of anti-TNF-α therapies. Adalimumab is an
      immunoglobulin G1 that specifically binds to TNF-α, and neutralizes its function; it also
      modulates the biological response, induced and regulated by TNF-α.

      Conventional UC therapy quite commonly does not bring satisfactory results; therefore,
      interest in new treatment methods has been growing recently. Biological therapy is a highly
      promising prospect, since it enables to discontinue the use of glucocorticosteroids and
      immunosuppressives or their dose reduction, shortens the hospitalization period, allows to
      avoid surgical treatment, extends the clinical response, the remission period and improves
      the patient's quality of life.

      Thus, the present study assesses the clinical response of active ulcerative colitis to
      adalimumab treatment.
