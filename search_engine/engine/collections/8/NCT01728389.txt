      haematologic malignancies, especially leukaemias and lymphomas, providing curative potential.
      The optimal donor is HLA-matched sibling and G-CSF stimulated peripheral blood is nowadays
      the most common source of stem cells. Routinely used route of stem cell transplantation is
      intravenous infusion via central venous catheter. Based on the animal studies, only 10-15% of
      intravenously transplanted stem cells migrate to haematopoietic sites while the rest is lost
      in other organs. Results of studies of direct intrabone allogenic cord-blood cells
      transplantation in humans confirm that this route of transplantation is associated with less
      probability of graft failure and moreover may reduce risk of graft-versus-host disease and
      malignancy relapse. For those purposes in the current study we investigate intrabone route of
      allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Our intention is to achieve fast
      engraftment and minimize risk of relapse and graft graft-versus-host disease.
