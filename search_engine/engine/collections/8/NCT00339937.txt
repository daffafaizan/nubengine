      National Cancer Institute and the University of Palermo to better understand the prevalence
      and risk factors for the newly discovered human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) and Kaposi s sarcoma
      (KS), which may be a consequence of HHV8 infection. There are four short-term projects:

        1. To determine HHV8 seroprevalence in extant, unlinked sera from informative groups,
           including homosexual men, persons with sexually transmitted diseases, and in general
           population groups, particularly the elderly. In addition, HHV8 prevalence and other
           serological studies may be determined among other adults, particularly those who may be
           recruited for future studies and those likely to enhance understanding of HHV8 serology.

        2. To identify a pediatric syndrome that might be associated with HHV8 infection, HHV8
           seroprevalence will be determined in sera from hospitalized children with a wide range
           of clinical conditions.

        3. To determine HHV8 seroprevalence in various regions of Italy and by HLA Class II groups
           that have been linked to increased (HLA-DR5) or decreased (HLA-DR3) risk of KS, using
           extant, unlinked sera and data from volunteer bone marrow donors.

        4. To conduct a case control study that will identify risk factors for KS among persons who
           are infected with HHV8 and who manifest anti-HHV8 latent antibodies.

      The results of these projects will be summarized for publication in the medical and
      scientific literature and for the design and prioritization of related projects in the
      future.
