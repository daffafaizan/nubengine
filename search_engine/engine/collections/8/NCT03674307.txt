      list and after transplantation. Current standard care involves screening for coronary artery
      disease prior to waitlist entry, then every 1-2 years, according to perceived risk, until
      transplanted. The aim of screening is two-fold. Firstly to identify patients with
      asymptomatic coronary disease to enable either correction, by bypass surgery or angioplasty,
      or removal of the patient from the list, with the ultimate aim of preventing premature
      cardiovascular mortality at the time of, or soon after kidney transplantation. Secondly, from
      a societal perspective, to prevent mis-direction of scarce donor organs into recipients who
      experience early mortality. This current screening strategy is not evidence based, has
      substantial known and potential harms, and is very costly. Two major issues of uncertainty
      require addressing in sequence: (1) whether to periodically screen asymptomatic wait-listed
      patients for occult coronary artery disease; and (2) whether to revascularise coronary
      stenoses in asymptomatic patients prior to transplantation. The CARSK study seeks to address
      the first of these 2 issues.

      CARSK aims to

        1. Test the hypothesis that after screening for wait list entry, no further screening for
           coronary artery disease (CAD) is non-inferior to the current standard care which is
           screening all asymptomatic wait-listed patients for CAD at regular intervals.

        2. Compare the benefits and costs of not screening versus regular CAD screening from a
           health system perspective.
