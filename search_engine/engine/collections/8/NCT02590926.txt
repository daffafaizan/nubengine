    
      The present is a multicenter prospective study enrolling all patients with stable angina
      and/or documented ischemia presenting with:

        -  An angiographic stenosis of more than 50% and less than 90% of the left main

        -  Any proximal descending anterior with a stenosis of more than 50% and less than 90%

        -  Two or three vessel disease with a stenosis of more than 50% and less than 90% and a
           left ventricle ejection fraction less than 40%

        -  Single remaining patent coronary artery with stenosis >50% and less than 90%

      In all of these patients FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve) will be performed according to
      guidelines and stenting will be performed or deferred according to the result of this test.
      Other techniques, like iFR, IVUS and OCT will be left at the operators' choice and will be
      recorded. MACE (a composite end point of death, myocardial infarction and target vessel
      revascularization and stent thrombosis) will be the primary end point, while its single
      components will be the secondary ones.
