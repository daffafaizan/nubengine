      the lack of sites that offer high-level breast MRI, limit clinical access to screening MRIs.

      One reason for the high cost is that current breast MRI protocols are time consuming to
      acquire and read. A typical MRI study occupies the MRI system for up to 40 minutes and
      generates several hundred images.

      DCE-MRI allows the assessment of high-resolution breast morphology and enhancement kinetics
      to depict angiogenesis as a tumor-specific feature. At any given field strength, DCE-MRI is
      the most sensitive modality for breast cancer detection, with a pooled sensitivity of 93%;
      DCE-MRI has good pooled specificity of 71%.

      With the abbreviated MRI protocol, the acquisition time was substantially decreased to 3
      minutes, compared with 17 minutes for the full diagnostic protocol. The interpretation time
      of the abbreviated protocol was 28 seconds on average and 2.8 seconds when the MIP image
      alone was evaluated.
