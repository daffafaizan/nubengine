      of the prognosis of MSA-P, it would be very useful to have objective tools to assist in the
      differential diagnosis between both disorders. Since dysarthria is a common early symptom in
      both diseases and of different origin, the innovative goal of this project is to use
      dysarthria, through a digital processing of voice recordings of patients, as a vehicle to
      distinguish between PD and MSA-P in early disease stages.

      The team will build a corpus of voice samples of patients with both diseases and a recent
      diagnosis (less than 4 years) and controls. This corpus will consist in sustained vowels,
      utterances of a standard text and spontaneous speech. The recordings will be performed using
      a high quality digital recorder (H4n) and the DIANA and EVA-2 workstations. DIANA is a
      state-of-the-art system dedicated to pathological voice recording and analysis.

      An electroglottograph (EGG), a non-invasive device, will be also used in conjunction with the
      recordings to provide the ground truth of glottal opening and closure instants during
      utterances. The use of an EGG can be very useful given that OGI and GCI provide valuable
      information about the voice short-time dynamics.
