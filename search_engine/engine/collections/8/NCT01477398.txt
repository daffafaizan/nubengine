      responsiveness after inhaled anesthesia. The benefits of accelerating patient recovery in the
      operating room may extend to the post anesthesia care unit if the patient is more alert and
      easier to care for when they arrive in the unit. Respiratory patterns and gas levels -
      including CO2, O2, and anesthetic vapor - will be measured in order to better understand a
      patient's respiratory status during recovery.

      In Feb 2009 we finished our first study (IRB 26111) and submitted a publication. The journal
      reviewers identified a serious limitation: we could not report whether the treated patients
      recovered from anesthesia faster because the treatment (inspired CO2) caused them to breath
      more vigorously or because the treatment caused the anesthetic vapors to be cleared more
      rapidly from the brain. Our new application uses essentially the same study protocol as the
      former study but adds chest bands to measure the patient's rate of breathing and expired gas
      monitoring to measure the rate at which the vapors are removed.
