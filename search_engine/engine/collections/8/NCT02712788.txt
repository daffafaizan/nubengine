      vasospasm by adding it to standard therapy. This will take the form of a randomized,
      controlled trial in which patients will receive either standard hyperdynamic therapy or
      hyperdynamic therapy + milrinone. The hypothesis of this study is that good outcomes will be
      25% more common in the experimental (milrinone) group than the control (standard therapy)
      group.
