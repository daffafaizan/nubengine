      To provide a prospective 2-year post-operative evaluation of complications and 9-year
      long-term survivorship analysis of patients implanted with the Oxfordâ„¢ Meniscal
      Unicompartmental Knee System at multiple sites in the United States.

      Study Design

      The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized post approval study.
      There are two phases to this study:

        1. A complications study where patients will be followed for at least 2 years to record all
           complications that may occur, and

        2. A survival study that will record at yearly intervals out to 9 years whether or not the
           device is still in place or if it has been removed for any reason.

      Phase 1 requires clinical follow-up (0-2 year) and patients will be evaluated at pre-defined
      intervals up to 2 years post-operative. Information gathered in phase 1 includes all adverse
      events and survival data.

      Phase 2 (3-9 year) only gathers survival data through patient directed mailing and/or phone
      call.
