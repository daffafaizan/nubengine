      requires co-operation and long-term commitment from the patients and their families. The
      medication itself may cause bothersome side effects and it can pose economic burden to the
      patients and the society. In contrast, lifestyle modifications, particularly relaxation
      technique, are less costly and relatively free of any side effects. Once the patients master
      the techniques, they can practice by themselves at home and at any time that is convenient to
      them. There is evidence from at least one RCT that the techniques are effective in reducing
      the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), even after a short
      practice of only two months.

      In this study, the investigators propose a randomized control trial to examine the
      effectiveness of modified relaxation (MR) technique to control HTN in Thai postmenopausal
      women against a control group who practice no MR. Such a study in Thai population has not
      been done before. In addition, the investigators will extend the period of observation up to
      16 weeks, to assess longer-term patients' compliance, and the effects of MR on BP.
