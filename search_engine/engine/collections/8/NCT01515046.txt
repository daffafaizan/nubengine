      States and is increasing in incidence; the prognosis remains dismal. We propose to
      investigate an entirely new approach, using pharmacological ascorbate, combined with
      Gemcitabine, to treat this cancer. Intravenous ascorbate (i.e., ascorbic acid, vitamin C),
      but not oral ascorbate, produces high plasma concentrations, which are in the range that can
      be cytotoxic to tumor cells. Though ascorbate has been utilized in cancer therapy, few
      studies have investigated intravenous deliver of ascorbate. Preliminary studies from our
      group have demonstrated that ascorbate induces oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in
      pancreatic cancer cells; this cytotoxicity appears to be greater in tumor vs. normal cells.
      We hypothesize that production of H2O2 mediates the increased susceptibility of pancreatic
      cancer cells to ascorbate-induced metabolic oxidative stress. Gemcitabine is the standard
      chemotherapy drug used to treat pancreatic cancer.
