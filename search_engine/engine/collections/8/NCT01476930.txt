      cupping therapy plus SERKANGABIN or to receive conventional medical treatment. The use of CAM
      in migraine is a growing phenomenon. Migraine patients seek and explore both conventional and
      CAM approaches. Wet cupping is an ancient medical technique still used in several
      contemporary societies. It is being used in management of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
      and headaches, renal and biliary stones and for maintaining health. Little experimental study
      has been devoted to test its efficacy to treat migraine headache. Investigators planned this
      study for evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of wet cupping and an Iranian traditional
      medicine preparation, SERKANGABIN in treatment of migraine headache compared with current
      medicine protocols. SERKANGABIN is a preparation of honey, vinegar and distilled mint water
      that in traditional Iranian medicine is believed to have therapeutic effects in many diseases
      (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive airway
      disease, interstitial lung disease, hepatitis, fatty liver, ischemic heart disease, migraine,
      cerebrovascular diseases)
