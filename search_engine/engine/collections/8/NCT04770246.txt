    
      Study TAS-117-201 is an open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy, safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TAS-117 in patients with advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors harboring germline PTEN inactivating mutations. The study will be
      conducted in two parts:

        -  Part A: Safety lead-in (Dose Escalation and Dose Regimen Confirmation)

        -  Part B: Single-arm Phase 2 study

      Patients will receive TAS-117 orally every day or intermittently on a 21-day cycle

        -  Part A (Dose Escalation): up to 36 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors
           (excluding primary brain tumors) irrespective of gene alterations. The Dose Escalation
           consists of 2 cohorts: Daily Dose Regimen and Intermittent Dose Regimen.

        -  Part A (Dose Regimen Confirmation): approximately 6 patients with advanced or metastatic
           solid tumors (excluding primary brain tumors) harboring germline PTEN inactivating
           mutations

        -  Part B (Phase 2): approximately 54 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors
           (excluding primary brain tumors) harboring germline PTEN inactivating mutations

      Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other of the
      criteria for treatment discontinuation is met. For patients who discontinue treatment for
      reasons other than disease progression, tumor assessments should be continued until
      radiologic disease progression is documented or until initiation of subsequent new anticancer
      therapy (whichever occurs first).

      Patients will be followed for survival every 12 weeks (Â±2 weeks) until survival events
      (deaths) have been reported for 75% of enrolled patients or the study is terminated early by
      the Sponsor.
