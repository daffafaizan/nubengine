      explore, as that application empowers the patient to apply self-care modalities that can be
      utilized in the long-term, for depression as well as for many other stress-related illnesses.

      Behavioral and Mind/Body techniques, such as the Relaxation Response, have been reported to
      be useful therapeutically (often as an adjunct to medical treatment) in numerous conditions
      that are caused or exacerbated by stress including: mild to moderate depression/anxiety;
      anxiety; headache; back/neck pain; myocardial ischemia; premature ventricular contractions in
      stable ischemic heart disease or hypertension; osteoarthritis; stress symptoms; improved
      outcomes after cardiac and other surgery; pain relief and anxiety reduction in femoral
      arteriography and other invasive medical procedures; premenstrual syndrome; infertility;
      psychosomatic complaints; chronic pain; insomnia; musculoskeletal disorders; wound healing;
      rheumatoid arthritis; fibromyalgia and disease and treatment related symptoms of cancer. In
      our recent review of the literature, we suggest that the Relaxation Response may be an
      appropriate and relevant therapeutic state to counteract several stress-related disease
      processes.
