      consumption of opioids. Thoracic paravertebral block is considered as an ideal regional
      analgesic choice for video-assisted thoracic surgery, but it still has some side effects,
      such as pneumothorax, vascular injury, especially for novices. Recent years,
      ultrasound-guided mid-point transverse process to pleura block and erector spinae plane block
      are reported for thoracic surgery. The insertion depth in these two methods is more
      superficial than traditional paravertebral block. They could have less side effects.
      Therefore, we design a randomised control study to compare them on block effects,
      postoperative pain and analgesic consumption in video-assisted thoracic surgery.
