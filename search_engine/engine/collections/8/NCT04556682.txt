    
      Coronary artery calcification (CAC) occurs in over 90% of men and 67% of women older than 70
      years old .

      Severe coronary calcification may be present in about 20% of patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) .

      Coronary calcification may impair stent delivery and expansion and damage the polymer/drug
      coating, resulting in impaired drug delivery and predispose to restenosis and stent
      thrombosis.

      Intravascular imaging as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) are good tools to assess calcium burden, distribution and thickness. Among the two
      imaging techniques, OCT was found to be more accurate than IVUS in defining calcium burden,
      calcium area , thickness and calcium length.

      Rotational atherectomy (RA) as a method of severely calcified lesions modification before
      Drug-Eluting-Stent (DES) implantation has shown good outcomes in recent studies. However, its
      efficacy is reduced in presence of deep calcification.

      Recently, intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has been introduced as a novel modality for
      severely calcified coronary lesion preparation with good preliminary outcomes .

      Currently the two techniques are regularly being used in combination in order to achieve
      optimal results . Whether IVL is a method equally good (or superior) to rotablation in cases
      where anatomy does not exclude the use of either technique (for example non
      balloon-uncrossable, heavily calcified lesions) has not yet been discussed.
