        -  M7824 is an investigational agent in phase IB/II clinical development with dual activity
           against TGF-beta signaling (TGF-beta ligand trap ; extracellular domain of human
           TGF-beta receptor II) and immune checkpoint ligand inhibition (PD-L1 inhibition;
           avelumab, fully human IgG1 mAb directed against human PD-L1) with an acceptable toxicity
           profile and early signals of anti-cancer activity including in pancreas cancer.

        -  Gemcitabine (2 <=,2 <=-Difluordesoxycytidine) is a standard-of-care nucleoside analogue
           in pancreas cancer with immunomodulatory mechanisms of actions in pancreas cancer
           patients.

        -  Preclinical studies in authochtenous and syngeneic murine models have shown that
           TGF-beta inhibition and PD-L1 inhibition cooperate with gemcitabine to achieve reduction
           of tumor growth and extension of survival induce anti-tumor immunity, and reprogram the
           immune landscape.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of M7824 in combination with gemcitabine in
           subjects with metastatic or locally advanced pancreas cancer.

        -  To determine best overall response (BOR) rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria
           (RECIST 1.1) in advanced pancreas cancer subjects.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

        -  Patients must have progressed on prior chemotherapeutic regimen.

        -  Concurrent treatment with non-permitted drugs and other interventions, prior therapy
           with gemcitabine or any antibody / drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins (immune
           checkpoints) such as anti-PD 1, anti PD-L1, or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4
           (CTLA 4 antibody) is not allowed.

      Design:

      - The proposed study is a phase IB/II study of M7824 in combination with gemcitabine in a
      safety run-in of 6-18 patients and, if safe and tolerated, will proceed to an expansion phase
      II cohort with a standard Simon Minimax design .
