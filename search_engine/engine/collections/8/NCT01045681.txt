      myeloma (MM) patients is unfavourable, and the search for new treatment regimens, including
      drugs with novel mechanisms of action is essential.

      Bendamustine and bortezomib have shown high activity boch in first-line regimens and
      pre-treated patients. The novel mechanism of action of the proteasome inhibitor and the
      non-cross resistance of bendamustine to other alkylating agents established in the first-line
      treatment of multiple myeloma seem to recommend a combination of the two drugs for salvage
      therapy (second-line regimen). Finally, the promising response data in a series of relapsing
      MM patients treated with bendamustine, bortezomib and prednisone support this assumption, as
      well as the feasibility and tolerability of the combination.

      In summary, there is some evidence for a favorable risk/benefit ratio for the combination of
      bendamustine, bortezomib and a corticoid drug, warranting the exploration in a larger,
      prospectively designed multicenter phase II study.
