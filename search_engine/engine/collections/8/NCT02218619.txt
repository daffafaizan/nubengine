      diabetes.

      The primary aim is to test the clinical efficacy of an already approved agent, TUDCA,
      re-purposed to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve beta cell survival in patients
      with new onset type 1 diabetes. The primary endpoint of this proposed double-blinded
      randomized placebo-controlled pilot study is c-peptide measured after mixed meal stimulation
      test at randomization and then at 6 and 12 months of treatment with TUDCA compared to
      treatment with placebo and at 6 months following treatment.

      TUDCA is an oral medication with an excellent safety profile that is approved for use in
      Europe for gall stones and liver disease. The drug and similar compounds has been used in
      children, as young as newborns, and in adults. TUDCA's ability to lower endoplasmic reticulum
      stress has only recently been recognized and will be applied to new-onset type 1 diabetes in
      this proposal. If this pilot trial is successful, future studies could include broadening the
      recipients to antibody-positive pre-type 1 diabetes patients and/or combining TUDCA with
      other agents shown to have a beneficial effect on insulin secretion in new-onset type 1
      diabetes.
