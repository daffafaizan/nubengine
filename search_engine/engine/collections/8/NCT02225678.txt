      Develop a point-of-service assay to assess eosinophilic airway inflammation

      Proposal Specific Aims:

        1. To establish the infrastructure and test the feasibility of sputum collection in a
           clinical setting as a minimally invasive patient sampling process for biomarker testing

        2. To transform the laboratory-based eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) ELISA detection assay into
           a clinic-friendly assessment that does not require sophisticated laboratory equipment
