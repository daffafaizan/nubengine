      clinical setting and gather data regarding the performance of the Invendo SC20 colonoscope in
      a real-world US population. The objective of the study is to specifically monitor three
      points:

        1. The diagnostic performance of the device including polyp and adenoma detection rates;

        2. The therapeutic performance of the device (the ability of the physician to remove/biopsy
           identified lesions);

        3. Performance of the device in a typical colonoscopy population, including patients with
           underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), previous pelvic surgery or irradiation,
           obesity, diverticular disease, and previous colorectal surgery, as they present in the
           study population (see below C.).
