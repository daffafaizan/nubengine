      teeth and is formed by the mineralization of dental plaque.

      Thus, maintaining oral hygiene and adhering to maintenance programs keep low levels of plaque
      and calculus.

      The electromagnetic field is known for bone healing by lessening osteoclast activity,
      improving osteoid formation, and stimulating angiogenesis. Furthermore, the electromagnetic
      field has an antimicrobial effect.

      Electric toothbrushes have shown a statistical reduction in plaque accumulation and gingival
      inflammation.

      Previous studies have shown that Silk'n Toothwave results in less plaque accumulation and
      calculus formation, in addition to stain removal and teeth whitening.

      Study aim: to asses the effect of the electromagnetic field in a tooth brush (Silk'n
      Toothwave) on calculus accumulation and gingival parameters.
