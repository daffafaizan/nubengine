      aspiration (TBNA) for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) had not been evaluated. The
      diagnostic impact of TBNA when the EBUS probe was adjacent to lesions remained to be
      determined.

      Here we designed a randomized, prospective study to evaluate : (1) The diagnostic yield of
      EBUS-guided TBNA in PPLs; (2) The role of TBNA when EBUS probe was adjacent to the lesions.
      Lesions not visible by bronchoscopy were defined as PPLs (no findings of endobronchial
      lesions, extrinsic compression, submucosal infiltration, or orifice narrowing). The TBNA
      apparatus (Olympus NA-2C-1) was inserted through the working channel, and was advanced until
      it reached the target lesion which was localized by EBUS. Negative manual suction was applied
      with the 20 ml syringe. The specimens were then smeared on glass slides and immersed in 95%
      alcohol. At least 3 aspirates per lesion were obtained. Using simple randomization with
      random digit table, we randomly assigned patients to undergo EBUS-guided TBB and BW or
      EBUS-guided TBNA, TBB and BW.
