      Patients will either be administered the brand of IGIV therapy ordered by their prescribing
      physician, or for patients issued unspecified or generic prescriptions of IGIV therapy,
      octagam® 5% or another brand of IGIV therapy will be provided by the Investigator according
      to federal, state and local regulations and good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines.

      The primary objective is to assess and evaluate the safety profile of octagam® 5% during or
      after administration under routine clinical use for all labeled indications, with a special
      emphasis on the occurrence of TEEs. The incidence of TEEs in patients receiving octagam® 5%
      will be compared with the incidence rate in a matching concurrent control group of patients
      receiving other IGIVs for routine clinical use.
