        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cladribine when administered after bryostatin 1
           in patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of cladribine.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously on days 1-3 immediately followed by cladribine
      IV continuously on days 4-8. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 2
      additional courses past CR.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating dose levels of cladribine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
