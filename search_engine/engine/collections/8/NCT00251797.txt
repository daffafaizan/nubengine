      used to determine toxicity and maximum dose. Currently, there are no "standard" treatments
      for Recurrent CNS Tumors. In this study, approximately 14 patients with Recurrent CNS Tumors
      will receive treatment with irinotecan, an intravenous drug, and thalidomide, a drug taken by
      mouth. Both have been approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration as treatments for
      cancer, but they have not been tested together for brain cancer.

      The study will try to answer these questions:

        1. What is the highest dose of thalidomide brain cancer patients can receive safely in
           combination with irinotecan?

        2. How well does this combination work to shrink brain tumors, and how long do responses to
           treatment last?

        3. What side effects does the combination of drugs cause?

        4. How does treatment affect patients' quality of life (how they feel and what activities
           they are able to do)?
