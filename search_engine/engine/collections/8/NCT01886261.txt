      web-based processing system for location (GPS) and physical activity (accelerometer) data. We
      will collect data on a pilot sample of 40 Hispanic persons to a) test the validity of PALMS
      assessments of transportation modes, and activity in different locations against an objective
      record of activities derived from images collected by Vicon Revue; b) compare PALMS
      assessments of transportation modes and activity locations to other self-report measures and
      interview measures; c) assess the construct validity of PALMS-based activity assessment.

      We will be assessing the usability of PALMS in a research staff with no previous experience
      of using the PALMS system. We will be assessing the added value of using PALMS to examine a
      place-based intervention in an existing cohort study.
