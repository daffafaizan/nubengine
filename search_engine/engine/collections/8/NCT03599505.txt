      Department of Ultrasound, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. The
      study is expected to enroll 200 patients. The feasibility and value of Intraoperative
      ultrasonographic localization of pulmonary nodules in VATS will be explored. The accuracy
      rate of localization will be evaluated using gray scale mode and elastography mode.
      Intraoperative ultrasonographic localization will be performed using an ultrasound system (HI
      VISON Ascendus), which is equipped with a 5-10MHz mechanical probe (EUP-OL531).
