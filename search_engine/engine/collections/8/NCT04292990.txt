      radiation-induced oral mucositis pain in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. But they do
      so by different mechanisms and in different effects.

      Morphine is a classic strong analgesic, which has been widely used in patients with advanced
      cancer pain. It has achieved satisfactory results in pain control, sleep improvement and
      quality of life. Oral morphine has been regarded as the standard treatment for moderate and
      severe cancer pain.

      Fentanyl transdermal patch is a system device for transdermal delivery of drugs. It is
      compressed on a film containing fentanyl memory. The film can continuously release fentanyl
      into the blood circulation and maintain stable for more than 72 hours. It is not affected by
      gastrointestinal PH or food, and it has no hepatic frst-pass effect, with a bioavailability
      of up to 92%.

      This study will test the efficacy and safety of morphine controlled-release tablets compared
      to fentanyl transdermal patch in the treatment of pain in patients with radiation-induced
      oral mucositis.
