    
      140 patients with moderate to severe epistaxis secondary to HHT will be randomized to receive
      one of four intranasal sprays for a period of 12 weeks and then followed for an additional 12
      weeks off therapy. Enrollment will occur over a period of 18-36 months. The primary endpoint
      will be the frequency of epistaxis. Secondary endpoints will include duration of epistaxis,
      the Hoag Epistaxis Severity Score (ESS), a quality of life survey, satisfaction with
      treatment, hemoglobin and ferritin levels, transfusion requirements, and treatment failure.
      The sprays will be: saline spray (Placebo); estriol 0.1% in methylcellulose suspension (EST);
      tranexamic acid 10% in saline (TA), and bevacizumab 1% in saline (BEV). All sprays will be
      applied to the nasal mucosa by an identical spray bottle at a dose of 0.1 ml per nostril
      twice daily (total dose of 0.4 ml daily). Thus, the delivered doses will be: EST, 0.4 mg/day;
      TA, 40 mg/day; BEV, 4 mg/day.
