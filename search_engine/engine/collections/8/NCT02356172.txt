    
      Isolated GnRH Deficiency (IGD) is a rare disorder characterized by decreased secretion of
      GnRH, resulting in impaired gonadotropin secretion and subsequent impaired sex-steroid
      production. Patients with this rare clinical syndrome present with absent, delayed, or
      stalled pubertal development by eighteen years of age. In addition, non-reproductive
      phenotypes of this spectrum have been identified in some individuals, including anosmia,
      auditory and ocular defects, and skeletal, neurological, and renal anomalies.

      Due to the complex heterogeneity among affected individuals and the rarity of the disease
      itself, the phenotypic spectrum has not been fully investigated. The relationship between
      psychological disorders and IGD remains largely unexplored as a phenotypic association,
      despite evidence that disorders of puberty and reproduction can have a negative impact on the
      psychological profile.

      This study aims to conduct a preliminary investigation into the association between
      psychological symptoms and IGD. We plan to recruit adult patients with a diagnosis of IGD to
      complete online assessments that measure psychological health outcomes from the patient
      perspective in order to gauge the prevalence of negative emotional states among affected
      individuals, compared to healthy controls. This will determine whether further studies are
      necessary to investigate psychiatric disease as part of the phenotypic spectrum of the
      disorder, and will improve our understanding of this complex disorder as a whole. Greater
      knowledge of the psychological impact of IGD may impact the current standards of evaluation
      and treatment of patients with delayed pubertal maturation.
