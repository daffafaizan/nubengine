      and are a common congenital cardiac anomaly accounting for approximately 10% of all
      congenital heart disease. They are one of the most common congenital heart defects to present
      in adulthood. Untreated, ASDs produce right heart volume overload and progressive impairment
      over time, including reduced aerobic capacity, atrial dysrhythmias, congestive heart failure,
      pulmonary hypertension, and potential paradoxical embolism. In the U.S. alone it is estimated
      that approximately 10,000 new patients per year can be expected to have an ASD. Successful
      surgical repair of ASD has been performed for 50 years with continued improvement in
      technique and outcomes. King and Mills reported the first transcatheter closure of ASD in
      1976, but the delivery system was quite large and impractical, especially for younger
      patients. With time, improvements in design concepts and materials discoveries have led to
      improved results in transcatheter closure systems. Several devices are now available
      commercially for transcatheter ASD closure.
