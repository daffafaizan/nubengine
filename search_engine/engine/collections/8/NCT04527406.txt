      deformities.Therefore, traditionally, children with a clear diagnosis should be fixed with a
      brace to delay the aggravation of scoliosis and then undergo surgery after 5 years of age.
      The design of this study is to conduct a single-center randomized controlled study. Children
      aged 3-5 years old diagnosed as congenital hemivertebrae will be randomly divided into the
      early operation group and the control group. The early operation group will undergo posterior
      hemivertebra resection. The control group received brace plaster fixation to reduce the
      progression of scoliosis, and posterior scoliosis correction will be performed after the age
      was over 5 years old. The primary outcome measures are the length of spine surgery for the
      two groups of children. The secondary outcome measures are change of scoliosis cobb angle, by
      comparing preoperative and postoperative cobb angle changes. It is expected that the early
      treatment group will shorten the length of surgery due to the smaller degree of scoliosis.
      Our research is expected to broaden the age-adaptation of classic spinal surgery in the field
      of pediatric spine.
