      randomly allocated into the plum-blossom needle group (n=30) and the habit reversal training
      (HRT) group (n=30). 12-week treatment will be given to all patients of each group, follow-up
      will be made at the 12th week after treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the mean
      change from baseline in the total tic score on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) at
      the 12th week. Secondary outcome measures will include the mean changes in score of YGTSS, TS
      Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and the Children and Adolescents' Quality of Life
      Scale from baseline at other time. Safety will also be evaluated.
