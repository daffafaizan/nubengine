      specified by the CONSORT statement as possible. This will include secure randomisation,
      intention to treat analysis, full reporting of outcomes and clinical follow-up by a person
      who is blinded to the prosthesis used. The trial will follow the code of good clinical
      practice as specified by the hospital trusts Research and Development Committee.

      In Peterborough all hip fracture patients are admitted to the acute trauma ward and
      transferred to the care of the Chief Investigator (Mr Martyn Parker (MJP)). Those patients
      that are willing to participant in this randomised trial are consented prior to surgery.
      Treatment follows standard evidence based protocols with follow-up of all patients in a hip
      fracture clinic. A comprehensive database is maintained for all patients containing both
      audit and research data. Included in this is a standardised assessment of outcome.
