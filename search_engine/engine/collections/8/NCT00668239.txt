      diffuse diabetic macular oedema with intravitreal triamcinolone and laser in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), using a morphofunctional assessment. Patients with clinically
      significant diffuse macular oedema, previously untreated and with a macular thickness >250 Î¼m
      at optical coherence tomography (OCT) were randomized for treatment with Laser or
      intravitreal injection of Triamcinolone acetate. Optical coherence tomography (OCT),
      biomicroscopy, fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography, tonometry, scotometry, visual acuity and
      contrast acuities were performed at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months.
