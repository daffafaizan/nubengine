      the study. All patients undergo a conventional echocardiography after 10 minutes of
      continuous triple site pacing and after 10 minutes of continuous dual site pacing (Customary
      biventricular pacing).Echocardiography studies will be performed to measure dP/dT using
      continuous flow Doppler velocity profiles of mitral regurgitation, LV volumes and Left
      ventricular ejection fraction. Left intraventricular desynchrony is assessed by using TDI.
