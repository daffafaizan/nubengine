      intestinal submucosa ) mesh group. Endpoints will be measured up to 5 years for the study as
      a whole, at 6 months and at 60 months. Prior to and following laparoscopic paraesophageal
      hernia repair, patients will be followed with both subjective and objective measures.
      Subjective evaluation will include symptomatic/quality of life assessment at 1-, 6-, 24-, and
      60- month periods; objective evaluation will include Upper GI study /pH probe study for
      symptomatic patients and for all patients at 6 and 60 months. The investigators hypothesize
      that use of synthetic mesh will have lower recurrence at these time points compared to use of
      biologic mesh.
