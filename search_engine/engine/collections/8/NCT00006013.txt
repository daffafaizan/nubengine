      or relapsed multiple myeloma treated with SU5416. II. Determine the toxicity of SU5416 in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour twice weekly.
      Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients
      are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
