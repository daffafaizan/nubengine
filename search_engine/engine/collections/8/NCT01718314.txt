      intrauterine abnormalities. This minimal invasive modality provides brilliant and clear
      visualization of the entire uterine cavity and besides this, by the operative channel, minor
      procedures may easily be performed in the office setting which is priceless for the
      gynecologist. However, pain related to the procedure may make the procedure uncomfortable for
      the patient and the physician. Together with the operative time, hysteroscope diameter is
      considered as the main factor influencing pain. The pain perceived during hysteroscopy may be
      reduced by using a smaller diameter hysteroscope or by using anesthesia, which decreases pain
      perception.

      In this prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study, we aim to compare
      the effectiveness of sublingual misoprostol versus lidocaine pump spray for pain relief
      during office hysteroscopy.
