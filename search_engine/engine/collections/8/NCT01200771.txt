      conventional morphologic imaging modalities. Results of these two diagnostic procedures in
      identifying diagnostic clues will be compared.

      We assume FDG-PET/CT could be safer and more helpful to reach early final diagnosis in
      patients with FUO and chronic inflammatory syndrome than conventional morphologic imaging
      modalities
