      The primary endpoint of the clinical investigation is the evaluation of the safety and
      effectiveness of the Perceval S valve at 12 months after implant.

      The safety of Perceval valve will be assessed in terms of percentage incidence of mortality
      and morbidity at 12 months after implant.

      The effectiveness of the Perceval s valve will be assessed in terms of:

        -  Improvement of clinical status by mean of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
           class at 12 months after implant

        -  Haemodynamic performance through echocardiography parameters as mean gradient and peak
           gradient, effective orifice area (EOA), effective orifice area indexed (EOAI),
           performance index, cardiac output, cardiac index and degree of regurgitation at 12
           months after implant

      In order to determine mortality and morbidity, the following specific device related and
      procedure related adverse event categories will be assessed:

      - valvular thrombosis, thromboembolism, hemorrhage (whether or not related to anti coagulant/
      antiplatelet drug therapy) [all and major], paravalvular leak (all and major), endocarditis,
      hemolysis, structural valve deterioration, non structural dysfunction, reoperation (all and
      valve related), explant, death (all and valve related), device dislodgement and device
      migration

      In order to assess the Haemodynamic performance the following echocardiography parameters
      will be measured:

      - mean gradient and peak gradient, effective orifice area (EOA), effective orifice area
      indexed (EOAI), performance index, cardiac output, cardiac index and degree of regurgitation

      Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoints of the clinical investigation are:

        -  Assessment of mortality and morbidity rates at discharge (or 30 days if the patient is
           still hospitalized) and at 3-6 months after implant

        -  Evaluation of the effectiveness of Perceval S valve in terms of improvement of clinical
           status assessed by means of NYHA functional class at discharge (or 30 days if the
           patient is still hospitalized), 3-6 months after surgery

        -  Evaluation of the effectiveness of Perceval S valve in terms of haemodynamic performance
           through echocardiography at discharge (or 30 days if the patient is still hospitalized)
           and 3-6 months after surgery

        -  Mortality and morbidity as well as haemodynamic parameters will be assessed
