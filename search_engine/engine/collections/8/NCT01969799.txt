      fosfomycin inhalation system (AFIS). AFIS consists of amikacin solution and fosfomycin
      solution, delivered by aerosol to the lungs via the PARI Investigational eFlow Inline System
      (eFlow Inline System). All patients will receive a standardized course of intravenous (IV)
      antibiotics for a minimum of 7 days. Patients will be randomized to receive 10 days of
      treatment with either AFIS or placebo, in addition to the IV therapy. The primary efficacy
      endpoint is defined as the change from baseline in the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score
      (CPIS) during the randomized course of study drug. The study was designed to enroll up to 150
      patients with the desire to enroll at least 140 patients with gram negative pneumonia. The
      study was terminated at 143 when that goal was achieved
