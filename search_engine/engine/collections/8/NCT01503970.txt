      deteriotation of patients' quality of life. The management of focal chondral lesions
      continues to be problematic for the treating orthopaedic surgeon. Although many treatment
      options are currently available, none fulfill the criteria for an ideal repair solution: a
      hyaline repair tissue that completely fills the defect and integrates well with the
      surrounding normal cartilage. Autologous chondrocyte implantation is a relatively new
      cell-based treatment method for full-thickness cartilage injuries that in recent years has
      increased in popularity, with different studies showing promising results. Typically, this
      implantation is performed in an open-surgery fashion. In our study the implantation of
      in-house autologous chondrocyte culture is done arthroscopically, situation that may offer
      advantages in surgery associated morbidity and patient recovery.
