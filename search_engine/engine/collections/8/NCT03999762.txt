      ejaculate and output a purified sperm population in an IUI syringe in less than 15 minutes.
      The IUI syringe will be detachable from the rest of the system. During the 15 minutes, the
      clinician will not need to perform any actions; as the system will run all of the sample
      processing steps in an automated fashion. Furthermore, the system will have a footprint of a
      small desktop printer that is portable to be conveniently placed on a bench in clinical
      setting. A portable system that performs automated isolation of sperm from ejaculate will
      revolutionize sperm processing and increase access to sperm sample preparation. Additionally,
      the system will decrease cost, time and skill required to process sperm, and potentially
      improve outcomes for patients with low sperm counts. By increasing the yield and precision of
      sperm isolation and concentration techniques, the investigator's approach has the potential
      to offer this exact benefit by specifically providing the opportunity for some patients to
      try less invasive and less expensive procedures.
