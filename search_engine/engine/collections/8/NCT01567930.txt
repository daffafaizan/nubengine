      is often up-regulated in HCC promoting cell growth and survival. This process is inhibited by
      rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR. Temsirolimus, a rapamycin analog, may delay tumor
      progression by inhibiting mTOR in HCC.Intervention: Temsirolimus IV

      Eligible patients will receive temsirolimus IV on days 1,8,15 every 21 days. Treatment will
      continue till disease progression or untolerable side effects
