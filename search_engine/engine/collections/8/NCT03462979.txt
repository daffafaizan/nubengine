      Gluten may cause a wide range of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. Thus, there is not always a
      'feedback loop' to alert to accidental gluten exposure. Nevertheless, these "silent" gluten
      exposures may interfere with recovery and healing of the intestine. New tools are available
      to test for fragments of gluten - Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIPs) in urine and stool.

      The goal of this research study is to evaluate how knowledge of gluten-immunogenic peptide
      (GIP) levels in urine and stool affects subsequent adherence to a gluten-free diet.
      Participants will be children with celiac disease recruited at Boston Children's Hospital.
      All participants will undergo a diet assessment by a dietitian at the beginning and end of
      the study. At random intervals, participants will be prompted to collect their next urine
      sample and complete a survey related to symptoms and diet adherence. Half of the participants
      will store the sample to be tested later and the rest of the participants will be provided
      with devices to test their urine at home to receive immediate results. Participants in the
      home testing group will also be given a set of stool tests (x4) to use at their own
      discretion during the study period, and will report results and reasons for test use to the
      research team. GIP test results will be compared to other measures of celiac disease and
      gluten-free diet adherence, including antibody tests. These findings will help to determine
      how these new tools can be used to improve gluten-free diet adherence and symptoms and the
      effect on quality of life.
