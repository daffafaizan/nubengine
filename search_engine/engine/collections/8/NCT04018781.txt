      technician, nurses...) and constitutes an investment for healthcare institutions. However,
      the resulting improvement in patients' health status (and the potential reduction in ADEs)
      could reduce their care consumption and thus reduce costs from a healthcare system
      perspective. We therefore propose to assess the cost-effectiveness of this care strategy.

      Finally, we will study the impact of the MR deployment on existing professional
      organizations, both in hospital and between community healthcare professionals and hospital
      as well as its conditions of implementation.
