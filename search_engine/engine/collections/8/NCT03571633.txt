      weeks), except in case of Inacceptable toxicity, or Patient decision, or Withdrawal of
      consent, or Clinical/radiological signs of disease progression.This neoadjuvant treatment
      period will be ended with a short term safety visit (STSVNeo) to be scheduled 28 days after
      the last dose of study treatments (considering the latest study treatments administered).
      Following the STSVNeo, patients will undergo surgery as per usual practice and pathological
      response will be centrally assessed by a referent pathologist blinded for the treatment
      arms.Following surgery, all patients will be treated in the adjuvant setting with trastuzumab
      administered every 3 weeks for up to 12 months in both arms with clinical assessments every 3
      months (cf. Réseau régional de Cancérologie,
      http://espacecancer.sante-ra.fr/Pages/Accueil.aspx). In case of RH+ disease, endocrine
      therapy may be initiated as per standard treatment guidelines.This adjuvant treatment period
      is planned for a maximum of 12 months; except in case of Inacceptable toxicity, or Patient
      decision, or Withdrawal of consent, or Clinical/radiological signs of disease progression.
      All randomized and treated patients will be followed-up for relapse and survival for at least
      15 months post-randomization (i.e. 1 year post-surgery).

      A total of 90 patients will be randomized in the study. (45 per arm). All the data concerning
      the patients will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) throughout the study
      serious adverse event (SAE) reporting will be also paper-based by e-mail and/or Fax. The
      sponsor will perform the study monitoring and will help the investigators to conduct the
      study in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and local
      law requirements
