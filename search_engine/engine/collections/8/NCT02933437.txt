      family history of sudden death or premature arrhythmogenic cardiac disease. Participants will
      undergo electrocardiographic phenotype assessment with standard and high lead
      electrocardiogram and sodium channel provocation. Detailed cardiac structural examination
      will be performed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to look for any variation in mainly
      right ventricular outflow tract structure and myocardial architecture. Participants will also
      undergo targeted genomic sequencing to look for variations in genes encoding for cardiac
      sodium channel.
