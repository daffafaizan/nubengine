    
      This is an open-label study (identity of assigned study drug will be known) to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate in patients with prostate cancer. The study will be
      conducted in 4 stages: Stage 1 will measure blood levels after patients take 1 daily dose of
      abiraterone tablet or capsule formulations with and without food; Stage 2 will measure blood
      levels of single daily doses of abiraterone tablet formulation taken with or without food in
      parallel design until disease progression (up to 12 cycles [28 days per cycle]); Stages 3 and
      4 will evaluate the safety and antitumor effects of abiraterone tablet formulation
      administered with a low dose glucocorticoid in a fasted state for up to 12 months for each
      stage. As of Protocol Amendment 4, all patients who have completed 12 cycles of abiraterone
      acetate treatment and continue to receive clinical benefit from such a treatment will enter
      Stage 4 and receive abiraterone acetate in a fasted condition with a low-dose glucocorticoid.
      Patients will continue in Stage 4 for an additional 24 cycles. After patients complete the
      last study visit, they will be followed every 3 months for disease progression and survival
      for up to 3 years. Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected during Stages 1 and 2.
      Efficacy and safety will be monitored throughout the study.
