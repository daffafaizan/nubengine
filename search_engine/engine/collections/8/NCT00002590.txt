    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the toxicity and feasibility of intensifying the New York I (NYI)
      regimen by adding etoposide and cytarabine, increasing the dose of methotrexate, using
      pegaspargase, and compressing the treatment duration (11 months) in previously untreated
      children with disseminated anaplastic (Ki-1 positive) large cell and large cell T-cell
      lymphoma. II. Provide preliminary data for a future phase III study that will compare this
      intensified regimen with the high-risk ALL regimen NYI in children with disseminated
      lymphoblastic lymphoma. III. Continue to investigate the immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and
      molecular biology of lymphoblastic lymphoma and their relationship to leukemia. IV. Obtain
      preliminary data on treatment of anaplastic large cell (Ki-1) and T-cell large cell lymphoma
      treated with intensive NYI.

      OUTLINE: Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis receive craniospinal irradiation on Regimen A
      at the conclusion of Maintenance chemotherapy. The following acronyms are used: ARA-C
      Cytarabine, NSC-63878 CF Leucovorin calcium, NSC-3590 CTX Cyclophosphamide, NSC-26271 DNR
      Daunorubicin, NSC-82151 DOX Doxorubicin, NSC-123127 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating
      Factor (Amgen), NSC-614629 MTX Methotrexate, NSC-740 PEG-ASP Pegaspargase, NSC-624239 PRED
      Prednisone, NSC-10023 TG Thioguanine, NSC-752 VCR Vincristine, NSC-67574 VP-16 Etoposide,
      NSC-141540 Induction: 5-Drug Combination Systemic Chemotherapy with Hematopoietic Stimulation
      plus 2-Drug Combination Intrathecal Chemotherapy. VCR/PRED/CTX/DNR/PEG-ASP; with G-CSF; plus
      IT ARA-C/IT MTX. Consolidation: 7-Drug Combination Systemic Chemotherapy with Hematopoietic
      Stimulation plus Single-Agent Intrathecal Chemotherapy.
      VCR/PRED/PEG-ASP/VP-16/TG/ARA-C/MTX/CF; with G-CSF; plus IT MTX. Maintenance: Sequential
      Pulses of 2-, 3-, 3-, and 2-Drug Systemic Chemotherapy Combinations plus Single-Agent
      Intrathecal Chemotherapy. CTX/TG/IT MTX; VCR/PRED/DOX; VCR/MTX/CF/PEG-ASP; ARA-C/VP-16.
      Regimen A: Radiotherapy. Craniospinal irradiation using megavoltage equipment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 40 patients will be entered over approximately 10 months. If 4 or more
      toxic deaths occur in the first 15 patients or 5 or more toxic deaths occur in the first 30
      patients, accrual will stop. As of 05/96, asparaginase has been replaced with pegaspargase;
      15-25 additional patients will be accrued. As of 01/97, a maximum of 35 patients will be
      accrued for PEG asparaginase-containing treatment regimen. As of 5/97, this study is open
      only to patients with anaplastic large cell and T cell large cell lymphoma. Approximately
      60-90 patients will be accrued.
