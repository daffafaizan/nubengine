    
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder affecting up to 1/50
      in the world and 1% in Taiwan. ASD is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous complex
      disorder with high heritability. Due to its high prevalence, lifetime impairment and no
      effective prevention and treatment, ASD has been prioritized for molecular genetic study.
      Among the genetic findings based on our copy number variation (CNV) analysis of 335 patients
      with ASD, HDAC4 gene is selected to help us understand the pathogenesis of ASD by
      investigating parent-of-origin and the gene and protein expression of this gene, alongside
      neurocognitive and behavioral phenotypes.

      Based on our findings on HDAC4 CNV analysis, the patients with HDAC4 CNVs (~30 patients) and
      their families will be invited to participate the investigation of the CNV, RNA and protein
      expression analysis. Five healthy controls without any diagnosis of psychiatric disorders
      will be recruited to perform the comparison with ASD patients with HDSC4. The autistic
      symptoms and behavioral phenotypes assessed by the Chinese SCQ and SRS, and the cognitive
      function assessed by intelligence test and WCST will be used to reveal the associations among
      the CNVs, RNA expression, protein level and clinical/cognitive phenotypes.

      According to our previous CNV findings at the HDAC4 locus, we expect to find CNV in HDAC4
      variation in another independent sample of our ASD cohort and to explore how HDAC4 CNVs
      affect the RNA and protein expression of HDAC4. We anticipate our endeavors will provide the
      comprehensive profiles of the CNV, RNA and protein expressions and the clinical features of
      ASD patients with HDAC4 CNVs and contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of ASD.
