      motor recovery, function,quality of life, compliance, safety and cost, of a novel,
      patient-centered home-based tailored TR program using an affordable virtual reality system
      for upper-limb rehabilitation post-stroke. Such a system, combined with remote off-line
      monitoring could allow patients to take charge and pursue their rehabilitation beyond current
      services, maximizing their potential for recovery.

      A single-blind two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) is proposed for this study with
      participants who have had a stroke randomly allocated to: (1) 4-week training with home-based
      tele-rehabilitation (TR) system (see intervention below).i.e. treatment group or (2) 4-week
      written home exercise program provided by a clinician, i.e. exercise control group.
