      (wheat protein) has been suggested as a cause for cerebellar ataxia even in the absence of
      malabsorption symptoms or intestinal pathology. However, the prevalence of gluten sensitivity
      in patients presenting with cerebellar ataxia is unknown and the effect of gluten-free diet
      on gluten sensitivity-associated cerebellar ataxia has not been systematically studied. The
      aim of this project is: 1) To identify gluten sensitive cerebellar ataxia patients attending
      the Human Motor Control Clinic at the NIH using tests for celiac disease antibodies as a
      screening method. 2) To conduct open-label controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy
      of gluten-free diet in the patients identified using a detailed cerebellar ataxia scale as an
      objective clinical measure.
