      insights for currently ongoing clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nuvastatic™
      could be used as potential anti-coronavirus therapy that acts on the human immune system or
      human cells as an immune modulator, and the other on coronavirus itself as an antiviral
      agent. In terms of the human immune system, the innate immune system response plays an
      important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus, and interferon
      gamma, interleukins, Th cells, granulocyte macrophage are expected to enhance the immune
      response.
