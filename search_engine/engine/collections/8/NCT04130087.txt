      symptoms of depression such as anhedonia (loss of interest and response to pleasurable
      activities). Studies in animals have suggested that the neurotransmitter, dopamine, plays a
      key role in reward processing. This has given rise to the suggestion that in depression,
      decrements in dopamine activity lead to impaired reward processing which cause symptoms such
      as anhedonia and low motivation.

      Research in humans into dopamine and reward is limited by suitable pharmacological means to
      manipulate dopamine activity safely and effectively.

      To our knowledge, no previous research has studied the effects of acute administration of the
      licensed drug, selegiline, on reward and emotional processing. However, a single dose of
      selegiline effectively inhibits monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), which should lead to increased
      dopamine availability in the CNS. Therefore, selegiline may be a useful tool to explore the
      effect of modifying dopamine availability on reward processing. Acquiring such knowledge
      through this study could assist in the clinical use of MAO-B inhibition as a target to
      ameliorate symptoms such as anhedonia as well as increasing our general understanding of
      reward processing in healthy individuals.

      The aim of this study is to explore the effects of acute administration of a standard (10mg)
      dose of selegiline on reward and emotional processing versus a placebo, in healthy
      volunteers. At this dose selegiline only has an -MAO-B function therefore the specific impact
      of MAO-B blockade on reward and emotional processing can be explored.

      Research Question: What effect will the administration of a single dose of selegiline have on
      reward and emotional processing in healthy volunteers?
