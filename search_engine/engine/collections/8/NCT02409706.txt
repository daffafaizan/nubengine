    
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common birth defects in the UK. Children
      with CHD are at risk of underfeeding and undernutrition. This is due to both the increased
      nutritional requirements of the disease and sometimes clinical management, which often
      hinders delivery of optimal nutrition.There are as yet no studies assessing micronutrient
      body stores in children with CHD or whether micronutrient deficiencies predict poor clinical
      outcomes, such as post-operative complications, after major cardiac operations.

      This study aims to explore the frequency, types and associations of micronutrient
      deficiencies in children with CHD using standard and novel markers in blood. The study will
      also explore whether micronutrient deficiencies increase the risk of complications after
      heart surgery. This study will identify any nutrient deficiencies that need monitoring in
      clinical practice.
