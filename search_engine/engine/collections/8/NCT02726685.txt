      Stroke is also the third largest cause of death in Taiwan in 2014. Stroke patients in the
      course of exercise are in addition to muscle weakness and reduced endurance, but usually also
      accompanied by respiratory damage. From past studies have shown that stroke patients whose
      respiratory function has significant change, such as decreased respiratory muscle strength,
      reduced respiratory movement of the affected hemithorax, declined in maximum breathing
      pressure and decreased amplitude of diaphragmatic movements on the paralyzed side. But
      whether respiratory training can improve respiratory and functional performance of stroke
      patients, because of the limited research results could not be confirmed.
