      the acute care setting to more closely tailor antibiotic use to disease risk for Acute Otitis
      Media (AOM) in children.

      The Investigator will conduct a single-center cluster randomized control trial comparing the
      efficacy, safety and patient-centered outcomes of the shared decision-making decision aid
      'Acute Otitis Media Choice' to usual care among children diagnosed with acute otitis media in
      the ED for whom antibiotics are being considered to engage parents in shared decision-making.
