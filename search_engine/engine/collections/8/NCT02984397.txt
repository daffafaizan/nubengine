      will be a randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study, designed to assess the
      potential efficacy of KF for the treatment of pain and associated symptoms in adolescent with
      CWP. The third arm will consists of assessing standard of care (SOC) data from patients who
      do not wish to participate in the study, but agree to allow us to use their SOC data to be
      compared with that of patients participating in the study. This arm will help to evaluate the
      potential beneficial effect of being part of the study ("placebo" effect) receiving a new
      treatment for a condition where the SOC have limited success rate.
