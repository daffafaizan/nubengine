    
      This is a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, treatment control trial with cross-over
      options performed at four sites. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and
      safety of cryoablation therapy for the treatment of post mastectomy pain syndrome.

      Participants will be randomized to receive cryoablation or a therapeutic peripheral nerve
      block injection (tPNB). All participants will be evaluated at baseline and after treatment at
      10 days, 90 days, and 180 days via clinical visits.

      The option to undergo cryoablation or tPNB will be offered to all participants at the end of
      the 90 day post-procedure assessment. Each subject that elects the crossover intervention
      will be assessed over the same time period and in an identical fashion to the initial
      intervention, including a final long term follow up (LTFU) assessment at 180 days
      post-cryoablation.
