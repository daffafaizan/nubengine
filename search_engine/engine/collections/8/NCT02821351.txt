      Study Design/Planned Number of Subjects/Number of Centers This study is a prospective, single
      center, single arm study. A maximum of 75 subjects will be enrolled in the study to include a
      maximum of 5 roll-in subjects in one investigational center in the Czech Republic.

      Primary Endpoints The primary endpoint events for this trial as follows are to assess the
      safety and performance effectiveness of the DiamondTemp System for the treatment of drug
      refractory, recurrent, symptomatic PAF.

        -  Primary Safety Endpoint: The safety of the DiamondTemp System will be assessed by
           evaluating the nature and frequency of serious adverse events (SAE) and serious adverse
           device effects (SADE) during the time of the ablation procedure and within 7 days
           afterwards.

        -  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint: The effectiveness of the DiamondTemp System will be
           evaluated post-ablation with demonstration of acute procedural success defined as
           isolation of clinically relevant pulmonary veins by demonstration of block or isolation
           of signals confirmed after delivery of the ablation treatment. Depending on EP lab
           protocol, one method will be chosen.

      Secondary Endpoints

      The following secondary endpoint will be evaluated to support the results of the primary
      endpoints:

      • Secondary Safety Endpoint: The chronic safety of the DiamondTemp System will be assessed by
      evaluating the nature and frequency of adverse events (AE) and adverse device effects (ADE)
      at 30 days, 90 days, 6 months and 12 months post-procedure.

      Study Duration The duration of the study is expected to last approximately 18 months from the
      first enrollment to final report for assessment of endpoints. An additional 12 months to the
      study closeout after the last follow-up.

      Key Inclusion Criteria

        -  Suitable candidate for intra-cardiac mapping for arrhythmias

        -  History of recurrent symptomatic PAF WITH ≥2 episodes reported within the 365 days (12)
           months prior to enrollment

        -  At least 1 episode of atrial fibrillation (AF) documented by Holter monitor, rhythm
           strip, trans-telephonic monitor (TTM), or 12-lead ECG prior to enrollment

        -  Refractory to at least one Class I-IV anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD)

        -  Eighteen (18) years of age or above

        -  Competent and willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study
           and agree to comply with the follow-up visits and evaluation

      Key Exclusion Criteria

        -  Previous ablation procedure in the left atrium

        -  Intracardiac thrombus, tumor or other abnormality that precludes catheter introduction
           and placement

        -  Known severe cerebrovascular disease or history of cerebrovascular event (within 1
           month)

        -  Cardiac surgery within the past two months.

        -  Short life expectancy (< 1 yr.) due to other illnesses, such as cancer or pulmonary,
           hepatic, or renal disease

        -  Unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction within the past three months

        -  Heart valve replacement

        -  Mitral clip (Evalve)

        -  Unable or unwilling to take anti-coagulants

      Ablation Procedure The ablation procedure will consist of documentation of pre-ablation
      pulmonary vein (PV) potentials, conducting PV isolation using the DiamondTemp System,
      providing documentation of PV entrance block. Investigator can opt to perform other ablations
      if any non- PV foci are involved in atrial arrhythmia.

      Follow-up Schedule

        -  Screening visit any time during six (6) months before ablation procedure

        -  Ablation Procedure (Day 0, all follow-ups post ablation are based on this date)

        -  Discharge (5-72 hours)

        -  7-Day Phone Check (7 + 3 days)

        -  1-Month Follow-up (30 + 5 days)

        -  Repeat Mapping Procedure

        -  Repeat Ablation Procedure, if necessary

        -  3-Month Follow-up (90 + 10 days)

        -  6-Month Follow-up (180 + 30 days)

        -  12-Month Follow-up (365 + 30 days)

        -  Additional Follow-up visits (as determined necessary)

      The study will be considered complete for the purpose of reporting results with regards to
      the primary endpoints after all subjects have completed the 7-Day follow-up. A final study
      closeout report will be created after the last 12-month follow-up visit.
