      hand. Task oriented training has been suggested as a contemporary neurorehabilitation
      technique. A single-subject AB series design with a follow-up was conducted to assess the
      effectiveness of a task oriented training program administered in participants' homes. This
      intervention, Task Oriented Training at Home (TOTE Home), incorporated current
      experience-dependent plasticity aspects modeled after the Acquired Skill Acquisition Program
      (ASAP) protocol parameters and principles of task oriented training as suggested by Lang and
      Birkenmeier in 2014. Repeated measures of accelerometry and level of confidence on a priority
      task were analyzed with visual analysis of changes in level, trend, and slope. Change scores
      from standardized assessments for the upper extremity, Motor Activity Log, Stroke Impact
      Scale question of recovery, Functional Test for the Hemiparetic Upper Extremity, and Canadian
      Occupational Performance Measure were evaluated on data collected at baseline,
      post-intervention, and follow-up time periods.
