        1. To determine the longitudinal relationships between circulating markers, such as
           Neuregulin (NRG)-1Beta levels and incident risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in
           patients exposed to anthracycline, trastuzumab, or a combination of the two agents. We
           hypothesize that a sustained increase in NRG-1Beta, indicative of enhanced cardiac
           stress with exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, is predictive of an increased risk of
           cardiac dysfunction and heart failure.

        2. To study the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/haplotype variation in pathways of
           interest, such as the Neuregulin/Epidermal Growth Factor (ErbB) signaling pathway, on
           incident risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We hypothesize that there will be
           SNP/haplotypes variations that are associated with incident cardiovascular outcomes.

        3. To determine the longitudinal relationships between novel echocardiographic measures,
           such as strain and strain rate and incident cardiac dysfunction in patients exposed to
           anthracycline, trastuzumab, or a combination of the two agents. We hypothesize that
           early declines in strain and strain rate are predictive of an increased risk of future
           cardiac dysfunction and heart failure.

        4. To explore the changes in biomarkers such as NRG-1Beta levels and the relationships with
           novel echocardiographic measures of cardiac function.

        5. To create a biobank as a future resource for additional questions in novel biomarkers
           and genetics.

        6. To determine the long-term effects of cancer therapy cardiotoxicity by following
           patients yearly for 5 years after their exposure to cancer therapy, with the option to
           extend up to an additional 5 years.
