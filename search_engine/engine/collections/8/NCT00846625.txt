      in this patient population. Since it is common clinical practice to perform regional
      periocular injections of steroids in patients with uveitic macular edema, only patients who
      are refractory to periocular steroids will be enrolled in the study. The 0.5 mg dose of
      ranibizumab will be given intravitreally since this dose and route has been found to be safe
      and efficacious in prior studies. A dosing regimen has not been established for ranibizumab
      in patients with uveitis, so patients will be assessed and treated monthly as needed.
      Triamcinolone 4mg intravitreal injection will be the steroid treatment, and patients will
      also be assessed monthly and retreated every three months as needed.
