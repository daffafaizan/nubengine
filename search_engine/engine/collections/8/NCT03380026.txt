      approved by the FDA in 2013 for the treatment of IA and IB Mycosis Fungoides. The most common
      side effect of Valchlor is a skin rash, which is routinely ameliorated with the application
      of topical corticosteroids, such as topical Triamcinolone. The main purpose of this study is
      to determine the efficacy of Triamcinolone in reducing side effects cause by Valchlor and
      further understand the nature of this skin rash.

      This is a split-face study, meaning that subjects will receive both therapies, but limit use
      to designated areas. Treatment lasts 4 months with follow ups at 5 and 12 months.
