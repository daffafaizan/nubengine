      biopsy in interstitial lung disease patients, but there is still no evidence as to its
      superiority in terms of outcome.

      However, there is extensive literature about the effect of anesthetic drugs and surgery on
      diaphragmatic function. Furthermore, in thoracic surgery, diaphragmatic dysfunction was
      associated with a higher occurrence of postoperative pulmonary complications.

      To assess the impact of general anesthesia on diaphragmatic function, the investigators
      conducted an observational prospective trial. The investigators measured both diaphragmatic
      excursion and Thickening Fraction at baseline and 12 hours after surgery together with
      pulmonary function tests and gas exchange data.

      The investigators divided our population into two groups: one group of patients undergoing
      awake thoracic surgery with epidural anesthesia, and the other group undergoing general
      anesthesia.

      Forty-one patients were recruited and the Thickening Fraction percentage, calculated as (End
      Inspiratory thickness-End Expiratory thickness)/End Expiratory thickness, was evaluated by
      means of an ultrasound-assisted method, using a high frequency (10 MHz) linear probe.
