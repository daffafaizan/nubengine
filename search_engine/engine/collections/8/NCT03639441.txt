      conducted by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the prevalence of osteoarthritis of the knee
      in Taiwan is about 3.5 million people, accounting for about 15% of the total population. Its
      effects are a heavy burden on socio-economic costs, and in addition to being included in
      medical expenses, serious cases can lead to incapacity to work; therefore, the disease is an
      important factor in causing disability and disability First, it is worth our attention.

      The investigator performed dry needle (DN) treatments with acupuncture needles. Stimulating
      the effected muscle, the investigator move the needle forward and backward several times.
      Muscle twitch may occur by our procedure. The pain caused by myofascial trigger points can be
      decreased effective simultaneously. So far, there is no solid research or clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of the treatment yet.

      For the reasons of the degenerative arthritis pain, the clinical observation is not entirely
      due to the cause of joint deformity or cartilage damage, soft tissue lesions around the knee
      is also a common source of pain, the use of dry needle for the diagnosis of soft tissue
      injury , And observed its efficacy, which is also the core of this study.

      This experiment used a randomized single-blind experiment to assess the immediate, short-term
      and long-term effects of dry needle therapy on patellar pain in patients with degenerative
      arthritis. The assessment tools included the VAS, WOMAC , Lequesnes index, Gait speed test
      and the Muscle Tension Changes in the Lower Extremities.
