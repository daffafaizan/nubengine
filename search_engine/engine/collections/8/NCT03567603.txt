    
      This is a single center prospective study of neonates >36 weeks' gestation prenatally exposed
      to psychoactive substances and gestationally age-matched controls. Evoked response potentials
      on EEG in response to auditory oddball paradigms will be compared between cohorts. Analyses
      will try to identify differences in auditory processing using ANOVAs to compare the mismatch
      negativity measures, amplitudes and latencies as a function of study group.
