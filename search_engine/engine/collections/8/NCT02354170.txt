    
      -  Prospective, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study

        -  Eligible patients will be those with CSC, with symptoms of blurred or distorted vision,
           with the presence of sub-retinal fluid as documented on optical coherence tomography
           (OCT) in the central foveal sub-field

        -  Only one eye of a participant will be included in the study, although both eyes will be
           evaluated. In patients with bilateral CSC, the eye with more sub-foveal fluid on OCT
           will be the study eye.

        -  Patients will be evaluated and treated at one of two study centers:

      Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston (OCB), 50 Staniford St., Suite 600, Boston, MA

      Bay Area Retina Associates (BARA), 122 La Casa Via, Suite 223, Walnut Creek, CA

        -  All participants will receive a standard ophthalmic examination as well as fluorescein
           and indocyanine green angiography and macular OCT per protocol.

        -  30 patients will be enrolled, as follows:

           10 patients will be randomly assigned to Cohort 1, and will take one (1) mifepristone
           300-mg tablet (300 mg total dose) once daily by mouth for 4 weeks.

           10 patients will be randomly assigned to Cohort 2, and will take three (3) mifepristone
           300-mg tablet (900 mg total dose) once daily by mouth for 4 weeks.

           10 patients will be randomly assigned to Cohort 3, and will take placebo tablet(s) once
           daily by mouth for 4 weeks.

        -  After completing the enrollment criteria, a subject will be randomized 1:1:1 to Cohort
           1, 2, or 3.

        -  During the Baseline visit and at the Week 2, 4, and 8 visits, all subjects will have
           laboratory testing of the following lab tests: serum electrolytes, BUN and creatinine,
           liver function tests

        -  Prior to initiating dosing of the study drug, all women of child-bearing potential
           (WOCBP) will have a serum beta-HCG assessed to rule out pregnancy; all WOCBP who are
           enrolled in the study will be required to use barrier contraception throughout the
           study.

        -  Adverse events will be tracked at each visit (see "Data Safety and Monitoring Plan"
           below)
