      I. Determine whether one dose of auranofin given the day following administration of
      paclitaxel decreases pain as assessed by daily completion of the Modified Brief Pain
      Inventory scale for seven days.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess whether auranofin is well tolerated in this setting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) on day 2.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on day 2.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 21-28 days.
