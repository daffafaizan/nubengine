      frequent cause of death of cancer. However, the management strategies for intermediate-stage
      HCC remain controversial without global consensus. On one hand, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
      (BCLC) staging system recommends liver resection (LR) for very early and early-stage HCC, and
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for intermediate-stage HCC. On the other hand,
      observational studies in both Eastern and Western countries have emerged to suggest that LR
      was safe and achieved better survival than TACE for patients with intermediate-stage HCC, but
      only very few studies have been conducted to directly compare LR with TACE for these
      patients.

      In light of this, the investigators have conducted a multistate Markov model simulating a
      randomized clinical trial comparing LR with TACE over a follow-up period of 15 years. The
      results suggested that LR may provide survival benefit over TACE for the treatment of
      intermediate-stage HCC in cirrhotic patients. However, validating the simulated result by a
      study with higher quality (e.g. prospective clinical trial) would be of great value in
      providing a more convincing finding.Therefore, based on the established Markov model,the
      investigators aimed to prospectively compare the treatment efficacy and safety of LR with
      TACE for consecutive patients with intermediate-stage HCC.
