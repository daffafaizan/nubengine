      inherited eye diseases. Progress in research on inherited eye disease would be augmented by
      the availability of patient DNA coupled to robust, anonymous phenotypic information. The
      National Ophthalmic Genotyping and Phenotyping Network (eyeGENE(R)) has been created to
      answer this need. By creating a national DNA and blood repository for inherited eye disease.
      These samples have been gathered from clinical centers around the nation and will be coupled
      to anonymous, phenotypic descriptors. If requested, a portion of the sample submitted by a
      clinician can be used for appropriate, CLIA-certified molecular diagnostics that can be used
      in patient care. Once a sufficient repository is created, researchers will be able to request
      aliquots for their laboratory experiments. Participants will be provided the option to be
      re-contacted if an approved clinical study for which they might qualify is offered.
      Researchers can request aliquots for their laboratory experiments or ask the eyeGENE(R)
      Coordinating Center to re-contact participants to inform them about the possibility to
      participate in a clinical study.
