      age-appropriate, culturally relevant approach to teaching about sexuality and relationships
      by providing scientifically accurate, realistic, non-judgmental information and CSE improves
      sexual and reproductive health outcomes of young people by delaying sexual debut, promoting
      condom use and increasing sexual health knowledge, however, most of these outcomes have been
      reported in older adolescents and there is limited evidence for effectiveness of CSE among
      young adolescents

      The study aims at improving adolescent sexual and reproductive health of young adolescents
      through CSE that is led by interdisciplinary university students' team in an environment
      where no consistent or regulated sexual and reproductive health education program currently
      exists
