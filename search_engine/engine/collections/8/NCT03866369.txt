    
      All subject will receive first a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin, under open-label fasting
      conditions at Day -8 (assay sensitivity).

      Following, all subjects also will receive a dose of placebo under open-label fasting
      conditions at D-1.

      In the morning of Day 1, subjects will be randomized to either the investigational medicinal
      product (IMP) or placebo (3:1). The treatment phase last 14 days and the end of study visit
      will occurs within 5 to 9 days after the last dose of IMP or placebo (or at early
      termination)

      A staggered dose approach will be applied within each subjects cohort with 48 hours of delay
      between subcohorts.

      A sefty review committe (SRC) will review after each cohorts all available safety and PK data
      under blinded conditions and conclude the safety and tolerability of the dose level before
      proceeding to the next dose level.
