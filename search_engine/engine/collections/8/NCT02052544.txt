      with continuous unfractionated heparin infusions. Blood samples collections (4 ml) are
      required routinely. A proportion of this standard sample (leftover plasma) will be used for
      study purposes. About three samples will be analyzed which are collected within 2 - 4 days.
      Time points for blood sample collections will be defined by the treating physician according
      the local standard of care and will be associated exclusively to clinical considerations.
      Results of the Pefakit® PiCT® UC assay will NOT be used to take therapeutic decisions for
      study subjects.
