      20 % versus 5.0 % in proportions of obstetrical and neonatal problems between (equal numbers
      of) primi- and multiparous mothers to be statistically confirmed with 80 % power and 95 %
      probability.

      Descriptive parametric data is reported as mean Â± standard deviation (SD), and descriptive
      non-parametric data as median with interquartile range (IQR). Proportions are reported in
      percent with 95 % confidence interval (CI).

      Parametric data was compared with two-tailed unpaired student's t-test, and non-parametric
      data with the Mann-Whitney U-test. Proportions were analyzed with two-tailed Fisher's exact
      test.

      Probability (P) values at < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
