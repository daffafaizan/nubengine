      other. If patients are randomized to the medication arm, after 6 months they have the option
      of going into the stimulation arm. There is a 3 week trial which includes a crossover period
      from "no stimulation" to subthreshold stimulation. The 3rd week patients will receive
      "optimal" stimulation. If they qualify, they will be implanted with the permanent device.
