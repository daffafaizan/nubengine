      Primary

        -  Determine progression-free survival in patients with mantle cell lymphoma undergoing
           low-intensity allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity by way of adverse event profile of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Reduced intensity conditioning: Patients receive carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -6,
           etoposide IV over 1 hour and cytarabine IV over 15 minutes on days -5 to -2, alemtuzumab
           IV over 2 hours on days -5 to -1, and melphalan IV on day -1.

        -  Donor stem cell transplant: Patients undergo stem cell transplantation on day 0 with
           filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow stem cells.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally
           on day -1 to 30 and taper to day 100.

        -  Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) therapy: Patients with evidence of disease progression,
           mixed chimerism, or low level residual disease undergo DLI every 3 months for up to 15
           months in the absence of GVHD.

      After completion of study, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
