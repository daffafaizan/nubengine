      over decades. Obesity, a crucial risk factors for developing T2DM, commonly exists with
      insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function. Early management in individuals at high
      risk of T2DM should be therefore considered for preventing or delaying the progression of
      diabetes and diabetic complications.

      Since 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), the major antihyperglycemic compound of mulberry leaves,
      inhibits alpha-glucosidase activities, ingestion of mulberry leaves results in the
      suppression of postprandial hyperglycemia. Long-term effects of mulberry leaves on glycemic
      profiles have been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies; however, the results were
      controversial. In addition, no study was conducted in patients with obesity. As a result,
      this open-label, randomized controlled study aims to investigate efficacy and safety of
      mulberry leaves in combination with lifestyle intervention (diet control) on glycemic control
      in non-diabetic patients with obesity and patients with early-stage T2DM. Efficacy of the
      interventions will be assessed based on the changes in glycemic indexes, expression of
      proteins related to insulin resistance and T2DM, and lipid profiles. Meanwhile, safety will
      be measured by the changes in renal and hepatic enzymes and patient-self reports. The
      outcomes will be monitored at 4-week interval throughout 12 weeks of the study period.
