      radiotherapy with the Oraya IRay system for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization
      (CNV) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), as measured by incidence and
      severity of ocular radiation related serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events (AE) in
      subjects treated with an 11, 16 or 24 Gray (Gy) macular dose through the 60-month follow-up
