      common and has been reported to occur in between 10-39% of patients. It has been shown to
      increase majority morbidity and also delay hospital discharge. Recent studies suggest that
      one week of pre-operative atorvastatin may reduce the incidence of post-operative atrial
      arrhythmia in patients who undergo cardiac surgery and a multi-institutional study is
      currently underway to further examine this concept. However, there are no published
      prospective randomized studies to date that have evaluated the effectiveness of atorvastatin
      to reduce atrial arrhythmia in patients who undergo thoracic, non-cardiac operations such as
      esophagectomy or pulmonary resection. The object of this study is to determine if
      atorvastatin reduces the incidence of atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation or flutter)
      following non-cardiac thoracic surgery, specifically pulmonary resections.
