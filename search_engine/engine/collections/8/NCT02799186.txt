    
      The recruitment of patients takes place in each interventional cardiology department.

      The patients can be included in a retrospective way (for SCAD occurred from 2010) or
      forward-looking way. The patients are informed about this study by the investigator. After a
      reflection period and an answer to the possible questions, the patient is included. The
      informed consent is signed.

      Every patient included with a SCAD or hematoma, will systematic benefit a tomographic or MRI
      angiography of renal, cerebrovascular and iliac arteries, to look for the presence of a
      fibromuscular displasia. A blood sample will be collected for the genetic analysis which will
      be realized by the Team 3 of the INSERM UMR970, Paris Cardiovascular research Center, France.
