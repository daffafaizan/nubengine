      number sequence, patients were enrolled in one of two groups: Group T receiving 5 µg of
      dexmedetomidine (Precedex® 100 µg/mL, Hospira, Inc., IL, U.S.A.) combined with 12.5 mg of
      0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (Marcaine® Spinal Heavy; Astra, Sodertalje, Sweden) and Group V
      receiving the same bupivacaine DOSE AND 0.75 microgram/kilogram of body weight
      dexmedetomidine intravenously. Dexmedetomidine 100 µg/mL was mixed with preservative-free
      normal saline to 10 µg/mL. The 0.5 mL of dilute dexmedetomidine was added to the bupivacaine
      in group T. An independent investigator prepared the drug solutions and provided the coded
      drug to the anaesthetic administrator before the start of the anaesthesia. The anaesthetic
      administrator, patients, outcome assessors, and data analysts were blinded to the allocation.
      Spinal Anesthesia Patients were hydrated with 500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution before
      anaesthesia. The spinal puncture was performed at L3-4 or L4-5 with a midline approach using
      a 25 G Quincke needle in the lateral decubitus position. After confirmation of free flow and
      clear cerebrospinal fluid, the drug was administered and the patients were then placed in the
      supine neutral position.

      Assessment: The primary end-point of this study was the first request to analgesia. The
      secondary end-points were the total postoperative analgesic consumption as well as the VAS.
