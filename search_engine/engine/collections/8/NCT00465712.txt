      second external cephalic version after initial failure. In case of success it could be an
      alternative to cesarian section. Without any other technique the foetus is in cephalic
      presentation after a first external cephalic version in 50%.

      Patients with a single fetus, at term, in breech presentation are proposed to participate.
      The randomization is done at the inclusion and determines whether the patient is included in
      the group with amnioinfusion before second cephalic version or usual second cephalic version
      only. The only difference between the two groups is the realisation of an amnioinfusion, the
      cephalic version's technique is the same.

      Efficacy's evaluation is based on rate of cephalic presentation at birth. Success rate of
      cephalic version, rates of cesarian section, maternal and fetal morbidity in the two groups,
      time between second cephalic version and birth will be studied.
