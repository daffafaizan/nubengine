      phase followed by an immunological phase whose onset has been associated with more severe
      prognosis. Hospitalized patients with comorbidities or clinical risk factors have a higher
      risk of respiratory functions deterioration and significant risk to need intensive care.

      Early transfusion of convalescent plasma (2 units of 200-230 mL of apheresis plasma
      inactivated by amotosalen) would prevent this secondary worsening and reduce the risk to be
      transferred to intensive care, length of stay and mortality. Considering clinical and
      biological manifestations of the disease, including coagulation disorders, endothelial
      alterations, immunological disorders, it seems interesting to compare this convalescent
      plasma with a SARS-CoV-2 lacking antibodies plasma.
