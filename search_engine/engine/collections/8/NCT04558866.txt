    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase II, single-arm trial evaluating combination of
      darolutamide and high testosterone doses - extreme bipolar androgen therapy (ExBAT) - in
      patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing after
      abiraterone. Extreme androgen therapy will include alternating 56-day cycles of darolutamide
      1,200mg/day (two 300 tablets every 12 hours) p.o. for 28 days followed by testosterone
      cypionate 400 mg i.m. During the treatment period, patients will be followed with chest,
      abdomen and pelvis CT and bone scan every 8-9 weeks until cycle 4 and every 12 weeks
      thereafter during the study period. Patients who present with disease progression but are
      considered to be benefiting from the treatment may continue receiving it, but will be
      followed by their treating physician according to local guidelines (follow-up period). All
      patients who stopped treatment will enter follow-up period and survival data will be
      collected from medical charts. Additionally, QoL questionnaires (BPI-SF, EQ-5D-3L and FACT-P)
      will be applied every 8-9 weeks until the end of treatment.
