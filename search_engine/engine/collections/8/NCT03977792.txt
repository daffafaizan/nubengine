    
      Secondary objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of BOR1500L7 on:

             -  The reduction of ulcerative lesions rates following the prodromal stage;

             -  The extension of the delay prior to first ulcerative lesions occurence following
                the prodromal stage;

             -  The decrease of cumulative ulcerative lesions dimensions during papule, vesicles,
                ulcers/soft and hard crust stages;

             -  The decrease of symptoms intensity (pain, tingling, itching, burning sensation)
                during prodromal, erythema, papule, vesicles, ulcers/soft crust, hard crust,
                re-epithelialize stages;

             -  The reduction of symptoms duration (pain, tingling, itching, burning sensation)
                during the prodromal, erythema, papule, vesicles, ulcers/soft crust, hard crust,
                re-epithelialize stages in subjects with recurrent herpes labialis;

        2. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of BOR15001L7 in subjects with recurrent herpes
           labialis
