      I. To evaluate fluorine F 18 DCFPyL (18F-DCFPyL) PET/CT for detection of recurrent prostate
      cancer after initial therapy in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive fluorine F 18 DCFPyL intravenously (IV). After 60-120 minutes,
      participants undergo whole body PET/CT. Immediately after the first scan, participants may
      undergo a second PET/CT without receiving fluorine F 18 DCFPyL.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 24-72 hours.
