      neurotransmission in mood disorders [1, 2]. Adenosine agonists have been shown to have
      properties similar to those of dopamine antagonists and there is a well characterized
      antagonistic interaction between adenosine and dopamine receptors in the ventral striatum.
      Increased adenosynergic transmission has been demonstrated to reduce the affinity of dopamine
      agonists for dopamine receptors. It has been theorized that adenosine may exert some of its
      antipsychotic effects through modulation of glutamatergic transmission.

      Two double-blind, randomized, add-on, placebo-controlled trials comparing allopurinol and
      placebo in acute mania have showed statistically significant greater improvements in YMRS
      scores in the allopurinol vs. placebo groups. These empiric data, together with the
      theoretical and basic science background cited, provide the impetus for this proposed study.
