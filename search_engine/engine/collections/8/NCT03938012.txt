    
      Primary objective:

      To investigate the prevalence of MET and TP53 mutations, as well as HER2 and MET
      amplification, in lung and head and neck tumours, through prospective collection of tumour
      specimens in newly recruited patients.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To distinguish the presence of somatic/germline MET and TP53 mutation in lung and head
           and neck tumours.

        2. To detect for amplifications of MET and/or HER2 genes in SCC samples.

        3. To investigate the association and interaction of cMet and HER2 in SCC tumours.

        4. To establish a prospective documation of clinical, histopathological, treatment and
           follow-up (clinic pathological) data of newly recruited patients.
