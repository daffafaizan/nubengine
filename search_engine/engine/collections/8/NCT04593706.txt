      reminder of the traumatic incident, past or present disease or a surgery which caused them.

      Scarring is a common consequence of wound healing process, and it is one of the most complex
      biological processes in human. This healing process is affected by numerous factors and thus
      can be disrupted, leading to pathological scarring.

      Pathological scarring is common in people with genetic predisposition, those undergone
      complex and massive surgeries, burns or those wounded in unsanitary environments. Apart from
      being aesthetically unpleasant, scars are associated with functional and psychosocial
      morbidities.

      Despite clinical, pathologic and pathogenic differences between keloids and hypertrophic
      scars, treatments are similar.

      Scars have a negative external impact causing social distress and impaired self-image, and as
      a consequence, low satisfaction rates following surgical and cosmetic procedures.

      The first line treatment is monthly intralesional corticosteroid injections with a response
      rate of 50-100% and recurrence of 50%.

      There are a few steroids available and used for abnormal scars treatment, including Celestone
      chronodose (Betamethasone acetate + Betamethasone sodium phosphate), Dexamethasone sodium
      phosphate, Methylprednisolone acetate, Methylprednisolone sodium succinate,
      Methylprednisolone hemisuccinate, Triamcinolone acetonide.

      Steroids are different by their hydrophilic properties, potency and half-life, although the
      half-life of intralesional injections is not known. Inspite of being widely used, there have
      never been a comparative study of the different steroid treatments.
