      treatment trial of a combined exercise or stretching regimen plus behavioral activation
      treatment. All individuals will receive 6 weekly and 3 biweekly 1-hour sessions of behavioral
      activation treatment. Behavioral activation involves exploring values in different life areas
      (relationships, education/career, interests, etc.) and scheduling activities in line with
      these values. Research has shown that behavioral activation treatment can improve mood and
      alleviate depressive symptoms.

      In addition, participants will be randomized (like a flip of a coin) to either an additional
      aerobic exercise intervention or an additional stretching intervention. These interventions
      will take place for half an hour after the first 6 weeks of the behavioral activation
      intervention. The purpose of this study is to examine if adding an aerobic exercise
      intervention to a brief psychosocial treatment can improve mood above and beyond an active
      control condition.

      Throughout the study, participants will complete computer, questionnaire, and interview
      assessments as well as exercise tests and a blood draw. The details of each visit are listed
      below. For full completion of this study, participants can earn up to $100.
