      DRG following a moderate-fat meal in a randomized sequence with a washout period of 28 days
      between doses. DBF dose was based on body weight according to the currently recommended dose
      regimen (derived by Aquestive from population PK modeling in healthy volunteers). DRG dose
      was based on body weight according to the current product labeling for DRG.

      Period 2: Participants who completed Period 1 were asked to participate in a second period on
      a voluntary basis during which volunteers received a second dose of DBF administered at the
      same dose and in exactly the same manner as the earlier dose of DBF with the exception that
      DBF was administered following a high-fat meal.
