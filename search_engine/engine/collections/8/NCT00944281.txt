      infants meeting a set of eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive
      lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) with different amounts of zinc and a placebo or zinc
      supplement from 9 to 18 months of age. The families will receive the respective supplement at
      weekly intervals and the participants undergo a morbidity evaluation weekly, anthropometric
      evaluation at 9, 12, 15 and 18 months and laboratory analyses at enrollment and at 18 months
      of age. Growth outcomes will be analyzed during the two-year follow up at 24, 30, 36 and 42
      months of age.
