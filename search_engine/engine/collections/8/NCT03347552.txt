      Health Evaluation (HOME) program, which is an innovative and culturally-relevant suicide
      prevention intervention for Veterans aimed at increasing treatment engagement and decreasing
      suicide risk following psychiatric hospitalization, a period of heightened suicide risk. The
      research project employs a multi-site two-arm interventional trial design to study the
      effectiveness of the HOME program. Effectiveness of the treatment will be evaluated by
      comparing Veterans receiving the HOME program at two active treatment sites, Denver and
      Philadelphia Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs), to with those receiving
      care at two control sites, Houston and Portland VAMCs. The current protocol describes
      procedures as they will occur at all sites, including those completed locally at the Denver
      VAMC, which is the lead site for the study.
