      Essential hypertension is a common disorder that contributes to morbidity, mortality, and
      cost of health care, especially among African-Americans. Although a single-drug therapy is
      commonly prescribed for treatment of hypertension, blood pressure levels are controlled in
      some individuals but not in others. The study has the potential to identify genes
      contributing to the etiology of interindividual differences in blood pressure response to
      diuretic therapy in African-Americans and European Americans.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Hypertensive adults were treated with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg/day, for four
      weeks; or with the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan, 16 mg/day for 2 weeks
      followed by 32 mg/day for 4 weeks. Interindividual variations in blood pressure responses and
      in candidate genes coding for components of systems regulating vasoconstriction and volume
      were measured. In addition, a panel of 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms genome-wide
      was measured in subsets of the most extreme responders and nonresponders to each drug for
      genome-wide association of analyses.
