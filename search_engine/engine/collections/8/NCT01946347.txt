    
      30 patients with T2D and 30 healthy control subjects will be examined on an outpatient basis.
      The following examination will be carried out in each subject after 12 hrs fasting:

        -  Hyperinsulinaemic euglycemic clamp study lasting 4 hours combined with indirect
           calorimetry and biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle aspiration biopsy

        -  Meal test:Plasma glucose, immunoreactive insulin, plasma lipids, oxidative stress
           markers and gastrointestinal peptides measured in response to a standard meal(at times
           0´,30´,60´,120´,180´)

        -  At the beginning and after 120 minutes during the meal test and clamp peripheral
           microvascular endothelial function will be measured using EndoPat(Itamar Medical)

        -  Proton and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy(MRS).

        -  Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry(DXA) scanning to measure body composition.
