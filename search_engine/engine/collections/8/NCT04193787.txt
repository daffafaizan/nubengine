      and preliminary efficacy of the Expanding PrEP Implementation in Communities of PWID (EPIC-P)
      intervention among high-risk people who inject drugs (PWID) with opioid dependence (N=100).
      Since the aim of this pilot study is to establish whether the EPIC-P intervention is
      feasible/acceptable among at-risk PWID in a community-based setting, proposed is a
      non-comparative design. With the hopes to target PWID who are not linked with existing harm
      reduction services, proposed is to recruit participants using respondent driven sampling
      (RDS), a chain referral method with demonstrated success in recruiting hard-to-reach
      populations. Initial RDS participants, called "seeds," will be carefully recruited from the
      community where the study team leadership have built a well-established relationship.
      Participants enrolled in the study will be assessed at baseline and will be followed for 9
      months (with follow-up assessments at 3- and 6-months) by trained research assistants.
      Importantly, structured interviews will be conducted at follow-up visits to examine the
      barriers and facilitators and feedback about optimal implementation of the EPIC-P
      intervention.
