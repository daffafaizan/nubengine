      subjects will modify gut microbiome composition and enhance intestinal permeability, which
      will increase plasma LPS concentration, induce an inflammatory response in peripheral tissues
      (skeletal muscle), and impair insulin signaling and sensitivity. Also we will test the
      hypothesis that the inflammatory response and insulin resistance caused by high fat ingestion
      can be ameliorated by administering

        -  a synbiotic (Bifidobacterium longum R0175 and oligofructose) which protects the
           intestinal epithelial barrier and decreases intestinal translocation of LPS; and

        -  sevelamer, an agent which sequesters lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the gastrointestinal
           tract limiting its translocation into the circulation.
