      subjects with epilepsy and impaired attention. In the blinded phase, subjects will receive
      placebo and MPH (20mg twice daily) for 4 weeks each, in randomized order. Subjects will then
      receive open-label MPH for 8 weeks (20mg twice daily). Cognitive tests will be performed at
      baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and at the end of the open-label period.

      The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of MPH for the treatment of attentional
      dysfunction in subjects with epilepsy. It is expected that subjects will have improved
      attention when taking MPH compared to placebo, measured by the Conner's Continuous
      Performance Test (CPT). The effects of MPH on other cognitive functions that rely in part on
      attention, including memory (MCG Paragraph Test) and psychomotor speed (Symbol Digit
      Modalities Test), as well as the impact on an overall measure of divided attention,
      psychomotor speed, and response inhibition (Stroop Color Word Interference Test), will be
      ascertained. Improved performance when taking MPH compared to placebo is expected. Finally,
      the study will establish the effect of MPH on overall quality of life. It is hypothesized
      that there will be improvement in self-reported quality of life with MPH, but no change while
      taking placebo, as assessed by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Patient Inventory.

      Secondary analyses will determine the safety of MPH, including effects on seizure frequency,
      the impact on mood and subjective cognitive function, and continued efficacy over an
      open-label period. Epilepsy type, concurrent use of antiepileptic drugs that impair
      cognition, and history of head trauma will be assessed as covariates.
