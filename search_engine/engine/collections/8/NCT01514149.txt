    
      DM200-103 is a dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 17 weeks of weekly
      injections of CJC-1134-PC in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) on metformin
      monotherapy. This study will be a randomized, double-blind comparison of CJC-1134-PC versus
      placebo. Patients taking metformin will continue to take their metformin at the same dose for
      the duration of the study.

      Patients with T2DM, who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria,
      will be randomly assigned to a treatment arm. All patients will undergo weekly clinic visits
      to receive 17 weeks of study treatment, including the titration period.

      CJC-1134-PC or placebo treatment will be administered weekly by subcutaneous injection in the
      abdomen to patients in a fasting state. Patients will be closely monitored and evaluated for
      toxicity on an ongoing basis.
