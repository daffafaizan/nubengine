    
      This study will be conducted in two parts.

      The first part (Part A) will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
      iOWH032 in healthy, adult Bangladeshi volunteers.

      The second part (Part B) will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
      iOWH032 in adult Bangladeshi patients with cholera. While female participants will be
      included in Part A, only male patients will be enrolled in Part B. The rationale for
      excluding women in Part B is the difficulty in separating urine from stool in severely
      dehydrated females with rapid rates of purging. Moreover, it has been difficult to retain
      adult females in the hospital after improvement of their diarrhoea because of their household
      responsibilities, which might impact compliance in this small study. Further, no sex
      differences in the pharmacokinetics of iOWH032 were found in the study conducted in healthy
      subjects in the US, which included 42 males and females, nor have sex differnces been
      observed in preclinical studies.
