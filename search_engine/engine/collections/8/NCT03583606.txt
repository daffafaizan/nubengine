    
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind trial of 60 evaluable males and non-pregnant
      females, 18-45 years old, inclusive, who are in good health, meet all eligibility criteria,
      and do not meet any exclusion criteria. This trial is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity and immunogenicity of an Ebolavirus Zaire (ChAd3-EBO-Z) vaccine for the
      prevention of Ebola. ChAd3-EBO-Z will be administered intramuscularly into the deltoid of all
      participants on Day 1. On Day 8, subjects will receive either placebo, ChAd3-EBO-Z , or MVA-
      BN(R)-Filo boosters, administered intramuscularly into the deltoid of the arm opposite their
      first vaccination, based on study group. There will be 20 subjects in each group. Subjects
      will be monitored for 6 months after vaccination to assess safety and efficacy for
      ChA3d-EBO-Z with homologous and heterologous boosting. Differences between the homologous and
      heterologous arm represent potential points for further, more in depth assessment to
      determine if there is a correlation with efficacy. Long term goals include comparing results
      from this study with results from naturally infected individuals as well as non-human primate
      (NHP) vaccination/challenge studies. There is no formal hypothesis for this study. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of study products
      by study group when administered IM to healthy adults. The secondary study objective is to
      assess the antibody response to Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) by study group.
