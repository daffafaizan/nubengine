      completely understood and its importance is questioned.

      Total intravenous anesthesia can be driven by a computer using bispectral index as a
      controller. Such a system matches anesthetic agent requirements to the needs of each
      individuum and thus allows an unbiased evaluation of the influence of nitrous oxide. Two
      groups of patients are compared: one ventilated with a oxygen-air mixture and one with
      oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture. Anesthesia is provided by a "dual-loop" which adapts propofol
      and remifentanil target concentrations to maintain a bispectral index between 40 and 60 in
      both groups.
