      surgical (DBS) methods, have limited impact on postural instability. Physical therapy (PT)
      for PD is becoming increasingly used as a means to induce benefits on patient balance.
      However, limits in efficacy and consistency still exist. In this study, the investigators
      will test the effects of TDCS+TUS combined with PT on postural instability of PD patients.
