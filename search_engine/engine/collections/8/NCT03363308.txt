      implemented in two phases: eight facilities will receive the intervention in phase 1 and the
      remaining eight facilities will receive the intervention in phase 2.

      Objective 1: For objective 2 on facility-based health outcomes, the study design is a
      cluster-randomized evaluation in phase 1. The intervention's effects will be assessed by
      comparing an intervention group and a control group of facilities. These will be selected
      from 16 Kinshasa health facilities. Intervention and control facilities' monthly reported
      health outcomes will be compared in a 12-month baseline period and 12-month period during and
      after the intervention implementation (Phase 1) in a difference-in-difference analysis. In
      Phase 2, all facilities will have their monthly service statistics and health outcomes
      reviewed for trends in improvement.

      Overall, in Phase 1, eight intervention sites will be matched to eight sites serving as
      controls. In Phase 2, the eight Phase 1 control sites will then receive the same package as
      the intervention sites in Phase 1. Sites will be stratified by case load, low and high (over
      90 births per month), and funding (public or private funding). Within each stratum, prior to
      start of the intervention, there will be random selection to intervention and control groups
      to allow for baseline comparability between groups.
