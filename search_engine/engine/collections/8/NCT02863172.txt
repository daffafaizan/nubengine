      Questionnaires:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will fill out a some
      questionnaires about participant's work, family history, medical history, and health habits.
      If participant has already answered these questionnaires when participant was registered as a
      patient at MD Anderson, the study staff will give participant a copy and review participant's
      answers with participant for any updates or if participant has any questions. It should take
      about 20 minutes to complete the questionnaires.

      Participant will also complete a health and lifestyle questionnaire, which contains 20
      questions for men and 22 questions for women. This questionnaire should take about 10 minutes
      to complete.

      Participant may be given the questionnaires electronically on REDcap (a secure, web-based
      application used to collect data for research studies that participant can access from
      participant's phone, tablet, or computer), over the phone (either with a member of the study
      staff asking questions or by using an electronic response system called IVR), at home through
      the mail, or in person by a member of the research staff at participant's MD Anderson visit.
      If mailed, a postage-paid return envelope will be provided for the return of the
      questionnaire.

      Blood or Saliva Sample:

      Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn. If possible, the blood will be drawn during an
      already scheduled blood draw to avoid additional needle sticks.

      If participant is unwilling or unable to give a blood sample, participant may give a saliva
      sample instead. If participant is at MD Anderson, a saliva kit will be given to participant.
      If participant is not at MD Anderson, the kit will be mailed to participant with instructions
      for collecting the saliva sample and a prepaid envelope will be included to return the sample
      to the study staff.

      The blood or saliva sample will be sent to the research laboratory of the study chairs at MD
      Anderson for testing.

      Residual Tissue Collection:

      If participant has tissue from procedures performed at MD Anderson, this tissue may be
      requested from participant's previous procedures for testing. If participant has had
      procedures done at another institution, participant may be asked to sign a waiver to allow
      the tissue from the outside institution to be sent to MD Anderson for testing.

      Follow-Up Questionnaires:

      Participant will also fill out a follow-up questionnaire at least 1 time in 5 years to update

      Participant may withdraw from participation in this study at any time. If participant decides
      participant wants to stop taking part in this study, data collected about participant and
      data taken from the blood or saliva samples participant has provided up to the time
      participant withdraws will remain in study database and will be used for the purposes of the
      study.

      Length of Study:

      Participant's active participation on this study will be over after the blood, tissue, and/or

      staff asking questions or by using an electronic response system called IVR), at home through
      the mail, or in person by a member of the research staff at participant's family member's MD
