        1. To examine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing an interdisciplinary
           goal-setting clinical group program focused on domains of physical, psychological, and
           spiritual wellness for survivors of cancer at University of California San Francisco
           (UCSF).

        2. To determine preliminary efficacy of the Survivorship Wellness intervention in regards
           to:

             1. Increasing knowledge of and perceived confidence in execution of health behavior
                changes in domains of physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness for survivors of
                cancer.

             2. Increasing quality of life.

             3. Reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety.

             4. Increasing physical activity.

        3. To assess differences in patient wellbeing and in the impact of the Survivorship
           Wellness program during the period of COVID-19 and telehealth classes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete surveys over 5-10 minutes at baseline (i.e. before participating in the
      program), and at 9 and 15 weeks follow up on the impact of COVID-19 on survivorship. Patients
      also complete a survey assessing how patients rate telehealth classes in the Survivorship
      Wellness program.
