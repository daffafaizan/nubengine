      ageing population. However, the prognosis is worse than that of young patients. Some patients
      can benefit from intensive treatment such as concurrent chemoradiotherapy, but are always
      with obvious toxicity. With the advancement of radiotherapy technology and the emergence of
      molecular targeted drugs, radiotherapy combined with Nimotuzumab has shown good therapeutic
      efficacy and tolerance. The investigators plan to testify VMAT combined with Nimotuzumab in
      elderly patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
