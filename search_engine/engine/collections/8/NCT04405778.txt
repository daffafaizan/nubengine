      people who have GPC3-expressing previously treated solid tumors. This study will look at the
      safety and tolerability of TAK-102 and will determine the RP2D of TAK-102.

      The study will enroll approximately 14 participants, with a maximum of 18 participants.
      Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment groups (dose cohorts) and dose
      escalation will be conducted in this study:

        -  Cohort 1: 1 × 10^7 CAR (+) cells/body [starting dose].

        -  Cohort 2: 1 × 10^8 CAR (+) cells/body.

        -  Cohort 3: 1 × 10^9 CAR (+) cells/body.

      In case Cohort 1 is not tolerable, the dose level will be de-escalated to Cohort -1: 3 × 10^6
      CAR (+) cells/body. Dose level(s) between planned cohorts and/or other dosing schedules may
      also be tested.

      This study consists of the Screening, Pretreatment, and Treatment and Primary Follow-up
      phases. In Treatment and Primary Follow-up phases, all participants will be asked to receive
      a single intravenous infusion of TAK-102 and administration of TAK-102 will continue up to
      Month 12.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 15 years as a maximum including planned long-term follow-up study (the 12-month
      Treatment and Primary Follow-up and the 14-year Secondary Follow-up phases in another study).
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic and be hospitalized for at least 28 days
      to receive treatment with TAK-102 followed by a recovery period.
