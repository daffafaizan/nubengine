      airway. It offers an improved laryngeal view compared with direct laryngoscopy and increases
      the likelihood of successful intubation in patients for whom direct laryngoscopy is
      anticipated to be difficult. It is among the most frequently preferred difficult airway
      devices due to its ease of use, portability and direct laryngoscopy resemblance. The use of
      videolaryngoscopy has been shown to improve intubation success in many cases associated with
      difficult intubation, such as morbid obesity, pregnancy, limitation of cervical motility, and
      poor mouth opening.
