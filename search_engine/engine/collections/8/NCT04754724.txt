      gastrointestinal symptoms for many which is termed lactose intolerance. Lactase is an enzyme
      occurring in the intestinal mucosa that hydrolyzes lactose into its constituent parts,
      galactose and glucose. The enzyme is normally present in neonates, however, for a majority of
      individuals in the world there is an inherited and irreversible reduction in enzyme activity
      as individuals age. Secondary lactose malabsorption can also occur when there is injury to
      the intestinal mucosa from a reversible condition such as infection.

      The mechanism of hydrogen detection is based on undigested lactose in the colon being
      fermented by bacteria resulting in the production of hydrogen which is then partially
      absorbed into the bloodstream and ultimately exhaled by the lungs via the pulmonary
      circulation and gas exchange. Direct lactase activity can also be measured on tissue obtained
      through jejunal biopsy via endoscopy. This approach, however, is more invasive, costly, and
      potentially less reliable given issues relating to sampling bias

      Current clinical hydrogen breath tests for diagnosis of lactose malabsorption are bulky and
      expensive for clinical providers to use and obtain. As a result, Vivante Health is testing
      how effective the GIMate device is in diagnosing lactose malabsorption as an alternative
      option.
