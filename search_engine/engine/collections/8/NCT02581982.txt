      I. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel.

      II. To calculate the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the immune effects of pembrolizumab combined with paclitaxel. II. To
      associate immune effects with tumor response. III. To explore changes in immune-regulatory
      micro ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as biomarkers of response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel IV
      over 60 minutes on day 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days and then every 3
      months for 1 year.
