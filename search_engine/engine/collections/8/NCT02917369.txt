      without liver metastasis, sequenced transcriptomes, perform whole exome sequencing, and
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array profiling for triplets, each comprising normal
      lung tissue, primary LCLC carcinoma, and its synchronous matched metastasis, as well as
      analyzed genomics of lung cancer characterized previously by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
      to conduct integrated proteogenomic analyses.
