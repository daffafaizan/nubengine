      therapy has recently become possible.

      There is growing evidence that inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF. CRP, a
      sensitive marker of systemic inflammation, is increased in patients with AF compared with
      patients in sinus rhythm. Elevated CRP levels are associated with increased likelihood of new
      onset AF and with recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion. Clinical and basic
      laboratory evidence suggests that, in addition to being potent lipid-lowering agents, statins
      may also have anti-inflammatory properties and protective effect against AF.

      125 eligible patients with AF, undergoing left atrial ablation, will be randomly assigned in
      a 1:1 ratio to receive daily 80 mg of atorvastatin or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 3
      months after their ablation procedure.

      Patients will have baseline lipids, CRP, endothelial function tests and Quality of Life (QoL)
      surveys compared with testing at 3 months post ablation.
