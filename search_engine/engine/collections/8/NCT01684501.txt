      will be used to study the biomechanics of motion and evaluate if the pattern of ankle power
      generation by the prosthetic foot is physiological. In addition, the metabolic cost of
      ambulation will be monitored during walking at constant speed over a period of several
      minutes. The data will allow us to assess if the prosthetic foot leads to a decreased
      metabolic cost of ambulation compared to passive prosthetic feet.
