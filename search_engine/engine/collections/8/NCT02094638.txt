      and Drug Administration(CFDA) in 2003, and widely used respiratory disease, such as biofilm
      related upper respiratory infections, pneumonia and bronchitis. During its 11 years marketing

      as severe allergic reaction. In this study, clinical pharmacists in selected hospitals will
      not only record the clinical use and the adverse drug reactions/ adverse drug events of this
      injection, but also try to figure out why drug-induced severe allergic reaction happens
      through a nested case-control study. This real world study for Tanreqing Injection with 30400
      patients will be conducted from January.2014 to June.2016.
