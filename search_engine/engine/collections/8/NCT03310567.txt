    
      Primary Objective

        -  Evaluate the response rate (RR) and 6 month progression-free survival (PFS-6) of
           patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma when treated with
           epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab as measured by modified RECIST v1.1

        -  In a subset analysis, evaluate the response rate (RR) and 6 month progression-free
           survival (PFS-6) of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) and recurrent or
           metastatic endometrial carcinoma when treated with epacadostat in combination with
           pembrolizumab.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab.

        -  Evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial
           carcinoma when treated with epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab as measured by
           modified RECIST v1.1.

        -  In a subset analysis, evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients with microsatellite
           instability (MSI) and recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma when treated with
           epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab.
