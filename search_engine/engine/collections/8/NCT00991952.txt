      I. To examine the antitumor efficacy of irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) followed by
      flavopiridol (alvocidib) (Arm A) and of irinotecan alone (Arm B) in patients with advanced
      gastric/ gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma wild type for p53.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of both study arms in patients with advanced
      gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma.

      II. To examine other measures of antitumor activity in both study arms, including response
      rate (in patients with measurable disease) and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies for p21 and RAD51 homolog (S.
      cerevisiae) (Rad51) expression in patients who agree to tumor biopsies (Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] and Weill-Cornell only).

      II. To explore the response to irinotecan and flavopiridol and to irinotecan alone by
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarray technology on pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies
      (MSKCC and Weill-Cornell only).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and
      alvocidib IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride as in Arm A. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
