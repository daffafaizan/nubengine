      each dose level until a grade >/= 2 treatment-related toxicity occurs during cycle 1;
      enrollment then will proceed using a classic 3+ 3 dose escalation design. If the toxicity was
      grade 2, then enrollment will continue on that dose level. If the toxicity was grade 3 or 4,
      then enrollment will continue on one dose level below that dose. Dose escalation with the 3+3
      design will continue until >/= 2 patients out of 6 experience a treatment-related
      dose-limiting toxicity. Then, the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose of
      intravenous artesunate will be one dose level below the level at which the toxicities
      occurred.
