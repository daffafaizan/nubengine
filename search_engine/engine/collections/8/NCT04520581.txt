      The investigator was studied 238 consecutive the American Society of Anesthesiologists'
      physical grades I and II adult patients scheduled to undergo general anesthesia requiring
      tracheal intubation for elective surgery. Exclusion criteria included a gross anatomical
      abnormality, before surgery of the head, neck and cervical spine, previously difficult
      tracheal intubation, loose teeth, or those requiring a rapid sequence or awake intubation,
      moderate or severe obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease accompanied by pulmonary
      function tests. Anesthesia was induced with remifentanyl 3ng/kg, propopol 1-2 mg/kg or TIVA
      2% fresopol 4ug/dL, remifentanyl 3ng/dL and rocuronium 0.8 mg/kg to facilitate tracheal
      intubation. Laryngoscopy was performed after the loss of the fourth twitch in the
      train-of-four in response to ulnar nerve stimulation. All laryngoscopies using a #4 Macintosh
      blade were performed with the patient placed in the sniffing position. Tracheal intubation
      was performed without assistance (ex. External laryngeal manipulation, Used stylet). A single
      experienced anesthesiologist, blinded to each group, performed all of the direct
      laryngoscopies and classified the laryngoscopic view according to the modified Cormack and
      Lehane grade, measured number of attempts, intubation time and blood pressure and heart rate
      before/ after intubation.
