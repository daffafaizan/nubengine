      To determine the effects of complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on survival of
      patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized multicenter study. Before randomization, all women were
      stratified according to age (≤50 years, >50 years), tumor size(≤2cm, >2cm) and research
      center. All the patients underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Eligible
      women were randomly assigned to ALND or no ALND Active Comparator: Patients undergo axillary
      lymph node dissection involving removal of at least level I and II nodes.

      Experimental: No surgery of axillary lymph node in this arm. All the patients were to receive
      whole-breast opposing tangential-field radiation therapy. The use of adjuvant systemic
      therapy was determined by the treating physician according to the recently NCCN.

      Patients are followed up every 4 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months from the third
      year to the fifth year, and then annually for a total of 10 years.
