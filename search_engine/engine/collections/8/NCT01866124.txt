      malnutrition (or wasting) (WHO 1999, and more recently ACF 2011), and guidelines for moderate
      acute malnutrition (or wasting) are in the process of formulation. In contrast, surprisingly
      little is known on preventive schemes for acute malnutrition. In Haiti, Ruel et al (2008)
      found that targeting nutrition interventions to prevent children from becoming malnourished
      might be more effective than curative treatment to reduce child wasting. In addition, recent
      preventive trials in humanitarian settings focused on the use of food-based strategies,
      especially ready-to-use food (Isanaka, 2009; Hendricks, 2010; Parikh, 2010; Imbad, 2011;
      Huybregts, 2012). However, it is well known that the causes of under-nutrition are numerous
      and also relate to inadequate health and care practices, lack of food diversification, food
      insecurityâ€¦ Therefore, the MAM'Out research project aims at assessing a context-adapted
      preventive approach, which is likely to influence several underlying causes of
      under-nutrition and not based primarily on food supplementation. The objective is to provide
      an evidence base for this alternative approach, in order that proven intervention be taken
      into account for scale-up at policy-making levels.
