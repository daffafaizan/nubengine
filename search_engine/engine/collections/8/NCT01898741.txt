      To determine safety and technical feasibility of stereotactic radiotherapy for locally
      advanced pancreatic carcinoma

      Study design:

      Pilot study to determine safety and feasibility

      Study population:

      Patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma, without distant metastasis

      Intervention:

      Patients will undergo endoscopic fiducial marker placement, and patients will get a
      custom-made individual corset. Radiotherapy will be delivered in three fractions of 8 Gy on
      an outpatient basis.

      Primary study outcome:

      The main study endpoint will be safety of the procedure, expressed in proportion of patients
      experiencing treatment-induced toxicity grade 3 or more according to the CTC-AE 4.0 due to
      the complete procedure within 90 days of the last radiation.

      Secondary study outcome:

      Other study parameters will be technical feasibility, treatment response, quality of life,
      overall survival, progression free survival, and rate of possible secondary resections

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      Increased severe toxicity may occur due to the intervention, but treatment related toxicity
      should be limited due to strict dose constraints to the organs at risk (e.g. duodenum,
      stomach). Potential benefits may be pain relief, due to local control of the tumor, and a
      prolonged survival.
