    
      Rationale: 'TEddI' will enable a once-daily treatment strategy to be studied and provide
      information on effectiveness, patient adherence and quality of life and the tolerability of
      such regimens.

      Hypothesis: The study hypothesis is that an antiretroviral regimen comprising of three agents
      taken once daily will have higher levels of adherence than a regimen requiring more frequent
      dosing.

      Primary objective: To determine over 24 weeks the levels of adherence in two groups of
      HIV-infected subjects randomised to receive either a once daily minimum 3-drug regimen or to
      continue a minimum 3-drug regimen requiring more frequent dosing.

      Secondary objectives: The secondary objectives of the study will include:

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with treatment failure where treatment failure is
           defined as:

        -  HIV-1 RNA viral load of >400 copies/ml on two consecutive occasions more than one month
           apart, OR

        -  Discontinuation of treatment for any reason (where subsequent therapy does not comply
           with the study regimen change guidelines outlined in section 3.3.3)

        -  Proportion of patients with plasma HIV-RNA less than 50 copies/ml (using an
           ultrasensitive assay) at 24 and 48 weeks

        -  Change from baseline in CD4 cell count at 24 and 48 weeks

        -  Changes from baseline in subjects' quality of life at 24 and 48 weeks

        -  Changes from baseline based on DASS 21 scores at 24 and 48 weeks

        -  Incidence and severity of adverse events and abnormal laboratory values (grade 3 & 4) at
           24 and 48 weeks

        -  Proportion of patients remaining on assigned treatment Study Design This is a
           randomised, open-label, multi-centre, prospective, 48-week study comparing a 3 (or more)
           drug once-daily antiretroviral regimen with any 3 (or more) drug regimen in which at
           least 1 drug must be taken at least twice daily.

      One hundred and twenty (120) subjects will be recruited and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one
      of two open-label treatment regimens and will continue to receive randomised treatment until
      week 24:

      Arm 1: (Once daily arm) commence treatment with a once-a-day combination of licensed
      antiviral medications (such as EFV/ddI/3TC, EFV/3TC/TDF or ATV/3TC/TDF).

      Arm 2: (Continuation arm) continue current ART (minimum 3-drugs) dosed twice daily or more
      frequently

      Following week 24, patients will have the option to continue randomised treatment for a
      further 24 weeks or switch to the once daily treatment arm. In all cases, patients will be
      followed up for 48 weeks from the baseline visit.
