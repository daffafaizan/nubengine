    
      This is a Phase I, single-center, single arm, open-label study, to establish the PK
      parameters of Vivitrol 380 mg IM injection (IP), a US FDA approved medication. Participants
      will be healthy volunteers with no significant medical or mental health disorders, who have
      completed participation in clinical trial GM 0017 (i.e. have received the OLANI treatment and
      have subsequently provided two consecutive plasma levels of naltrexone (NTX) <0.1ng/mL).

      This study will examine the PK profile of Vivitrol IM 380 mg over 6 doses for a treatment
      period of 196 days. Intense sampling will occur after the 1st and 6th dose of Vivitrol.
      Participants will be without a DSM 5 - Substance Related Disorders classification.
      Participants will be required to undergo a Naloxone Challenge Test (NCT) to confirm opiate
      naivety before administration of the IP. No randomization will occur.
