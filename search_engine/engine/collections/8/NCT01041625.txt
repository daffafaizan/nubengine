      designed to characterize the response of Apremilast 20 mg oral administered twice daily over
      12 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe lichen planus. The hypothesis and ideal primary
      end point will be that subjects achieve significant clinical response in cutaneous disease
      defined as a 2 or more grade improvement of the physician global assessment (PGA) after 12
      weeks of treatment.

      Many various therapies have been used to treat LP including topical and oral corticosteroids,
      retinoids, cyclosporine, griseofulvin, dapsone and phototherapy, but often with disappointing
      response.4 It is an inflammatory condition whose pathogenesis involves damage to basal
      keratinocytes by alloreactive T cells through the release proinflammatory cytokines, such as
      TNF-α and IFN-γ.1 Significantly elevated levels of such inflammatory mediators are present in
      tissue from LP lesions compared to normal controls.5 Based on these observations, the
      investigation of Apremilast, due to its ability to inhibit multiple inflammatory cytokines,
      for the treatment of moderate to severe LP is warranted.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Apremilast in
      subjects with moderate to severe lichen planus after 12 weeks of treatment. Other objectives
      are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Apremilast, effects on quality of life, and
      efficacy for mucosal disease if present.
