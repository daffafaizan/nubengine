      membrane perforations who have been offered and agreed to undergo tympanoplasty surgery with
      fascia graft (either transcanal or post-auricular) will be recruited. The surgical
      intervention and procedure of tympanoplasty will be performed as normal, however, the packing
      material will be randomly chosen using a random number generator. The middle ear and external
      canal will then be packed with either Chitosan Succinamide or Gelfoam. The patients in both
      groups will be placed on ciprodex post-operatively for 4 weeks. The patients will be seen
      post-operatively at 1 week for photo documentation and removal of the lateral aspect of CS/CD
      or Gelfoam. The patients will be seen at 4 weeks for photo documentation and the remainder of
      packing removal. At 3 months and 1 year the patients will have photo documentation and an
      audiogram.
