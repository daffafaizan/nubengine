      Primary

        -  Determine whether acupuncture reduces pain and dysfunction in patients with head and
           neck cancer who have undergone neck dissection.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether acupuncture relieves dry mouth in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are stratified according to
      surgical procedure (selective neck dissection vs modified radical neck dissection vs radical
      neck dissection) and baseline Constant-Murley score (â‰¤ 35 vs > 35). Patients are randomized
      into 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo acupuncture for 20-30 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo standard of care for 4 weeks. In both arms, treatment continues
           in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      The Constant-Murley score is assessed at baseline and then at week 6. Pain medication use is
      recorded at baseline, during study treatment, and then at week 6. Numerical Rating Scale of
      pain on activity and xerostomia inventories are completed at baseline and then at weeks 5 and
      6.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients will be accrued for this study.
