      emotion processing abilities, and these effects might be mediated via alterations in oxytocin
      production or sensitivity. The goal of this study was to test whether emotion recognition
      abilities and empathy might be improved by intranasal oxytocin administration in adults with
      a history of childhood maltreatment.

      In a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment with a crossover design, we assessed the
      performance of 40 healthy participants with a history of childhood adversity on the Reading
      the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and an emotion recognition task under 24 IU oxytocin vs.
      placebo and compared them to a control group of 40 matched individuals without traumatic
      childhood experiences.
