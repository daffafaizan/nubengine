    
      Design :

      Double-blind randomized trial

      Randomization :

      Simple Randomization generated by an online randomizer

      Sample Size :

      Difference between two means of primary outcome where

        1. mean difference (μ 1 - μ 2 ) = 0.05

        2. pool variance = 0.09

        3. Z 1-α/2 = 1.95 with type 1 error 5%

        4. 1-β = 1.282 with power 90%. Yielding 16 patients for each arm

      Time Period of Recruitment September 2019- August 2020

      Detailed Intervention

        1. Intervention group : Prolotherapy given three times (Day-1, Day-29, and Day-57 )

        2. Comparison group : Hyaluronate given five times (Day-1, Day-8, Day-15, Day-22, and
           Day-29.)

      Outcome Measurement :

        1. Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP) Source of Sample : Median Cubital Vein Whole
           Blood Measurement : Enzyme-linked Immunoassay

        2. Urinary C-Terminal Telopeptides of Type II Collagen (uCTX-II) Source of Sample : 50 cc
           of random urine sample Measurement : Enzyme-linked Immunoassay

        3. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) for functional
           Outcome (self-reported assessment)

      Domains :

        1. five elements of pain (score range 0-20),

        2. two for stiffness (score range 0-8),

        3. 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68)

      Classification :

      0 - 24 : Mild 25 - 48 : Moderate 49 - 72 : Severe 73 - 96 : Extremely Severe

      Statistical analysis :

        1. Descriptive statistic to elaborate baseline characteristic

        2. Assuming the baseline characteristic between groups are similar, the independent t-test
           will be conducted to see the differences between group, whereas Mann Whitney will be
           performed for non parametric data

        3. Difference within group (baseline and last day) will be measured by paired-t test or
           wilcoxon for non parametric scenario
