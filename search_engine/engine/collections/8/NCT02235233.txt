      healthy volunteers (n=10) of any race and ethnicity investigating the effect of liver disease
      on the pharmacokinetics of 99mTechnetium-mebrofenin. The use of the gamma emitter 99m Tc-
      labeled mebrofenin will allow real-time assessment of hepatic exposure. To determine the
      differences between healthy subjects and patients with NASH, blood and hepatic concentrations
      will be analyzed by non-compartmental analysis. Additionally, serum bile acid samples and
      fibroscan data will be collected to determine whether the bile acid profile and/or fibroscan
      readings are different between healthy subjects and patients with NASH. Changes in
      99mTc-mebrofenin will be correlated with the patient specific bile acid profile and fibroscan
      data. This study will increase our understating of the effect of liver disease on the
      disposition of medications that undergo transporter-mediated hepatic clearance.
