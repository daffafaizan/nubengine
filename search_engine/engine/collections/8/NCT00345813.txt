      Primary

        -  Compare the effect of dietary supplementation with soy vs placebo on biomarkers of cell
           cycle regulation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and signaling pathways in
           patients with localized prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicity and side effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the dietary patterns of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral soy supplementation daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo supplementation daily for 4 weeks. Patients
           undergo radical prostatectomy within 21 days after completion of soy or placebo
           supplementation.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected for biomarker analysis using immunohistochemistry.
