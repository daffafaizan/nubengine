    
      People with chronic low back pain will be recruited to participate in a team assessment with
      a local rural nurse practitioner and an-urban based physiotherapist linking through
      telehealth. The assessment will include a detailed history, physical examination and
      jointly-delivered education and recommendations for further community-based management. Pre
      and post measures of self-reported pain, back-specific function, quality of life, and
      satisfaction will be completed 2-4 weeks after the assessment. Comparison of short-term
      outcomes will be made with a group of participants from another study using the a different
      telehealth technology (secure laptop based videoconferencing) same inclusion criteria,
      measures and health care providers (Clin Trials.gov NCT02225535). The health care providers
      will be interviewed to get feedback on their preference and experience using the different
      type of telehealth technology.
