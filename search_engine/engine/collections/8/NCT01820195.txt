      morbidity and mortality of this disorder is considerable. There is no treatment for this
      condition and all measures should be taken into account to prevent this complication. Among
      the all prophylactic measures hydration and the dose ant type of contrast are the only
      factors that have been proved to be effective in preventing contrast nephropathy. N-Acetyl
      Cystein is an antioxidant agents that may be effective in different aspects of medicine, but
      it,s use in this condition is controversial. While some studies showed it is effective in
      prevention of contrast nephropathy, others showed no benefit. Different studies used
      different dose and route of administration. So more clinical trials with good power are
      needed to compare different oral Vs IV administration of the drug in a randomized double
      blinded clinical trial. In this study we allocate the eligible patients with chronic kidney
      diseases stages 2 to 4 to three groups. Oral N-Acetyl Cystein group, IV N-Acetyl Cystein
      group, placebo group. All group will be matched according to stages of chronic kidney
      diseases, diabetes, anemia, heart failure, age and sex.
