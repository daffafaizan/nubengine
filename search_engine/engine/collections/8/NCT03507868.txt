      chronic periodontitis patients. Chronic periodontitis patients were received nonsurgical
      periodontal treatment. Clinical measurements were recorded, saliva and GCF samples were
      obtained before and at first and third months after periodontal therapy. Levels of YKL-40 and
      IL-6 in saliva and GCF were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
