      quality of locations. A gastrointestinal endoscopy unit consists of the following area:
      procedural, recovery areas, and area for a disinfection and cleaning for equipment. This area
      is frequently exposed to the gastrointestinal gas expelled from patients and gas from
      electrocoagulated tissue through carbonation or electrocoagulation of neoplasms (procedure of
      endoscopic submucosal dissection, endoscopic mucosal resection, etc). This can be potential
      harmful component for respiratory health not only to medical practitioners but also to the
      patients who undergo endoscopic examinations. However, there has been scare data for the air
      quality check in the endoscopic unit. The aim of this study is to check the air quality using
      conventional portable passive air quality monitoring sensors in gastrointestinal endoscopy
      unit.
