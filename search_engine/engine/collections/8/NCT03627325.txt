      shared decision making process. Informed consent requires that patients have a thorough
      understanding of the potential risks of surgery. Moreover, clinicians and patients also need
      information regarding surgical risks in order to make decisions on the type of operation or
      whether surgery should be performed at all.

      Therefore, there is a need to discuss the risks derived empirically with a specific patient
      before any action to guide both surgical decision-making and informed consent.

      However, predicting postoperative risks and identifying patients at a higher risk of adverse
      events have traditionally been based on individual surgeon experience and augmented by
      published rates in the literature, either from single institution studies or clinical trials.
      Unfortunately, these estimates are typically not specific to an individual Patient's risk
      factors. The ACS (American College of Surgeons) Surgical Risk Calculator estimates the chance
      of an unfavorable outcome (such as a complication or death) after surgery. The risk is
      estimated based upon information the patient gives to the healthcare provider about prior
      health history. The estimates are calculated using data from a large number of patients who
      had a surgical procedure similar to the one the patient may have.
