    
      Primary Objective: To characterize the impact of radiation therapy on the lower urinary and
      bowel tract symptoms, (featuring urinary incontinence, irritative voiding symptoms, voiding
      dysfunction, bowel incontinence, and defecatory dysfunction) of female survivors of
      colorectal cancer 2-5 years after treatment.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize sexual dysfunctions present in female colorectal cancer survivors 2-5
           years after treatment and to determine the impact of radiation therapy compared to
           surgical treatment alone.

        -  To examine the impact of radiation therapy on the sexual function of the partner of
           female survivors of colorectal cancer treated with radiation treatment.
