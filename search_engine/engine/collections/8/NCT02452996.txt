    
      The monoclonal antibody, GNbAC1, targets the envelope protein (Env) of the human endogenous
      retrovirus (HERV), also called multiple sclerosis associated retrovirus (MSRV), which is
      considered as a critical factor in the development of multiple sclerosis.

      This study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of GNbAC1 following
      single ascending doses (6, 18, and 36 mg/kg) administered via IV infusion.
