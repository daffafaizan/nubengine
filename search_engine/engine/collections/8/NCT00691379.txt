      does not respond to hormonal or biological therapy with trastuzumab. However, triple negative
      breast cancers are highly sensitive to chemotherapy. The combination of paclitaxel and
      carboplatin administered on a weekly basis is active and well tolerated. Recently, initial
      therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab demonstrated prolonged
      progression-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone
