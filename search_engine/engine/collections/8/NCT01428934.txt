      developed and developing countries. The fundamental strategy consists in identifying people
      in a high risk situation in which preventive measures are effective and efficient. However,
      specificity and sensitivity of risk equations are modest, which means that approximately 50%
      of the patients who are likely to develop a vascular event and would benefit from preventive
      measures are not considered at high risk. While 30% of the subjects considered at risk don't
      really benefit from preventive measures. Moreover, decisions which imply thousands of people
      and can determine drug treatment indications are taken every day in primary care centers.
      These decisions are based mostly on the result of estimations about the probability to
      develop a vascular disease in 10 years. Improvement of these predictions in our country will
      have an immediate, clinical and welfare impact and a short term public health effect.

      The purpose of this study is to analyze if ankle-brachial index (ABI), measures of arterial
      stiffness, postprandial glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, self-measured blood pressure and
      presence of comorbidity are independently associated to incidence of vascular events and
      whether they can improve the predictive capacity of current risk equations in the
      intermediate-risk population.
