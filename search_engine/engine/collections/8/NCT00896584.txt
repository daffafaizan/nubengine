      chronic respiratory disease is based on an algorithm where arterial oxygen saturation is the
      discriminating factor. It has recently been shown that this algorithm does not discriminate
      sufficiently between patients who need pre-flight evaluation and maybe supplementary oxygen
      during air travel, and those who can travel by air without supplemental oxygen or further
      evaluation. Studies have also shown that exercise desaturation may predict in-flight
      hypoxemia. The objective of the present study is to examine if inclusion of arterial oxygen
      saturation measured by pulseoximetry during exercise in the BTS algorithm, will increase the
      sensitivity and specificity of the BTS pre-flight evaluation guidelines.The study also
      include questionnaires on symptoms during air travel carried out before ande after the
      pre-flight evaluation.
