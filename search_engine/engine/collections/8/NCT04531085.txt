      operative treatment to non-operative treatment of over 3 mm dislocated pediatric medial
      epicondyle fractures without joint incarceration or ulnar nerve dysfunction. A total of 120
      patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to either operative or non-operative treatment. The
      study will have a parallel non-randomized patient preference arm. Non-operative treatment
      will be upper limb immobilization with long arm cast for 4 weeks. Operative treatment will be
      open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). Data is collected at baseline and at each
      follow-up up to 2 years. Quick-DASH is used as primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes
      are patient reported pain, differences in range of motion, PedsQL Life inventory
      questionnaire as well as Mayo elbow preformance score.
