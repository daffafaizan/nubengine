      with cyclophosphamide or Rituximab (RTX) which has been used more and more widely due to
      superior safety profiles. But the long term remission rate of RTX monotherapy is only 60% and
      it takes effect relatively slowly.

      2 pilot studies reported that the combination therapy of cyclosporine (CsA) and RTX had
      better efficacy for inducing remission for iMN, with the long term remission rate up to 85%.
      CsA and RTX may have synergistic effect in the treatment of iMN because they have different
      time of action and different effects on the immune system and podocytes.

      Based on the previous rationale, the investigators designed this trial to determine whether
      combination of CsA and RTX is more effective than RTX alone in the treatment of iMN.
