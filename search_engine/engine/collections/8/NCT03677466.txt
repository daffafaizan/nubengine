      reperfusion therapy intramyocardial haemorrhage determined after a long-term period of severe
      ischemia. Earlier, definition of intramyocardial haemorrhage was possible only by autopsy.
      Nowaday, cardiac contrast MRI is the best diagnostic method, which allows to assess the
      regional and global function of the LV, structural changes in myocardial tissue and also in
      T2 mode it became assessable to reveal intramyocardial haemorrhage.

      Taking into account the results of previous researches, it can be concluded that the
      intramyocardial haemorrhage was determined in half of patients with primary PCI [1]. An
      influence of fibrinolytic therapy to the intramyocardial haemorrhage was conducted in small
      group of patients in one trial, and therefore further data will be actual and useful [2].

      It is planned to study 60 patients with primary STEMI using standard therapy. The patients
      will be divided into 2 groups. Patients of the 1st group will be treated by pharmaco-invasive
      strategy. The 2nd group will be treated by primary PCI. Patients in all groups after
      reperfusion strategies will be conducted cardiac contrast MRI for detection intramyocardial
      haemorrhage within 2 days onset. At day 7 and through 3 months, the clinical condition of the
      patients will be assessed and cardiac ultrasound will be performed for the evaluation of
      myocardial contractile function and 2D global longitudinal strain. Also, the incidence rate
      of secondary endpoints will be evaluated.
