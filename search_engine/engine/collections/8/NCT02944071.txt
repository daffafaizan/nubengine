    
      study objectives: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate acceptable safety and
      performance of the Ranger™（Ranger & Ranger LE） and Ranger™ SL (OTW) paclitaxel-coated PTA
      balloon catheter used for angioplasty of femoropopliteal artery lesions.

      Primary endpoints: The primary safety endpoint is the rate of following major adverse events
      through 30 days post-procedure:

        -  all device and/or procedure related mortality

        -  target limb major amputation at

        -  Clinically-driven Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR)

      The primary efficacy endpoint is primary lesion patency of the treated segment(s) as assessed
      by computed tomography angiography (CTA) at 12 months post-procedure without
      clinically-driven TLR.
