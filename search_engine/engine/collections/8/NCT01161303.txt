      terms of lung function, asthma symptom scores, medication usage and allergen sensitivity (by
      blood and skin tests). If suitable, they will then be asked to withdraw their corticosteroids
      for a week with careful monitoring of the symptoms and peak flows before undergoing
      fibreoptic bronchoscopy as was carried out in the previous explant study. Bronchial brushings
      and biopsies will be carried out as per standard technique used in University medicine.
      Primary epithelial cell cultures will be established from bronchial brushings and will be
      used for optimising the dose of anti TNF-alpha required for inhibition of TNF-alpha induced
      responses. The biopsies will be placed in either culture medium alone, allergen extract or
      allergen extract plus anti TNF-alpha antibody and cultured for 24 hours. The biopsies will
      then be either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis of cytokines or processed for
      immunohistochemical analysis. The supernatants from each study will be recovered and analysed
      for cytokine (IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, MIP 1 alpha and RANTES) release by ELISA.
