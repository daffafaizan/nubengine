      subjects per group. They are between the ages of 24 and 60 years old. They will not be taking
      pain medications for at least 48 hours prior to the study. The groups were as follows;

        1. Control

        2. heat only

        3. Tens only

        4. Tens and heat

        5. Tens for the last 15 minutes each hour plus heat

        6. Tens for the last 15 minutes each hour Tens is at threshold intensity (12 ma) at a
           frequency of 20 Hz either ramped continuously or for the last 15 minutes of each hour.
           The stimulation is 3 seconds increase to threshold, 3 seconds hold and 3 seconds ramped
           down followed by a 9 second rest period. Pain is assessed by an analog visual pain scale
           and an algometer placing pressure on the back to assess the pressure that causes pain, a
           measure of inflammation. In addition, the Oswestry lower back pain index and Roland
           Morris questionnaire are used. Range of motion in the trunk where first pain is felt is
           also measured.
