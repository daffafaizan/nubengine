    
      This is a Phase II, open-label study of TRC105 (anti-endoglin antibody) in combination with
      abiraterone or enzalutamide in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who
      are taking either abiraterone or enzalutamide and showing signs of biochemical progression
      without radiographic progression. A patient who is progressing on AR-therapy will continue
      the same AR-therapy on study with the addition of TRC105. The two arms will accrue in
      parallel and independently.

      There will be a 2-week washout of the active AR-targeted therapy prior to initiation of
      combination therapy. Tumor response should be assessed at a frequency of 8 weeks by CT/MRI
      chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as bone scan. Patients may continue on therapy until
      radiographic progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 criteria.
