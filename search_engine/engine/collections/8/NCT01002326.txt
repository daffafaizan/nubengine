    
      The main purpose of this trial is to develop and investigate the effects of a CBT protocol
      for children and adolescents with BDD. It is important to investigate CBT in this population
      given the disorder's early onset and poor trajectory if left untreated.

      In the first phase of this trial, we will develop the treatment manual, adapting the adult
      manual for use in a pediatric population. In the second phase of this trial we will test the
      effectiveness of the CBT treatment in 12 pediatric BDD patients. We intend to treat 12
      children and adolescents with BDD. All patients will receive CBT. We will also examine
      treatment feasibility and acceptability (e.g., retention and reasons for treatment refusal
      and dropout, expectancy, and motivation), and we will explore predictors of outcome.
      Therapeutic progress will be broadly assessed with measures of beliefs, behaviors, mood,
      functioning, and quality of life before, during, and after treatment.
