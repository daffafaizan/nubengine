      mass with exercise, and also in muscle loss conditions caused by a decrease in physical
      activity. Participants will be recruited who will undergo reconstructive surgery for a
      complete ACL tear and will then enter a standard physical therapy program during a six week
      recovery period. Subjects will receive either HMB or a placebo supplement during the recovery
      period. Muscle mass will be measured two weeks prior to the surgery and again after the
      recovery period using an InBody 720 body composition analyzer. Additionally, the Knee Injury
      and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire will be administered as a measure of
      recovery and activity level during the study.
