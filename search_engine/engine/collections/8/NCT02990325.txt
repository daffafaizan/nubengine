      sequelae associated with exposure to ABX464 and to explore selected immunological endpoints,
      compartmental pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. The site will screen and enroll 12
      HIV-infected subjects who will receive 150 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 28 days (Cohort
      1). Following completion of this cohort a further 24 subjects will be enrolled: 12
      HIV-uninfected subjects will receive 50 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 28 days (Cohort 2)
      and 12 HIV-infected subjects (Cohort 3) who will 50 mg ABX464 orally once daily for 84 days.
