    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of bendamustine and lenalidomide (BL)
      and also bendamustine,lenalidomide, and rituximab (BLR) in relapsed/refractory CLL and
      relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas. Phase I dose escalation will be done independently for
      the CLL and NHL groups. In addition, the study will be conducted in 2 parts. In part I of the
      study, the maximum tolerated dose of bendamustine and lenalidomide will be determined
      independently for the CLL and NHL groups. In part II of the study, CLL and NHL subjects will
      be enrolled at the MTD of BL determined in Part I for CLL and NHL and all subjects will
      receive rituximab. Part II of the study will determine the MTD of BLT independently for the
      NHL and CLL groups.
