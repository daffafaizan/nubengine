      one half of adult values. An important gap in knowledge exists that explain the mechanisms
      that result in higher clearance and lower bioavailability of voriconazole and places children
      at a substantial risk for sub-therapeutic concentrations and treatment failures. Preliminary
      data suggests that intestinal first-pass metabolism is responsible for the lower
      bioavailability in children, but not in adults. By inhibiting intestinal metabolism with
      grapefruit juice, the extent of the effect of intestinal first-pass metabolism on
      voriconazole pharmacokinetics can be determined. Inpatient children at the Children's
      Hospital of Philadelphia who are receiving oral voriconazole as standard of care will be
      enrolled in an open label, cross-over clinical trial to monitor plasma voriconazole levels
      after voriconazole administration with and without grapefruit juice to inhibit intestinal
      metabolism of voriconazole. The proposed research will elucidate the role of intestinal
      metabolism in the reduced oral bioavailability of voriconazole in children, which can be
      incorporated into a model simulation to guide accurate dosing.
