      done as per standard of care.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PHIL® device in the
      treatment of intracranial cerebral arteriovenous malformation. The PHIL® device, a
      non-adhesive liquid embolic agent, has been CE marked since July 2014. It is intended for use
      in the embolization of lesions in the peripheral and neurovasculature, including
      arteriovenous malformations and hypervascular tumors.

      All patients with a cAVM, ruptured or unruptured, eligible for endovascular treatment with a
      liquid embolic agent, PHIL®, based on multidisciplinary consensus are eligible for this
      study. A maximum of 108 patients will be enrolled in 18 European Institutions.

      The expected approximate study duration is 39 months.
