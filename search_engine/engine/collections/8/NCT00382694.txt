    
      This is a randomised, placebo controlled, phase II study evaluating toxicity and safety of
      fludarabine added to CyDex (cyclophosphamide+dexamethasone) as induction therapy in younger
      patients with untreated and treatment demanding multiple myeloma. The treatment regimen
      Patients will be randomised at diagnosis either to CyDex + Placebo (control Arm A) or CyDex +
      Fludarabine (Experimental Arm B).

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Primary:To determine the toxicity and safety of fludarabine when added to induction
           therapy by registration of side effects and adverse events in accordance with the common
           toxicity criteria (CTC).

        -  Secondary:To quantitate clonal cells in bone marrow and blood by flow cytometry (MRD)and
           to study new potential prognostic markers identified by cytomic, genomic and proteomic
           analysis.

        -  Tertiary: To estimate the efficacy of fludarabine when added to induction
           chemotherapy(CyDex) in patients with multiple myeloma by clinical end points: disease
           response and progression free survival.
