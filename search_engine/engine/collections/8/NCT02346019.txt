      residual limb of the transfemoral amputees with an MRI. We will measure the displacement of
      the socket wall relative to the femur under mechanical loading with x-ray. The functional
      mobility level of the subject with be quantified via standard clinical and bio mechanical
      tests. Perform a standard medial thighplasty with our without thigh liposuction. Characterize
      the post-surgical anatomy, compliance of the residual limb and function of the amputee
      subjects. After six months, repeat the MRI and xray and compare results. Subject will also
      complete a questionnaire regarding their views on the outcome of the surgery.
