    
      Phase 1a/1b multicenter dose-escalation study of ARC-521 Injection in normal healthy
      volunteers and patients with CHB. Eligible participants who have signed an Ethics Committee
      (EC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form and have met all of the
      protocol eligibility criteria.

      Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the study:
      medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate, and temperature), weight, adverse events assessment (AEs), concomitant
      medications/therapies assessment, electrocardiograms (ECGs), telemetry [NHVs only], measures
      of hepatic fibrosis [CHBs only], blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation,
      chemistry, Pharmacokinetics (PK) [NHVs only], metabolic analysis [NHVs only], exploratory
      Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures, urinalysis, hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology, immunogenicity,
      Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) testing (post-menopausal females) and pregnancy testing
      for females of childbearing potential. Clinically significant changes including AEs will be
      followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise
      explained, or until the patient is lost to follow-up. Prior to enrollment there is a 60 day
      screening period.
