      treatment of participants with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Niraparib is
      an orally available, highly selective poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase
      (PARP) inhibitor, with potent activity against PARP-1 and PARP-2 deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA)-repair polymerases. AA is a pro-drug of abiraterone and selectively inhibits the enzyme
      17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), which is found in the testes and adrenals, as well
      as in prostate tissues and tumors. In participants with metastatic prostate cancer,
      DNA-repair anomalies are identified in approximately 15 percent (%) to 20% of tumors. The
      study will consist of 4 phases: a prescreening phase for biomarker evaluation only, a
      screening phase, a treatment phase, and a follow up phase. During the prescreening phase
      participants will be evaluated for homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alteration
      status and then will be assigned to one of the 2 cohorts based on their biomarker status.
      Treatment will be administered daily and is planned to be continuous until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or the sponsor terminates the study. Efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics, biomarkers, participants reported outcomes and safety will be assessed. The
      total duration of study will be approximately 66 months.
