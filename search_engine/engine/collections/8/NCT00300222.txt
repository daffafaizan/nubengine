    
      This study is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, controlled multi-center evaluation of the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of NGX-4010 for the treatment of PHN. Eligible subjects
      will have pain from PHN, with average numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) scores during
      screening of 3 to 9 (inclusive). Painful areas of up to 1000 square centimeters will be
      treated during a single treatment administration in this study. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive active NGX-4010 patches or low-concentration control patches that are
      identical in appearance, according to a 1:1 allocation scheme.

      Subjects may be on stable chronic oral pain medication regimens, but currently will not be
      using any topical pain medications on the affected areas. NPRS scores for the average pain in
      the past 24 hours will be recorded daily in the evening, beginning on the day of the
      Screening Visit (usually on Day -14). Subjects will continue to record NPRS scores in a
      take-home diary from the evening on the day of treatment through the evening before the
      Termination Visit at Week 12. Subjects will return for interim follow-up visits at Weeks 4
      and 8 following study treatment.
