      neuropsychological testing and medical history to determine their status as normal, mild
      cognitive impairment, or dementia.

      The investigators will analyze the data to learn the correlations between eSAGE and gold
      standard neuropsychological testing designed to differentiate normal cognition from MCI and
      early dementia. The investigators will also find out whether the paper (SAGE) and electronic
      (eSAGE) versions of SAGE could be used interchangeably or not.
