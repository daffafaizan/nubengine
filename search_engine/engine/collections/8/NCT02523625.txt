        -  Project Purpose:

      The purpose of the project is to develop the technology to reliably acquire and analyse
      ultrasound images through the use of a training programme which are comparable to those from
      scanning by an expert sonographer in the diagnosis (i.e. as a diagnostic tool) and monitoring
      of patients with GCA following treatment (i.e. as a response indicator), and patient
      stratification according to initial or early scan changes to determine the most appropriate
      treatment (i.e. as a prognostic tool).

        -  End Point:

      The end point will be the production of an effective training programme which can be used to
      obtain reproducible accurate ultrasound images of the temporal artery which can be
      automatically analysed and used in real time in the management of patients with suspected or
      confirmed giant cell arteritis.

        -  Milestones:

      The project is in 3 phases. In phase 1 (0-12 months) the study group will create a bank of
      images for training from healthy volunteers and patients with GCA; in phase 2 (13-18 months)
      the study group will test the programme on sonographers assessing patients with GCA; in phase
      3 (19-42 months) the study group will acquire serial images, clinical data, serum and plasma
      from cohorts of patients with newly diagnosed and flaring GCA so that they can analyse and
      develop new software algorithms. The study group can use images already acquired from a
      previous diagnostic study in GCA, and test the algorithms on the new cohorts..
