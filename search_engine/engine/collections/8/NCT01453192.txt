      which increase rejection of renal graft incidence.

      In addition HIV infection may be modified together with cardiovascular risk. Patients
      participating to this study will receive after transplantation antiretroviral regimen
      including Raltegravir.

      Raltegravir treatment does not interact with immunosuppressive drugs and thus seems to be the
      treatment of choice to be associated with immunosuppressive drugs.
