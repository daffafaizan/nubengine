      flap using the static two-point discrimination (2PD) test and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament
      (SWM) examination. The test points were at the centers of the radial and ulnar portions of
      the finger pulp and the flap. Cold intolerance of the injured and donor fingers was assessed
      using the self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire. The maximum score
      was 100; scores were grouped as mild (0 to 25), moderate (26 to 50), severe (51 to 75), and
      extremely severe (76 to 100). Pain was given subjectively by the patient using a grading
      system that included grade 1, none; grade 2, mild, no interference with daily activities;
      grade 3, moderate, patient works but has some limitation in use of the hand because of pain;
      and grade 4, severe, cannot work or use hand. The Tinel sign on the donor and recipient sites
      was graded as follows: grade 1, none; grade 2, mild, slight tingle; grade 3, moderate, very
      uncomfortable; and grade 4, severe, patient unable to use hand because of any stimulation of
      the neuroma. Finally, patients reported their satisfaction with functional recovery of the
      injured finger according to the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire that was based on a
      5-point response scale. All tests were performed by an independent senior hand surgeon.
