      eligible population. Vaccine will be made available to infants from 6 months of age through
      children up to 10 years old. This includes an age group that is at high risk for severe
      outcomes (<5 years) and an age group (school-age children, 5-10) that is considered most
      likely to spread the infection.

      Ascertainment of Influenza Illness:

      Primary Outcome Measure

      â€¢ Laboratory-confirmed influenza infection

      Secondary outcome measures

        -  Medically attended ILI, SARI

        -  Community-reported ILI SARI

        -  Laboratory-confirmed influenza, medically attended ILI and SARI, and community-reported
           ILI and SARI in non-immunized household members

      In Lwak and Kibera, field workers visit households weekly and encourage residents to go to
      the free clinic if they have respiratory symptoms. Currently, from KEMRI/CDC surveillance
      data, in Kibera, approximately 57 % of people in the catchment area seek medical care for ILI
      (Range: 62% children - 52% adults) and of those people who seek care, 72% seek care at
      Tabitha clinic. In Lwak, approximately 77% of people in the catchment area seek medical care
      for ILI (Range: 75% children - 80% adults) and of those people who seek care, 34% seek care
      at Lwak clinic.

      The surveillance for ILI and SARI will continue as usual, with weekly field worker (also
      called community interviewer) household visits, clinic-based surveillance for ILI and SARI at
      Tabitha clinic and Lwak clinic, and sampling of all patients who meet the case definition for
      ILI and SARI
