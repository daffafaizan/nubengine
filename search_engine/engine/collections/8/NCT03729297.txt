    
      Rationale: Salivary gland cancer (SGC) is a rare cancer with 24 histological subtypes.
      Treatment options for locally advanced and/or metastatic SGC are limited. The tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor cabozantinib suppresses tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and has been
      approved for renal cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. Cabozantinib may also be of value in
      advanced SGC because c-MET, one of the targets of cabozantinib, is frequently overexpressed
      in SGC.

      Objectives: To assess the objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS),
      overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL) of
      patients with advanced SGC treated with cabozantinib in 3 cohorts: salivary duct carcinoma
      (SDC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), other SGC's.

      Study design: Single arm, single center, phase II clinical trial in 3 cohorts: ACC, SDC and
      other SGC's.

      Study population: Patient with c-MET positive, locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic
      SGC.

      Intervention: Cabozantinib tablets 60 mg once daily until progressive disease, intolerable
      toxicity, or investigator and/or patient decision to withdraw for a maximum duration of 2
      years.
