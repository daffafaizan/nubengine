      and will wear a transportable electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder at least 24 hours before,
      during and 24 hours after the BMW-Berlin Marathon. All participants will undergo brain MRI
      examinations to detect cerebral lesions within days before and after the marathon race,
      respectively. Moreover, serial blood samples will be taken a few days before, immediately
      after as well as a few days after the BMW-Berlin Marathon.
