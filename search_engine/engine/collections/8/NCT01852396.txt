      clavicle and advancing the needle with a 45-60 degree angle from cephalad to caudad. The aim
      is to advanced the block needle posterior to the axillary artery and to deposit the local
      anesthetic at that point, near the posterior cord. A "U" shaped spread around the artery
      should ensure distribution around all three cords. Ultrasound guidance is highly recommended
      and neurostimulation is optional.

      The retroclavicular approach is a variant to this classical technique. Ultrasound probe is
      positioned initially below the clavicle in a manner similar to the classic approach but is
      then rotated in a clockwise fashion (right arm) or counter-clockwise fashion (left arm) for
      about 25-35 degrees. The puncture site is just behind the clavicle at the most lateral point
      available. If initial entry point is optimal, needle direction is then parallel to ultrasound
      probe. The final aim and position of block needle is identical to classical approach. Entry
      point ensures a parallel alignment of the needle and the ultrasound beam, thus enabling
      almost perfect visualization of both artery, cords and block needle. This is turn optimizes
      safety, rapidity of technique, efficiency and efficacy.
