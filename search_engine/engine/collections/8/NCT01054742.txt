      non-interventional studies (i.e. observational studies). Medicinal products are prescribed in
      the usual manner in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorization. The assignment
      of the participant to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by the
      trial protocol but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine is
      clearly separated from the decision to include the patient in the study.
