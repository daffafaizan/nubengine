      but they do so by different mechanisms.

      The main cause of oral lichen planus is still unknown. Some authors advocate the disease
      appears to be a result of T-cell-mediated autoimmune responses in oral epithelial tissues.
      But, recent study suggests that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid
      peroxidation together with an imbalance in the antioxidant defense system may play a part in
      the generation of disease.

      Lycopene exerts its antioxidant activity by physical and chemical quenching of free radicals
      and decreases free radicals-initiated oxidative reactions, particularly lipid peroxidation
      and DNA oxidative damage, thereby preventing tissue damage.

      Prednisone have both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.It suppresses the
      inflammatory response by limiting the recruitment of inflammatory cells and inhibiting
      synthesis of pro-inflammatory products such as prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs) and
      platelet activating factors (PAF) by indirectly inhibiting phospholipase A2 and negative
      regulating cyclooxygenase (COX-2).
