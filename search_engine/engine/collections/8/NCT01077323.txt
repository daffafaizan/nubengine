      following limitations:

        -  Misclassification of acute pancreatitis may have distorted our estimates of absolute and
           relative IRs. In cases where the degree of misclassification is non-differential with
           respect to the exposure cohort, as is likely the case in administrative data, the RR
           would be biased toward the null value, although the magnitude of bias will depend on the
           amount of misclassification.

        -  Lack of information on important potential confounders, like obesity and alcohol use, is
           another limitation of the present analysis. Although we adjusted for propensity scores
           of exenatide initiation, which included a large number of factors derived from the
           claims data, it is likely that the present estimates are somewhat inaccurate due to
           residual confounding.

        -  Our definition of current use in the time-on-drug analysis, which extended 31 days past
           the nominal end of the last dispensing of the cohort-defining drug, may be too long in
           duration and thus misclassify exposure during the relevant etiologic period.

        -  Additionally, these analyses assume that when pharmacies submit a claim for a medication
           that patients receive and consume the medication. While it is possible that
           misclassification of exposure by non-adherence to the medications dispensed occurred,
           prior work showed that pharmacy claims are valid for ascertaining medication exposure.
