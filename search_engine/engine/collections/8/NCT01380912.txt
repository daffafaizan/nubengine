      puncture, which is a small operation, but many patients have to come several times, and there
      is a risk of infection. In some cases further treatment can be postponed.

      Preventing seroma to develop would be an improvement in the treatment of breast cancer
      patients operated with mastectomy.

      An earlier study found that the seroma production was significant lower in the group who had
      Prednison injected directly into the cavity.

      In this study the patient are divided into two groups: patients who have mastectomy and
      axillary dissection and patients who have mastectomy and Sentinel Node operation. Each group
      are examined separately.

      Using Prednison in patients after operation could be a potential risk, but correct injection
      into the cavity will seldom give systemic side effects.
