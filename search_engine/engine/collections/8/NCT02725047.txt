      and quality of life in individuals with knee osteoarthritis. This is a randomized controlled
      clinical trial, double-blinded. Will participate in the study 60 patients with knee
      osteoarthritis, diagnosed with clinical and radiographic criteria of the American College of
      Rheumatology, of both sexes, aged between 40 and 75 years. The total number of subjects will
      be divided randomly into two groups of 30 subjects each. During four consecutive days, for a
      period of 20 min, each group will receive one type of intervention around the knee with
      osteoarthritis: the cryotherapy group will receive an application of ice bags with
      compression and the placebo group will receive an application of sand bags with compression,
      the weight and volume of the sand bags will be similar to that used in cryotherapy. Every
      individual will have the following variables evaluated one day pre- and one day
      post-intervention: pressure pain threshold (Algometry), pain index (VAS), physical function
      questionnaires (WOMAC, KOOS) and physical activity (IPAQ). Two physical function tests will
      also be carried out: the 30s sitting and standing chair and the Timed Up and Go (TUG).
      Thermographic images will also be obtained for further temperature analysis of the knee with
      osteoarthritis. Moreover, after a period of 3 months, participants will perform a follow-up
      in which will be measured the VAS, WOMAC and KOOS questionnaires. Also, some Yes/No questions
      about the continued use of the therapy will be asked,
