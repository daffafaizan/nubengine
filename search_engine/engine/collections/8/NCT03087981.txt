      intracranial status in neurosurgery department especially in neurosurgical critical patients.
      Most of us focus only on the mean ICP value while ignoring other ICP derived parameters, such
      ICP waveform, AMP, RAP, PRx, IAAC and so on. However, it is reported that these parameters
      can reflect the status of intracerebral circulation, cerebrospinal compensatory reserve and
      brain compliance and can often be indicative of impending neurological deterioration and even
      outcome of patients. The PANDA trial is a multicenter prospective observational study
      designed to investigate the relationship between these ICP derived parameters and clinical
      status and to uncover the mechanism behind it. We will use a brand-new automatic big data
      collecting and storing system to continuously acquire patients' physiological information
      such as blood pressure, ICP, ETCO2ï¼ŒEEG etc. before analysis. Hopefully, this trial will
      reveal what is happening in the cranial cavity through the natural history of different kinds
      of intracranial lesion.
