      newly developed cells in the body of subjects with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (B-CLL) can be labeled and followed by performing routine blood draws at specified time
      intervals. By using mass spectrometric analysis we can measure how quickly new B-CLL cells
      are generated in the bone marrow and how quickly they leave the blood, a measure of cell
      turnover. This will help us to better understand the unique characteristics of this disease
      process.
