      efficacy and safety profile compared to GreenLight PVP in treating patients with urinary
      retention secondary to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) that have failed medical management.

      The target population is composed of subjects referred to the urology department for
      treatment of BPH who have failed medical treatment, who present with permanent bladder
      catheterization and who meet the eligibility criteria.

      Subjects who consent will be randomized to either the Prostate embolization (PAE) arm or to
      the GreenLight PVP arm.

      The primary endpoint of efficacy of the procedure is measured by the successful removal of
      bladder catheter and ability of the patient to void. As well, the secondary endpoints
      recorded will be: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), peak flow rate (Qmax) and
      post-void residual urine volume (PVP) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) will be measured at
      3, 6, and 12 months post treatment. Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) will be performed for
      measurement of prostate volume for the stratified randomization process. All adverse events
      will be captured and analyzed. MRI will be performed preoperatively, 3 months and 12 months.
      Hospital stays after the procedures will not be considered serious adverse events, unless a
      hospital admission occurs because of a complication of the treatment performed.
