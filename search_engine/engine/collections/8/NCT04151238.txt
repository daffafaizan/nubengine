    
      The duration of the exercise intervention is eight (8) weeks. There will be guided endurance
      and muscle power training two (2) time weekly. The participants will also be provided with
      one training program per week for use at home. Data on training at home and other items of
      physical activity is recorded in a diary. Before the intervention is started, an oncologist
      will examine the participants condition before brisk physical activity is started. Safety is
      an important consideration and a nurse will examine the patients before each bout of
      exercise. A nurse will be present during the entire time of the exercise. A physician is
      always available for consultations by phone.

      Before the intervention starts, baseline measurements will be made in the laboratories of
      physical exercise in the Tyks Hospital and the Turku University of Applied Sciences. At
      baseline, endurance, muscle power, balance and body composition will be evaluated and
      recorded. Endurance will be measured with a submaximal treadmill test. Muscle power will be
      assessed by a dynamic elevation test, hand pressure test, the lower extremities by repeated
      squatting-standing and by rising to stand on the toes. Balance is measured in the specific
      sway platform (one leg and both legs standing). The patients will be asked to fill
      questionnaires on quality of life (QLQ-c30) and fatigue (FACIT-F) before and after the
      intervention. The patients will fill in their exercise diaries from the very moment their
      participation has been decided until the end of the intervention. After exercise intervention
      the patients also fill the feedback-questionnaire.
