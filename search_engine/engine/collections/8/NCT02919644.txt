    
      Vaccination with autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumour homogenate after
      curative resection for stage IV colorectal cancer: a phase II study.

      Primary objectives: Safety Immunological efficacy, expressed as number of patients who show
      enhancement of the proportion of circulating immune effectors specific for a selected panel
      of Colon-Rectal Cancer (CRC)-associated antigens.

      Secondary objectives: Clinical outcome of the patients (OS, RFS, TTR). To evaluate the
      predictive role of the development of a positive DTH test after at least three vaccine
      administrations.

      To evaluate the persistence of an antitumor immune response after the completion of the
      vaccination program.

      To evaluate the prognostic or predictive role of the enhancement of a specific immune
      response.

      To evaluate a panel of inflammatory cytokines involved in antitumor immune response.

      To evaluate the predictive role of immune cells in tumour microenvironment. To evaluate the
      predictive role of tumour antigen expression.

      This is a two-stage, phase 2 clinical trial designed according to Simon minimax design. A 40%
      immune response rate would preclude further studies, while a 70% immune response rate would
      indicate that further studies would be warranted. Given α and β error of 0.1, the first stage
      will require enrolment of 7 patients. If at least 3 patients show an immune response and
      toxicity is acceptable, the study will proceed to the second stage and additional 12 patients
      will be enrolled.

      The vaccine will be considered immunologically active if at least 11 patients are
      immunological responders.
