    
      This study is an open-label, baseline-controlled, single-center study to measure the change
      in skin elasticity after combined radio frequency (RF) and pulsed electromagnetic field
      (PEMF) treatment. Forty-five adult females will undergo weekly treatments over a period of 8
      weeks. Skin elasticity will be measured by a CutometerÂ® prior to beginning treatment, week 7
      and 3 months after completion of treatment. Photographs will be taken prior to treatment, at
      week 4, week 7 and 3 months after completion of treatment. Patient discomfort/pain and
      satisfaction questionnaires will be completed before, during and after treatment.
