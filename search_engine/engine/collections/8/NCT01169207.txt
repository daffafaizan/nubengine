    
      We initiated this research study in 1996 with the overall goal of identifying IBD
      susceptibility genes. In the beginning, our major focus was recruitment of multiply affected
      IBD pedigrees for linkage studies, but we have since expanded our study to include singleton
      cases and spousal/friend as well as population controls for comparison purposes Our
      recruitment goal is 2500 subjects.

      Blood samples obtained from participants are used to isolate lymphocytes for storage, serum
      for serological analysis of antibodies and other proteins relevant to IBD and DNA for
      genotyping or sequencing. Lymphocytes may be transformed with EBV to establish immortalized
      lymphoblastoid cell lines. These cell lines can be used as a secondary DNA source or to study
      IBD relevant gene, protein expression and cell function
