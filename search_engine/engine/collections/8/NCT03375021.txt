      of adults with ADHD. The study was a double-blind, 2-period crossover study that compared 2
      different doses of CX717 with placebo. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 different treatment
      sequences: placebo - low dose; low dose - placebo; placebo - high dose; or high dose -
      placebo. Each treatment period was 3 weeks with a 2-week washout between treatment periods.
      The doses chosen were 200 mg b.i.d. and 800 mg b.i.d.
