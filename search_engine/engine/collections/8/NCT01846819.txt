    
      100 ambulatory patients with cirrhosis will be prospectively evaluated for severity of liver
      disease, anemia, and fatigue; exclusion criteria includes chronic renal insufficiency and
      recent alcohol use, gastrointestinal bleeding, and infection.

      Patients will first be identified and be asked to partake in the study. They will be asked to
      read over an informed consent form. Subsequently, they will be asked to fill out a depression
      questionnaire before performing the 6MWT. During the 6MWT the patient will be walking up and
      down two designated points 100 feet apart. They will be asked to walk for 6 minutes using any
      walking aids and resting as needed. Their final distance will be recorded. They will then be
      asked to fill out the FIS fatigue questionnaire.

      Severity of liver disease will be assessed through a detailed clinical examination of ascites
      grade, hepatic encephalopathy, history of complications from cirrhosis (hepatic coma,
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding), standard liver tests (TBili,
      Albumin, INA), platelet count as a parameter of splenic sequestration and portal
      hypertension, Child-Pugh score, MELD (Model of End-stage Liver Disease) score. Anemia will be
      assessed with hemoglobin levels. Depression will be assessed with the following
      questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), EQ-5D, Psychological General Well-Being
      Index (PGWBI), LDQOL. Fatigue will be assessed with the FIS and 6 Minute Walk Test. Hepatic
      Encephalopathy will be assessed with the number connection, digit-symbol coding and
      inhibitory control test. Sexual function will be assessed by the Sexual Problems and Sexual
      Function scales of the LDQOL. The results will be scored and compared to depression quality
      of life, and end-stage liver disease factors.
