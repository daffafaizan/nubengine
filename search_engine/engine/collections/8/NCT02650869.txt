      gastrointestinal tract in preterm very low birth weight infants and associated with increased
      morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic enteral probiotic supplementation may play a role in
      reducing NEC and potentially provide benefits to preterm very low birth weight neonates. The
      objective was to evaluate the efficacy of orally administered probiotics in preventing
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.

      This prospective, randomized double blind controlled trial is undergoing in 102 preterm
      (28-33 weeks gestation) VLBW (birth weight 1000-1499g) neonates fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria. The study group was fed with probiotics once daily with breast milk from first
      feeding and the control group only breast milk without the addition of probiotics. The
      primary outcome was the development of NEC (stage II and III). NEC is categorized by modified
      Bell's classification.

      Probiotic supplementation reduces the frequency of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm
      neonates with very low birth weight. It is also associated with faster achievement of full
      enteral feeding and shorter duration of hospital stay.
