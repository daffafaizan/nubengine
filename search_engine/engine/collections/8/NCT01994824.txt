    
      Blood for IL15 and IL2Ra determination will be drawn in the morning of day 7 (10 ml red top
      tube). IL15 and IL2Ra levels will be measured in Storek/Khan Lab by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described (Pratt LM et al: BMT 2013). Storek/Khan Lab staff
      will report the IL15 and IL2Ra levels to the Bone Marrow Transplant ward (Unit 57, Foothills
      Medical Centre) no later than in the morning of day 8. If the IL15 level is <31 ng/L or the
      IL2Ra level is >4500 ng/L, the physician caring for the patient on the ward will order
      Thymoglobulin, 3 mg/kg intravenously, to be infused over 4-8 hours on day 8. The dose is
      based on actual body weight, and is rounded to the nearest vial (Thymoglobulin is supplied in
      25 mg vials) except if the rounding would result in >5% difference from the calculated dose.
      Unit 57 standard practice will be followed for the infusion of ATG (see Standard Operation
      Procedure BMTS40153 ["ATG Administration"]). Premedication for ATG will include
      methylprednisolone 40 mg IVPB, acetaminophen 1000 mg PO and diphenhydramine 50 mg IVPB.
      Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO and diphenhydramine 50 mg IVPB can be repeated in 4-6 hours PRN
      flu-like symptoms/fever/chills. Meperidine 25-50 mg IVPB every 4 hours will be given PRN for
      rigors.

      EVALUATIONS For the endpoint of the incidence of significant GVHD, patients will be followed
      per standard practice of the Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant Program for the development
      of acute and chronic GVHD
      (www.albertahealthservices.ca/hp/if-hp-cancer-guide-bmt-manual.pdf). Per this standard
      practice, acute GVHD is graded according to Consensus criteria (Przepiorka D: BMT 1995) and
      chronic GVHD is diagnosed and graded according to NIH criteria (Filipovich AH: BBMT 2005).
      Significant GVHD is defined as grade 2-4 acute GVHD or chronic GVHD needing systemic
      immunosuppressive therapy.

      For the endpoint of survival free of significant GVHD and relapse, relapse will be defined by
      standard criteria (eg, >5% marrow blasts by morphology in case of acute leukemia).

      For the endpoint of quality of life at 2 years (21-27 months) posttransplant, Short Form 36
      will be used.
