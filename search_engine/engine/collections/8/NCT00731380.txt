      diagnosed in Canadians. In the year 2007, there was an estimated 4,350 new cases diagnosed in
      Canada, with approximately 1,600 deaths attributable to HNSCC[Canadian Cancer Statistics
      2007]. In the United States there is an annual incidence of approximately 40,000 newly
      diagnosed cases of head and neck cancer [US Cancer Statistics 2006]. Primary treatment for
      newly diagnosed localized (stage I-II) HNSCC is surgery and/or radiotherapy. The majority of
      patients (70%) however present with locally advanced HNSCC (Stage III or IV). Treatment of
      locally advanced HNSCC generally consists of either concurrent chemotherapy and radiation or
      surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation or adjuvant concurrent chemotherapy and
      radiation. Unfortunately despite aggressive treatment with combined modality therapies
      approximately 40-50% of cases recur, with the majority recurring at the primary site and/or
      regional nodes. Except for a small minority of patients in whom salvage surgery or
      radiotherapy can be delivered, the prognosis for the majority of these patients is poor and
      further treatment is generally considered palliative.
