      treatment of scoliosis, for this reason, several questionnaires (e.g. SRS-24 and SRS-22) have
      been developed. SRS-22 has been reported as the most commonly used scale to measure HRQOL in
      patient with scoliosis in many countries. However, current literature showed that SRS-22 has
      poor measurement properties, it does not satisfy fundamental measure requirements, i.e.
      additivity, generalizability and unidimensionality. According to Rasch analysis study SRS-24
      and SRS-22 presents high ceiling effects in conservative care, for the reason that was
      developed for surgical candidates. The Italian Spine Youth Quality of Life (ISYQOL)
      questionnaire originally in Italian, is the first HRQOL questionnaire developed according to
      the Rasch analysis. It was developed in a conservative treatment setting for all type of
      spinal deformities, including also patients with surgical curves. The ISYQOL has recently
      been translated into English, however, its adaptation to the Turkish language is necessary
      for use in the Turkish population. The psychometric properties of any scale may be affected
      by translation into another language, that's why it is important for the scale to be
      evaluated psychometrically. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to translate the ISYQOL
      questionnaire to Turkish and to assess the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of
      the ISYQOL in terms of test-retest reliability, internal consistency and construct validity
      when used on patients with idiopathic scoliosis. Adolescent girls with idiopathic scoliosis
      who applied to Formed Scoliosis Treatment and Brace Center between September 2018 to 2020 are
      inviting in this stud by mailing
