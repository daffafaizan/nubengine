    
      Penicillin allergy is the most common of self-reported drug allergies and un-verified
      penicillin allergy is a significant and growing public health problem. 10% of all patients
      report penicillin allergy. However, there is large discrepancy between reported penicillin
      allergy and true allergy. Despite its high prevalence, greater than 90% of such patients are
      in fact able to tolerate the medication without allergic reactions.

      In this study patients having a penicillin allergy label will be investigated to confirm or
      to exclude the allergy diagnosis. The diagnostic value of the allergen test panel and the
      allergologic work-up will be evaluated. Clinical parameters as well as immunological will be
      assessed.
