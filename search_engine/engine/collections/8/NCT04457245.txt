      I. To compare the outcome of patients with unfavorable intermediate (IR) and high-risk (HR)
      prostate cancer (PCa) after standard dRT versus prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
      positron emission tomography (PET)-based dRT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. In both arms, no other primary treatment
      should be given before RT.

      Arm I: Patients do not undergo PSMA PET for dRT planning. Patients undergo standard of care
      dRT at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.

      Arm II: Patients undergo PSMA PET for dRT planning. Patients then undergo dRT at the
      discretion of the treating radiation oncologist, who receives the PSMA PET result and images.

      After completion of dRT, clinical follow-up of patients with their treating radiation
      oncologist will be obtained for 5 years. The investigators will rely on the medical records
      obtained from the treating physicians as the primary source of outcome data.
