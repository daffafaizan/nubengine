      (TDC) measured prior to the biopsy. Similar TDC measurements will be made at a standard
      breast site on the biopsied breast and on mirrored sites on the non-affected breast. Values
      obtained at the biopsy site will be compared against the outcome of the biopsy analysis:
      benign vs. malignant. In addition the measurements obtained at the standardized site for all
      breasts will be used to establish a set of reference values to characterize breast TDC
      values. In addition, inter-breast differentials will be used to characterize these ranges for
      future studies and clinical assessments.
