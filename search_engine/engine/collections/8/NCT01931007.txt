      for this pilot study. Baseline data includes radiographs, MRI imaging, clinical data on knee
      pain and analysis of synovial fluid inflammatory markers. Bone marrow will be aspirated from
      the patient's iliac crests and the cellular rich portion will be concentrated. Randomly, one
      knee will be injected with the bone marrow concentrate. The contralateral knee will be
      injected with only sterile saline for placebo. Follow-up analysis of synovial fluid will be
      at one week and 6 months after injection; clinical data will be obtained at 3, 6 and 12
      months and MRI imaging will be performed at 6 months after injection, with repeat radiographs
      at 12 months
