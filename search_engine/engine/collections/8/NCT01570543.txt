      continuous development in order to improve the quality of images, speed of acquisition, and
      usability of MR devices applied to image subjects with metallic orthopedic implants.
      Collection of in vivo human data throughout the product development and maintenance lifecycle
      plays an important role in enabling the technology to be investigated, optimized, and
      validated.

      This is a pre-market investigation involving commercially available devices, investigational
      devices, and commercial devices modified with investigational components. The Study will be
      conducted for three years, over which time a number of endpoints will be collected for
      various devices under development.
