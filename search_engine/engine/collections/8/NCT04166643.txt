    
      This is a cluster randomized control trial (n=164) delivered in four long-term care
      worksites. Aim 1 is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the Worksite Heart Health
      Improvement Project-PLUS (WHHIP-PLUS) on workers' composite Life's Simple 7 scores.
      Hypothesis: workers exposed to the WHHIP-PLUS will report improved adherence to heart healthy
      behaviors and a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors measured by a composite
      Life's Simple 7 score at 6 months and 12 months compared to those exposed to education-only
      control. Aim 2 is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the WHHIP-PLUS on workers' stress
      levels. Hypothesis: workers exposed to the WHHIP-PLUS will report decreased stress as
      measured by stress scales at the same 2 time-points compared to those exposed to
      education-only control. Aim 3 is to evaluate the feasibility of integrating the WHHIP-PLUS
      with long-term care workers over time. Feasibility will be based on evidence of delivery,
      receipt, and enactment of the intervention.
