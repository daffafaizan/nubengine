      computer-assisted version of CBT, alone and in combination, to improve treatment outcome and
      cognitive functioning among cocaine users. The proposed study will be the first to evaluate a
      cognitive enhancing medication as a means of enhancing the effects of an extremely promising
      empirically validated behavioral therapy for addiction, and hence bridge cognitive
      neuroscience and behavioral therapies development.

      The aim is to conduct a 12 week randomized placebo controlled trial, using a 2x2 factorial
      model, that will evaluate the efficacy of adding computer assisted training in CBT
      ("CBT4CBT") and galantamine to standard treatment for 160 cocaine abusing or dependent
      methadone-maintained individuals. Participants will be randomized to (1) standard treatment
      (TAU) plus placebo, (2) TAU plus galantamine, (3) TAU plus CBT4CBT plus placebo, or (4) TAU
      plus CBT4CBT plus galantamine.
