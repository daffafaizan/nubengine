      and drug target may affect the efficacy of Methotrexate in vivo.To investigate the influence
      of genetic factors on the curative effect , to find the relationships between genetic
      variants and the response of Methotrexate to treatment of Psoriasis Vulgaris.Investigators
      analyzed the various levels of genetic factors, including: 1.To analysis the key gene
      variants which associated with ADME(absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)
      affect the efficacy of Methotrexate; 2.Direct full genetic sequencing of MHC genes, to
      explore the genetic variations of efficacy and side effects; 3. Direct sequencing of all
      exons in the gene in the patients of the response of serious and effectively, to explores the
      rare genetic variation may cause deterioration of treatment by Methotrexate.
