      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      lirilumab in combination with 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) in patients with
      refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (Part A, Lead-In Phase) II. To determine
      the overall response rate (ORR) of lirilumab in combination with 5-azacytidine in patients
      with refractory/relapsed AML. (Part B, Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival
      (OS) of patients with refractory/relapsed AML treated with this combination.

      II. To determine the safety of lirilumab in combination with 5-azacytidine in patients with
      refractory/relapsed AML.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 1 hour as
      determined by the treating physician on days 1-7 and lirilumab IV over 60 minutes on day 8.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and up to 90 days.
