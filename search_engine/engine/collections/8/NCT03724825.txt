      Adropin is a new metabolic hormone that was first isolated in liver and brain tissues, It was
      observed that mice fed on a high-fat diet (HFD) had a rapid increase in adropin expression
      compared to control values. In human also, adropin levels were negatively correlated with
      body mass index (BMI) and were associated with dyslipidemia.

      Adiponectin is a protein that is mainly produced by white adipose tissue and has an important
      role in lipid metabolism. Serum adiponectin concentrations were decreased in obese compared
