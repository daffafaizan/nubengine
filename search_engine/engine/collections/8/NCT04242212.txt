      safe and effective. Investigators aim to assess whether self-use of early (<9 weeks)
      medication abortion using a misoprostol-only regimen results in non-inferior rates of
      clinical outcomes when compared with clinic-based provision of medication abortion.

      The investigators will prospectively recruit women who obtain misoprostol from patent
      medicine vendors and clinics. Follow-up will occur by telephone during three phone calls
      within 45 days of the first dose of misoprostol.
