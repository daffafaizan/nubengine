      limbs for people with neuromuscular disorders. Few studies have investigated the training
      effects on muscle strength and functional performances of upper limbs for elderly
      adults。Therefore, appropriate training devices and exercise programs to facilitate the muscle
      strength and functional performances of upper limbs in elderly people would be needed for
      clinical therapists. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a vibration training
      device and investigate the training effects on muscle strength and functional performances of
      upper limbs in elderly people. This study will recruit 44 elderly adults, evaluating the
      muscle strength and functional performances of upper limbs before and after interventions.
      All subjects will be randomized assign to experimental and control groups; the experimental
      group will perform 30mins/ section, three times weekly for 8 weeks vibration training, and
      the control group will receive regular exercise training at same time. Two-way ANOVA with
      repeated measure will be applied to analyze the training effects and difference in the muscle
      strength and functional performances of upper limbs between two groups. SPSS version 18.0
      statistical software will be used. The α level for statistical significance is set at 0.05.
