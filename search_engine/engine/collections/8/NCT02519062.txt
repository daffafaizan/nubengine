    
      This is a retrospective observation that involves the revision of clinical, instrumental and
      pathologic data of an estimated cohort of 130 patients with NSCLC treated with surgery with
      radical intent at our center.

      We will review FDG-PET acquired within 30 days prior to surgery and analyze its principal
      imaging characteristics with respect to hypoxic and immune-related markers at
      immunohistochemistry (IHC). These markers will be studied on tumor tissue obtained at
      surgery, used for diagnostic purposes and stored in paraffin.
