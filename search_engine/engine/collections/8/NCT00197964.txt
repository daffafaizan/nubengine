      improve quality of life and decrease urgent resource utilization in adult asthma patients
      followed in a primary care practice. Specifically, the intervention involves a two-component
      self-directed self-management workbook. The first component focuses on increasing knowledge
      by providing patients with factual information about asthma and self-management. The second
      component focuses on asthma self-efficacy using case vignettes and making a contract to adopt
      a behavior to improve asthma. Asthma-related social support is achieved through interval
      telephone contact.
