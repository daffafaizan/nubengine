    
      Primary objective:

      - Determine the percentage of patients with at least a 20% improvement over the baseline
      visit of the NAPPA-PBI scale in weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine the percentage of improvement with respect to the baseline visit of the NAPPA
           QoL and CLIN scale in weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52

        -  Determine the percentage of patients, regarding baseline visit, who reach a NAPSI 50 and
           changes in the NAPSI scale, in weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52

        -  Determine the percentage of improvement or change of the nail ultrasound variables with
           respect to the baseline visit in weeks 4, 16, 24, 38 and 52

        -  Explore the possible correlation between clinical (NAPSI / NAPPA-Clin) and ultrasound
           variables before and after treatment

        -  Determine the percentage of patients with sonographic signs of enthesopathy of the
           distal interphalangeal joint before and after treatment

        -  Determine differences in clinical and sonographic parameters before treatment in good
           responders (NAPSI 50) compared to non-responders
