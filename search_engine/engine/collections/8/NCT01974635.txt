      this study, we are testing 2 additional diagnostic tests (i.e., Joint Position Test and
      "Frisbee" Test), both of proprioception, in order to determine which of the two is the best
      test of proprioception. Our hypotheses are: (1) both sensation and movement recover with AMES
      treatment, (2) sensory recovery precedes that of movement, (3) robotic delivery of the Joint
      Position Test produces more reliable test results than does manual delivery of this test, and
      (4) the Frisbee Test results will parallel those of the Joint Position Test.
