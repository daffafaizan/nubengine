      pulmonary function laboratories to assess gas exchange from the lung to hemoglobin in the
      pulmonary circulation. This test is used in the differential diagnosis of respiratory related
      symptoms, to grade the degree of severity in lung disease, and to objectively monitor the
      progression of disease or the response to therapies. Therefore, it is important to have
      standard methods of performing and interpreting this test.This is a prospective study,
      collecting data from subjects at different simulated altitudes. The study hypothesis is that
      increasing altitude will increase the DLCOsb in a predictable manner that will allow for
      mathematical corrections to be applied for uniform interpretation in pulmonary labs at
      differing altitudes.
