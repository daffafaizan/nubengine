      environments, the investigators plan to use two tasks: (1) a variant of the RISKGARP task, a
      well-established risky decision-making task and (2) a modified Becker-DeGroot-Marshak task
      that measures choice preference and the width of preference representations with the range of
      willingness to pay procedure (range-WTP). Note that wider representations should result in
      more choice randomness. The investigators will assess choice randomness also by repeating the
      same decision questions several times within each task and by relating the preferences
      measured by the RISKGARP task to those measured by the range-BDM task by using the same
      options in both tasks. To assess the impact of changing environments and learning on choice
      preference and randomness, participants will perform two established exploration/exploitation
      tasks. One (3) is a foraging task that has been combined with different pharmacological
      manipulations and the other (4) is a variant of the four-armed bandit task, which allows
      distinguishing value- or information-based exploration from random choice. Blood and saliva
      samples may be taken. Blood samples may be used to determine levels of the administrated
      substances and to assess genetic variation. Saliva samples may be used to determine cortisol
      and testosterone levels.
