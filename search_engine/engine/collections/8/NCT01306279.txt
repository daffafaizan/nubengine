    
      We will sequentially recruit patients attending our CF centre with an infective exacerbation
      of CF, who are chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

      We will record spirometry, blood markers of inflammation, quality of life questionnaires and
      investigate sputum samples for:

        1. Routine microbiology

        2. Bacterial diversity using 16s RNA identification techniques

        3. Relative abundance of P.aeruginosa hypermutators

        4. Levels of quorum sensing molecules

      These observations will be undertaken before commencing intravenous antibiotic therapy, on
      days 7, 10 and the last day of antibiotic therapy. Patients will also be reviewed one month
      after the end of antibiotic therapy where spirometry and a sputum sample will be collected
      for the above investigations.
