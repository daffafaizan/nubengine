      supplement of docosahexanoic and eicosapentanoic acids or a supplement of a similar dose of
      corn oil during 12 weeks, will be assessed on the following parameters:

        1. Urine albumin excretion

        2. Renal function measured with serum creatinine, cystatin C and beta-2 microglobulin

        3. Carotid intima media thickness and pulse wave velocity

        4. Inflammation status assessed measuring serum levels of C reactive protein and
           interleukin 6

        5. Metabolic control of diabetes

        6. Serum lipid levels
