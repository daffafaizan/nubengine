      memory, attention span, mood and more complex brain functioning such as planning and
      organizing. There are currently no drugs available to reduce the brain damage or the
      persisting symptoms that result from TBI. The longer term goal of this study is to provide
      physicians with a safe and effective treatment for TBI
