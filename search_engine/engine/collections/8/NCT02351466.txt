      sedation, as well as a functional MRI and neurocognitive testing. The children with T1D will
      wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), will follow up every 3 months and will be asked to
      wear the CGM each time. The structural and functional MRI and neurocognitive testing will be
      repeated 2 yrs from baseline.

      The healthy controls will also undergo MRI and cognitive testing as well as have a blood
      sample at baseline and after 2 years.

      Parents of newly recruited subjects will also have abbreviated IQ testing.
