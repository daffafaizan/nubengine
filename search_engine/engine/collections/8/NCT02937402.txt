      I. To discover predictive immune biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitor
      therapy in individuals with primary lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine biomarkers that may be predictive of treatment related adverse events,
      specifically pneumonitis.

      II. To further elucidate lung immunologic microenvironment by performing single cell analysis
      in addition to mass cytometry (Cytof) on cells of bronchoalveolar lavage.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage over 45 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.
