      population ages, the prevalence of hypertension will continue to increase if broad and
      effective preventive measures are not implemented. According to the World Health
      Organization, hypertension is the most common attributable cause of preventable death in
      developed nations, as uncontrolled hypertension greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular
      disease, cerebrovascular disease, and renal failure. Despite the availability of
      antihypertensive treatments, hypertension remains inadequately controlled; only about
      one-third of patients continue to maintain control successfully.

      Takeda Global Research and Development is developing TAK-491 (azilsartan medoxomil) for the
      treatment of essential hypertension. This study is being conducted to demonstrate the
      long-term safety and tolerability of azilsartan medoxomil in individuals with essential
      hypertension.

      Study participation is anticipated to be approximately 1 year and 1.5 months, and
      participants will be required to return to the clinic for 10 study visits.
