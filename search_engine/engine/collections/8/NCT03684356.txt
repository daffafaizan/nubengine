    
      to compare the efficacy of the socket shield technique in counteracting the dimensional
      changes of the soft and hard peri-implant tissues to filliing the buccal gap with xenograft.

        -  Population (P): Patients with single non-restorable tooth in the esthetic zone.

        -  Intervention (I): Immediate implant placement with socket shield technique.

        -  Comparator (C): Immediate implant placement and filling the buccal gap with xenograft.

        -  Primary Outcome (O): Pink Esthetic Score (PES) (FÃ¼rhauser et al., 2005).

        -  Time frame: 9 months (Chu et al., 2015).

        -  Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial.
