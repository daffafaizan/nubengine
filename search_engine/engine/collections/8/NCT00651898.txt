      receive the circulating water mattress and be covered by a forced air warming device for both
      the upper body and lower body

      Once the patient is moved to the operating room table, the surface of the back will begin to
      be warmed using either the circulating-water garment for those in Group A or the
      circulating-water mattress for those in Group B. Following the start of anesthesia,
      additional warming will be done by covering the large parts of the legs and the upper and
      side of the chest using either the circulating-water garment for those in Group A or upper-
      and lower-body forced-air warmers for those in Group B.

      Patient involvement will last until the warming devices are removed prior to departure from
      the operating room. There is no follow-up to this study.
