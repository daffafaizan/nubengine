      from a group-based manual-driven intervention to a computerized app, conduct alpha phase
      post-development bug testing, conduct beta phase usability pilot testing, and refine the app
      according to alpha- and beta-phase testing. Four focus groups will provide input on the
      development of the Getting Off app (further input will be obtained through an ongoing
      Consumer Advisory Board and usability pilot testing) with: 1) out-of-treatment,
      methamphetamine-using MSM (n=~8); 2) methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM)
      who are currently in outpatient treatment in the brick-and-mortar Getting Off program at the
      study site (n=~8); 3) prior methamphetamine-using MSM with a minimum of one year recovery who
      have completed a minimum 18/24 sessions (75%) of the brick-and-mortar Getting Off program;
      and, 4) prior methamphetamine-using MSM with a minimum of one year recovery who have had no
      previous experience or knowledge of the Getting Off intervention (n=~8). The focus groups
      will be structured to provide guidance on translating Getting Off into an app that is
      responsive to culture (e.g., sexuality; HIV prevention/care including pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake, adherence and persistence, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence,
      viral load suppression) and methamphetamine treatment needs.

      Following app development, and to ensure benchmarks have been met, alpha phase testing will
      uncover and remove unwanted bugs, and beta phase usability pilot testing will be conducted
      with members of the target population (N=30) to test the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary effects of the Getting Off app. Furthermore, the pilot testing will be utilized
      to ensure the functionality of the app (i.e., that the app is user-friendly and all features
      function appropriately).

      Behavioral assessments will be conducted at baseline and at 1-month follow-up.

      The study team will then conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate reductions
      of methamphetamine use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, and increased advancement along the HIV
      Prevention or Care Continuum, using three approaches: a) two-arm RCT to determine
      intervention effects through comparison of the immediate delivery (ID; n=150) and delayed
      delivery (DD; n=150) arms; b) an observed treatment effects analysis powered for prospective
      sub-group to compare longitudinal pre/post data from the pooled ID and DD arms (N=300); and,
      c) a two-arm historical matched comparison design to evaluate the outcomes of the Getting Off
      app (ID+DD; N=300) relative to a matched sample of participants having previously attended
      the brick-and-mortar group-based Getting Off intervention (N~600; total N=900).

      Following screening, informed consent and baseline assessments, participants will be
      randomized into one of two arms: Arm A: Immediate access to the Getting Off app (ID); or, Arm
      B: Participants will have access to the Getting Off app after a delayed 30-day period (DD).
      Participants in both arms will receive the same Getting Off app and participants in both arms
      will be given 30-days to engage with the app. The randomized two-arm repeated measures design
      will assess participants at 1-, 2- (DD arm only), 3-, 6-, and 9-months post-randomization to
      determine longitudinal intervention effects, observed treatment effects, and a historical
      comparison with a matched sample of participants who have attended the brick-and-mortar
      group-based Getting Off intervention.
