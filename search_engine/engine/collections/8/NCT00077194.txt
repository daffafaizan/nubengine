      I. Determine the response rate (complete and partial) in patients with relapsed or refractory
      Burkitt's, mantle cell or diffuse large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with FR901228
      (depsipeptide).

      II. Determine the safety and feasibility of this drug, in terms of incidence and maximum
      grade of toxicity and courses delayed or doses reduced, in these patients.

      III. Determine the 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated
      with this drug.

      IV. Correlate tumor expression of BCL-2, BCL-6, BAX, and RAS with response in patients
      treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months until
      5 years from study registration.
