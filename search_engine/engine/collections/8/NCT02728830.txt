      endometrial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, and account for >70,000 new
      diagnoses and >22,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. Treatment typically
      consists of a thorough cytoreductive and staging surgery in combination with platinum/taxane
      chemotherapy. Newer approaches adding anti-angiogenic therapies to chemotherapy have resulted
      in moderate improvements in recurrence free survival. However, despite these aggressive
      treatments, the majority of women with advanced stage at diagnosis will experience relapse.
      Unfortunately, relapsed disease is incurable and women ultimately die of their disease
      despite maximal efforts at cancer control using subsequent chemotherapy or targeted agents.
      There has been significant interest in incorporating immune checkpoint therapies in the
      treatment of gynecologic malignancies, especially given the durable remissions associated
      with these therapies in the treatment of melanoma and early indications of durable responses
      in recurrent ovarian cancer. At this time, little is known about whether or how to combine
      chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic therapies, and immunologic therapies for maximal benefit.
      Understanding the tumor microenvironment, particularly immune and angiogenic factors that
      contribute to tumor survival, as well as the changes that occur in response to immunotherapy
      is critical to identify favorable biomarker profiles which could lead to improved prognostic
      outcomes and inform the development and sequencing of therapies to maximize benefit.
