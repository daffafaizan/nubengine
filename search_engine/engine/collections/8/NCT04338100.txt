      confirmed COVID-19 are checked for inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and asked for study
      participation.

      Including patients have point-of-care lung ultrasonography (POCUS) performed within 48 hours
      following ED admission. The severity of lung damage is assessed using the lung
      ultrasonography score on 36 points for ARDS (POCUS score).

      Apart POCUS score assessment, patients are managed as usual.

      If a chest CT scan is performed, its result is collected and, in particular, the
      quantification of the extent of pulmonary lesions in percentage from 0 to 100%, carried out
      according to the recommendations of the French Society of Radiology.

      For hospitalized patients, if possible, a second chest ultrasonography is performed on Day 5
      +/- 3. The extent of lung damage is assessed by the POCUS score.

      A follow-up is carried out on day 14 (D14) and the patient's status according to the "Ordinal
      Scale for Clinical Improvement" for COVID-19 from WHO is recorded.
