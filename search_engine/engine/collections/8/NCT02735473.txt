      of choline bitartrate in children ages 2-5 who have been diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol
      Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Pre-clinical data suggests that choline may attenuate the
      cognitive deficits caused by prenatal alcohol exposure (especially memory deficits). This
      study will evaluate the effects of daily choline supplementation vs. placebo for 9 months.
      Outcome measures include an elicited imitation memory paradigm, global cognitive functioning,
      and aspects of executive functioning. The study will also continue to collect safety and
      tolerability data.
