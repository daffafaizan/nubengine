      problems are not detected. Despite recommendations and high rates of acceptance by providers
      and women, only a minority of providers conduct psychosocial assessments as part of routine
      prenatal care. Computer-based 'screening' is an acceptable and feasible approach to
      assessment of sensitive issues including prenatal and postnatal intimate partner violence,
      mental health problems, and postpartum depression by patients and providers. It is
      well-suited for busy clinical settings and is advantageous in that it offers a consistent
      approach to assessment, is resource-sparing, can be tailored to meet the specific needs of
      patients, can be used with audio/video for low literacy, provides a real-time summary for
      patients/providers,achieves similar or higher rates of disclosure of violence and mental
      health problems, and is preferred by patients because they perceive it as more anonymous
      compared to interviews or questionnaires.

      However, psychosocial assessment on its own is ineffective in preventing or treating mood
      disorders and unethical in the absence of treatment options. As such, many providers do not
      assess pregnant women for mood disorders because non-pharmacological treatments are
      frequently unavailable and pregnant women prefer them. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is
      a highly effective, non-pharmacological treatment for depression and anxiety and is
      recommended by perinatal national Australian guidelines as a potentially effective EARLY
      intervention for reducing the risk of maternal-child outcomes.
