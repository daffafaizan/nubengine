      Refreshing Recess program designed to build capacity of recess supervisors to create a
      positive mealtime environment so that all students can successfully participate in and enjoy
      recess and socialization with peers. Occupational therapy practitioners provide weekly
      information and coaching to recess supervisors and embed weekly activities into the recess
      experience (e.g. team building games, strategies for including students with disabilities,
      etc.).
