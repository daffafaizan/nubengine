    
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study of KHK2823 in adult
      patients with previously untreated AML who are not candidates for intensive remission
      induction therapy; relapsed/refractory AML for whom no other standard therapy is available or
      appropriate; or relapsed/refractory MDS who have received prior therapy with a
      hypomethylating agent, such as decitabine and azacitidine or who are not candidates to
      receive a hypomethylating agent, this would include high risk or transfusion-dependent low
      risk patients. Patients must have documented primary or secondary AML or MDS according to
      World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Following the provision of signed informed consent,
      patients will be screened for entry into the study. The study consists of 2 parts. In Part 1,
      3 to 6 patients per cohort will be enrolled sequentially in up to 7 dose-escalation cohorts
      to establish the MTD. KHK2823 will be administered once weekly. In Part 2, up to an
      additional 18 patients may be enrolled to further evaluate the safety, PK, PD, potential
      anti-leukemic activity of KHK2823.
