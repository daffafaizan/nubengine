(cytological and cytochemical study ofhepatic cells in the human embryo)changes in golgi apparatus and mitochondria as well as in the contents ofnucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and iron in the hepatic cellsof developing human embryo were studied; the data obtained in human embryos andadults were compared.  it was found that during the developmental process somechanges in localisations of golgi apparatus and iron salts were taking place.the contents of rna and polysaccharides in the cytoplasm increased:mitochondria in the form of granules were revealed throughout the embryonicperiod and in adults.  no essential alterations in the contents of dna,proteins, and lipids were noted.
