    
      This is a prospective, international multi-centre, open randomized clinical trial to assess
      whether the use of Paradigm REAL-Time System from the onset of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) leads to
      a better glycaemic control after 12 months of T1D compared with the use of Paradigm 515/715
      insulin pump combined with conventional Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose finger-sticks in
      paediatric patients. Total randomized treatment duration of the study for a patient will be
      12 months with an optional phase of follow-up of 3 months.Patients eligible according to
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups. A
      total of 160 patients will be recruited. Each subject will participate in the study for 15
      months, which includes 12 months of treatment and 3 months of follow-up. Each patient is
      asked to use either the Paradigm REAL-Time System that provides a combination of insulin pump
      and the Real-Time continuous glucose monitoring or Paradigm 515/715 insulin pump combined to
      conventional SMBG finger-sticks. Main time-points of assessments are at baseline (within one
      month after T1D onset) and 12 months thereafter. In total, there will be 6 study visits at
      the local site. During study, patients will regularly attend the outpatient clinic according
      to local Standard care, i.e. every 8Â±2 weeks.
