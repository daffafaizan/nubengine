      a cancer of the pleura, surgery may be considered as an attempt to treat the cancer. As part
      of the testing needed before surgery, a pleuroscopy or video camera examination of the pleura
      is necessary to establish the diagnosis and/or to evaluate the extent of the cancer. This
      study evaluates the effects of cryotherapy (freezing spray) on the ability of a patient's
      immune system to attack the cancer, as has been reported in other types of cancers. The
      purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of
      cryotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. If successful, this study could
      provide support for future studies evaluating this new treatment for mesothelioma.
