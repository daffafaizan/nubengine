      components will be used for this pilot study. The randomized controlled trial will include a
      1:1 allocation comparing a more intensive program (MIP - usual care plus healthy lifestyles
      program) with a less intensive program (LIP - usual care plus development of health goals).

      The qualitative components include semi-structured interviews of participants (exit
      interviews at 12 months), MIP staff and participants' healthcare providers (at 6 months and
      12 months). In addition, focus groups will be conducted with family members of MIP
      participants at 9 months. These elements will provide perspectives from multiple stakeholders
      for improving the healthy lifestyles program and on their roles in creating and maintaining
      healthy lifestyles.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and implementation of the healthy
      lifestyles program. Impact on participant experiences and outcomes will also be measured.
      Findings from this study will help inform a larger randomized trial to further look at
      effectiveness of the program and to determine health system implications. A 2-year extension
      was approved in order to determine sustainability of findings.
