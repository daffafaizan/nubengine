      recovery. IgG antibodies against Covid-19 are measured and only subjects with high titers are
      accepted. Plasmaphereses is done and up to 600 ml plasma is drawn and aliquoted in 200 ml
      portions.

      Patients with acute respiratory symptoms, verified Covid-19, hospitalized and in need of
      oxygen treatment are asked to participate in the study. The patients are randomized 50/50 to
      get either convalescent plasma or routine treatment without plasma. The patients randomized
      to get plasma will have infusion of 200 ml blood group compatible convalescent plasma daily
      during three days from different donors.

      The clinical course will be carefully monitored and days with oxygen requirement will be
      compared between the groups. Secondary clinical outcomes as mortality, need of assisted
      ventilation, total days in hospital and side effects to treatment will be observed.
