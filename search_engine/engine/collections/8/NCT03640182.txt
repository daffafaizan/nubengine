      preventive medicine has become the key point of science in modern days. In addition, World
      Health Assembly urged member states to appropriately integrate traditional and complementary
      medicine into health services according to the resolutions of sixty-ninth World Health
      Assembly.（WHA69.24）. To strengthen the foresight of health and welfare governance, Ministry
      of Health and Welfare lay down "2025 White Paper on Health and Welfare Policy", looking on
      ahead the needs of health care, preventive care, health promotion and social welfare.

      With regard to "Developing traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Health Care", the goal of
      "Promoting the development of TCM health promotion service" was set and the strategy of
      "Promoting the development of TCM preventive medicine and health promotion services" was used
      to develop TCM preventive medicine, which is applied to preventing disease and improving
      physical fitness. By establishing the TCM health care prototype of "health promotion" and
      "preventive medicine," this project will push the systemic development of TCM preventive
      medicine forward and improve suboptimal health by early intervention, proving people with
      multiple model choices in self-health management. This project will first form a
      multidisciplinary team to gather and analyze the domestic and international health promotion
      and management models of TCM or traditional medicine. Then systematically arrange and induct
      the literature references to establish the outline and draft of "Health management model of
      TCM preventive medicine." Furthermore, this project will try to practice "Health management
      model of TCM preventive medicine" together with health promotion groups related to Taiwan
      Society of Health Promotion in the district of Shilin, Zhongzheng, Beitou, and Songshan in
      Taipei city, and plan to recruit 200 people in this promotion project. The purpose of this
      project is to design a health management model of TCM preventive medicine that meets the need
      of healthy or suboptimal healthy people and bring up concrete policy and implementation
      recommendations of "promoting the development of TCM preventive medicine and health promotion
      services."
