    
      MicroPort Orthopedics Inc. (MPO) currently markets the EVOLUTIONÂ® TKA System globally,
      including in the European Union (EU). As part of the process for gaining approval to market
      in the EU, MicroPort is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of this system. These types of studies are required by
      regulatory authorities for all TKA devices that do not have medium to long-term clinical
      evidence available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU. The objectives of
      this study are to evaluate component survivorship, cumulative revision rate, functional
      outcome scores, and subject satisfaction at early, midterm, and long-term follow-up.
