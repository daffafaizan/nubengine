103. repopulation of bone marrowin mice  number and type ofcells required forpost-x-irradiation protectionfractionation of cells from mouse bonemarrow and autologous mouse spleen indi-cates that the cell responsible for bonemarrow repopulation and x-irradiationprotection resembles the small lymphocyte.experiments with injection of differentnumbers of bone marrow and spleen cellsand observations on survival obtained byfractional irradiation of the entire body andof extirpation of the shielded spleenafter irradiation indicate that approximately3 x 10 4 cells of this type are requiredto provide 50% survival, and that approximatelythis number migrates from theshielded extremity or spleen of a mouse per hour(slightly faster for spleen and slower for bone marrow).
