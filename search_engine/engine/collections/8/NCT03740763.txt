      receive inadequate pain relief. Neuropathic pain is a common pain condition, affecting 1.5-8%
      of the population. Conventional pharmacological treatment reduces pain but is often
      insufficient. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is associated with improved pain relief and
      health-related quality of life compared to conventional medical management. Despite SCS
      treatment, only half of the patients report >50% pain relief. Other studies have indicated
      that active, specific physiotherapy led by professionals reduces pain in chronic pain
      conditions. The aim of the study is to access the combined effect of optimized
      pharmacological treatment, SCS and physiotherapy on pain relief, health-related quality of
      life and physical function in patients with neuropathic pain. Furthermore, the study
      evaluates when it is most effective to start the physiotherapy.
