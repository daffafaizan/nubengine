      outpatient clinic for infertility, the basal gonadotropin and androgen levels are routinely
      measured. In unexplained infertility couples with normal ovarian reserves the first line drug
      used for ovulation induction is CC. The starting dose is 50mg/day and the treatment is
      started within the 2nd to the 5th days of the menstrual cycle and continued for 5 days.
      Starting on the 2nd-3rd day following the last dose of the drug, the follicular growth was
      monitored with the transvaginal ultrasound and blood levels of hormones including FSH, LH,
      estradiol, progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate
      were measured every 2-3 days. In this follow-up, if no follicular growth was observed day21
      of the cycle, the CC dose was increased to CC 100mg/day (2X1, 50mg). If follicular growth and
      ovulation is achieved with no concluding conception, the same dose of CC is used in the
      following 2-3 cycles. When a maximum number of 2 dominant follicles are obtained ovulation is
      triggered with recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG) and timed coit or intrauterine
      insemination is conducted.
