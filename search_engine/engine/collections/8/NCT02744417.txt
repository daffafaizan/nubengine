    
      Smokers willing to quit, with 10 teeth or more, and with periodontitis (30% or more of their
      teeth with proximal attachment loss â‰¥ 5 mm) were enrolled in the study. All subjects received
      periodontal treatment and concurrent smoking cessation therapy. Smoking cessation therapy was
      performed by a team comprising physicians, nurses, a psychologist and dentists, and consisted
      of four 1-h counselling lectures, psychologist-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy,
      nicotine replacement therapy and medication (bupropion or varenicline). Smoking cessation
      motivation was reinforced by dentists at the maintenance sessions, by means of motivational
      interviewing techniques. Periodontal therapy consisted in full-mouth supra and subgingival
      scaling and root planing (with curettes and ultrasonic scaler); oral hygiene instruction and
      motivation and removal of intra-oral plaque retentive factors. Further, periodontal
      maintenance was performed every 3 months.

      A single calibrated examiner, blinded to smoking status, assessed periodontal clinical
      outcomes (recession, pocket depth, clinical attachment level, plaque index and bleeding on
      probing). A structured questionnaire was applied in order to collect demographic and
      behavioral information. Expired carbon monoxide concentration was measured with a
      monoximeter, in order to validate smoking status. A pooled subgingival plaque sample was
      collected from the deepest periodontal pocket from each participant. The presence and
      quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella
      forsythia and Treponema denticola were determined using real time - PCR (RT-PCR).
