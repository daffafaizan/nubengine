      therefore, in the past, aspirin and clopidogrel were performed as anticoagulant therapy post
      stenting.But this treatment had limited effectiveness upon restenosis. Argatroban is a
      selective thrombin inhibitor, and previous study had suggested that argatroban use post PCI
      could potentially prevent reocclusion. But there has no study on large sample of argatroban
      treated Occlusion and Restenosis Extracranial vertebral Artery Stenting. This study will test
      the safety and efficacy of the argatroban on prevent Occlusion and Restenosis in patients
      with Extracranial vertebral Artery Stenting.
