      acetylcholinesterase that is indicated to slow the deterioration of cognitive impairment in
      Alzheimer's Disease. Initial anecdotal data suggest a promising role for Galantamine HBr in
      the treatment of ADHD. We propose to study to test the safety and efficacy of Galantamine HBr
      therapy in adults with ADHD. We will test if Galantamine HBr -associated improvements in ADHD
      symptomatology translate into improved cognitive and functional capacities (social and
      occupational) as well as increased quality of life.

      The proposed study includes 1) use of a 12-week design to document the response rate 2)
      assessment of the impact of Galantamine HBr on functional capacities (quality of life,
      psychosocial function) and cognition, 3) careful assessment of safety and tolerability.
