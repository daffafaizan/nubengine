      death in men worldwide. Existing methods of diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer are
      inadequate due to their invasiveness, inaccuracy, cost, access uneven, etc., making difficult
      the diagnosis and patient's follow up. New techniques and methods are necessary to improve
      diagnosis.

      Biological liquids might represent an attractive target to isolate prostate tumour cells for
      these purposes. In recent years, several studies have been carried out with the aim of
      reducing and / or avoiding the limits of sensitivity and specificity of current methods of
      screening for prostate cancer and thus obtain new biomarkers for the diagnosis and / or
      non-invasive monitoring.

      However, due to technical and technological difficulties few studies have been performed to
      investigate the non-invasive isolation and direct analysis of tumour cells. Our project is
      therefore an innovative project which aims to study a new approach for the early diagnosis of
      prostate cancer, with better sensitivity and specificity.
