      with a reported prevalence varying between 10%-60% in adults. Periodontal health is commonly
      affected in pregnancy. The prevalence of pregnancy gingivitis varies widely, ranging from
      around 35%- 100%. Although, most of the periodontal changes during pregnancy are reversible
      but females with preexisting periodontitis or those who have metabolic disease such as
      diabetes may suffer increased periodontal destruction and may exhibit significantly greater
      probing pocket depth and attachment level. Periodontal disease, as a source of persistent
      infection, may induce systemic inflammatory responses that increase the risk of adverse
      pregnancy outcomes. However, so far the results have been mixed. As vitamin D metabolites may
      also alter the inflammatory response and have antimicrobial effects thus the use of vitamin D
      may affect periodontal status. Evidence is there which suggests that an association exists
      between low serum levels of Vitamin D and periodontal attachment loss. If the investigators
      take all of the above factors in consideration, the broad picture reveals that as vitamin D
      deficiency is prevalent in Pakistan, the pregnant females here are likely to have compromised
      periodontal health and probably poor pregnancy outcomes.
