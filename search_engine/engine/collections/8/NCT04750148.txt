      subject's physical capacity is essential to know the basic level of the subject
      pre-treatment, to evaluate progress following rehabilitation, to set goals to prevent decline
      in physical capacity or to evaluate changes in physical capacity at different stages of
      survival. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is frequently used in the clinic to assess the
      physical capacity of the subject in oncology. A variant of the 6MWT exists and has been
      little studied in an oncological context: the 2-minute walk test (2MWT). The 2MWT is
      performed in the same way as the 6MWT: the same instructions and the same test procedure. It
      offers the advantage of being less tiring for the test subjects and saves clinicians time.
      The 2MWT has been validated in the past for people with COPD or after cardiac surgery. To our
      knowledge, it has not been validated for cancer patients.
