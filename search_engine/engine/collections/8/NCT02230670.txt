      serum of liver disease patients and has been associated with disease severity, thus
      associating both excessive apoptosis and caspase activity with disease. Studies have also
      shown that caspase cleaved cytokeratin 18 is generally elevated to an even greater degree in
      cirrhosis than in other liver diseases. In addition, increasing stages of cirrhosis from
      Child-Pugh A, Child-Pugh B to Child-Pugh C are associated with progressively higher levels of
      caspase cleaved cytokeratin 18. Therefore, it appears that apoptosis and caspase activity
      tend to correlate with the stage of cirrhosis. A caspase inhibitor like IDN-6556 could have
      clinical utility by reducing the rate of apoptosis in cirrhotic patients and potentially
      reduce the progression of disease as determined by clinical markers of progression.
