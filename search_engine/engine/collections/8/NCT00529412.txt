      to a sodium hyaluronate-based bioresorbable membrane (Seprafilm) group or to a control group.
      Before closing the abdominal incision, two sheets of Seprafilm membrane were applied to the
      surface of the small intestine under the middle abdominal wound in the Seprafilm group. The
      primary end point was the incidence of bowel obstruction. Secondary end points were
      intraoperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality.
