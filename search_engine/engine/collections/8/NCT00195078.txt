    
      This is a Phase I-II, open-label, dose-escalation study in subjects with advanced head or
      neck cancer. Subjects will receive daily ZD1839 during a course of standard radiation therapy
      accompanied by cisplatin.

      Subjects are adults with Stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx,
      larynx, or hypopharynx, who are in medically stable condition, with an Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of Â£ 1, stable hepatic and bone marrow function, and
      a life expectancy of at least 6 months. Subjects should have no previous cancer history (with
      the exception of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or cervical cancer in situ) and no prior
      treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, or definitive surgical therapy. Subjects in the Phase
      II portion of the trial must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST criteria.
