      regimen in 61 patients with lower oesophagus, oesophagus junction or gastric carcinoma.

      Preoperative chemotherapy include eight weekly preoperative cycles of cisplatin (30mg/m2),
      epirubicin (50 mg/m2) and paclitaxel (90 mg/m2)with a break of one week without chemotherapy
      between cycle 4 and 5. Surgery is performed within 4-6 weeks after the end of the last cycle
      of chemotherapy. Primary endpoint of this trial is the curative resection rate (=R0). R0 must
      be higher than the 79% achieved in previous published studies. Response rate, histologic
      response rate (Becker score), progression-free survival, overall survival, impact of complete
      response in survival and dose-density are secondary endpoints. For an ancillary study, tumors
      (biopsies and operative specimens) and sera will be collected to identify biomarkers
      correlated with treatment efficacy.

      This study is carried out by the Besan√ßon University Hospital and were approved by the
      independent Est-II ethics committee and by the French National Authority for Health: AFSSAPS.
