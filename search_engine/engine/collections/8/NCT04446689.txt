      anxiety levels, as well as the quality of professional life, and their coping mechanisms, of
      a nursing staff from de Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre. The research will have two
      phases, first to select the nursing staff sample, and then to apply and evaluate the
      intervention. From 2.219 individuals will be randomly drawn a sample of 272 participants. All
      will respond a questionnaire (Vasconcelos Symptoms and Stress List) in order to obtain a
      general level of stress score greater than 1 (inclusion criteria to enter the RCT). The 272
      group will be randomly split in two groups (136 subjects each) to compare the intervention vs
      placebo.
