      improve the outcomes for elderly AML(older than 60 years) in complete remission (CR). At
      present, the best conditioning regimen for elderly AML in CR remains in discussion. Flu+Bu
      conditioning regimen is the most commonly used regimen for elderly AML in CR undergoing
      allo-HSCT. However, it appears to have higher relapse rate. To reduce the relapse rate,
      decitabine is added in the conditioning regimen. In this prospective study, the safety and
      efficacy of Decitabine+ Fludarabine+Busulfan myeloablative conditioning regimens in patients
      with elderly AML in CR undergoing allo-HSCT are evaluated.
