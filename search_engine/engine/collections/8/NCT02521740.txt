      may induce a stress response to the caregiver. This stress response can be measured by
      biological markers (inflammation, transcription and immunity) and also by clinical markers
      (frailty, physical performance, nutrition). This stress response can be influenced by the
      subjective burden of the caregiver and by the severity of the disease of the care receiver
      (Activity of daily life capabilities, cognitive function, behavioral disturbance).
