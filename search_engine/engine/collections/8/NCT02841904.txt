      bladder (cystoscopy) gives magnified, microscopic-like images of tissues and cells, by
      inserting a laser fiber through the cystoscope. CLE aims to target biopsies during cystoscopy
      and reduce the number of biopsies, and the need for additional cystoscopies i general
      anesthesia.

      This study evaluates the ability of CLE to assess tissue in the bladder. The ability to
      diagnose normal mucosa, inflammation and tumors of the bladder by the CLE is compared to the
      histopathological examination of selected tissues (biopsies).

      Patients scheduled for cystoscopy with biopsies in general anesthesia are recruited for the
      study. After standard cystoscopy where suspicious mucosal areas are located and marked, A
      contrast agent (Fluorescein) is administrated intravenously. CLE fiber is introduced through
      the cystoscope and the marked mucosal areas are examined by direct contact with the laser
      fiber. The pathologist assesses the CLE video and registers the results. Biopsies are then
      taken from the selected, suspicious areas. The results of CLE assessment are compared with
      the histopathological results.
