      mechanical therapies (percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting)
      and pharmacological therapies (nitrates, calcium channel blockers, betablockers and potassium
      channel activators) main actions are to treat the end product of ischaemic heart disease on
      chronic stable angina, i.e. the flow limiting stenosis. We postulate that by treating insulin
      resistance, an upstream factor in the pathogenesis of ischaemic heart disease, we will
      improve angina by in turn improving endothelial function. We will attempt to demonstrate this
      by way of full bruce protocol exercise tolerance test, Seattle Angina Questionnaire and 24
      hour ST segment analysis before and after treatment with the insulin sensitiser rosiglitazone
      for three months.
