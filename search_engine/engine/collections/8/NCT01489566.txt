    
      -  Subjects will return to the hospital 25±5 days after the resection of hepatocellular
           carcinoma following the baseline examination. Baseline imaging data will be sent to the
           lead study site imaging center for review and verification. The investigator will
           determine whether the subject satisfies all inclusion/exclusion criteria. If all
           requirements are satisfied, then randomization will occur 25±5 days after surgery

        -  The day of randomization will be defined as Day 0. Randomized subjects will return to
           the hospital and begin cycle 1 on the day of randomization (Day 0). The Investigator
           will administer chemotherapy according to the subject's condition. On the next day,
           experimental drug therapy will begin, and the relevant laboratory tests will be
           performed within 3 days after the end the study drug infusion.

        -  Cycles will occur every four weeks for the first 6 cycles (i.e. cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
           will begin on days 28 ± 3, 56 ± 3, 84 ± 3, 112 ± 3, and 140 ± 3, respectively). The
           second 6 cycles will occur every eight weeks (i.e. cycles 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, will
           begin on days 196 ± 3, 252 ± 3, 308 ± 3, 364 ± 3, and 420 ± 3, respectively).

        -  the participant will receive medical inspection so as to observe and ensure drug safety.

        -  A CT scan will be performed for each participant to exclude the recurrence or metastasis
           of tumor and assess the effects of treatment once before the initiation of each new
           cycle.
