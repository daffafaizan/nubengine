      face-to-face via a secure digital video solution (to minimize cancelled sessions because of
      the COVID-19 pandemic) or at the Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset cardiac research unit, by
      licensed psychologists with expertise in CBT for cardiac disease. During treatment, the
      psychologists will have direct access to a cardiologist assigned to the project and
      treatments are conducted in close interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure patient safety.
