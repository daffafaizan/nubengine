      then it will reduce gradually until commonly disappearing after 7-10 days in most cases.
      Since piroxicam has a half-life of 50 hours in the plasma, it will be effective in
      controlling the most intense pain which occurs after endodontic treatment It appears that
      optimal clinical benefits can be achieved by administering drugs such as local anesthetics
      and NSAIDs before the onset of postoperative pain. Administering these drugs before a
      surgical or an endodontic procedure may be of benefit for longer procedures or for minimizing
      peripheral sensitization, which is a result of the cascade of inflammatory mediators that are
      released by tissue injury and fuel the subsequent inflammatory process
