      sites in the US and 1 site in the United Kingdom.

      The study was to enroll ~30 boys with nonsense mutation DMD/BMD (nmDBMD) who have been
      nonambulatory for at least 1 year. Enrollment was to be stratified to ensure evaluation of
      ~15 participants who were receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy and of ~15 participants
      who were not receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy. Participants were to take ataluren 3
      times per day (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for 48 weeks (~1 year). Study assessments
      were to be performed at clinic visits during screening, every 6 weeks for 2 visits and then
      every 12 weeks until the end of the study. Additional safety laboratory testing was to be
      required 4 times during the course of the study; this could have been performed at the
      investigational site, at an accredited local laboratory or clinic, or in the participant's
      home using a nursing service. When the blind for a similar study (PTC124-GD-007-DMD;
      NCT00592553) was revealed, the results indicated lack of efficacy for the high dose.
      Therefore, even though an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) agreed that both
      ataluren dose levels were well tolerated by the participants, the DMC recommended
      discontinuing ongoing studies with participants with nmDBMD receiving high-dose ataluren.
