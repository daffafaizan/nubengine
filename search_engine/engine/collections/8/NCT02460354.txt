    
      Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a genetic disease. Patients with this disease make
      large amounts of urine because their kidneys don't hold on to water. The large amount of
      urine means that patients need to urinate very frequently. They are also at increased risk
      for dehydration if they don't drink enough. The large amount of urine can sometimes damage
      their bladders and kidneys. There are some medicines that may help these patients urinate
      less, but they are not very effective. There is evidence in animal studies that a medication
      called metformin may help patients with NDI urinate less.
