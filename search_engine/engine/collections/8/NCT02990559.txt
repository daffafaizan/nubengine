      including neurotransmitter synthesis, neuron myelination, and mitochondrial function. In the
      United States, of the donors who provided the ~15 million units of red blood cells that were
      collected for transfusion, 69% were repeat donors. Although iron deficiency is surprisingly
      prevalent in first-time donors, its prevalence is even higher in these particularly
      altruistic frequent donors, (i.e., up to 49% and 66% of male and female repeat donors,
      respectively), manifested as iron depletion or iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Iron deficiency
      from blood donation is associated with fatigue, restless leg syndrome, decreased physical
      endurance and work capacity, and impaired concentration, attention, and other neurocognitive
      functions; however, these conclusions are not based on definitive studies and have not yet
      changed blood donation policy. This study is to collect data through noninvasive procedures
      routinely employed in clinical practice to better understand how iron treatment may affect
      brain functions.
