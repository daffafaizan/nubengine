      of communication between care providers and patients. Communication of abnormal laboratory
      results represents a particular challenge. Laboratory and other test results are often not
      reported until repeat visits weeks to months later. In the case of treatment failure, severe
      treatment complications, or evidence of opportunistic infection, such reporting delays likely
      result in adverse outcomes and potentially compromise future treatment options. The
      investigators propose to evaluate a novel strategy of communication using SMS text messaging
      to facilitate patient return to an HIV clinic in Uganda after critical laboratory results.

      The investigators will consent and enroll participants at the time of laboratory testing for
      cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, viral loads, acid fast bacteria smears of sputum,
      among others. Those with abnormal results will be randomized to various messaging formats and
      receive text messages requesting a prompt return to clinic. For outcomes, the investigators
      will measure successful receipt and comprehension of messages, as well as proportion
      returning within 14 days of the abnormal laboratory test.
