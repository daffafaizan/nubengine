      in disadvantaged communities in low- and middle-income countries. A study in the Western Cape
      Region, which was conducted between 2001 and 2015, reported for example a caries prevalence
      of 84% for 6-years-old (Smit 2017), highlighting the need for oral health programs and
      cost-effective interventions. Fluoride varnish offers hereby a feasible possibility to
      supplement toothbrushing programs in order to improve fluoride delivery and consequently
      caries prevention. However, many studies failed to confirm the benefits of fluoride varnish
      for caries prevention, which may partially be explained by the fact that many of these
      studies were conducted in high-income countries, in which the caries increment is low due to
      a wide access to fluoride.

      This study, thus aimed to further validate the benefits of fluoride varnish application
      specifically in a primary school setting within a peri-urban, low socio-economic, high-caries
      risk community in South Africa.
