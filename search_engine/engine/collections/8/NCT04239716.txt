      may occur with most of regional anesthesia. pain in the axilla and upper limb is related to
      ineffective block of medial and lateral pectoral nerves as long thoracic and thoracodorsal
      nerves, leading to inadequate analgesia.The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block and erector spinae plane block
      for providing surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia after modified radical
      mastectomy.
