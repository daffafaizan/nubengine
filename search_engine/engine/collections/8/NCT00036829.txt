        -  Develop and test a pain assessment and management system for people with cancer
           (PAMS-PC).

        -  Obtain feedback from patients with non-hematologic malignancies on the proposed features
           of the system and its usability and effectiveness.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. The study contains 3 parts. Patients in part II are
      assigned to 1 of 2 assessment groups.

        -  Part I: Patients participate in a focus interview by telephone over approximately 45
           minutes. The interview includes discussion of beliefs and concerns regarding pain and
           its management, strategies used by the patient for managing pain, the features of the
           proposed pain assessment and management system for people with cancer (PAMS-PC), and
           reactions of the patients to each proposed component of the system.

        -  Part II:

             -  Group A: Patients participate in an assessment session over approximately 90
                minutes, comprising completion of a questionnaire followed by use of a test version
                of the PAMS-PC.

             -  Group B: Patients use the PAMS-PC first followed by completion of the
                questionnaire.

      Thirty patients are then randomly selected from the 2 groups to repeat use of the PAMS-PC 3
      hours after the initial assessment.

        -  Part III: Patients participate in a patient acceptance test over 30-60 minutes, in which
           patients test the demo version of the system, complete an evaluation questionnaire, and
           provide feedback by telephone.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (10 for part I, 150 (75 per group) for part II,
      and 20 for part III) will be accrued for this study.
