    
      Analysis of the effect of i.v. VAS203 on renal function and perfusion in healthy subjects.

      Primary objective:

      Possible adverse effect of VAS203 on the Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) and the Glomerular
      Filtration Rate (GFR) during and after 6 hours of constant-rate iv. infusion of 10 mg/kg
      VAS203.

      Secondary objective:

      To analyse the effects of VAS203 on

        -  filtration fraction

        -  hemodynamics (afferent and efferent resistance, intraglomerular pressure)

        -  markers of kidney injury and renal function

        -  systolic, mean and diastolic brachial blood pressure

        -  Plasma Pharmacokinetic of VAS203 and its first metabolite.
