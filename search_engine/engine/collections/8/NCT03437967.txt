      photobiomodulation therapy reduces pain and facilitates opioid pain medication (OPM)
      reduction (weaning). The subject group includes patients with chronic pain who are undergoing
      OPM weaning and are candidates for LASER photobiomodulation therapy. This is a prospective
      interventional study using a double-blind 4-period crossover design to assess the efficacy of
      HIGH POWER LASER photobiomodulation therapy compared to sham (LOW POWER LASER) therapy in
      reducing pain and improving compliance with OPM weaning.
