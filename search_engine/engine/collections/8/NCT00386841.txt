      endo-phenotypes. Endo-phenotypes are heritable biological or psychological markers, which are
      more commonly found in patients and their healthy relatives than in the general population.

      Recent studies point at disturbed regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical
      (HPA) system as a possible endo-phenotype for depression.

      The hypothesis of AGENDA are that endo-phenotypes are affected by treatment with
      antidepressants in healthy first degree relatives.

      AGENDA is a four week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in which first
      degree relatives of patients with the diagnosis of depression are randomised in to two
      groups, which are treated with either placebo or antidepressant medicine (Cipralex). We
      expect to include 80 healthy subjects, with the predisposition for depression, since one of
      their parents or siblings recently was treated for depression.

      The subjects will be examined before and after four weeks of treatment by a thorough
      interview concerning psychiatric symptoms (SCAN), including depressive symptoms, personality,
      perceived stress and cognitive function. The effect of antidepressant on stress is measured
      with saliva-cortisol and by the response to the combined dexamethasone
      corticotropin-releasing (CRH) hormone test. Additionally, MR and PET scans of the 5-HT4
      receptor function will be conducted before and after 4 weeks of treatment.
