      assistance of the new imaging software analysis package. Analysis of technical and clinical
      data will be recorded on the case report forms. This will be an observational design. We
      intend to test the results of our analyses through a Test Plan looking at Cardio
      functionality (hardware and software), System performance (reconstruction, loading,
      transferring, archiving),and System stability.

      We plan to find out the relevant effect of our clinical reading results by enrolling our
      patients in a long-term clinical outcomes database. To evaluate the presence of traditional
      coronary risk factors, a focused medical history will be requested (see attached) as well as
      access to relevant medical records to determine the presence of major adverse cardiac events.
      These will be handled in a confidential manner and will be de-identified using subject number
      and initial only to be compliant with HIPAA.
