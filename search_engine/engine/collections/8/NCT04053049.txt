      dyspepsia. However, it is unclear which foods exacerbate symptoms more than others.

      Children with post-prandial distress functional dyspepsia will receive four different meals
      with variables being: semi-solid vs. solid and high fat vs high carbohydrate. At the time of
      ingestion and for up to 3 hours after each meal, subjects will rate their gastrointestinal
      symptoms. Comparisons of symptom onset and severity will be made for each meal.

      Enrolled subjects will have undergone previous gastrointestinal evaluations: gastric emptying
      study and/or upper endoscopy. In addition, subjects will complete psychosocial measures:
      Behavioral Assessment for Children-3, childhood somatization inventory.

      The first goal is to compare the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms with different
      composition and consistency meals. The second goal is to correlate the severity of
      postprandial gastrointestinal symptoms to psychosocial distress, gastric neuromotor function
      (emptying and accommodation), and duodenal inflammation.
