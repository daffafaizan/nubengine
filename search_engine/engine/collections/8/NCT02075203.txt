      be conducted in 990 healthy, HIV-uninfected, QFT-GIT negative, previously BCG vaccinated
      adolescents. The trial will be conducted at the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative
      (SATVI) site in the Western Cape region of South Africa, where epidemiological studies
      involving thousands of adolescents have been conducted over the last decade to characterize
      rates of Mtb infection and active TB disease in this age group. Subjects will be enrolled in
      two sequential cohorts and within each cohort subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to
      receive either AERAS-404 or saline placebo on Days 0 and 56, or BCG Vaccine SSI on Day 0. The
      first 90 subjects (30 from each arm) will form the Safety & Immunogenicity Cohort and will be
      subject to more intensive collection of safety data, with data reviewed by the Data
      Monitoring Committee (DMC), principal investigator and local medical monitor. Selected
      immunogenicity assays, including whole blood intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), will also
      be performed in this cohort. The remaining 900 subjects will be enrolled into the Correlates
      Cohort. All 990 subjects in the study will be evaluated for safety and biomarker outcomes,
      and for prevention of Mtb infection.

      The primary Mtb infection endpoint will be QFT-GIT conversion from a negative to positive
      test, using the manufacturer's recommended threshold of 0.35 IU/mL, at any time-point after
      Day 84 and through end of follow-up for the primary endpoint. The 84-day 'wash-out' period is
      stipulated in order to exclude subjects who may have already been Mtb infected, but not yet
      converted their QFT-GIT test at screening, thus subjects who convert their QFT-GIT at Day 84
      will not be included in the analyses of prevention of Mtb infection.
