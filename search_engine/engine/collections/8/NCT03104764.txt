      randomized to treatment with conventional scalpel or laser treatment technology after parents
      and children had given consent to participate. During the surgery the time required for the
      procedure and the amount of bleeding the different techniques caused were measured. Wound
      healing was assessed five and ten days after surgery by a clinical judgement and by analysing
      photos. Three months after surgery an independent dentist assessed the long-term outcome by a
      clinical examination. The patientsÂ´ view of the treatment were assessed directly after the
      surgery and five days, ten days and three months after the surgery.
