    
      Prospective, controlled, multicenter, randomized, single-blind trial. The aim is to examine
      the treatment of coronary Bare Metal Stent restenosis with a drug coated AngioSculpt scoring
      balloon. Patients are randomized to treatment by an AngioSculpt scoring balloon (no drug
      coating)or a drug coated AngioSculpt scoring balloon (paclitaxel 3.0 µg/mm²). Primary
      efficacy endpoint is late lumen loss in-segment at 6 months. Key secondary endpoints include
      procedural Success, MACE (cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically
      driven target lesion revascularization at 6 months). Individual clinical endpoints include
      stent thrombosis (ARC), cardiac death, any death, target vessel myocardial infarction, any
      infarction, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, clinically driven target
      vessel revascularization, any revascularization.
