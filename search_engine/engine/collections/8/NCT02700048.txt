    
      This is a single center, single-blinded randomized cross over design trial, that will compare
      the impact of IN naloxone vs. IN saline during experimental hypoglycemia on day one on the
      responses to experimental hypoglycemia on day two. 18 participants will be studied twice, 8
      weeks apart. On each occasion participants will undergo a 2 hour hypoglycemic clamp (target
      50 mg/dl) in the morning and in the afternoon on day one and then again on the morning of day
      2. During the morning clamps, samples will be collected for later measurement of serum
      epinephrine, glucagon and cortisol levels and participants will be asked to complete a
      hypoglycemia symptom questionnaire. 3 intranasal doses (4 mg each) of naloxone hydrochloride
      or IN saline will be administered to the subject on day 1. Plasma will be collected for
      measurement of naloxone concentrations on day 1 primary outcome is the difference in peak
      epinephrine secretion during the morning episodes of hypoglycemia on days one and two, thus
      each participant will have two observations: one from their naloxone experiment and one from
      their saline experiment.

      Secondary endpoint will be naloxone pharmacokinetics including maximum concentration (Cmax),
      time to maximum concentration (Tmax) and area under the curve (AUC)
