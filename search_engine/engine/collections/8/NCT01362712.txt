      subjects. In this study of [F-18]CP-18, it is intended to assess its biodistribution, PET
      scan resolution, signal to background ratio in tumor, and any adverse events. This
      exploratory Phase I study will be used to obtain the necessary safety and dosimetry data in
      normal subjects and to collect drug biodistribution data, and tumor to background imaging
      data in breast cancer subjects. The information collected from this study will not be used
      for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical
      management of the subject.
