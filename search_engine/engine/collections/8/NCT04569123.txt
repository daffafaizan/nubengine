      survivors in the U.S. who suffer from post-stroke hand disability. Post-stroke hand
      disability impairs stroke survivors' abilities and independence with self-care, hygiene,
      employment, and leisure, frequently resulting in diminished quality of life. Rehabilitation
      can often be limited, but research suggests that the effects of therapy is improved by the
      addition of sensory stimulation.

      To fully leverage the potential therapeutic benefits of sensory stimulation, we have
      developed a new stimulation that is imperceptible random-frequency vibration applied to wrist
      skin. The objective of this study is to determine if this treatment is superior to
      task-practice alone in improving hand functional recovery, sensorimotor grip control, and
      neural communication.
