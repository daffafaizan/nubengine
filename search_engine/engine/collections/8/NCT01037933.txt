      informed consent, patients receiving intravenous chemotherapy were randomly assigned to view
      a 45-minute humorous DVD or non-humorous DVD. The following measurements were obtained before
      and after patients viewed the DVD: Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the state
      portion of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI-S) to assess symptoms related to
      cancer and chemotherapy, salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) to assess immune function and
      salivary cortisol to assess emotional stress. In addition, patients, caregivers, and nurses
      were asked open-ended questions after the intervention to ascertain their impression of the
      overall intervention experience. Multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) were be used to
      analyze changes in ESAS, STAI-S, IgA and cortisol within and between the two groups.
