      lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone in subjects with Multiple Myeloma (MM) in
      first or second relapse. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the confirmed response rate of
      bendamustine in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with MM in first
      or second relapse. (Phase II) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the safety of bendamustine
      in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. (Phase I and II) II. To evaluate
      time-to-tumor-progression, progression-free survival, duration of response, and overall
      survival. (Phase II) OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of bendamustine
      hydrochloride and lenalidomide followed by a phase II study. Patients receive dexamethasone
      orally or IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 2; and oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving at
      least stable disease after 6 courses may continue to receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone
      as above in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dexamethasone may be
      discontinued after 12 courses of therapy at the treating investigator's discretion. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then periodically for up
      to 2 years.
