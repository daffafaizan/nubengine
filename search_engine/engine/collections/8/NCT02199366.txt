      cardiac MRI within 1 year after completion of standard radiation therapy for left-sided
      breast cancer. The cardiac MRI scans will be evaluated to determine if there are changes in
      cardiac function within 1 year after radiation treatment.

      Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire before and after treatment that asks about
      their health and any symptoms they may be having.

      Physical exams and any other standard of care service or treatment will be at the discretion
      of the treating physician.
