    
      Objective: The purpose of the protocol is to determine the effects of the social content of
      gestures on brain activation patterns. We will localize the extent and areas of brain
      activation by using functional MRI during observation of gesture varied by type of gesture,
      number of images shown at a time, and number of times a subject is exposed to a face.

      Study Population: Healthy, normal adult volunteers will participate in a gesture observation
      experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      Design: The experiment we are conducting will employ an event-related design to determine
      whether increasing the social content of the gesture spreads activation from traditional
      sensorimotor regions engaged in mirror movement activity to regions in the prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) concerned with processing social behavior.

      Outcome Measures: The data collected will consist of accuracy measures of cognitive
      performance, fMRI images, and post-questionnaire results. The results gained from this
      protocol will provide evidence for a social effect of gesturing.
