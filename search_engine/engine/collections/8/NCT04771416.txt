    
      PBKR03 is an adeno-associated viral vector serotype Hu68 carrying the gene encoding for human
      galactosylceramidase, GALC, formulated as a solution for injection into the cisterna magna.

      This is a global interventional, multicenter, single-arm, dose escalation, study of PBKR03
      delivered as a one-time dose administered into the cisterna magna of subjects with early
      infantile Krabbe Disease.

      The dose-ranging portion of the study will enroll independent dose escalation cohorts in two
      age groups of subjects with early infantile Krabbe disease:

        -  Cohort 1: 3 subjects aged ≥4 to <9 months will receive the low dose (Dose I)

        -  Cohort 2: 3 subjects aged ≥4 to <9 months will receive the high dose (Dose II)

        -  Cohort 3: 3 subjects aged ≥1 to <4 months will receive the low dose (Dose I)

        -  Cohort 4: 3 subjects aged ≥1 to <4 months will receive the high dose (Dose II)

      Part 1 of the study will enroll a total of four cohorts, enrolled sequentially with separate
      age-based dose-escalation cohorts. Enrollment will initiate in Cohort 1. Following completion
      of Cohort 1, simultaneous enrollment in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 will occur. Cohort 4 will
      follow completion of cohort 3.

      The confirmatory cohort, Part 2, will enroll subjects with early infantile Krabbe Disease,
      aged >1 to <9 months. These subjects will receive a dose chosen based on the data obtained in
      part 1 of the study This will be a 2-year study with a 3-year safety extension.
