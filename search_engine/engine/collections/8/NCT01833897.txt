      contributes disproportionally to morbidity and mortality. At present, few approved treatments
      for bipolar depression are available, and have primarily depended on manipulations of brain
      monoaminergic systems. In contrast, recent studies suggest that the N-methyl-D-aspartate
      glutamate-receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, ketamine, may provide near-immediate relief for
      treatment resistant depression. Its utility during long-term treatment, however, is limited
      by its psychotomimetic potency and the need for repeated IV infusions. D-cycloserine (DCS) is
      an approved oral antibiotic for tuberculosis drug and a well-studied mixed agonist/antagonist
      at the NMDAR/glycine binding site. DCS showed preliminary evidence of efficacy in a pilot
      study. DCS would thus be practical from both a safety and route of administration
      perspective. The present study will explore the feasibility and safety of DCS for maintenance
      treatments, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
