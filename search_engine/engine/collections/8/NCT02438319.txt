    
      Cross-Over non-randomized Case-Series. Arm 1 (Manual segmentation): Manually marking of the
      boundaries of the optic disc and it's excavation on color photographs of the optic disc. Arm
      2 (Automated segmentation): Automatic detection of the boundaries of the optic disc and it's
      excavation. Calculation of cup size, size of excavation, cup-to-disc ratio, and rim area.
      Comparison of all parameters of both arms and computing of agreement.
