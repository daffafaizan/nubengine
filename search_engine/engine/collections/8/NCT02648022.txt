      new era of more effective treatments for hepatitis C (HCV). The impact of more effective
      therapies on patient access to treatment is unknown. Integrated Care (IC) involving patient
      case management may overcome barriers to treatment access imposed by psychiatric and
      substance use disorders (SUD).

      Methods: Prospective, randomized trial at a single medical center. Patients with HCV at risk
      for active psychiatric and SUD between Jan 2012 and Jan 2013 were recruited and randomized to
      IC or Usual Care (UC). A mid-level mental health practitioner was placed in the IC clinic and
      provided brief mental health care and case management.
