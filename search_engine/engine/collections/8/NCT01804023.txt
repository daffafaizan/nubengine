      of point-of-care exclusion criteria, four applicators (#1 to 4, "sham" applicators) will be
      handled by the participant, but not inserted into the vagina and the gel will be expelled
      into a waste container. Four applicators (#5 to 8) will be inserted into the participant's
      vagina, one at a time, by the investigator, removed, and then the gel will be expelled into a
      waste container. Two applicators (#9 and 10) will be inserted into the participant's vagina,
      one at a time, and gel will be expelled into the participant's vagina. Finally, two
      applicators (#11 and 12) will be inserted into the participant's vagina, one at a time, by
      the investigator, removed and then the gel expelled into a waste container. Applicators #11
      and 12 will then be wiped clean with a paper towel. Thus, each participant will provide a
      total of 12 applicators, half of which will be processed within one week of her visit and
      half of which will be processed in approximately one month of her visit. Three readers
      blinded to the status of the applicators (sham, inserted with or without gel expulsion) will
      determine, by VIRA and UV light assessment, whether or not the applicators were inserted
      vaginally. Additional laboratory personnel, who will also be blinded to the status of the
      applicators, will process the applicators for DNA and protein markers of product adherence
      and protocol compliance.
