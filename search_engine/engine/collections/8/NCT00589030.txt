      Primary

        -  Provide supervised access to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres
           (TheraSphere®) to eligible patients with primary cancer to the liver and who are not
           surgical resection candidates.

        -  Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with TheraSphere® treatment.

        -  Enter treatment experience into a liver database.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tumor response rates in patients receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a humanitarian device exemption use study.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) via percutaneous hepatic
      arterial infusion. Patients may be retreated between 30-90 days after the initial infusion.
