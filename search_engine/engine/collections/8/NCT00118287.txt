      I. Determine the frequency of hematologic responses in patients with MDS to 5-aza
      (azacitidine) plus etanercept.

      II. Determine the efficacy of 5-aza combined with etanercept in patients with low or
      intermediate (int)-1 risk who fail to respond to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) plus
      etanercept and for the purpose of this trial are considered as having progressive or "more
      advanced" disease.

      III. Correlate results of ex vivo/in vitro studies on phenotypic, cytogenetic and functional
      disease characteristics with in vivo treatment responses, to identify parameters that are
      associated with a high probability of response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive etanercept subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly during weeks 1 and 2 and
      azacitidine SC or intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for at least 3 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
