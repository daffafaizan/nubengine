      program on the muscle mass, muscle strength, and quality of sleep of institutional older
      adults with sarcopenia. Using convenience sampling, 12 long-term care facilities with 114
      older adults were recruited, and then cluster-randomized by the facility to a VA experimental
      or a control group. The experimental group received the VA program led by certified
      instructors 3 times per week and 40 minutes per session for 6 months; the control group
      continued with their regular daily activities. One pre-test and two post-tests, 3 months
      apart, were conducted.
