      energy to produce focused cell death while sparing the normal extracellular matrix, nearby
      vessels, and structures, while allowing for rapid normal tissue regrowth.

      Unlike thermal ablation modalities, Irreversible electroporation does not require significant
      consideration for dissipation of thermal energy, or heat sink, and has less complications
      relating to damage of normal soft tissue, eliminating a major cause of treatment failure.

      Irreversible electroporation is a novel minimally invasive tumor/tissue ablation technique
      that can be used under guidance of ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT), without
      inducing thermal damaging effects, and with preservation of the surrounding vital structures
      such as vessels, bile ducts, urethra, and nerves which remain intact to function normally,
      even in locally advanced tumors. The technique depends upon inducing apoptotic non-necrotic
      cell death in short procedure time.

      It has the advantage of allowing quick tissue regeneration. Irreversible electroporation
      treatment time is significantly shorter than traditional thermal ablation modalities, usually
      in few minutes range, and allows for treating considerably larger lesions than thermal
      ablation modalities.
