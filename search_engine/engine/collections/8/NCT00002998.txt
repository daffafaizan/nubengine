      metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed one or two systemic regimens. II.
      Determine time to progression and survival in these patients. III. Define further the
      toxicity of this two-drug combination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients with complete response
      may receive an additional 2 courses after attainment of complete response status. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicities for a maximum of 8
      courses. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then at 3 years after
      treatment.
