      efficacy of PNBs: high placebo response rate and possible unblinding. In order to test the
      efficacy of this commonly used treatment for children and adolescents with difficult-to-treat
      headache, we need utilize a trial design which will address the high placebo response rate
      and the potential lack of blinding.

      About 58 children, recruited over a 3.5 year period at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,
      will take part in this study. Participation will last about one month and involve one
      in-person study visit, and then completion of headache-related surveys, at home, for 28 days.
      Lidocaine cream lead-in will be used open-label for all subjects followed by double-blind
      randomized injections of active treatment (lidocaine) versus comparator (saline) in subjects
      who continue to have significant headache.

      To accomplish our secondary objectives, we will examine how expectation is affected by
      perceived treatment, and how expectations, measured in patients, parents, and providers,
      influence outcomes in pediatric and adolescent acute migraine.
