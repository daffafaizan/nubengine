      mechanisms underlying atrial dysfunction. Here the investigator provide a power calculation
      based on detecting the genetic control points of gene expression (eQTLs) in the human atrial
      fibroblast. The investigator and many others have shown that tissue-specific eQTLs can be
      robustly identified at genome-wide significance in segregating populations of ~200. In this
      study the investigator propose eQTL association analysis in humans, which have previously
      been successfully performed in cohorts of less than 1000 subjects. The general applicability
      of this approach has been validated in multiple studies across multiple tissues in cohorts of
      between 200-1000 subjects.Based on published imaging genetic studies that have been
      successfully applied in small cohorts (<500) and the success of echo-based, semi-quantitative
      studies of ventricular dimensions, the investigator are confident that our quantitative
      studies of 750 individuals are powered to detect genome wide significant loci for the traits
      under study.

      Despite intensive research there is a critical gap in our knowledge in the mechanisms
      underlying atrial fibrillation, which is a major cause of stroke and heart failure and
      increasingly common as it is a disease of the elderly. This project will address this
      important gap in our knowledge and provide new insights into disease pathogenesis with the
      goal of stratifying participants to prevent strokes and for treating the underlying
      substrate.
