        -  Determine the effectiveness and toxic effects of intensive salvage therapy and
           radiotherapy in previously irradiated patients with recurrent head and neck cancer.

        -  Determine the feasibility and effectiveness of amifostine at limiting or minimizing side
           effects of repeat irradiation in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo surgical resection of gross disease (if not already done) followed
      by 4-6 weeks of rest. Patients receive radiotherapy over 5 consecutive days on weeks 1, 2, 4,
      and 5. Intravenous cisplatin is administered on days 1-3 and 29-31. Intravenous amifostine is
      administered 15-30 minutes prior to radiotherapy and cisplatin therapy. Patients receive
      fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4 and 29-32.

      Patients are followed every month for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 1
      year, every 4 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
