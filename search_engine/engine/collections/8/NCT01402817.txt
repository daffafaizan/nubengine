      who have clinically significant plexiform tumors. A secondary goal of this study will be to
      seek to improve on current and novel tools to evaluate tumor response of plexiform tumors.
      The rationale for this study arises from the response of human and murine NF1 cells to
      Sutent® in vitro and the clinical response of individuals with NF1 using a similar
      drug,Gleevec®. Following enrollment adult subjects will start receiving Sutent® by month at
      25mg once a day for 28 days. Subjects will then have 14 days without taking any Sutent®. If
      tolerated the dose will be increased to 37.5mg and 50mg with the same regimen (28 days of
      taking medication followed by 14 without). Children will be started on a dose of 10mg/m2/day
      once a day for 28 days. They will then have 14 days without taking any Sutent®. If tolerated
      the dose will be increased to 15mg/m2/day.
