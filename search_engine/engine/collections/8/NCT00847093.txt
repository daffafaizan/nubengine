      will receive a local anesthetic injection in the area of the tailbone (normal procedure for
      this surgery). At the end of the operation your child will go to the recovery room. At the
      time of discharge from the hospital, we will be give you the prescription for acetaminophen
      with codeine (standard medication given for children undergoing surgery on the penis), and a
      tube of cream. The tube will contain either a local anesthetic cream (LMX-4)Â® or a cream with
      no active medicine (a placebo). We want you to apply the cream to the base of your son's
      penis every six hours. Which kind of tube you get will be picked randomly (similar to drawing
      numbers out of a hat) by a computer. Thirty minutes after applying the study cream, or sooner
      if needed, if you think your child needs pain medication, you may give the oral pain medicine
      (Tylenol with codeine as prescribed on the bottle). You may continue to apply the cream and
      give oral medicine every six hours as long as you think your child needs pain medicine for a
      maximum of 7 days. The cream can also be re-applied when changing diapers to facilitate the
      continued use of the cream even if it is sooner than the suggested 6 hours.
