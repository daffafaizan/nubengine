      anti-incontinence procedures, but offer the benefit of shorter operating times, less voiding
      dysfunction, lower morbidity and are usually done as an outpatient procedure. Despite the
      advantages, about 35% of patients are discharged home with indwelling catheters. Indwelling
      catheters are bothersome for patients, costly to the healthcare system and are a source of
      significant morbidity. The challenge for pelvic surgeons performing anti-incontinence
      procedures is avoiding postoperative urinary retention while minimizing the use of catheters
      and their associated risks. A commonly described backfill-assisted voiding trial is used as a
      means of evaluating bladder function postoperatively. This method uses a low post-void
      residual as a specific criterion for discharge without a catheter. However, the validity of
      this method has never been critically evaluated. Our recent observational study suggests that
      patients may be safely discharged without a catheter after a midurethral sling procedure
      based on their subjective assessment of the force of stream. Our proposed study expands on
      this pilot data using a randomized trial to evaluate two methods of post-operative voiding
      evaluation. The results may lead to a decreased use of indwelling catheters and their
      associated morbidity after outpatient sling surgery.
