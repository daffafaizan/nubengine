      pelvic floor reconstruction. Unfortunately, safety and efficacy data have lagged behind the
      technical advancements. No randomized controlled trials of different vaginal apical
      suspension procedures have been reported. The use of synthetic vaginal mesh has evolved due
      to the 20-30% recurrence rate for conventional pelvic reconstructive surgeries. This trial
      will examine synthetic monofilament polypropylene mesh use in vaginal reconstructive surgery
      for vaginal Stage II-IV prolapse.
