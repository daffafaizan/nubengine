    
      This is an open-label, single arm, single center study in patients with hypertension in the
      setting of an acute brain injury. Approximately 15 patients admitted to the Columbia
      University Neurocritical Care Unit with intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage or
      traumatic brain injury who are hypertensive and have neuromonitoring probes placed in the
      course of standard clinical management will be enrolled over a 10-12 month period. Patients
      must be hypertensive (SBP > 180mmHg), or have an elevated cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP)
      above 100 mm Hg and the decision has been made by the ICU team to initiate an infusion of
      clevidipine to maintain CPP within a target range of 70-90 mm Hg and SBP between 120-180mmHg.

      Due to the decreased level of consciousness from their injury, the majority of patients will
      be unable to provide consent. Informed consent will be sought from a surrogate according to
      Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) guidelines (See section 8-Informed Consent
      Process).

      Clevidipine infusion will be used to treat hypertension within the first 24 hours after
      injury. Multi-modality brain monitoring will have been placed as standard care.

      Clevidipine will be infused at an initial rate of 2.0 mg/h for the first 90 seconds and
      titrated to effect (CPP target range of 70-90 mm Hg) by either doubling or reducing the dose
      by 50% every 90 seconds (with dose ranging 0-32mg/h of continuous IV infusion).

      At the end of 6 hours clevidipine treatment, the treating physician will make a determination
      to continue clinical management with clevidipine or change to another antihypertensive
      medication.

      Patients will be monitored at 24 hours after infusion for liver function, triglycerides and
      lipase.
