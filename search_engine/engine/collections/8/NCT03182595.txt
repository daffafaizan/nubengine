      sulfonation, the investigators need more information on SULTs. Studies of in vivo sulfonation
      in humans are lacking, although they are of key importance in assessing the functional
      consequences of individual variation. In our current study, the investigators will start by
      developing an HPLC method of quantifying SULT1A1 activity using paracetamol as probe
      substrate and studying intraindividual variation in healthy adults. Advantages of using
      paracetamol as a probe substrate for in vivo phenotyping of SULT1A1 include: wide safety
      margin for in vivo use, easy and ready administration of the drug, significant metabolism by
      the enzyme of interest, short half---life, linear pharmacokinetics over a wide concentration
      range and a limited number of metabolites, quantifiable in plasma.15,24 In a subsequent
      study, the investigators plan to study interindividual variation in a larger sample,
      including subjects with chronic disease and on medication.The investigators expect to provide
      a valuable new tool to explore the clinical significance of variation of SULT1A1 activity,
      the most important SULT on drug metabolism.
