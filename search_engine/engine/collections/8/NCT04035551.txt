      and outcomes of patients receiving home parenteral nutrition therapy. Data collected will
      include information on patient safety, clinical outcomes, resource utilization and
      health-related quality of life (QOL). The goals of this Registry include:

        -  To better understand the patients and populations requiring HPN in the U.S.

        -  To measure clinical outcomes associated with HPN

        -  To identify areas for focused quality improvement interventions

        -  To provide opportunity for resource allocation identification and improvement
