        -  Overall quality of bowel cleansing for each of the three segments of the colon
           (ascending, transverse, and descending) as measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation
           Score (BBPS), a validated numerical scale for bowel cleanse (0-3 for each colon segment;
           0-9 total score) (6).

        -  Patient satisfaction, as measured by a questionnaire administered by a study
           investigator via follow-up phone call after completion of the colonic irrigation and
           subsequent colonoscopy.
