      cancer survivors are those diagnosed at age 45 or younger. This study includes stress
      reducing interventions known to have a positive influence on physical and psychological
      functioning that will be administered through recorded videos. The interventions include
      watching an hour-long video stress-reduction class, each week, for 8 weeks and practicing
      guided meditations. YBCS participants will be randomly assigned to either an 8-week
      mindfulness-based stress reduction course designed for couples (C-MBSR) or an 8-week
      mindfulness-based stress reduction course for individuals. At the end of the study all
      participants (regardless of what assignment) will receive both sets of stress-reducing
      videos. Partners of the YBCS assigned to the couples condition will also be asked to watch
      the 8 C-MBSR videos. Some young breast cancer survivor participants and their partners will
      be asked to complete provide salivary cortisol and all survivors and partners will be asked
      to complete the 4 surveys.
