      according to a pre-programmed treatment protocol. ReX-C addresses poor adherence to
      medication therapy by providing real-time, reliable adherence data to caregivers and timely,
      personalized reminders to patients.

      During the study, the use of ReX-C system to receive medications will be compared to Standard
      of Care. Patients' adherence will be evaluated for both methods.
