      corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). They can be hemorrhagic or ischemic and are partly due
      to the difficulty of balancing heparin therapy. Few pediatric studies have estimated the
      incidence and risk factors for these lesions. In addition, the developmental monitoring and
      quality of life of these children is not systematic or standardized, and their long-term
      outcome deserves to be better evaluated.

      The purpose of this retrospective study is to describe the different types of acute
      neurologic complications in children who underwent veno-veinous or veno-arterial ECMO and
      their risk factors. The study is being conducted at Necker Enfants Malades hospital between
      2014 and 2019. The research will also assess the child health at 1 year after withdrawal from
      ECMO and in 2020 in terms of neurological state and quality of life.
