      93-3 and LNH 98-3B studies.

      To date, the ACVBP regimen is considered as the reference induction treatment of the GELA in
      patients with 2-3 adverse prognostic factors. Indeed neither NCVBP regimen (LNH87-2) nor
      ECVBP (LNH93-3) led to increase the complete remission rate. More recently, the addition of
      etoposide to doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (LNH98-3B) did not enhanced the complete
      remission rate with more toxicity. In patients < 60 years with 2-3 adverse prognostic factors
      the complete remission rate remained less than 65% in all these studies. Consequently,
      increasing the quality of response remains a major goal in this group of young patients with
      adverse prognostic factors.

      It has been shown that the addition of rituximab to CHOP regimen significantly improved the
      CR rate in elderly patients with previously untreated large B-cell lymphoma when compared
      with CHOP alone without additional toxicities. Moreover, event-free survival and overall
      survival were found to be longer in the R-CHOP group. The present trial will evaluate the
      response rate obtained after four cycles of ACVBP combined to rituximab (R-ACVBP) before high
      dose therapy consolidative treatment in this group of higher risk patients.

      The LNH87-2 study has shown that intensive consolidation treatment with autologous stem cell
      support was beneficial to high risk patients in good response after a full induction phase.
      The long-term results of this randomised study prompted us to consider high dose therapy as
      the best consolidative option for these patients.
