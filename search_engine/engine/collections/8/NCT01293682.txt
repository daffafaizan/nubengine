      density. Calcitriol is efficacious in maintaining proper bone health and muscle mass among
      the general population, but little research has been done on breast cancer patients. In
      addition, calcitriol may be effective in reducing tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, while
      increasing tumor apoptosis. Each of those factors could have beneficial effects on breast
      cancer outcomes.
