      of Venetoclax and dexamethasone in relapsed or refractory amyloid light chain (AL)
      amyloidosis patients. AL amyloidosis is a disease involving cells called plasma cells that
      make antibodies as part of your immune system. These cells are not functioning the way they
      are supposed to and they start to produce abnormal fragments of antibodies that are toxic to
      your body and can form amyloid. The antibody fragments are called "light chains." They can
      cause damage to organs, especially the kidneys, heart, skin, liver, and lungs.

      Researchers are looking for ways to stop the light chains from being formed to treat the
      disease. Under some circumstances, patients will receive chemotherapy drugs in order to
      manage the disease. However, researchers do not know what the best treatment is for relapsed
      AL amyloidosis, so the researchers are testing new drugs or new combinations of drugs to see
      what will work best with the least side effects.

      The researchers want to find out if Venetoclax (ABT-199) in addition to dexamethasone will
      reduce or eliminate AL amyloidosis plasma cells. In this study, varying doses of Venetoclax
      will be given to determine the maximum tolerated and safe dose for further study. The
      researchers may also gain a better understanding of whether Venetoclax and dexamethasone can
      counter the plasma cell disease that causes AL amyloidosis.
