      I. Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden from baseline (within 60
      days of diagnosis) to 12 months after diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer treated with
      curative-intent.

      SECONDARY OBJECTVIES:

      I. Evaluate reported access and utilization of financial services (i.e. financial counselor,
      navigator, social workers) and its association to financial burden in the first 12 months
      after diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer treated with curative-intent.

      II. Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden and employment limitations
      from baseline (within 60 days of diagnosis) to 3, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis of colon
      or rectal cancer treated with curative-intent.

      III. Evaluate long term outcomes at 24 months after diagnosis including financial burden,
      employment limitations and adherence to clinical follow-up guidelines.

      IV. Evaluate the change of quality-of-life outcome (QoL) from baseline to 12 months and its
      association with predictors.

      V. Evaluate the change in level of self-reported financial burden from baseline to 12 months
      using alternate measures of financial burden (i.e. impact of cost questions and single item
      from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] questionnaire [Q]30).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires over 20-60 minutes at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, and 24
      months after cancer diagnosis.
