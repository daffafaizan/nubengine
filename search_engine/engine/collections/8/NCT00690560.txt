      Primary

        -  Determine event-free survival of patients with large B-cell lymphoma treated with CHOP-R
           followed by consolidation therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine overall survival.

        -  Evaluate relapse-free survival for patients achieving complete or partial response.

        -  Determine the rate of disease progression.

        -  Determine response rate at the end of study therapy.

        -  Assess the toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive the CHOP-R regimen comprising doxorubicin
           hydrochloride IV, vincristine IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and rituximab IV on day 1 and
           prednisone IV on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 2 courses.

      Patients who achieve complete or partial response, as assessed by PET/CT scan, receive a
      third course of induction therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive rituximab IV on days -8 to 0 and yttrium Y 90
           ibritumomab tiuxetan IV on day 0.
