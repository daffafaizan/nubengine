           Therapy(SBRT) of a metastatic site in metastatic esophageal cancer patients.

        2. To induce the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of therapy, SBRT and
           thymalfasin for heavily pretreated, metastatic esophageal cancer patients; Eligible are
           patients with metastatic esphageal cancer who have achieved stable disease or have
           disease progression after systemic therapy (surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy) and
           have at least two measurable sites of metastatic lesions. Extent of metastatic disease
           is recorded both at CT and PET/CT scanning. Radiation is given during combined therapy
           to one of the lesions, 25Gy in 5 fractions over one week interval with SBRT, conformally
           to maximally spare normal tissue or organ. Thymalfasin treatment is given twice a week
           with an interval of 3-4 days each week for a total of 8 weeks. Tumor response is
           evaluated by assessing clinical and CT/MRI response for all of the measurable metastatic
           sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum two-stage Phase II Simon design is
           used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be treated in Stage one; if there
           are no tumor responses, the trial will be terminated. If there are one or more tumor
           responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an additional 19 patients.
