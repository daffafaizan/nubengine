    
      General objective:

      To assess the causes of acute undifferentiated febrile illness and evaluation of biomarkers
      for differentiation of bacterial and viral infections among outpatients at University of
      Gondar (UOG) Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia

      Specific objectives

        1. To determine the number of malaria cases, bacterial infections (by blood culture and
           polymearase chain reaction (PCR) for Rickettsia and Borrelia), and arboviral infections
           (DENV, YFV, CHIKV) among all acute febrile patients

        2. To evaluate the diagnostic performance different assays (RDT, RT-(reverse
           transcriptase)PCR, ELISA) for the diagnosis of DENV

        3. To evaluate the qualitative detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Myxovirus
           resistance protein (MxA) (by FebriDx RDT) and quantitative CRP detection for
           differentiating bacterial and viral infections

      Study design, population, materials and methods: a cross-sectional cohort study on febrile
      patients presenting with acute fever at the emergency ward of the UOG hospital from June to
      August 2019. Clinical and epidemiological data will be recorded in a pseudo-anonymized and
      collected using an electronic data collection tool (KoBoToolbox). Blood will be collected for
      RDT testing, blood culture, PCR and serum for ELISA and RT-PCR.

      Sample size: 200 acute febrile patients

      Expected results and relevance: Evaluation of the causes of acute febrile illness and the
      role of biomarkers in differentiating viral and bacterial infections will increase the
      awareness of circulating pathogens and improve patient management. This evidence will
      contribute to a more rational use of laboratory diagnostic tests, antibiotics and
      antimalarial treatment.
