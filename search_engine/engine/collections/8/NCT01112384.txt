        1. - To determine the efficacy of SB939 in translocation associated sarcoma patients.

        2. - To determine response duration, stable disease rate and progression free survival.

        3. - To evaluate toxicity of SB939.

        4. - To investigate potential molecular factors predictive of response.

      60mg SB939 will be given every other day 3 times a week for 3 weeks followed by a week off.
      Patients may receive a maximum of 12 cycles if they have a response to treatment in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease may
      continue therapy for a maximum of 6 cycles.
