      in Singapore and worldwide. However, due to acute ischaemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) to the
      liver at the time of surgery, patients still experience significant morbidity and mortality.
      Therefore, novel therapies are required to protect the liver against acute IRI during partial
      hepatectomy. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) using transient limb ischaemia/reperfusion
      has been shown to protect the liver in experimental animal studies. In the ERIC-LIVER trial
      the investigators investigate whether RIC can reduce liver injury and preserve liver function
      in patients with HCC undergoing partial hepatectomy.

      50 patients with HCC undergoing partial hepatectomy will be randomised to receive either RIC
      (four-5 minute arm cuff inflations/deflations) or sham control (four-5 minute arm cuff
      simulated inflations/deflations) after induction of anesthesia and prior to surgical
      incision. The primary endpoint of the study will be acute liver injury assessed by serum
      transaminases measured at 24 hours post-resection. Secondary endpoints will include liver
      function in subset of patients (N=24, assessed by indocyanine green [ICG] clearance measured
      at 24 hours post-resection), incid ence of liver failure, episodes of confirmed sepsis, acute
      kidney injury, intensive care unit and hospital stay, and quality of life.
