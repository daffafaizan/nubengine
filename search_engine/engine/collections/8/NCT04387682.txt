      among the top 10 leading cancers in Taiwan. This research aimed to explore whether increased
      anti-tumor immunity for OSCCs reduces the recurrence rate or improves survival. We first
      identified CD33+/CD11b+/HLA-DR-/low/CD14+/- as myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) surface
      markers by using flow cytometry to compare the MDSC frequency of OSCCs with blood samples
      from healthy donors (HDs). We then re-confirmed the suppression of T cell proliferation and
      function achieved by co-culturing with OSCC-educated MDSCs.

      Clinically, we enrolled 100 OSCC patients and 30 HDs to demonstrate a significantly higher
      MDSC frequency in OSCC candidates than HDs. To determine whether using β-glucan as a
      food-grade supplement promotes the immune system of OSCC patients, we further allocated OSCC
      patients with and without pre-surgical administration of whole glucan particle β-glucan to
      groups II and III, respectively (with group I being the HDs).

      We will explore whether using particulate β-glucan as a food-grade supplement promotes the
      human immune system via subversion of immune modulatory MDSCs. Lastly, we correlated
      clinicopathological parameters with MDSCs and β-glucan administration to examine anti-tumor
      immunity, and to predict the therapeutic effect and prognosis in OSCC patients.
