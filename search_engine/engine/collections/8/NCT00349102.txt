        -  Validation of the Lent-Soma toxicity scale by comparison to the RTOG scale,

        -  Response rate at different times: week 6-8, 1 year and 2 years after the end of
           irradiation,

        -  Progression-free survival rate at 1 year and 2 years after the end of irradiation

        -  Confirmation of the predictive value of serum cytokine levels (IL-6 and IL-10) during
           irradiation for the occurrence of early radiation toxicity, and analysis of the
           correlation between these serum levels at inclusion and the expression polymorphism of
           candidate genes.
