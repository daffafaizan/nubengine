      form of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), characterized by a neuroendocrine pattern called
      "sympathoadrenal imbalance" (SAI), in children. In SAI, plasma adrenaline levels increase
      progressively and to a greater extent than do norepinephrine levels, before syncope. The SAI
      pattern is associated with skeletal muscle vasodilation. We hypothesize that increased
      occupation of beta-2 adrenoceptors in skeletal muscle by high circulating adrenaline levels
      precipitates the neurocirculatory positive feedback loop that leads to NCS.

      Study Population: Patients 10-17 years old with a history of NCS.

      Design: In a randomized, crossover-design, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we test
      the above hypothesis by using the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol. We
      predict that in patients with previously documented SAI and tilt-evoked NCS, propranolol
      treatment will improve orthostatic tolerance during follow-up tilt table testing.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure will be whether propranolol therapy can prevent
      tilt induced syncope; or significant hypotension and/or bradycardia preceding development of
      clinical symptoms (greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg decrease in blood pressure or heart rate
      less than 40 beats/min). Secondary dependent measures that will be assessed are occurrence of
      duration of tilt tolerance (if tilt induced symptoms are provoked), hemodynamic and
      neurochemical indices of SAI, and patient questionnaire reports.
