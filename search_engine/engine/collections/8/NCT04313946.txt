        -  specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scanning chest radiographs in the
           emergency department (triage) in patients with suspected respiratory symptoms (fever,
           cough, myalgia) of coronavirus infection COVID 19;

        -  the objective is to create and validate a software solution that discriminates on the
           basis of the chest x-ray between Covid-19 pneumonitis and influenza;

        -  this software will be trained by introducing X-Rays from patients with/without COVID-19
           pneumonitis and/or flu pneumonitis;

        -  the same AI algorithm will run on future X-Ray scans for predicting possible COVID-19
           pneumonitis
