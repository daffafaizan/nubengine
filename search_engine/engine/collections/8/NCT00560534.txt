      injected bolus of contrast medium can be difficult, especially in the legs. As the result of
      the WB-MRA depends on the contrast medium only being in the arteries at the time of
      examination, the use of venous compression is a possible way of overcoming the problem of
      early venous filling, that can hamper the diagnostic value of the examination. Venous
      compression is performed with a blod pressure cuff around the thighs. It is inflated to
      subsystolic pressure (45 mm Hg). This elevated pressure leads to filling of the lower leg
      arteries and late venous filling.
