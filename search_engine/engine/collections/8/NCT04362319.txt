      affected, with more than 5000 patients infected in the whole country as of 20th April, 2020.
      Many anaesthesiology clinicians, who are at the frontlines of managing Covid-19 patients,
      face increased workload, in addition to psychological stress from managing these patients,
      with stress also coming from being exposed to the risk of cross infection. Hence, they are
      possibly at high risk of burnout and depression. In such a time of increased stress, we also
      seek to find out the prevalence of medical errors by anaesthetic clinicians during this
      pandemic, and whether the medical errors are associated with burnout. Factors associated with
      burnout, depression and medical errors will also be evaluated.
