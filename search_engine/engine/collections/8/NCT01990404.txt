      scale of 3/10 or lower) 15 minutes after randomisation. Secondary endpoints are treatment
      safety and adverse events, time to analgesia and duration of analgesia. This study will
      expect 108 patients assigned in two parallel groups, defined by a randomization scheme. Four
      sites will participate to the research. Eligible patients with a numeric rating scale (NRS)
      score higher than 6/10 are randomly allocated to receive either MEOPA, or medical air.
      Neither the investigator nor the nurse knows the treatment. Pain score will be measured at
      baseline and every 5 minutes until pain relief will be obtained. The safety evaluation will
      include non invasive monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation by pulse
      oximetry (SpO2) and adverse events collection.
