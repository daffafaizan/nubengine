      women over 18 years undergoing unilateral or bilateral breast reconstruction. Women were
      originally randomized 50/50 to either the DIEP or SIEA group. Due to only about 60-70% of
      patients randomized to the SIEA group actually receiving the SIEA procedure, the weight of
      the randomization has now been changed to 70/30 (SIEA/DIEP) for the remainder of the study
      (approx. 40/110 recruited patients waiting for their OR). Objective isokinetic abdominal
      strength testing is being done pre-operatively and 3, 6 and 12 months post-operatively. A
      self-administered validated abdominal wall and breast outcome questionnaire (Breast-Q) is
      also given preoperatively and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively in . Secondary outcomes
      measured include: fat necrosis, abdominal wound breakdown, flap loss and seroma rate. Fat
      necrosis is detected using ultrasonography. Abdominal wound breakdown is measured using
      calipers. Seroma rates are tabulated and drainage volumes measured. Statistical analyses
      include a combination of parametric and non-parametric tests.
