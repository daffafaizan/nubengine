        -  Determine the 4-month progression-free and overall survival of patients with progressive
           low-grade neuroendocrine tumors treated with vatalanib and octreotide.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on tumor markers (e.g., chromogranin A, 5-HIAA, and
           gastrin) in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vatalanib once daily on days 1- 28 and octreotide* intramuscularly or
      IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients on a stable dose (i.e., no changes in dosage within the past 3 months) of
      octreotide before study entry remain on their current dose and schedule during study
      participation; patients who experience hypersensitivity and/or toxicity to octreotide may
      receive vatalanib alone.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-44 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
