      provides a higher concentration and thereby a smaller volume to be administered. ZomaJet
      Vision X is a needle-free injection system. It sends a thin jet of ZOMACTON through the skin
      and into the subcutaneous tissue without the use of a needle. The mode of administration is
      referred to as "transjection". By use of ZomaJet Vision X, both transjection and
      reconstitution of ZOMACTON 10 mg can be done without using a needle. The rationale of the
      study is to describe the local tolerability of the new ZOMACTON 10 mg administered by ZomaJet
      Vision X.
