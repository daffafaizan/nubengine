      3,000 Chinese patients. Two subtypes of patients will be enrolled: I, acute disabling
      ischemic stroke (<24 hours of symptoms onset); II, acute TIA (<24 hours of symptoms onset).

      Patients will be randomized into 3 groups:

      Ⅰ Receiving a 75 mg dose of clopidogrel and 75mg dose of aspirin from day 1 to day 21, with
      placebo apixaban twice daily.

      Ⅱ Receiving a 2.5-mg twice daily of apixaban, with placebo clopidogrel and placebo aspirin
      from day 1 to day 21.

      Ⅲ Receiving a 5-mg twice daily of apixaban, with placebo clopidogrel and placebo aspirin from
      day 1 to day 21.

      From day 22 to 3 months, all patients will receive 75-mg dose of clopidogrel long-term
      antiplatelet therapy.

      The primary efficacy end point is percentage of patients with new stroke (ischemic or
      hemorrhage) at 90 days.
