      populations, other stages of the lifespan also provide opportunities for prevention. With
      older people, there are certain risk and aetiological factors, which become more prominent
      and require preventive action at that point in the lifespan. The aim of this study is to
      determine the efficacy of various interventions in preventing depression and cognitive
      decline among older people who are at high risk of developing major depression because they
      are currently suffering from depressive symptoms.

      The study has three interventions; i) folate and vitamin B12, ii) physical activity; and iii)
      mental health literacy. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive each combination
      of the interventions (folate and vitamin B12 or placebo, physical activity intervention
      programme or physical activity no-intervention control, mental health literacy intervention
      [containing written modules with information about depression that is relevant to older
      people] or mental health literacy no-intervention control group). Participants will receive
      these interventions over a two-year period with regular assessments across that time period.
