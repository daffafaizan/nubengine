      tuberculosis (TB) is associated with reduced survival and increased rate of opportunistic
      infections compared to CD4-matched controls. Mounting evidence from immunologic and virologic
      studies supports the concept of co-pathogenesis, in which cytokines such as tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (TNF alpha) are over-expressed during the course of TB and stimulate viral
      replication in latently infected cells, possibly leading to greater viral load.

      Glucocorticoids are potent inhibitors of cytokines, including TNF, and clinicians have
      extensive experiences with their use in HIV infection. Although corticosteroid use in HIV
      infection has a record of safety, the safety and bioavailability of corticosteroids in HIV/TB
      coinfection has not been established.

      This study evaluated the change in viral load and CD4 count in HIV infected patients with TB
      who were treated with oral prednisolone. The study found that the viral load increased
      slightly when prednisolone was administered and that patients receiving prednisolone cleared
      their tuberculosis more rapidly. Although there was some benefit to using prednisolone in
      these patients, the benefit was short-lived and was gone within 4 months of stopping therapy.
