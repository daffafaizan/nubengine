    
      This is an interventional, controlled, open-label and monocentric study. 80 patients are
      planned to be included.

      After written informed consent will be obtained, the patients will be randomized in two arms:

        -  Intervention arm: intervention of a pharmacist who will explain bDMARDs management.

        -  Control arm, without intervention.

      Two primary end-points are defined:

        1. the changes from baseline to M6 in the patients' knowledge score about subcutaneous
           bDMARD management

        2. the changes from baseline to M6 in Medication Possession Ratio (MPR)

      As secondary end-points, the changes in disease activity and patients' satisfaction regarding
      the pharmacists' intervention are evaluated.
