      I. To evaluate the complete response rate of concurrent chemotherapy radiation treatment
      combined with avelumab for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity (adverse event profile) of concurrent chemotherapy
      radiation treatment combined with avelumab.

      II. To evaluate quality of life (QoL) at 1 year of concurrent chemotherapy radiation
      treatment combined with avelumab.

      III. To evaluate progression-free survival and relapse-free survival at 1 year with
      concurrent chemotherapy radiation treatment combined with avelumab.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore biomarkers that may predict response to avelumab in the muscle invasive
      population.

      II. To evaluate the association of tumor mutational burden with response to concurrent chemo-
      radiation and immunotherapy.

      III. To evaluate whether concurrent chemoradiation and immunotherapy after maximal
      transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is associated with a decrease in circulating
      Bim+CD11a^high PD-1+CD8+ T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 14 days for a total of
      10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 29 days
      after the first dose of avelumab, participants receive either fluorouracil IV on days 1-5 and
      16-20 during radiation therapy (RT) and mitomycin IV on day 1 of course 3, or cisplatin IV
      starting on day 1 of courses 3-5 for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, 6, 9, and 12
      months.
