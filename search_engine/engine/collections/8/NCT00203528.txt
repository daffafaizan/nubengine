      completed: the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), general medical history,
      psychiatric history, physical examination, physicians assessment, and laboratory tests.
      Patients who are on mood stabilizers and oral neuroleptics prior to study enrollment and are
      not responding fully to these medications will be tapered off of the medication for a washout
      period of 48 hours. After the completion of screening, only patients who are determined to be
      eligible for the study will be randomized to study medication (divalproex or risperidone) in
      a 1:1 double-blind fashion. Scheduled study visits will occur every two weeks for a total of
      12 weeks. Assessments for each visit, from the baseline visit to the week 12 visit are as
      follows: the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF),
      Alcohol and Drug Use Inventory, clinician alcohol and drug use scales, self report scales,
      adverse events, vital signs and weight, concomitant medications, urine drug screen, and study
      medication accountability. Designated research staff will complete assessments weekly.
      Investigators will be blinded to laboratory tests completed at week 2, 4, and 12 visits.
      Patients randomized to Depakote ER will begin 500mg BID on day of randomization and remain on
      this dose for 5 days, then on day 6 increase to 20mg/kg to achieve valproic acid levels of
      80-100 (blinded laboratory reporting). Patients randomized to risperidone, initially start
      with 2mg QD with an increase to 4mg at day 5 and increase (as tolerated or required) up to
      6mg/d.
