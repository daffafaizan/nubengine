      randomized into two groups in a cross-over fashion to have either continuous or cyclical
      stimulation for a total of three months. Following this, the trial will be unblinded and
      open-label follow up will continue for another nine months. Device use as per standard
      practice continues after the end of the trial.

      If the hypothesis is proven correct, this will provide proof of concept that cyclical
      stimulation for the treatment of essential tremor results in improved battery life, reduced
      number of operations for battery changes, reduction in stimulation side-effects and enhancing
      quality of life.
