      neuropsychiatric problems, such as sleep disturbance and PTSD. This study evaluates a novel
      neuromodulation intervention, light emitting diodes (LED), for treatment of patients with
      TBI. LED is a noninvasive, non-thermal, painless treatment, which does not involve any
      needles or any form of surgery. LED treatment improves cellular activity of the brain tissue
      that has been damaged by TBI. Half of the study participants will receive active LED
      treatment, and a control group will receive sham LED. This study takes place in Boston,
      Massachusetts: at the VA Boston Healthcare System.
