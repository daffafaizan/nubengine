bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexusa rare case of bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexusin a five-and-a-half-year old hydrocephalic girl is pre-sented.the tumor encountered at autopsy was not suspectedduring life, the existing hydrocephalus being attributedto either cytomegalic inclusion disease or toxoplasmosis.after post mortem examination, it was evident thatthe hydrocephalus was due to two factors; hypersecretionfrom the tumor itself, and obstruction at the level of thesylvian aqueduct by a delicate, tense, translucent mem-brane.an interesting and uncommon additional feature ofthis case was the presence, within the choroidal papillo-ma, of well-formed haversian bone.a plea is made for regularly considering papilloma ofthe choroid plexus in the differential diagnosis of hydro-cephalus in children, for here, early diagnosis and treat-ment might conceivably result in total cure.
