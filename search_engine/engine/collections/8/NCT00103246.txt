        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of photodynamic therapy using topically delivered
           silicon phthalocyanine 4 in participants with actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease,
           squamous cell or basal cell skin cancer, or stage IA, IB, IIA, or IIB mycosis fungoides.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this therapy with emphasis on whether it induces
           photosensitivity in non-treated sites in these participants .

        -  Determine the antitumor mechanism of this therapy, by monitoring tissue changes via
           clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and other biochemical markers, in these
           participants.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the dose of this therapy that results in highest clearing
           rates in these participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants receive topical silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4). One hour later, participants
      undergo photodynamic therapy. Treatment repeats weekly for up to 3 weeks (up to 3 total
      treatments for the same lesion OR up to 3 lesions treated if multiple lesions are present).

      Cohorts of 3 participants receive escalating doses of Pc 4 and visible light until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 1 of 3 participants experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Three additional participants
      are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study therapy, participants are followed for up to 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-45 participants will be accrued for this study.
