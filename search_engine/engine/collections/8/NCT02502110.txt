      whether rosuvastatin 20mg/d could decrease early AF recurrence in patients with paroxysmal AF
      after radiofrequency catheter ablation. 346 patients with paroxysmal AF are planned to be
      enrolled. The patients are randomized to receive oral rosuvastatin 20mg/d or control therapy
      from 7 days before operation and last for 3 months. The early AF recurrence within 90 days
      after ablation and the changes of 4 inflammatory markers including white blood cell count,
      hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-Î± and safety indicators will be observed. The study is aim to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin on decreasing early recurrence in patients with
      paroxysmal AF and discuss its mechanisms of action.
