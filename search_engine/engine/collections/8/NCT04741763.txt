      automobile injury or fatality (driver, passenger or pedestrian) associated with motor vehicle
      accidents has been determined to increase with age, as a result of the complex interplay of
      age-related declines in vision, motor and cognitive functioning. However, basic visual
      function is the foundation for higher order processing whether it is visual spatial or
      cognitive. Four recent studies reflect the cost of poor vision on driving.
      (www.visionimpactinstitute.org). For example, visual impairment among European drivers was
      examined in 2422 drivers from 5 European countries. Visual acuity, visual field, contrast
      sensitivity, glare sensitivity, and useful field of view were tested. Visual functions not
      included in the current licensing standards were found to be more impaired among drivers
      (compared to those functions legally required). Elderly drivers are particularly vulnerable
      to sensory visual impairment when driving at night, as they suffer declines in both Contrast
      sensitivity (CS), Glare Disability (GD) and Glare Recovery (GR).6

      Justification for study involving humans

      Carotenoid science is well developed with respect to the safe utilization of dietary lutein
      (L) /zeaxanthin (Zx) as studied by the National Institute of Health (NEI). The recently
      published NEI AREDS2 study- May 2013, further substantiated the safety and usefulness of
      prescribing the carotenoids (10 mg L / 2 mg Zx) in patients at high risk of AMD. 7
      Significantly, the average American and veteran population are typically low dose consumer of
      these carotenoids (1 to 2 mg/day for the average American).
