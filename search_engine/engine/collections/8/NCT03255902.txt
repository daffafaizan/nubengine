    
      The intervention in Family Routines - Healthy Families contains an established and effective
      parent skills training curriculum called "The Incredible Years," uniquely integrated with a
      newly developed family evening routine component e.g., family dinner time and evening
      routine, to promote improved metabolic control. The investigator will assess outcomes during
      and at one week post intervention. Outcome measures will include family routine, specifically
      the time between the dinner and bedtime glucose check, parent bedtime decision making, and
      child overnight glucose control. In addition, parental quality of life and receptiveness to
      the intervention will be assessed.
