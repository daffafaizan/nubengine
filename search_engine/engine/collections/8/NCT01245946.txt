    
      -  There will be a randomized, controlled, single blind comparison study of PDT with
           5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) 20% versus conventional therapy consisting of topical 0.1%
           adapalene plus doxycycline 100 mg/day orally in patients with moderate inflammatory
           acne.

        -  Be sought from all patients written informed consent prior to study entry.

        -  For sample size calculation, we assumed that the correlation is the same in both groups
           and is relatively low (0.01), the number of lesions per subject is equal in both groups
           with a mean of 100 and low variance, which take 1 control per case and that. Whereas the
           percentage of improvement in the control group is 0.6 and expected in the treatment
           group is 0.7 yields a sample size of 23 patients in the treatment group and 23 new
           controls.

      Interventions:

      Patients will be randomized to receive:

        1. ALA-PDT: In 23 patients applied 20% ALA solution in the affected area for 1.5 hours.
           Subsequently irradiated with noncoherent red light (lamp Waldmann PDT 1200; wavelength
           590-700 nm) with irradiance of 70 mW/cm2 and total dose or fluence of 37 J/cm2 for 7-9
           minutes. From the sixth week will begin nightly topical adapalene 0.1% gel.

        2. Standard therapy:

      In 23 patients applied topical adapalene 0.1% gel at night for 12 weeks plus doxycycline 100
      mg / day for 6 weeks.
