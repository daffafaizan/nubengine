        -  Determine the treatment-related mortality in patients with imatinib mesylate-resistant
           chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning
           comprising fludarabine, alemtuzumab, and total-body irradiation followed by
           T-cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation allogeneic
           T-cell infusion.

        -  Determine if donor engraftment can be safely established using partial T-cell depletion
           with additional T-cell infusions in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 5-6 hours on day -8 and fludarabine IV on days
      -4 to -2. Patients undergo total-body irradiation followed by T-cell-depleted (CD34+
      selected) allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive allogeneic T-cell
      infusion on days 30 and 60. Patients also receive cyclosporine twice daily beginning on day
      -3 and continuing until day 100 followed by a taper until day 177.
