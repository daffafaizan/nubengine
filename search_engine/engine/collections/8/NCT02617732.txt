      and microvascular diseases. Large prospective clinical studies have shown a strong
      relationship between time-averaged mean levels of glycemia as measured by HbA1c and diabetes
      complications. However, in recent years several pieces of evidence indicated that glucose
      variability may also contribute to the development of diabetes complications. Thus, glucose
      variability may become a new target in treatment of diabetes. Traditional Chinese medicine，a
      kind of multitargeted compound, may contribute to maintaining blood glucose homeostasis in
      diabetes.

      Tianqi capsule(Chinese herbs extract) is a Chinese patent medicine approved to treat T2DM in
      China. Previous clinical studies have shown that Tianqi capsule could lower blood glucose
      measured by HbA1c. What's more, Tianqi capsule has also been proved to improve the
      glycometabolism and lipid metabolism in T2DM and IGT.

      This research adopts a randomized, open, parallel double blind, placebo controlled clinical
      method. The patients, meeting eligibility criteria, are divided into experimental group and
      placebo group and treated for 12 weeks . A main outcome，glucose variability is detected by
      continuous blood glucose monitoring system which could obtain continuous and comprehensive
      blood glucose by "glucose sensor". The influence of Tianqi capsule on glucose variability in
      type 2 diabetes will be evaluated.
