      very good clinical response at treatment initiation. However, relapses at GC tapering are
      frequent. GCA population is elderly, frequently over 80 years, and is especially affected by
      GC-related side effects, that increase proportionally with treatment duration. Thus,
      metabolic, musculo-skeletal, infectious or neuro-psychiatric complications are frequent
      during prolonged GC use.

      After GC introduction, gradual tapering is scheduled, provided the disease remains clinically
      and biologically controlled. In France, guidelines recommend tapering GC on an 18-24 months
      timeframe, while other countries, such as the USA, usually taper GC over a shorter period,
      often 6-8 months. Few comparative data exist on the relapse rates or the GC-related side
      effects in both settings. In this prospective multicenter study, two GC-tapering schedules
      are planned: patients in one arm (short treatment) will be treated for 28 weeks, while
      patients in the second arm will be treated for 52 weeks. Each starting dose of GC and
      tapering doses will be adapted to body weight. The primary endpoint is to compare the
      remission rate without relapse at W52 between the two groups and the secondary endpoints are:
      1) cumulative GC doses at W52; 2) GC-related side effects and 3) number of relapses (minor
      and severe) in both arms at W52.

      The results of this study might considerably modify future French clinical practice if
      investigators confirm that a shorter GC treatment does not significantly impact the disease
      course while reducing GC-related side effects.
