      of immune system stimulation is the determinant factor for patient response to BCG.
      Immunological markers for BCG-response could be helpful for urologists especially in the era
      of BCG shortage.

      Objectives: To assess the predictive performance of different immunological markers on
      BCG-response in high risk NMIBC BCG-na√Øve patients.
