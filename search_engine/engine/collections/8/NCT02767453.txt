      literature. Drains have been used with the intention of decreasing infection, ecchymoses, and
      frequency of dressing changes. Some have reported a corresponding decrease in hematocrit for
      patients receiving post-op drainage leading to increased transfusion needs. Given that no
      clinical benefit has been consistently documented regarding drain usage in knee and hip
      arthroplasty, they are no longer routinely used in those operations. The use of such drainage
      systems in shoulder arthroplasty, however, has not been studied and the benefit of drain use
      in regards to patient outcomes is questionable. As such, the study is a prospective
      investigation comparing outcomes in two groups of total shoulder arthroplasty patients, those
      receiving a drain at the time of surgery and those without a drain. The short-term outcome
      measurements include peri-operative hematocrit and hemoglobin, infection rate, hematoma
      development, transfusion requirement, ecchymosis and wound complication. Long-term outcomes
      include shoulder functional scores as measured by post-operative visits and any need for
      revision shoulder surgery.
