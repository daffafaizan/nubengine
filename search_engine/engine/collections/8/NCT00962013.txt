      revision total hip arthroplasty, as well as in the presence of severe proximal bone loss.
      This study evaluates the System in revision cases only. The stems are intended to be used
      with Stryker Orthopaedics femoral heads, unipolar and bipolar components, and acetabular
      components. These femoral stems are designed to be press fit into the proximal femur.

      In addition to demonstrating survivorship at 5 years, this study will seek to gain
      information on four secondary objectives: radiographic stability, Harris Hip Scores, SF-36
      general well-being assessment, and safety profile.
