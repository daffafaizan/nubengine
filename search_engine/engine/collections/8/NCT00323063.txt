      Primary

        -  Compare time to progression in patients with previously treated locally advanced or
           metastatic breast cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride with vs without imatinib
           mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the efficacy of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 3 and 10.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 3 and 10 and oral imatinib
           mesylate once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
