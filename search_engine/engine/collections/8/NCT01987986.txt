      enroll approximately 144 women between the ages of 18 and 45 in the United States. Treatment
      effectiveness will be evaluated by investigator and patient assessments, as well as 3-D
      photographic imaging techniques. Once the safety and local tolerability profile from the
      first stage has been found to be acceptable subjects will be enrolled in stage 2. After an
      interim safety and local tolerability review was completed of all subjects in stage 1, it was
      determined that enrollment in stage 2 is acceptable and has been initiated.
