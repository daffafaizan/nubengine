      if this treatment modality provides symptomatic relief of pain, stiffness, and abnormal gait
      and balance in a variety of conditions. The study will compare a specific mechanism of
      motion, whole-body periodic acceleration (WBPA), that has been shown to increase the release
      of beneficial mediators from the vascular endothelium into the circulation, to a control
      condition of slow passive motion that promotes relaxation but does not increase release of
      beneficial mediators into the circulation. The study tests the efficacy and safety of a
      commercially available device that consists of a motion platform, called Exer-RestÂ©, that is
      capable of producing both types of motion to be tested. In this investigation, 15 subjects
      will be randomly assigned to either procedure for 10 treatments for 2 weeks followed by a
      one-week "wash-out" period. Then the opposite treatment will be employed for two weeks.
