      solving training for disease management and school functioning. In 4 sessions offered over
      the course of one day, families (patient, caregivers, and school-age siblings) will work
      together and individually to learn and apply the problem solving skills training model to
      relevant examples and family-specific problems, culminating in an outline of family goals to
      target after the intervention. The three booster phone calls will provide support to families
      in implementing the problem-solving model by addressing and refining goals and
      trouble-shooting barriers to implementation. Children and caregivers completed measures at
      baseline (prior to intervention participation) and 6 months later.
