    
      A total of 15 patients will be enrolled into the study. This is a 3 year randomized
      controlled study with the primary endpoint at 1 year. Secondary safety and efficacy endpoints
      will be evaluated in year 2 and year 3.

      Patients will be randomly enrolled into 1 of 3 groups:

      Group 1: Dexamethasone administered up to every 3 months Group 2: Dexamethasone administered
      up to every 6 months Group 3: Sham

      Patients will be evaluated on a monthly basis with ETDRS visual acuity, intraocular pressure,
      fundus examination and OCT.

      Ozurdex (dexamethasone) or Sham Procedure will be performed on Day 0. All patients will be
      evaluated monthly thereafter. One month following initial injection/sham, patients will be
      evaluated for focal or grid laser treatment if the investigator feels the patient will
      benefit.

      Re-implantation of Ozurdex may occur at any time > 3 months following last injection in group
      1 and > 6 months following last injection in group 2 if any of the following conditions are
      met:

        1. Increase of > 50 microns from the best previous CRT measurement

        2. Recurrence of intraretinal cystic edema

        3. Persistent intraretinal cystic edema

      At 13 months, patients in the sham group will be eligible for Ozurdex implantation if initial
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. These patients would follow re-implantation guidelines
      of group 2 (up to every 6 months).
