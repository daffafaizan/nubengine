      Americans. Peripheral nerve stimulation via acupuncture has been shown to directly decrease
      alcohol craving and self-administration. TheraNova has developed the Empower Neuromodulation
      System, a non-invasive, portable transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device
      intended to stimulate peripheral nerves for the treatment of AUD. In this study, we will
      conduct a cross-over, home-use study in participants with AUD. Participants will have a
      one-week control period with no treatment followed by two weeks of twice daily treatment with
      the Empower device. We will evaluate endpoints for safety and effectiveness.
