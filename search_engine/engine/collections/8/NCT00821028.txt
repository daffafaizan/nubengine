      hindered by high restenosis rates. Paclitaxel inhibits restenosis in coronary arteries, and a
      few studies suggest it may be effective in reducing restenosis rates in peripheral arteries.
      The investigators hypothesize that delivering paclitaxel through an irrigating catheter will
      be superior in preventing restenosis.
