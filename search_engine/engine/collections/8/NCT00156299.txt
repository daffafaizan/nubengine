      Primary

        -  Determine temporal changes in leukemic cell NF-kB activity when choline magnesium
           trisalicylate is administered during induction chemotherapy in patients with newly
           diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine patterns of leukemic cell gene expression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine if NF-kB modulation results in enhanced apoptosis in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral choline magnesium trisalicylate every 8 hours for 48 hours or
      dexamethasone every 6 hours for 48 hours plus choline magnesium trisalicylate every 8 hours
      for 48 hours during induction chemotherapy as determined by the primary physician.

      Blood is collected at baseline, 24 hours, and 48 hours to assess for changes in NF-kB
      expression, apoptosis, and gene expression in leukemic cells.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
