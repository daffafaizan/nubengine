      which theoretically may prove to be more effective for recalcitrant wet AMD and therefore may
      demonstrate a positive impact on visual acuity and the foveal anatomy of subjects who have a
      history of a less than optimal anatomical and visual response to multiple intravitreal
      injections of 2.0mg (super-dose) ranibizumab. Based on the anatomical data from the VIEW1 and
      VIEW2 trials, approximately 70% of VEGF-Trap eye patients had no evidence of fluid on OCT
      compared to approximately 55% of ranibizumab patients. One potential interpretation of this
      clinical data is that the increased binding affinity and longer half-life of VEGF-Trap eye
      result in the resolution of more fluid for a longer duration of effect.

      Patients to be enrolled in this study have a history of requiring monthly dosing of
      ranibizumab 2.0mg to achieve maximum resolution of fluid on OCT and increased visual acuity.
      These patients initially showed minimal fluid resolution visual acuity gains while treated
      with Lucentis (0.5mg ranibizumab) and were subsequently treated with 2.0mg monthly. It is
      expected that treating these same patients with 2.0mg EYLEAâ„¢ (aflibercept injection for eye)
      will maintain the fluid resolution on OCT and visual acuity gains previously requiring a
      super-dose of ranibizumab.
