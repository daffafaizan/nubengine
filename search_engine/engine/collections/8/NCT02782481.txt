    
      This phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group clinical study
      will be conducted in 150 subjects with idiopathic PD who are experiencing motor complications
      despite optimized anti-PD therapy.

      The study will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of continuous SC infusion
      (16 weeks) of ND0612 compared with placebo infusion. The treatment period will be comprised
      of a 4-week adjustment period during which time the ND0612 infusion dose will remain constant
      and the oral LD/DDI dose can be decreased or increased back up to the Baseline levels. All
      other anti-PD treatments must remain constant. During the maintenance period (Weeks 5 to 16)
      all anti-PD medication including the ND0612/placebo should remain constant.
