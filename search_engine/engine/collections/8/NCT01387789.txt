    
      This study was designed to evaluate adalimumab therapy in Malaysia on participants' Quality
      of Life (QoL) using non-invasive epidemiological methods like the Health Assessment
      Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), the Health Assessment Questionnaire Visual Analog
      Scale (HAQ-VAS), and the Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36). The primary
      objective of the study was to evaluate the changes in QoL outcomes in anti -TNF naïve
      Malaysian RA patients after 6 months of adalimumab treatment. The secondary objectives of
      this study were to evaluate the changes on QoL outcomes after 1 month and 3 months of
      adalimumab treatment; and provide an assessment of the safety and tolerability of adalimumab
      in anti TNF naïve Malaysian Rheumatoid Arthritis patients.
