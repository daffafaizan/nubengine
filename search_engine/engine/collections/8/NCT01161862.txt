    
      To test the safety and efficacy of our control system in the bi-hormonal configuration in
      regulating BG in adults (18 years of age or older) and in children (12-17 years of age) with
      type 1 diabetes based on interstitial-fluid (ISF) glucose data from a CGM. Experiments will
      be 51 hours in length incorporating 6 meals and two (night) sleep periods. In order to
      evaluate the effect of exercise on BG control, the last 48 hours of the experiment will be
      divided into two 24 hour blocks, the second of which will contain a period of structured
      exercise near the beginning of the block.
