    
      This is a single-center cross-sectional imaging study in patients with localized lung cancer
      undergoing immunotherapy with or without stereotactic radiation therapy as part of the
      companion clinical trial (NCT03217071; Pembrolizumab With and Without Radiotherapy for
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer). Each patient will undergo a single [18F]F-AraG PET exam as part
      of this study. [18F]F-AraG will be administered at a single time point intravenously prior to
      PET imaging. Whole-body PET will be acquired along with a whole body low dose CT (PET/CT)
      used for attenuation correction and anatomic localization of [18F]F-AraG uptake, SUV
      calculation, and volumetric selection for radiomic analyses.

      A total of 20 patients will be enrolled over an accrual period of approximately 12 months.
      Approximately 10 patients will be enrolled in the immunotherapy alone cohort and
      approximately 10 patients will be enrolled in the immunotherapy and stereotactic radiation
      therapy cohort.

      Patients will be evaluated one day and one week via telephone after each radiopharmaceutical
      injection for safety follow-up. All adverse events will be recorded. Due to the noninvasive
      and non-therapeutic nature of the study, potential risks of the study are anticipated to be
      low.
