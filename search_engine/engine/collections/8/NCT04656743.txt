      Post-operative knee pain management has become a challenge to provide early relief and
      pain-free postoperative care to the patient.

      Pain management has become a priority for management as a daycare procedure. Patients
      operated as a daycare procedure should have minimal postoperative pain which influences the
      timing of discharge. Pain is due to multifactorial causes such as irritation of free nerve
      endings of the joint capsule, synovial tissue, anterior fat pad.

      Effective pain relief allows the patients to obtain early knee mobilization and optimal
      rehabilitation and thus improves patient satisfaction.

      Postoperative pain after knee arthroscopy is commonly moderate to severe and can affect the
      patient's activity level and satisfaction.

      In an effort to provide safe, effective, and long-lasting post-arthroscopy pain relief, many
      drug regimens were injected intra-articularly including local anesthetics alone or with
      additive drugs to prolong and improve the quality of postoperative analgesia.

      Genicular nerve block (GNB) and ablation have been used for managing chronic pain from knee
      osteoarthritis with good success.
