      Hospital, depending on the diagnosis leading to NOA. To date, there are no known parameters
      known to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful sperm recovery.

      MRI is performed on men prior to the operation, and the objective is to compare the
      functional parameters assessed by magnetic resonance imaging between the group of men with
      positive and the men with negative sperm recovery in testicular microdissection sperm
      extraction (MD-TESE).
