      monitoring and therapy. In fact, ICU admissions are dependent on the severity of illness and
      the ICU capacity of the health-care system. Therefore, many patients with confirmed COVID-19
      with RT-PCR and/or suspected COVID-19 were hospitalized in ICUs with a limited number of
      beds. This ambiguity can result in both contamination risk to uninfected patients and
      occupancy rate of the limited ICU beds. Hence, it may be need a new scoring system for
      contagious critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological
      and clinical features of 75 critically ill patients due to COVID-19 and to compare confirmed
      COVID-19 cases with suspected COVID-19 cases in our critical care units.
