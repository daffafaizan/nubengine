    
      The study will be submitted for approval by the Ethics Committee of Faculty of Medicine,
      Assiut University, and written informed consent will be obtained from all patients prior to
      enrollment. The study population will be selected from patients attending the Department of
      Orthopedics and Trauma surgery, Assiut University hospitals.

      A total of 104 patients treated with single level degenerative or lytic lumbar
      Spondylolisthesis indicated for PLF will be included ,patients will be classified into 2
      groups Group A:Of 52 patients PLF + autologus bone graft+ PRP Group B: Of 52 patients treated
      with PLF + autologus bone graft only without adding PRP

      Methods of evaluation

        -  History taking.

        -  Full clinical and neurological examination

        -  Radiological evaluation by x-ray (antero posterior, lateral, and, CT scans provide
           excellent views of bony detail) and MRI if needed Method of randomization By shuffling
           cards method the candidate patient will choose one card from104 cards 52 of them
           containing fusion with PRP and the other 52 contaning Fusion without PRP

      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP is obtained using a two-stage centrifugation process:

      Whole blood sample will be drawn from the participant and be collected in a sterile tube
      containing anticoagulant (sodium citrate 3.8% or Ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid). The tube
      will be centrifuged at 160xg relative centrifugal force (about 1000 round per minute) for 10
      min in a centrifugal apparatus. The first spin will separate platelet poor plasma at the top
      from red blood cells at the bottom and platelet rich plasma above (mixed with the white blood
      cells in the buffy coat). The Platelet poor plasma, Platelet rich plasma and a few red blood
      cells will be aspirated into a new tube, mixed and in the second spin, the tube will be
      centrifuged at 400xg relative centrifugal form (about 1500 round per minute) for another 10
      minutes. The upper section will consist of Platelet poor plasma and the Platelet rich plasma
      will be collected at the bottom of the tube in the form of pellet. Then, Platelet poor plasma
      and Platelet rich plasma will be aspirated and mixed (discarding the upper portion). Prior to
      treatment calcium chloride 3% will be added to activate platelets specimen
