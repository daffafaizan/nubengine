      identified with genetic testing. The psychological impact of genetic testing and the rates of
      psychological distress in patients undergoing genetic testing vary between 6 to 65% depending
      on socio-demographic or clinical characteristics.

      The effect of baseline distress on post-testing assessments tended to decrease or show little
      change over time, it may be important to target patients with high baseline distress for
      additional counseling or intervention both pre-testing and over time.The most robust
      predictor of future distress is baseline distress, additional factors were associated with
      cancer risk perception considering family history of cancer, patient's affected or unaffected
      with cancer, etc...

      It is relevant to developing and providing care for these patients, it has been demonstrated
      that enhanced genetic counseling with clinical psychologist to facilitate decision-making
      process, managing family concerns promoting their communication with and involvement of
      family members, and attending their emotional distress, can be beneficial. Also, cancer
      genetic counseling may promote patient use of personal resources and enhance patient health
      literacy about their syndrome.
