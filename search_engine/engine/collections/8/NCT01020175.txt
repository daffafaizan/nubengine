      filgrastim-mobilized PBPCT compared with allogeneic BMT in patients with standard-risk
      leukemia. A total of 350 patients between 18 and 55 years of age with acute leukemias in
      remission or chronic myelogenous leukemia in first chronic phase were randomized to receive
      either filgrastim-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells or bone marrow cells from
      HLA-identical sibling donors after standard high-dose chemoradiotherapy. The study was
      approved by the ethics committees of all participating centers, and all patients and donors
      gave informed consent before any study-related procedure was performed. Donor-recipient pairs
      were randomized to undergo either BMT or PBPCT. Randomization was carried out centrally at
      the International Institute for Drug Development (id2), Brussels, Belgium, and used the
      minimization method to allocate donor and recipient to allogeneic BMT or PBPCT. The
      randomization strata were as follows: diagnosis (chronic myeloid leukemia [CML] vs other
      diseases), sex mismatch of donor and recipient, and whether the donor was female and
      nulliparous. Follow-up visits were scheduled for 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after the date of
      transplantation.

      Neutrophil and platelet recovery occurred significantly faster after transplantation of
      peripheral blood progenitor cells than after bone marrow transplantation. Acute graft versus
      host disease of grades II-IV was significantly more frequent in recipients of peripheral
      blood progenitor cells than in recipients of marrow cells The cumulative incidence of chronic
      graft versus host disease was higher with peripheral blood progenitor cells than with bone
      marrow cells
