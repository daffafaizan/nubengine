    
      This study is a prospective, non-concurrent, multicenter study to compare the clinical and
      radiographic outcomes of smooth PEEK, 3D-printed titanium, and Porous PEEK interbody implants
      when used with cancellous allograft chips with BMA or cellular allograft in subjects who
      undergo XLIF surgery at one or two levels. To minimize selection bias, all consecutive
      patients at a given site who meet eligibility requirements will be asked to consent to
      participate in the study. These patients will present with degenerative conditions in the
      lumbar spine that are amenable to surgical treatment and will be screened prior to study
      enrollment. Once enrolled into the study, subjects will undergo their XLIF operation using
      one of the 3 previously noted interbody implants based on a non-concurrent enrollment
      schedule. The bone graft material used inside the interbody implant will be randomly assigned
      between cancellous allograft chips with BMA or cellular allograft prior to surgery based on
      surgeon investigators' equipoise for the effectiveness of both bone graft materials. Subjects
      will be followed for 24 months following surgery to determine the number of study subjects
      that are solidly fused at or before 24 months postoperatively.
