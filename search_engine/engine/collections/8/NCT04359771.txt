      bilateral DME. The patients were recruited from the Retina Clinic at Kasr Al Ainy Hospital,
      Cairo University. The study's protocol was reviewed and approved by board of the
      ophthalmology department, Cairo University, and was in concordance with the tents of
      Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients were informed about the study's objectives,
      methodology, risks and benefits. A written informed consent was obtained from every patient
      included in this study.Preliminary examination was in the form of slit-lamp examination,
      fundus examination, intra ocular pressure measurement, and best corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) measurement. A spectral domain optical coherence tomogram (OCT) scan was performed to
      all patients before treatment to measure the central retinal thickness (CRT). The eyes were
      randomized into two groups; one eye (right eye) of each patient was treated with 577-nm
      yellow MPL and the other eye (left eye) of the same patient with Infrared 810-nm diode MPL.
      Changes in the BCVA and CRT were measured after treatment at 1 and 3 months of follow up.
