    
      Design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Objective: to determine the effects of manipulative
      techniques for the ervicothoracic spine versus home exercises on pain, disability, and range
      of movement in patients with unilateral shoulder inmingement syndrome.

      Methods and Measures: ninety-two subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.

      Intervention: For 5-weeks, the groups 1 will undergo tratment comprising manipulative
      protocol techniques for the cervicothoracic spine (2/week) and the group 2 will develop a
      home exercise (2/week).

      Main Outcome Measures: Intensity of pain, disability, and range of motion data will be
      collected at baseline, and 24hr after the last therapy application. Mixed-model analyses of
      variance will be used to examine the effects of the treatment on each outcome measure.
