      treated metastatic osteosarcoma when treated with ecteinascidin 743. II. Further characterize
      the toxicity profile and the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of this drug in
      this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV over 24 hours.
      Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression for at least 2-6 courses. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive at least
      2 additional courses after documented CR. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression. All patients are followed until death after disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-33 patients will be accrued for this study.
