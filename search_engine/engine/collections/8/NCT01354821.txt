      morbidity and the costs of endovascular versus conventional surgical repair of type 1, 2 and
      3 thoracal abdominal aortic aneurysms.

      The primary goal of the study is to demonstrate a significant drop in 30-day mortality and
      life threatening morbidity in the endovascular arm of the study. Our hypothesis, derived from
      the literature, that the average 30-days mortality is 3% after endovascular repair and 10%
      after open surgery justifies the design of a prospective study between endovascular therapy
      (50 patients (amendment n.5 - 9/07/2013) treated in 5 University hospitals with significant
      experience of the technique) and open repair (220 similar patients analyzed from the national
      database of the MOH).

      In-hospital morbidity are similarly expected to be lower in the endovascular group. The
      investigators also wish to demonstrate that endovascular repair does not represent a
      significant overcost, as compared to open repair. The cost of the implantable medical device
      (IMD), of follow-up screening, and of eventual repeated interventions should be compensated
      by a reduced stay in intensive care unit ICU, and by a reduced in-hospital length of stay.
