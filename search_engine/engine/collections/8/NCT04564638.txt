      clinical (UC duration, extent of the disease, prior Cs usage, disease severity, laboratory
      results at index flare) and treatment data (occurrence of new flares, need for further Cs
      therapy; CyA, thiopurines, biologics or colectomy during follow-up). The diagnosis of UC was
      made on basis of clinical history, symptoms, endoscopic and histological features. Disease
      extent was categorized by the Montreal classification and the severity of the flare was
      assessed by Mayo scoring system based on clinical and endoscopic characteristics. ASUC was
      characterized by more than six bloody stools/day along with any of the following:
      tachycardia, elevated temperature, anemia and/or ESR >30 mm/h (Truelove and WittÂ´s
      criteria)5. Alleviation of UC was defined as clinical response to intravenous corticosteroids
      with no need for colectomy or rescue therapy at the same hospitalization as the index flare.
      Relapse was defined as requiring further corticosteroid treatment, rehospitalization,
      rescue-therapy, or colectomy later in follow-up.
