      in both the adult as the paediatric population. In the adult population, six Randomised
      Controlled Trial (RCTs) showed that an appendectomy could be avoided in 40-76% of the
      patients at the end of their follow-up period. Despite the fact that some patients need to
      undergo a delayed appendectomy, it has been demonstrated in systematic reviews that
      non-operative treatment strategy is associated with a significant reduction in complications,
      faster recovery and return to work, less pain duration and analgesic medication consumption.
      In children only pilot data is yet available. Short-term success rates of this strategy
      (including of the investigators own pilot cohort study) are between the 83-92%. Long-term
      results (one-year follow-up) are available from two studies; 62-75% did not require an
      appendectomy. No large RCT have yet been conducted in the paediatric population. It is
      therefore essential to generate high quality empirical evidence regarding this strategy in
      this subset of patients.
