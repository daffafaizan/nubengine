    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the activity of a smoothened, frizzled class receptor (SMO) and PTCH1
      inhibitor in patients with meningiomas harboring SMO mutations as measured by 6-month
      progression free survival (PFS) and response rate.

      II. To determine the activity of a FAK inhibitor in patients with meningiomas harboring
      neurofibromin 2 (NF2) mutations as measured by 6-month PFS and response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival and progression-free survival of SMO and FAK inhibitors in
      patients with meningioma.

      II. To determine adverse event rates of SMO and FAK inhibitors in patients with meningioma.

      III. To determine the activity of SMO and FAK inhibitor as measured by response rate by
      central radiology review.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate genetic biomarkers in meningioma. II. To evaluate dynamic contrast enhanced
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during treatment with SMO and FAK inhibitors for meningioma.

      III. To evaluate volumetric response by central radiology review.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms based on their mutation status.

      ARM A (SMO/PTCH1 mutation): Patients receive vismodegib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B (NF2 mutation): Patients receive FAK inhibitor GSK2256098 PO twice daily (BID). Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for a maximum of
      5 years from registration.
