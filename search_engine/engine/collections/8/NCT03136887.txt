    
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered the most beneficial and cost-effective treatment
      for end-stage knee arthritis and is the most frequently performed joint replacement surgery.
      TKA is also indicated for earlier osteoarthritis (OA) interventions, such as osteotomy or
      unicompartmental replacement, when additional treatment is warranted. One device option
      available once the decision is made to perform TKA is the JOURNEY II XR Total Knee System.
      The JOURNEY II XR Total Knee System is designed to be a more "natural feeling" total knee
      replacement. The goal of the JOURNEY II XR is to enable a higher level of function after
      total knee replacement by relieving pain and restoring the ability to participate in active
      lifestyles. The main aim of this study is to generate long-term safety and performance data
      for the JOURNEYâ„¢ II XR Total Knee System. Effectiveness information such as short- and
      long-term function, subject satisfaction, and quality of life will also be measured.
