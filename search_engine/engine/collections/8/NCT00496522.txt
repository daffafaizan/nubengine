      challenging location and nearness to critical structures within the brain.

      Pathology will be confirmed prior to discussion of the study.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive proton beam
      therapy, no sooner than 2 weeks after the last surgery to remove tumor. You will receive
      proton beam therapy once a day for about 35 treatments (7 weeks). Treatment will be given for
      5 days in a row each week (except for Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) at the Proton Center
      in Houston. The whole process should take up to 1 hour each day.

      If your doctor feels it is necessary, the proton beam therapy may be combined with standard
      photon therapy.

      After the proton beam, and possibly photon beam, therapy, you will be asked to come in for
      study follow-up visits every year, until the study is completed. At these visits, you will
      have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, blood draws (less than 1 teaspoon) to monitor
      your pituitary function, and neuropsychological testing. For the neuropsychological testing,
      you will be interviewed and tested by a neuropsychologist to evaluate your memory, fluency
      (the ability to talk and form words) complex thinking ability, planning ability, and
      coordination. These tests could last from 1-2 hours. You will also have eye exams performed
      by an ophthalmologist from MD Anderson and hearing exams. It is anticipated that it will take
      about 5 years to complete this study.

      This is an investigational study. The proton beam center and its treatment are approved by
      the FDA for patient use. A total of up to 15 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at MD Anderson.
