      young adults. Because few data are available regarding post-vaccination syncope, evidence
      regarding presyncope and syncope after blood donation provides useful insight. Based on
      studies of blood donors, acute water loading fifteen minutes prior to vaccination with 500 mL
      of water might reduce the risk of syncope. However, the degree to which hydration attenuates
      the risk of post-vaccination syncope or presyncope is unknown. Furthermore, little is known
      about the acceptability of pre-vaccination hydration to adolescents and young adults.

      The objective of this study is to conduct a study to evaluate the acceptability and impact of
      oral hydration to prevent presyncope following vaccination in adolescents and young adults 11
      through 21 years of age. The primary objectives are to determine if pre-vaccination hydration
      decreases the rate of presyncope in adolescents and young adults receiving at least one
      intra-muscular (IM) vaccine and to determine if pre-vaccination hydration is acceptable to
      adolescents and young adults.

      This is a randomized controlled open-label study in adolescents and young adults receiving at
      least one IM vaccine. Vaccine administration will be part of routine care and will not be a
      study procedure. Adolescents and young adults 11- through 21 years of age will be eligible
      for participation. Minimal subject exclusion criteria will be used to best reflect how
      pre-vaccination hydration could be used outside of the controlled trial setting. For all
      primary and secondary objectives, data will be collected before and after vaccination, with
      data collection to be completed on the day of enrollment.
