    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      of EGFR/EGFRvIII inhibitor WSD0922-FU (WSD0922-FU) in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma,
      IDH wildtype (GBM), anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH wildtype (AA) and central nervous system
      (CNS) metastases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to
      WSD0922-FU.

      II. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial overall response rate (ORR),
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to Response Assessment in
      Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for GBM/AA and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 for NSCLC.

      III. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial disease control rate (DCR)
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and
      RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.

      IV. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial duration of response (DOR)
      and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA and
      RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.

      V. To assess anti-tumor activity: intracranial and extracranial progression-free survival
      (PFS) and change in tumor size compared with baseline according to RANO criteria for GBM/AA
      and RECIST 1.1 for NSCLC.

      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the presence and/or identity of the drug metabolites of WSD0922-FU, and the
      concentrations of these in the plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tumor.

      II. To assess plasma concentration of WSD0922-FU and metabolite SN16110801P1 and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters after single and multiple doses of WSD0922-FU.

      III. To assess the brain tumor pharmacokinetics of WSD0922-FU and SN16110801P1 after a single
      dose of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion - Brain tumor penetration [BTP] cohort only).

      IV. To assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of WSD0922-FU and SN16110801P1 after
      multiple doses of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion - NSCLC leptomeningeal metastases [NSCLC LM]
      cohort only).

      V. To explore the impact of tumor markers (e.g. MGMT promoter methylation, EGFR mutation
      [including EGFR vIII], PTEN deletion, TP53 mutation, etc.) on clinical parameters associated
      with WSD0922-FU treatment.

      VI. To evaluate and measure pharmacodynamic biomarkers of inhibition of EGFR and downstream
      signals in tumor samples after a single dose of WSD0922-FU (Dose Expansion Cohort - BTP
      cohort only).

      VII. To evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of single dose of WSD0922-FU in
      plasma (Dose Expansion - NSCLC LM cohort only).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      DOSE ESCALATION: Patients receive WSD0922-FU orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      DOSE EXPANSION: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients with GBM/AA receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II: Patients with BTP receive a single dose of WSD0922-FU prior to surgery. Patients
      then undergo surgical resection of brain tumor. After surgery, patients receive WSD0922-FU PO
      BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT III: Patients with NSCLC LM receive WSD0922-FU PO on days 1 and 4 of cycle 0. Patients
      then receive WSD0922-FU PO BID on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, then every 2
      months until progressive disease, at progressive disease, and then every 3 months after
      progressive disease for up to 5 years.
