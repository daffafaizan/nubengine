      fulfil necessary dental treatment, and has a close relationship with dental caries and
      anxiety. Oral health status of the children was evaluated using the DMFT/dmft, PUFA/pufa, and
      OHI-S indices. In addition, the parents completed the Dental Neglect Scale (DNS) and a
      questionnaire, and the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDASf) was administered to the
      children to assess their dental anxiety.
