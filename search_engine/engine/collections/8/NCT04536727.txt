      Determine the feasibility of adapting Fit & Strong! to include affect and mood-related
      content and of employing this intervention among older adults with a range of depressive
      symptoms. 2) Begin to determine whether Fit & Strong! is efficacious as an approach for
      improving positive affect, reducing negative affect, decreasing symptoms of depression, and
      improving cognition among older adults. 3) Explore the relationship between negative/positive
      affect and symptoms of depression and maintenance of physical activity between baseline and 2
      months, in order to determine whether improved positive affect and reduced negative affect
      and depression and improved cognition are associated with an increase in physical activity.
