      two groups and will be randomly selected to receive either antibiotic therapy or placebo;
      but, the assignment of medication will not be made known to the patient or administering
      doctor. Antibiotic or placebo will be given intravenously (IV) for 30 consecutive days and
      then orally for the next 60 consecutive days.
