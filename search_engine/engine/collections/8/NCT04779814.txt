      significant burden on the healthcare system. Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) is an adjunctive
      treatment for patients with drug resistant epilepsy and is reported to reduce the frequency
      of seizures in adults and children. However, real-world data on healthcare resource
      utilization by patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy and their clinical outcomes prior
      to and post VNS device implantation in the UK are limited. The current study aims to describe
      the resource utilization and clinical outcomes prior to and following the implantation of
      different VNS devices (Demipulse速/Aspire HC速, Aspire SR速 and SenTiva速) in subjects with drug
      resistant epilepsy
