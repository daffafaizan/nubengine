      novel imaging approaches to the investigation of obesity, one of their most important risk
      factors for poor clinical outcome and chronicity. To that end, the clinical team will utilize
      the WTC Pulmonary Evaluation Unit Chest CT Imaging Archive, an already established large
      imaging database, linked to extensive related databases that include disease symptoms, both
      pre-WTC and WTC-related occupational exposures, detailed pulmonary function and longitudinal
      spirometry measurements, visual imaging classification and grading, and quantitative computer
      assisted method (QCAM) measurements of airway, pulmonary parenchymal, pleural, and
      cardiovascular abnormalities. During the course of the proposed research project, the
      clinical team will continue to enrich most sources of data with periodic updates, in order to
      accrue information on the trajectories of the different clinical, functional, and imaging
      abnormalities observed in this population, and investigate the role of key adverse risk
      factors directly, and in collaboration with other investigators. In a related project, the
      research team will focus on COPD, classifying its severity, investigating its diagnostic
      stability, progression, and transitions, characterize structural abnormalities as assessed by
      chest CT imaging, and examine the interaction of WTC-related exposure levels with tobacco
      smoking on increasing the risk of for the disease.
