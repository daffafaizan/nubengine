      surgery. It is perioperative care pathway designed to achieve early recovery and helps to
      minimize postoperative morbidity and mortality.

      These multimodal approaches focuses on enhancing recovery and reducing of surgical stress by
      minimal invasive surgery, optimized pain relief, early nutrition and ambulation.

      In postoperative, the bed rest leads to the increase in muscle loss and weakness, impairs
      pulmonary function, predisposes to venous stasis and thromboembolism, increases infection
      complications and reduces functional capacity.

      However, information on the results of Fast-track protocols in functional capacity of
      exercise during hospital stay is sparse.

      The six-minute walk test is use to measure of functional capacity of exercise in different
      populations and to detect changes after interventions. The distances traveled in two
      six-minute walk test (preoperative and postoperative) will be compared between the two groups
      (Fast-track and Conventional).

      In this trial the investigators will consider Fast-track protocol to be feasible to enhance
      functional capacity of exercise after thoracic surgery.
