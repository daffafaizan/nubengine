      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Historically, precut sphincterotomy has been
      regarded as a risk factor for post-ERCP pancreatitis. However, some evidence has suggested
      that if used at an early point during the procedure, it may actually behave as a protective
      factor.

      In high risk patients, such as those patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, pancreatic
      duct stent placement has been considered to be a prophylactic measure against pancreatitis.
      However, pancreatic duct stent placement can sometimes be a cumbersome procedure, and may
      require additional procedures (mainly if spontaneous stent dislodgment is not accomplished).
      There is no evidence comparing early precut versus pancreatic duct stent placement in
      high-risk patients.

      As a consequence, the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of early precut
      sphincterotomy versus pancreatic duct stent placement in patients presenting at least one
      risk factor for post-ERCP pancreatitis and difficult biliary cannulation.

      A single-blinded, randomized trial was undertaken. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria who
      presented with difficult biliary cannulation during ERCP were randomized to early precut or
      persistence in biliary cannulation with a sphincterotome with posterior pancreatic duct stent
      placement. The incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis as well as other complications were
      compared between groups.
