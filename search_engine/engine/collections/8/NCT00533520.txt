    
      Phase 4 study to test the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of a higher doses (1.0 mg
      and 2.0 mg) of ranibizumab versus the standard dose (0.5 mg), in adults with age related
      macular degeneration who have never been treated with ranibizumab. An additional purpose is
      to determine if the higher doses (1.0 mg and 2.0 mg) of ranibizumab can increase the time
      between doses beyond that currently needed with the 0.5 mg dose.
