      medicine and orthopedic practice. The percentage of fractures among these injuries is small,
      however many will undergo x-ray. Ottawa ankle rules (OAR) are clinical guidelines for
      determining whether to use radiography in such cases. The aim of this prospective study was
      to compare outcomes in patients handled by emergency physician according to OAR versus by an
      orthopedic resident. Also, we validated the applicability of OAR in an emergency department
      in our country.

      Methods. 92 consecutive patients with ankle injuries attending our emergency department were
      divided in two groups. The study group comprised 32 patients who arrived during the morning
      shift and were examined by an emergency physician according to OAR. Patients discharged
      without an x-ray were followed in the clinic or by telephone communication. The control group
      constituted 60 patients who were examined during the evening and night shifts by orthopedic
      residents unaware of this study.
