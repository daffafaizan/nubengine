    
      This study was designed to improve the acquisition of sufficient tissue (EUS-FNA) with
      endosonography-assisted fine needle aspiration biopsy, which has been approved and used
      worldwide for the diagnosis of digestive system diseases. The procedure to be applied in the
      study is to determine the visible tissue fragments in the sample to be taken after the
      standard EUS-FNA procedure and to compare it with the diagnosis made by the pathologist.
      Patients with a tumor detected in the digestive system and referred to the investigation unit
      for tissue diagnosis will be included in this study. The data obtained in the study will be
      collected prospectively and will be analyzed retrospectively.
