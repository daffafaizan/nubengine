        1. Investigators hypothesize that, relative to the neutral films, PFM EMG activity will
           significantly increase in response to the erotic film as measured by the labial, anal,
           and vaginal EMG probes.

        2. Investigators hypothesize that, relative to the anxiety-provoking film, PFM EMG activity
           will significantly increase in response to the erotic film as measured by the labial,
           anal, and vaginal EMG probes.

        3. Investigators hypothesize that continuously measured subjective sexual arousal (via the
           arousometer) will correlate significantly with PFM EMG activity during the erotic film.
