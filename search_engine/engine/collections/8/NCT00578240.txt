      factors contributing to and associated with progression change as the disease evolves. To
      categorize these changes we now consider the disease as a series of states. 1 The states
      represent points where an intervention might be considered to prevent cancer from developing,
      to eliminate established disease, or to delay progression. The states also represent
      clinically significant milestones that can be used to assess treatment effects.
