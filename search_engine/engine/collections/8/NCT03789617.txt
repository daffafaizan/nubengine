    
      The present study is a multi-center, single-arm, open, phase I/IIa clinical trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of EBViNT Cell when administered to patients with Epstein-Barr (EBV)
      positive NK/T-cell lymphoma.

      The present study doubles the maximum dose of 7.0x10^8 cells from phase I and administers
      three subjects with the investigational product at 1.4x10^9 cells, checks the safety for 28
      days after administration, and proceeds in accordance with the following criteria.

        -  If CTCAE grade 3 or higher adverse drug events (ADR) do not occur in the three subjects:
           Begin enrollment for phase IIa

        -  If a CTCAE grade 3 or higher ADR occurs in one of the three subjects: Enroll three more
           subjects (up to six subjects in total) and assess whether any CTCAE grade 3 or higher
           ADR occurs

             -  If a CTCAE grade 3 or higher ADR does not occur in the three additional subjects
                (1/6): Begin enrollment for phase IIa

             -  If a CTCAE grade 3 or higher ADR occurs in at least one of the three additional
                subjects (more than 2/6): Begin enrollment for phase IIa at 7.0x10^8 cells, the
                maximum dose from phase I

        -  If a CTCAE grade 3 or higher ADR occurs in two of the three subjects: Begin enrollment
           for phase IIa at 7.0x10^8 cells, the maximum dose from phase I

      Subjects participating in the present study will undergo 1) an EBV epitope screening test
      followed by 2) an eligibility assessment for clinical trial enrollment.

      Subjects who are administered with the investigational product will be monitored until
      progressive disease (PD) is confirmed or for 24 weeks (main observation period of 4 weeks +
      monitoring for 20 weeks) to evaluate the product's safety and efficacy, and will undergo
      immunological assessment.

      Radiological tests for tumor assessment will be conducted at the enrollment visit, 4 weeks, 8
      weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks and assessed by the Independent Radiology Review Committee
      (IRRC) using the Lugano criteria. To eliminate pseudo-progression, progressive disease (PD)
      will be determined by considering immunological tests, a quantitative EBV DNA assay, and
      intermediate response (IR) under LYRIC. Biopsies may be performed to achieve this.
