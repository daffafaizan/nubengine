      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of aprepitant as monotherapy for opioid-induced nausea and
           vomiting (OINV) in comparison to ondansetron hydrochloride in patients who have failed
           at least one prior anti-emetic agent/regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether control of OINV improves quality of life.

        -  To determine if control in OINV decreases pain.

        -  To determine if control in OINV improves mood.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm A: Patients receive aprepitant orally once daily for 7 days in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity or persistent grade 4 nausea and vomiting.

        -  Arm B: Patients receive ondansetron hydrochloride orally 3 times daily for 7 days in the
           absence of unacceptable toxicity or persistent grade 4 nausea and vomiting.

      Patients complete the following questionnaires: Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-General (FACT-G); Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D); and
      Brief Pain Index (BPI) at baseline and on day 7. Patients also complete symptom diaries
      documenting the following: number of episodes (an emetic episode is defined as a simple vomit
      or retch, or any number of continuous vomits or retches; distinct episodes that are separated
      by at least 1 minute) of vomiting or retching including the date and time; worst and average
      degree of nausea (recorded every 2 hours while awake during the first 24 hours after
      treatment and every 8 hours on days 1-7); and adverse events other than episodes of vomiting
      and nausea.
