      reliably identify the thoracic paravertebral space. Diffuse reflectance spectra will be
      acquired during needle advancement, with custom-made needle stylets that contain optical
      fibers.

      Main study parameters are:

        1. Successfully acquired diffuse reflectance spectra obtained in the thoracic paravertebral
           space, and spectra obtained during needle advancement.

        2. Confirmation of sonographic thoracic paravertebral localization, defined as tissue
           imaging in all locations of the needle where the diffuse reflectance spectra have been
           collected .

        3. Recordings of reaction to a small test dose of lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:200.000
           at target position for regional anesthesia (to exclude vascular localization of the
           needle)

        4. "certainty score" on a 3-point scale (1 = uncertain, 2 = certain, 3 = very certain)
           provided by the physician for assignment of the type of tissue present at the needle
           tip, based on the information available from imaging and/or aspiration and/or reaction
           to a small injection of epinephrineOther study parameters

      The endpoint of the study is a statistical analysis of the difference between diffuse
      reflectance spectra obtained at non-paravertebral and paravertebral measurement locations.
