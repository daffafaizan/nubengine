    
      This is a multi-center, single blind, randomized, cross-over study. Subject enrollment will
      continue until forty (40) eligible participants have been randomized into one of the two
      groups. Subjects will undergo baseline valuation (Visit 1) during which the stability of
      their glycemic parameters, medical treatment and medical condition will be assessed. Subjects
      meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria at Visit 2 will be implanted. Approximately three
      days prior to their implantation, subjects will be seen for their 'pre-implant' medical
      evaluation (Visit 3). One week after implant (Visit 5, Week 1)subjects will be randomized
      into one of two groups (A and B).

      "Group A" subjects will have their device programmed to deliver GCM signal including the
      setting of automatic eating detection parameters for the first 24 week period (Period 1). At
      Visit 10, (week 25 and end of Period 1), Group A subjects will have their devices turned
      "OFF" for the next 24 weeks period (Period 2). At Visit 15, (week 49 and end of Period 2),
      Group A subjects will have their devices turned "On" for the next 24 weeks period (Period 3)
      "Group B" subjects will not have their device activated for the first 24 weeks (Period 1) of
      their study. At Visit 10 (week 25 end of Period 1), Group B subjects devices will have their
      device turned "ON" (i.e. activated to deliver CGM signals) for the 24 weeks period (Period
      2). At Visit 15, (week 49 and end of Period 2), Group B subjects will have their devices
      turned "OFF" for the next 24 weeks period (Period 3).
