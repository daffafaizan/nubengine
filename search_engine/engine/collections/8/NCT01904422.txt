      control defined as a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) â‰¥ 7% at last check, with randomization
      stratified by referral center, with two parallel groups (1: 1). Diabetic patients are in
      treatment and control in Diabetes Polyclinic Medical Specialty Center of the University of
      the Andes or the medical polyclinic Joan Alsina in San Bernardo . All decompensated DM2
      patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis will receive periodontal treatment based on 2
      different periodontal treatment modalities: the first and most traditional is by spaced
      sessions by quadrant in 1 weekly session (5 sessions). The second form of treatment
      corresponds to an intensive periodontal treatment, whole mouth in 24 hours.

      All patients will be given an initial periodontal examination with manual north carolina
      periodontal probe, performed by a single operator previously calibrated.

      Periodontal status will be determine according to the classification of Page and Eke (2007)
      and periodontal wound size (PISA) will be also determine. Also, will be measured inflammatory
      mediators and cytokines in both plasma and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) by ELISA test. The
      data were entered into a medical record designed specifically for this study and the
      variables will be recorded prior and at 3 and 6 months after periodontal therapy.
