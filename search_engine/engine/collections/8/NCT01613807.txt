      maternal outcomes. Not only must fasting glucose be normalized, but clinical evidence also
      indicates that controlling postprandial hyperglycemia will significantly reduce the risk of
      adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes.

      Standard therapy to achieve near-normal glycemia in gestational diabetes involves combining
      intermediate-acting basal (NPH) insulin with rapid-acting insulin (insulin lispro), thereby
      requiring 6 daily injections. Premixed Humalog速 Mix50/50TM has the potential advantage over
      combination rapid-acting plus NPH insulin because it involves fewer injections, and those
      injections are associated with mealtime. The potential downside to the premixed formulation
      is nocturnal hypoglycemia associated with the time lag between the dinner and breakfast dose.
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Humalog速 Mix50/50TM compared to that of
      Humalog速 plus Humulin N速 insulin for the treatment of insulin-requiring patients with
      gestational diabetes mellitus, while monitoring glucose control, intrauterine growth and
      assessing pregnancy outcomes.
