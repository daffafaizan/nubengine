      CBF derangements is detrimental for the neurological outcome in both settings, but the
      management of neurologically critically ill patients does not involve CBF measure routinely.
      Cerebrovascular autoregulation, can be assessed by the cerebrovascular pressure-reactivity
      index (PRx) that point out the response of ICP to spontaneous changes in arterial blood
      pressure (ABP). Autoregulation has been proven to be a powerful protective mechanism. Adding
      together the information on CBF and autoregulation, might drive clinical strategy in
      exceptionally noteworthy and innovative way. Currently, a novel Thermal Diffusion (TDP)
      microprobe has been introduced for the continuous bedside monitoring of regional CBF: TDP is
      a promising technique in the reliable detection of flow derangements at the patient's
      bedside.

      It is a "proof of concept" study, aimed to evaluate whether the "optimal CPP", defined by the
      best PRx, corresponds to the acceptable CBF values.

      Patients admitted with the diagnosis of TBI and SAH in for whom ICP and CPP needs to be
      monitored on clinical ground will be also monitored with a TD probe and routinely tested for
      cerebral autoregulation, thus obtaining the CBF corresponding at a given the "best CPP" and
      autoregulation status.

      Continuous CBF measures and PRx monitoring may allow more accurate identification and early
      detection of adverse cerebral conditions. This approach may bring us a step closer to the
      goal of outcome improvements in patients suffering from intracranial insult.
