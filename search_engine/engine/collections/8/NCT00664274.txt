      schizophrenia. The COMT gene is functionally expressed in neural systems considered important
      in a range of healthy brain functions and brain disorders, including schizophrenia. The COMT
      Met allele has been shown to be associated with a lower activity form of COMT, and with
      better performance on neurocognitive tests, while the COMT Val allele is associated with
      poorer executive cognition. This study will investigate the relationship of COMT polymorphism
      in patients with chronic schizophrenia with the response to CRT targeting visuospatial
      processing, attention, and cognitive flexibility using MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery
      (MCCB) developed by the NIH-MATRICS initiative.
