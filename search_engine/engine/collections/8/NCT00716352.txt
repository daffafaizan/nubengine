      delivered to health care professionals can improve the use of evidence based treatments in
      the management of patients admitted to hospital with non-ST elevation Acute Coronary
      Syndrome. A total of 38 centres participated. A cluster randomised method was used and half
      of centres received the educational intervention. Patients were followed to hospital
      discharge. Patients were followed up at 6 months and longer term follow up for mortality will
      be performed through the national databases.
