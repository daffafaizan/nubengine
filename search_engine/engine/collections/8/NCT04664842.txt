      economical burdens. Studies have found that nearly 83% of chronic neck pain patients had
      changes in breathing patterns. Compensated breathing pattern by using the neck-accessory
      respiratory muscles may result in excessive muscle strains and over-activations, which may
      also contribute to develop chronic neck pain. The diaphragm is the most important respiratory
      muscle which attached to the ribs and spine, and thus has an influence on spinal stability.
      Few studies have showed that diaphragm releasing and breathing training can reduce pain and
      improve flexibility of posterior chain muscles, spinal range of motions, and ribcage
      excursions in asymptomatic adults and patients with low back pain. However, the effects in
      patients with chronic neck pain has not bee determined. Therefore, there are two main purpose
      of this study. First, to determine the relationships among diaphragm mobility, neck pain and
      dysfunction, and respiratory in patients with chronic neck pain. Second, to investigate the
      effects of diaphragm releasing, breathing training, or combined intervention on pain and
      disability in patients with chronic neck pain. It is expected to recruit 150 patients with
      chronic neck pain and 30 healthy volunteers. Patients with chronic neck pain will be randomly
      assigned to (1) manual therapy group (2) manual control group (3) breathing training group
      (4) general exercise control group (5) manual therapy combined breathing training group. Each
      participant will receive a specific intervention program depending on their group allocation.
      All participants will receive two evaluation sessions before and after the intervention
      including ultrasonography, cervical and thoracic function, respiratory functions, and
      autonomic balance.
