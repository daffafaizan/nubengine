      respiratory distress syndrome more than neonates born by vaginal delivery, and this risk
      increases for the subgroup of neonates born after elective caeserean section , i.e. before
      onset of labour , , with potentially severe implications The risk is decreasing with advanced
      gestational age and neonates born in 37 weeks are at 1.7 times more than those born at 38
      weeks , which in turn are at 2.4 times more than those born at 39 weeks If the pregnant
      female is given four intramuscular injections of 6 mg of dexamethasone , 48 hrs before
      elective caesarean section decreases the neonatal respiratory morbidity. Five studies lasting
      between 3 to 20 years with more than 1500 patients have shown no adverse effect of single
      course of antenatal corticosteroid , neither through infection of the fetus or mother nor in
      long term neurological or cognitive effect According to Cochrane Database of Systematic
      Reviews 2018 , prophylactic administration of antenatal corticosteroids appeared to reduce
      the rate of RDS by approximately 52%. It also reduced the need for NICU admission, both due
      to respiratory morbidity (by approximately 58%) and for any indication. The reduction of NICU
      admissions due to respiratory reasons is consistent with the reduction of respiratory
      morbidity after corticosteroid administration
