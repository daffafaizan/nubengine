      sedentary behavior intervention during weight loss on respiratory function. Site will enroll
      150 older (65-85 years), obese (BMI=30-45 kg/m2), sedentary men and women from EMPOWER.
      EMPOWER is a 3-group design where participants will undergo a 9-month weight loss (WL)
      intervention (6-mo intensive phase and 3-mo reduced contact phase), followed by a 9-month
      self-managed follow-up phase with minimal contact. The diet element of the interventions is
      identical across groups, but groups differ by activity intervention: 1) moderate-intensity
      aerobic exercise (WL+EX); 2) intervening on SB (WL+SitLess); or 3) (WL+EX+SitLess)
