      countries, is caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
      molecule (CFTR) and affects approximately 40 000 patients in Europe. Most, if not all,
      CF-patients develop a chronic pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.
      aeruginosa). At present it is un-known why CF-patients are highly sensitive to P. aeruginosa
      infections and, most important, no curative treatment for cystic fibrosis is available.

      Our data on CFTR-deficient mice demonstrate that the CFTR-molecule does not only function as
      a chloride-channel, but also as a transporter for sphingolipids, in particular sphingosine
      and sphingosine-1-phosphate. Deficiency of functional CFTR in CFTR-knock-out mice results in
      an alteration of the sphingolipid metabolism in pulmonary epithelial cells and an
      accumulation of cellular ceramide in these cells.

      Inhibition of ceramide release in the lung was achieved by pharmacological and genetic
      inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) that generates ceramide from sphingomyelin.
      Amitriptyline was employed to pharmacologically block the ASM genetic inhibition of the ASM
      was achieved by crossing CFTR- and ASM-deficient mice. Although the ASM is not affected in
      cystic fibrosis, an inhibition of the enzyme should block the formation of ceramide and,
      thus, normalize the increase of pulmonary ceramide caused by CFTR-deficiency.
