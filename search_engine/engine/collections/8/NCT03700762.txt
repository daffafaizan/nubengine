      of the thyroid nodule was divided into 5 grades according to gray scale. Of the five
      categories, the diagnostic values of the hypoechoic and markedly hypoechoic categories have
      been widely accepted for thyroid malignant nodules. However, distinguishing between
      hypoechoic and markedly hypoechoic categories is a subjective process and is thus influenced
      by the observer's judgement. A more objective method should be proposed to differentiate
      papillary thyroid microcarcinoma(PTMC) from small nodular goiter(NG).

      The investigators suspect the echo intensity of nodules could be reflected by values, as CT
      values reflecting the nodule density. The investigators first proposed the ultrasound
      gray-scale ratio (UGSR), namely, the ratio of lesion gray-scale value to surrounding normal
      thyroid tissue, and the previous study showed UGSR can better display the relationship of
      gray scale of PTMC or NG with surrounding normal thyroid tissue, and can make objective
      judgment of the nodules through quantitative results.

      As the absolute ultrasound grayscale value is affected by the apparatus, scan gain, dynamic
      range, frequency, and operators. The investigators would collected different data acquired
      from different parameters to explore their potential relations.
