      amount of information available, as well as the unknown reliability and applicability of
      information can be overwhelming. Studies in specific patient populations have determined that
      patients given access to personalized, on-line medical information are more satisfied with
      their care than patients provided generalized information. None of these studies have looked
      at whether this type of patient education would be helpful for pregnant women. This study is
      being done to determine whether pregnant women who have access to their own health records
      and personalized health information over the Internet are more satisfied with their prenatal
      care, and if they are more compliant with health visits and tests, compared to pregnant women
      who receive only generic pregnancy information on the Internet and from pamphlets

      Women are being randomly assigned to receive secure access to pregnancy health information
      links chosen by the centre's physicians, or to receive these links with access to their
      online personal health that includes the antenatal record and a section of their care
      planner, from the centre's electronic medical record
