        -  Determine the response rate in adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
           leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with high-dose cytarabine followed by
           clofarabine.

        -  Document the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours followed by clofarabine
           IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats for up to 4 courses (1-2 induction
           courses, 2-3 post-remission courses) in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      A cohort of 3-6 patients receives the starting dose of clofarabine. If 1 of 6 patients
      experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), a subsequent cohort of patients receives
      clofarabine at the next higher dose. If â‰¥ 2 of 6 patients experience DLT, the dose of
      cytarabine is reduced and subsequent cohorts of patients receive cytarabine at reduced doses
      and clofarabine as per the dose-escalation scheme above.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9 patients will be accrued for this study.
