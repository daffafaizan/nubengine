      This Hospital attends nearly 4500 births every year. When the COVID-19 pandemia came to
      Chile, there was no possibility to assess the seroconversion for SARS-Cov2. Currently, it
      remains unclear the seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2 in pregnant near to delivery in our country,
      also its correlation with clinical, perinatal outcomes and sociodemographic characteristics.
      The project will evaluate these features, collecting nasopharyngeal swab serology in a
      systematic manner in unselected pregnant women on labor (or a predictable delivery during
      next 24 hours). Maternal information including clinical data, obstetric history,
      comorbidities and sociodemographic characteristics acquired from medical records will be
      correlated to the seroconversion.
