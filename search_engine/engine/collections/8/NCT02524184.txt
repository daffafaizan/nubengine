    
      The study subjects will be taken placebo (first stage) and sildenafil (second stage)
      intervention for 7 days, respectively afterward.Subcutaneous fat tissue and muscle samples
      will be obtained by biopsy from some individuals and measure the browning of white adipose
      tissue and insulin signaling.The insulin sensitivity will be tested by insulin clamp assay
      before and after each intervention, respectively. In addition,blood samples for biochemical
      analysis will be obtained before and after each intervention, respectively.

      The browning of white adipose tissue will be measured by the expressions of peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), PPARγcoactivator 1α (PGC-1α), uncoupling protein 1
      (UCP-1), the second messenger cyclic guanosine-3', 5'-monophosphate (cGMP),PR domain
      containing 16 zinc finger transcription factor (Prdm16) and deiodinase, iodothyronine, type
      II (DIO2).The metabolic makers will be measured by blood pressure, heart rate, thyroid
      functions, resting metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, blood cGMP, blood insulin and blood
      glucose.
