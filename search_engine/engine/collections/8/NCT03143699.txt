      promising outcomes. Although, immediate feedback is associated with better knowledge and
      skills in short-term, few studies have assessed whether immediate feedback could impact the
      maintenance of skills. The present study aims to investigate the effect of immediate feedback
      on long-term blood pressure measurement skills. This is a randomized controlled trial
      including first year students from a Brazilian medical school, which will be randomized in
      two groups: an intervention group (submitted to a training on blood pressure measurement
      skills and an immediate feedback after their encounter with an standardized patient - SP) and
      a control group (submitted to the same training on blood pressure measurement skills, but
      with no immediate feedback after the SP encounter).

      Both groups will be trained to measure blood pressure in the same way, with a brief 4-hour
      theoretical-practical intervention. After the training, students will measure the blood
      pressure of a standardized patient and observers will evaluate them using a checklist.

      Then, students will have no other exposure to the BP training for three months and they will
      be invited again to participate in another SP encounter. Differences on BP skills after 3
      months between those exposed to immediate feedback and those not exposed to immediate
      feedback would be investigated.
