    
      Cushing Syndrome is a severe condition caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of
      glucocorticoids.

      This is a disease with high morbidity and mortality due to metabolic, cardiovascular,
      coagulative, psychiatric complications of hypercortisolism.

      The loss of circadian secretion of cortisol is one of the most sensitive and specific
      diagnostic features of Cushing's Syndrome that normalizes during remission. The evaluation of
      the circadian rhythm of cortisol is one of the diagnostic tests recommended by the guidelines
      to evaluate the state of the disease's activity.

      Studies in literature have shown several correlations between states of hypercortisolism and
      circadian secretion of melatonin, displaying reduced melatonin secretion throughout the day
      and the suppression of circadian rhythm of cortisol. However, the dynamics of the
      normalization of melatonin circadian rhythm during remission from Cushing syndrome are
      unclear.

      Therefore, the aim of our study is to evaluate the changes in circadian secretion of
      melatonin in Cushing's syndrome during active disease and during remission (3 and 6 months),
      according to the rational scientific influence of endogenous hypercortisolism on the function
      of the pineal gland. In addition, the changes in circadian secretion of cortisol, of
      mononuclear cells of the blood (PBMC) and of anthropometric-metabolic parameters, will be
      analyzed.
