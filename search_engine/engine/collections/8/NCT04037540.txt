      conservative approach. The fracture occurs especially in highly active individuals.

      The study proposes a supposition of recommending the active operational approach, which
      shortens the period of healing by 6 weeks, limitation of physical activity by 4 weeks, and
      sick leave by 2 months. It also completely eliminates the need to perform a rigid fixation of
      the extremity for 8-12 weeks.
