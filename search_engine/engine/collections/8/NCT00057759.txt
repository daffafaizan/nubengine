        -  Compare the effect of sildenafil vs placebo on erectile dysfunction in patients with
           prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and antiandrogens on RTOG-9910.

        -  Compare the overall sexual function and satisfaction of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare sexual satisfaction of partners of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare patient and partner marital adjustment after treatment with these regimens.

        -  Determine factors that may predict response to sildenafil, including age, pretreatment
           sexual function, tobacco use, and comorbidities in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to prior use of sildenafil after treatment on RTOG-9910 and level of response (No
      vs yes [unsatisfactory] vs yes [satisfactory]), International Index of Erectile Function
      (IIEF) Question #1 score (0-1 vs 2-3), and RTOG-9910 treatment arm (I vs II). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sildenafil 1 hour prior to desired sexual intercourse.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 1 hour prior to desired sexual intercourse.

      Treatment on both arms continues for 12 weeks. Patients then cross over to treatment on the
      other arm for 12 weeks.

      Quality of life, including sexual function, marital adjustment, and partner's satisfaction,
      is assessed at baseline, at 12 and 25 weeks, and at 1 year.

      Patients are followed at 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 332 patients (166 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
