      cancer. The usual sequence of an anthracycline followed by a taxane is due to the timing of
      their discovery and introduction in the treatment armamentarium. More recent evidence
      suggests that there is pre clinical as well as clinical rational for the reverse sequence.

      The neoadjuvant approach allows quick evaluation of these different treatment strategies. At
      the same time, the study will collect tissue biopsies and blood at different time points in
      order to evaluate predictive biomarkers.
