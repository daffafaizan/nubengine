    
      phase II trial assessing the feasibility of an experimental multimodal treatment combining:

        -  surgery of the MPM: extended pleurectomy/decortication (eP/D)

        -  intra-operative (intrapleural) photodynamic therapy (PDT). Briefly, each patient will
           receive porfimer sodium (PHOTOFRIN®) (2 mg/kg) 24 hours before eP/D (IV injection on 3-5
           minutes). Cutaneous light precautions will be instituted immediately and for the next 4
           weeks.

      then:

        -  prophylactic chest radiotherapy of surgical scars to prevent tumor seeding (3 x 7 Gray)

        -  adjuvant standard chemotherapy by (cis)platin 75 mg/m2 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 up to 6
           cycles (1 cycle every 3 weeks), with oral folic acid (400 μg daily) and vitamin B12
           (1000 μg Q9W) supplementation

        -  follow-up
