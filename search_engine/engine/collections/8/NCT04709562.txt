      comparison to NIPPV, to clinically stabilize and provide respiratory therapy to patients who
      have COPD with moderate-to-severe hypercapnic respiratory distress upon presentation. It is
      hypothesized that HVNI is comparable to NIPPV in the stabilization and relief of
      moderate-to-severe hypercapnic respiratory distress upon presentation, by relieving the
      patient's dyspnea (breathlessness) within 4 hours to a comparable degree to NIPPV.
