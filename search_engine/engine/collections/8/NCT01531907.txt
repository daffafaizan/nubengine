        1. To determine if differences in baseline serum levels of GLP-2 are related to differences
           in bone microarchitecture, structure and strength at the distal tibia and distal radius
           between obese and lean premenopausal females.

        2. To determine whether obesity in premenopausal females influences levels of circulating
           GLP-2 following a standardised glucose meal with a resultant change in markers of bone
           formation and resorption

        3. To test whether GLP-2 directly affects osteoclast function via an identifiable receptor
