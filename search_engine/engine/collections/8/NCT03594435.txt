    
      The study design consists of a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical
      trial of IBUD (50mg BID) for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). The investigators
      will randomize 132 treatment-seekers with current AUD over the course of 4 years. As a
      behavioral support platform, all participants will complete the NIAAA-developed and
      computer-delivered program "Take Control" during the study. Participants will complete
      telephone screening, followed by in-person eligibility assessment, a physical exam for
      medical eligibility, randomization to study medication or matched placebo, and in-person
      follow-up visits at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. TLFB assessment of drinking outcomes
      will also occur by telephone on weeks 2, 6, and 10. A final safety check visit will occur on
      week 16, consisting of repeated clinical labs and ECG.
