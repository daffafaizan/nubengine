      opioid-using women who are in or have been referred for treatment through outpatient and
      inpatient services and have a child aged 0-36 months. We will use a longitudinal design with
      an active control condition to test the central hypothesis that associations between (a)
      increases in responsive caregiving and (b) subsequent caregiver opioid addiction recovery,
      psychological well-being, and child developmental and biobehavioral outcomes (secondary
      targets), will be partially mediated through (c) changes in caregiver executive functioning,
      reward responsiveness, and parent self-concept. The rationale for this work is that it
      simultaneously addresses the unmet needs of a large, significantly underserved population and
      allows for a rigorous test of our conceptual model, which specifies hypothesized underlying
      mechanisms and differential impact.
