      vehicle ointment applied to 2 sites on opposite sides of the the infrascapular area of the
      back under occlusive patch conditions for approximately 24 (Â±2) hours. Product was applied
      according to the randomization scheme in an amount of 0.2 mL, once during the study.

      Patches were removed and 1 of the skin sites for each product was irradiated and 1 remained
      non-irradiated. The irradiated and non-irradiated sites were compared with each other and
      with an untreated irradiated control site.
