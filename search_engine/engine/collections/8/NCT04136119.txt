      but measurement of serum concentrations of most vitamins and micronutrients does not form
      part of routine care for most critically ill adults in the UK. When measured in a research
      setting, a large proportion of critically ill patients have low serum concentrations of many
      essential nutrients. Nutrient deficiency is associated with adverse outcomes, including
      delirium and increased mortality. To date, it is unclear whether there is a role for
      micronutrient supplementation in critically ill patients. Official guidelines from the
      European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN), American Society of Parenteral
      and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), German Intensive Care Society and Kidney Disease Improving
      Global Outcome (KDIGO) vary and are contradictory to some extent. Additionally, vitamins B1
      and C have been administered as an intervention in the treatment of septic shock and other
      disease states, but methodological flaws with such studies have left many clinicians with
      equipoise over the place of vitamin and micronutrients in clinical practice.

      There is a need for a well designed, adequately powered intervention study. In preparation,
      we would like to explore current practice and decision making of doctors, pharmacists and
      dieticians who are directly involved in prescribing nutritional support.

      The primary objective of this observational study is to investigate the clinical practice of
      micronutrient supplementation during critical illness and to explore the factors underpinning
      clinical decisions.
