      the relationship between tonic and phasic Electrodermal Activity (EDA) variables. EDA during
      rest and in response to a variety of sensations was measured using skin conductance.
      Descriptive statistics summarized EDA dependent variable data using skin conductance response
      (SCR) magnitude, SCR amplitude, skin conductance level (SCL), non-specific response (NSR) and
      habituation (HAB). The data was used to assess the relationship between tonic and phasic
      patterns of arousal and compare response patterns between groups using the Sensory Challenge
      Protocol (SCP) in children with ASD and typically developing children (TD).
