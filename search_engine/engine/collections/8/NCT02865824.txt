      enrollment in this study. On enrollment, patients were randomized to two groups. One group
      continued DAT and the other group discontinued antiplatelets (i.e. clopidogrel, ticagrelor,
      prasugrel) for 7 days before colonoscopy. If polyps (â‰¤1 cm) were observed during colonoscopy,
      they were removed by cold snare polypectomy. The primary aim was to compared the delayed
      bleeding rates of the two groups.
