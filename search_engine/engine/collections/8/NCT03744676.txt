    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and antitumor activity
      in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma when administered
      with lisocabtagene maraleucel (JCAR017) in the outpatient setting.

      Upon the successful product generation of lisocabtagene maraleucel, subjects will enter the
      treatment phase of the study. Treatment will include lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by
      lisocabtagene maraleucel administration. Subjects will then enter the post-treatment
      follow-up phase of the study and will be followed for approximately 24 months for safety,
      disease status, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and survival. Long-term follow-up
      will continue under a separate long-term follow-up protocol, per health regulatory authority
      guidelines, currently up to 15 years after the last lisocabtagene maraleucel administration.
