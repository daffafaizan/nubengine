      basic study requirements. If no obvious counterindications are present, subjects will be
      scheduled for a screening visit. After briefing the subjects on the reasons for the research,
      they will be given an opportunity to read the Informed Consent Form, approved by the
      Cambridge Health Alliance Institutional ReviewBoard, and to ask questions prior to signing
      it. Subjects will be given a copy of the signed Consent Form. Each subject will complete a
      standardized interview schedule designed to obtain personal and background data along with
      psychodiagnostic and psychometric evaluations. An open-label treatment will be utilized for
      all patients. Seroquel tablets will be flexibly dosed and begun at a target dose of 25 mg per
      day and taken over an 8 week period.
