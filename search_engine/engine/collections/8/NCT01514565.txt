    
      This is a prospective observational cohort study, with no control group and no direct
      experimental intervention, where the patient's pathological material will be used to examine
      the expression of molecular biomarkers believed to predict chemotherapy response. Patients
      with locally advanced triple negative breast cancer, who are candidates for neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, will be enrolled in this clinical study. Patients will receive standard of
      care, FDA-approved and clinically validated chemotherapy regimens. The biopsy specimens taken
      during the diagnostic phase (pre-treatment specimen) will be used for specific biomarker
      evaluation. Data obtained from this pre-treatment phase will be compared with the surgical
      specimens (post-treatment phase) obtained after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The
      primary endpoint is to assess the ability of specific biomarkers to predict treatment
      response, and thus identify those patients who will achieve benefit from such treatment.
