      Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of infectious disease, morbidity and
      mortality in immunocompromised patients with cancer, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,
      aplastic anemia, autoimmune diseases, and primary immune deficiencies.

      Foremost among the more lethal of these infections are invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and
      zygomycosis. Early detection of these infections allows timely initiation of specific
      antifungal therapy, which may be life saving. However, early diagnosis of respiratory fungal
      infections is difficult, often leading to delay in therapy and inaccurate treatment.

      The Immunocompromised Host Section has developed a series of sensitive and highly specific
      PCR assays for the detection of these life-threatening infections. We also have characterized
      the expression of cell wall derived biomarkers, (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan and galactomannan in
      vitro and in vivo. Laboratory animal studies indicate that these assays may complement
      current diagnostic modalities and allow for more accurate and earlier detection of invasive
      pulmonary fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to improve the early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary
      aspergillosis and invasive pulmonary zygomycosis in immunocompromised patients through the
      addition of molecular biomarker detection methodology to the standard diagnostic systems used
      in clinical microbiology laboratories.

      The secondary objectives are:

      A. To compare the diagnostic yield and analytical performance of the PCR, galactomannan and
      (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan to standard diagnostic systems.

      B. To evaluate the effect of different independent variables on expression of the
      aforementioned assays

      C. To characterize the variables that may contribute to therapeutic outcome (global response;
      survival)

      D. To characterize the use of these biomarkers in the context of EORTC/MSG definitions

      E. To identify genetic markers which may predispose patients to invasive fungal pulmonary
      infections.

      Eligibility:

      Immunocompromised patients currently enrolled in any NIH IRB approved Clinical Center
      protocol for the evaluation and/or treatment of his/her primary disease, or patients
      receiving treatment at the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) who develop a pulmonary
      infiltrate radiologically compatible with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis or invasive
      pulmonary zygomycosis, by EORTC/MSG criteria.

      Design:

      This is a multi-center, prospective diagnostic interventional study.

      Patients referred to the Clinical Center for evaluation and treatment in primary research
      protocols will be eligible for enrollment in this protocol at the Clinical Center. Patients
      meeting eligibility criteria may also be enrolled from the CNMC.

      Patients who have compatible radiologic signs and are at risk for development of invasive
      pulmonary aspergillosis and invasive pulmonary zygomycosis will have specimens of
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid supernatant and /or tissue from lung biopsy when
      available, obtained for the measurement of diagnostic PCR for Aspergillus and Zygomycete
      identification, proteomics, cytokines and for the presence of galactomannan and
      (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan. The BAL will be performed only if clinically indicated as part of the
      patient's routine care of pneumonic infiltrates.

      Blood will be obtained from patients meeting the eligibility requirements, regardless of
      whether they have had a BAL or lung tissue biopsy, to be submitted for the measurement of
      diagnostic PCR for Aspergillus and Zygomycete identification, proteomics, cytokines, presence
      of galactomannan and (1-3)-Beta-D-glucan and host genomics.

      Digital copies of computer tomography (CT) images, that are part of routine care will
      utilized to reconstruct multi-dimensional volumetric images and correlate clinical and
      laboratory outcomes with the extent of lung volume involvement.
