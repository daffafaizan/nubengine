      obtained . Group 1 received fiber reinforced composite retainer and group 2 received
      multistranded stainless steel wire retainer. The patients were recalled at every three months
      interval for a period of 12 months. They were evaluated for number of fractures, failure
      pattern based on adhesive remnant index and relapse tendency by measuring little's
      irregularity index.
