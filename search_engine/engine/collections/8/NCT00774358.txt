      results from a mutation of the WAS protein (WASp) gene. Immune cells that carry this mutation
      have a decreased ability to reorganize filamentous actin (F-actin) after activation. As a
      result there are a number of defective immunologic functions, some of which result in
      deficient host defense. The investigators have identified a pervasive deficit in natural
      killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity in WAS patients. WAS patients suffer from conditions that are
      hallmarks of NK cell deficiencies. These include severe herpesvirus infections and B cell
      malignancies. Our lab and others have also found that exposure of WAS subject NK cells to
      IL-2 in vitro restores NK cell function and allows for normal F-actin reorganization. Thus,
      the investigators propose a proof of principal clinical trial to treat WAS subjects with IL-2
      to determine safety and efficacy of IL-2 in this population and if NK cell function is
      restored ex vivo. If IL-2 can circumvent a defective WASp to restore NK cell function, the
      investigators will propose a larger NIH funded efficacy trial of IL-2 in WAS. The
      investigators will also use the in vivo treatment of WAS subjects to forward our mechanistic
      studies of how IL-2 may facilitate F-actin reorganization in the absence of WASp function.
