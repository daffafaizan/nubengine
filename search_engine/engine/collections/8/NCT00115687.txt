      to smoking cessation during pregnancy.

      The specific aims are:

        -  (1) To compare smoking cessation rates and smoking reduction among pregnant smokers who
           are randomized to receive nicotine gum (2 mg dose) or a matching placebo;

        -  (2) To compare nicotine gum versus placebo on surrogate measures of maternal and fetal
           safety (i.e., overall nicotine and tobacco exposure at 6 weeks after the quit date and
           at 32-34 weeks gestation) and birth weight at the time of delivery;

        -  (3) To examine which subjects benefit the most from the use of nicotine gum for smoking
           cessation during pregnancy.

      Subjects will be recruited from prenatal clinics that serve primarily a low-income, minority
      population. Two hundred sixty-eight pregnant smokers will be randomly assigned to receive
      smoking cessation behavioral counseling and either a 6-week course of mint flavored placebo
      or nicotine gum, followed by 6 weeks of decreasing doses. Maternal blood for genotyping will
      be obtained at study entry. Primary outcome measures will be 7-day point prevalence of
      cigarette abstinence, number of cigarettes smoked per day, urinary cotinine concentrations,
      and measures of tobacco exposure (i.e., carbon monoxide in exhaled air and urine anabasine
      and anatabine) at 6 weeks after the quit date and at 32-34 weeks gestation, and infant birth
      weight. We hypothesize that:

        -  (1) Pregnant smokers who are randomized to nicotine gum will have double the quit rates
           and will reduce their smoking to a greater degree than subjects randomized to placebo;

        -  (2) Nicotine gum compared to placebo will reduce maternal levels of tobacco-exposure
           markers and increase birth weights in the offspring;

        -  (3) The odds of cigarette abstinence will be increased primarily in subjects who smoke
           at least 15 cigarettes per day.
