      eligibility for the study. Eligible participants will undergo a baseline visit in which they
      will be randomized to either active or sham Neuro RX Gamma device.

      The Vielight Neuro RX Gamma is a non-invasive device that administers low-energy
      near-infrared LED (light emitting diode) light to the brain transcranially and intranasally.

      There are two treatment phases in the trial, each with a duration of 12 weeks. The patient
      along with the caregiver will perform home (or living facility) - based treatments with the
      device and document the sessions in a patient diary. The device will be applied to the
      patient participant by a dedicated caregiver for a 20 minute daily session, 6 days a week for
      a total of 12 weeks. The study participant and caregiver will be required to return to the
      clinic for follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 weeks post randomization, between treatment
      phases.

      228 patients will be enrolled across 8 sites in Canada and the United States.
