      management of CLL. While considerable progress has been made in the treatment of CLL, the
      prognosis of CLL patients with malignant disease transformation still is very poor and
      reported median OS is between 6 to 8 months. Conventional approaches with chemo- and
      chemoimmunotherapy have largely failed to improve response rates in RT patients. However, as
      the established treatment approach for de-novo Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is
      chemoimmunotherapy with a combination of Rituximab, Cyclophosphamid, Hydroxydaunorubicin,
      Vincristin and Prednisolon (R-CHOP), this has become the most commonly used regimen for lack
      of alternative strategies, despite poor efficacy. Patients being fit enough for allogeneic
      transplantation are undergoing this procedure after induction with R-CHOP. However, the
      majority of patients are not suitable for transplantation and relapse quickly. Hence, there
      is urgent need to improve therapy of RT by testing new compounds and combinations for
      treatment of this disease. Based on the available preclinical and preliminary clinical data
      on checkpoint inhibition plus Bruton's tyrosine (BTK) inhibition, the current trial will
      systematically assess the safety and toxicity of tislelizumab, a programmed cell death
      protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, plus zanubrutinib, a BTK inhibitor in patients with RT.
