      pharmacokinetic curve). It was designed to replace IR-MPH TID treatment. Another new
      long-acting formulation is Metadate CD. Metadate CD consists of capsules with two types of
      beads. It was designed to replace IR-MPH BID treatment. The main target of MPH in the brain
      is the dopamine transporter (DAT). We have an exquisitely sensitive methodology to measure
      DAT occupancy using C-11 Altropane and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The time course of
      decay of the C-11 Altropane permits repeated imaging, thus allowing documentation of the
      pharmacokinetics of DAT receptor occupancy.
