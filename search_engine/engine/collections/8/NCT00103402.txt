        -  To compare 12 weeks of treatment with alfuzosin versus placebo in newly-diagnosed,
           alpha-blocker naive CP/CPPS participants with respect to the primary endpoint in the
           National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI).

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of alfuzosin in newly-diagnosed,
           alpha-blocker na√Øve CP/CPPS participants.

      The proportion of "responders" in each treatment arm will be compared to evaluate the overall
      safety and efficacy of alfuzosin as compared to placebo. Approximately 270 eligible patients,
      135 per treatment arm, will be randomized and followed for a period of twelve (12) weeks
      after randomization.

      There will be four research-clinic visits during which data for the primary and secondary
      outcome measures will be collected: visit 1 involves screening, visit 2 involves collection
      of baseline data and randomization, visit 3 is the 6-week evaluation, and visit 4 is the
      12-week evaluation of the primary end point.
