      I. Comparison of fluorine F 18 L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG) accumulation with
      fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) accumulation to assess whether
      (4S)-4-(3-18F-Fluoropropyl)-L-Glutamate (18F-FSPG)-PET is better at discriminating between
      benign and malignant nodules.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop and validate early lung cancer detection biomarkers that would directly impact
      the growing need to integrate imaging and non-invasive molecular diagnostics for
      indeterminate pulmonary nodules and allow physicians to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures
      in patients with benign lung disease.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 18F-FSPG intravenously (IV) and, undergo a PET/CT scan over 30-60 minutes.
      Within 24 hours-14 days, patients receive 18F-FDG and undergo a second PET/CT scan over 30-60
      minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 24-72 hours.
