      systematic review found low quality evidence in favour of a conservative fluid or
      deresuscitative approach (active removal of accumulated fluid using diuretics and/or renal
      replacement therapy) compared with a liberal strategy or usual care. The RADAR-2 pilot
      randomised trial will compare conservative fluid and deresuscitation with usual care in
      patients who are mechanically ventilated in an intensive care unit. The main hypothesis is
      that in critically ill patients, a post-resuscitation fluid strategy comprising conservative
      fluid administration and active deresuscitation reduces net fluid balance, is safe and
      improves clinical outcomes.
