      University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the University of Florida will work together to
      conduct a research study to find associations between asthma symptoms, sleep patterns, and
      physical activity over an 8-week period among adolescent patients with persistent asthma.

      The goal of this research study is to find new ways for teenagers to manage their asthma.
      Full understanding of the connection and interference of sleep patterns and physical activity
      with asthma symptoms will be very helpful for teenagers with asthma to better manage their
      daily routine and asthma care. This research study will use wrist-worn devices (i.e. FitbitÂ®
      wristbands) to collect participants' sleep and physical activity data.
