      advocates that most children under 3 months of age with a fever undergo a full septic screen
      including lumbar puncture and receive parenteral antibiotics. Approaches in the United States
      and Europe including the PECARN and StepByStep approach allow for the discharge home of some
      low risk young infants.

      We intend to assess the current approach to febrile infants and compare that to the available
      clinical practice guidelines. We also intend to determine which clinical and/or laboratory
      features are most predictive of serious bacterial infection.
