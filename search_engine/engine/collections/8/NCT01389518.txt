      cases involves the use of symptomatic drugs. Paracetamol is used as an analgesic and
      antipyretic, whereas chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine is an antihistamine with a
      vasoconstrictor decongestant function. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of a fixed combination of paracetamol, phenylephrine and chlorpheniramine in
      symptomatic treatment of common cold and flu-like illness in adults in a randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trial.
