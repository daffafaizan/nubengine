      respiratory mechanics, secretion removal, and gas exchange in mechanically ventilated
      patients; however, the literature is scarce concerning its safety and adverse effects. Thus,
      the aim of this study is to compare the hemodynamic repercussions of VHI in volume-controlled
      mode.

      Methods: in a randomized, controlled and crossover design, 24 mechanically ventilated
      patients will undergo 2 modes of ventilator hyperinflation (with and without an inspiratory
      pause of 2 seconds) and a control intervention. For the VHI interventions, the inspiratory
      flow will be set at 20 Lpm, and tidal volume will be increased until a peak pressure of
      40cmH2O is achieved. During the control intervention, the patients will remain in
      volume-control ventilation with an inspiratory flow = 60Lpm and tidal volume = 6mL/IBW. The
      interval between interventions (washout) will be of 10 minutes or more, according to the time
      needed to recover the cardiac index to baseline values (maximum difference of 10%). Cardiac
      output, cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, systolic volume
      and other hemodynamic variables will be recorded during the interventions by using impedance
      cardiography.
