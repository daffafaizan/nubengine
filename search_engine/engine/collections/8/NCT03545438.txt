      a single dose of LIB003. Seven (7) cohorts will receive LIB003 escalating doses of LIB003, or
      placebo, by SC injection and 2 cohorts LIB003 or placebo by IV infusion. Dose escalation will
      be based on the assessment of safety and tolerability data. All cohorts will each first
      enroll a sentinel group of subjects who will receive LIB003 or placebo in a double-blind
      fashion with the remaining subjects in that cohort only to be dosed after the safety data on
      day 4 from the sentinel subjects has been assessed and deemed safe.
