      protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. All procedures followed were in
      accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation
      (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.
      Informed consent was obtained from all patients for being included in the study. The study
      was conducted according to the standards of GCP, the European Union Directive for Medical
      Devices, and the German Medical Product Law.

      Patients were seen at 14 visits over a period of 78 weeks: one baseline visit (screening),
      followed by 12 visits (in week 1-4 weekly, then in weeks 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 46 and 52;
      dates varied a maximum of ± 1 week) including application of TcES for 52 weeks and one
      follow-up visit (in week 78, dates varied a maximum of ± 1 week).

      After inclusion patients were randomly assigned to TcES with 0 mA (sham), 150% or 200% of
      their individual electrical phosphene threshold (EPT) current at 20 Hz.

      Patients and technicians who performed kinetic perimetry, as well as full-field
      electrophysiology (ERG), multifocal ERG (mfERG) and dark adaptation, were blinded to the
      treatment group for the entire study period. The physicians who performed all other
      examinations and TcES were not blinded to study treatment because they were responsible for
      setting the stimulation parameters.
