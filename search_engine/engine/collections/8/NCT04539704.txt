      and medial arteries and the effect of such placement on peripheral pulses assessed via PPG on
      fingers and on skin blood flow via laser Doppler perfusion determined. These assessments will
      be made while healthy subjects are lying supine on a padded examination table over a time
      interval of about 45-60 minutes. In addition to the impact that either the magnet or the sham
      devices have, the pulse and skin blood flow patterns and features will be analyzed from the
      point of view of sequential variability with and eye toward developing related parameters to
      potentially improve such variability.
