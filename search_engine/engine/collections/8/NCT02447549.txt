    
      RAIDER has a two stage design. Stage 1 will establish the feasibility of delivering DART in a
      multi-centre setting, and stage 2 will establish the toxicity of DART. 72 patients will be
      recruited in stage 1, with at least an additional 168 patients in stage 2 (sufficient to
      recruit 57 evaluable participants to the DART group in each fractionation cohort).

      Both fractionation regimens in standard use in UK are included - 32f and 20f. Participants
      will be permitted to receive concomitant chemotherapy. Primary endpoints will be assessed in
      each fractionation cohort separately with the flexibility to drop either a fractionation
      cohort or an experimental treatment group (on advice of Independent Data Monitoring
      Committee) following completion of stage 1.
