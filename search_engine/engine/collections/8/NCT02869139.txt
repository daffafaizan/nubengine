      using cold and menthol could be viable alternatives to reduce thirst and the discomforts
      arising from it. For that reason, this study evaluated the efficacy of a mentholated package
      of measures (lip moisturizer and ice popsicle) compared to a non-mentholated package of
      measures in alleviating thirst in the anesthesia recovery room.
