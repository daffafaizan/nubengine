    
      The participants will be stratified by the age (cut off; 60 years old) and last year
      influenza vaccination, and block-randomized to 2 groups; Day 1 vaccination group and Day 11
      vaccination group.

      Day 1 group will be vaccinated at Day 1, when the cycle of chemotherapy begins. Day 11 group
      will get the vaccine at Day 11, 10 days after chemotherapy begins.

      As the rate of completion of study in the Day 11 group is anticipated lower than Day 1 group,
      we will assign the participants into Day 1: Day 11 with the different ratio; 4:5.

      Hemagglutination inhibition Ab titre at pre-vaccination and post-vaccination (21-28 days
      after vaccination) will be examined in all participants.

      All the participants will be asked if they have any contraindication for influenza vaccine by
      a physician before vaccination. And they will be monitored for any adverse reaction of the
      vaccination after 2-4 days(phone calling) and after 21-28 days (visiting the hospital).
