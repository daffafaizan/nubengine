      14% of infected patients requiring hospitalization. Identifying ways to ameliorate the
      progression and severity of the COVID-19 infection and preventing hospitalization is
      critical. Patients suffering from COVID-19 have been shown to have a significant inflammatory
      response resembling that of cytokine release syndrome, and it is this inflammatory phase that
      is thought to drive fatality.

      To this end, a multi-center randomized clinical trial to determine the efficacy of resistant
      starch in reducing the need for hospitalization for COVID-19 positive patients will be
      studied. This study will enroll 1500 non-hospitalized COVID-19 positive individuals who are
      being monitored in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized to either a dietary
      supplement containing resistant starch or a placebo for 14 days. Our primary outcome is the
      rate of hospitalization for COVID-19 related complications. Secondary outcomes will look at
      time to recovery and symptom severity scores.
