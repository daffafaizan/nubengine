      anaesthesia. Mesh fixation is performed using 3 methods: Optilene™ mesh + cyanoacrylate glue
      (n=200), self-fixing Parietex Progrip™ mesh (n=200) and non-absorbable sutures with Ultrapro™
      mesh (n=200). Operative time and pain scores, immediate postoperative outcome,
      quality-of-life and total costs are followed 1, 7, 30 days and 1 and 5 years postoperatively.
