      HIV infection and AIDS-associated mortality. Narcotic addiction is often treated by use of
      methadone. Fluconazole has been shown to be highly effective in treating symptomatic mucosal
      candidiasis, but it is unknown whether fluconazole affects methadone metabolism, which could
      result in symptoms of methadone withdrawal or overdose in patients taking the drugs in
      combination.

      Patients are randomized to receive methadone plus either fluconazole or placebo in clinic
      daily for 16 days. Study drugs are administered as close to 8 AM as possible. Patients must
      visit the Fort Greene clinic on study days 1, 2, 15, and 16; they may receive treatment at
      their home clinics on days 3 through 14.
