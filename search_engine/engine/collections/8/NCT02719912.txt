    
      This study is a prospective first in man feasibility study intended to evaluate preliminary
      safety and effectiveness of the MValve Mitral Dock with Lotus transcatheter heart valve for
      mitral valve replacement in subjects who are at high risk for surgical valve repair or
      replacement.

      The surgical technique adapts the valve-in-valve approach for mitral replacement in
      degenerated mitral prostheses to failing native mitral valves. The MValve Dock is designed to
      provide a structural platform within the mitral annulus so that the Lotus THV can be
      implanted in a secure fashion in the mitral annulus. The investigational device anchors to
      the mitral annulus commissures, sparing the native valve leaflets and sub annular apparatus.
      This study is designed to treat subjects with moderate-to-severe MR who are not deemed
      candidates for mitral valve surgery.
