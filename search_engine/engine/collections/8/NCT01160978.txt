      donor simvastatin treatment reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury after heart transplantation.
      Also, it potentially decreases natural immune activity, rejection activation and thus
      improves long-term prognosis.

      Simvastatin is administered to heart and/or lung donors through the nasogastric tube 4-6
      hours prior to organ harvesting. Control organ donors do not receive simvastatin. The
      randomization and donor hospital instruction of the donor simvastatin treatment is performed
      by the transplant coordinator. All other caregivers and the transplant recipient are blinded
      to the treatment group allocation.

      The impact of donor simvastatin treatment is investigated and analyzed by several specific
      blood samples and biopsies that are taken from the recipient at the various time-points
      during the perioperative and postoperative phase.

      In heart transplant recipients (n=42 in the donor simvastatin treatment group and n=42 in the
      control group), the primary end-point is postoperative cardiac enzyme serum levels (TnT, TnI,
      and CK-MB 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after transplantation) and primary graft
      failure. Secondary end-points include peri- and postoperative parameters hemodynamics, short-
      and long term survival, biopsy-proven rejections, rejection treatments, and chronic rejection
      at 1, 5, 10, and 20 years after transplantation.

      Lung, kidney and liver transplant recipients that have received organs from donors randomized
      to the control group or donor simvastatin group will also be followed for
      ischemia-reperfusion injury, perioperative organ function, innate and adaptive immunity and
      patient survival.
