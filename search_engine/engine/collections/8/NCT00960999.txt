      Primary

        -  To determine the 1-year rate of ≥ grade 3 adverse events that are definitely, probably,
           or possibly related to treatment with single fraction vs multiple fraction stereotactic
           body radiotherapy in medically inoperable patients with stage I peripheral non-small
           cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the 1-year primary tumor control rate in these patients.

        -  To estimate the 1-year overall survival and disease-free survival rate of these
           patients.

        -  To assess FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography) standardized
           uptake value changes as a measure of treatment response and outcomes.

        -  To determine pulmonary function changes by treatment arm and response.

        -  To determine the association between biomarkers and primary tumor control and/or ≥ grade
           2 radiation pneumonitis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Zubrod performance
      status (0 vs 1 vs 2) and T stage (T1 vs T2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
