      world (including developing countries) and low cost. An oral treatment is more accessible to
      patients than drugs given by injection or by inhalation.

      Patients with confirmed PCP are randomized into one of three treatment groups. Group A
      receives SMX/TMP. Half of group A receives dapsone placebo (placebo is an inactive substance)
      daily plus trimethoprim placebo; the other half receives clindamycin placebo plus primaquine
      placebo. Group B is given dapsone plus trimethoprim. Half of group B receives SMX/TMP
      placebo; the other half receives clindamycin placebo plus primaquine placebo. Group C is
      given clindamycin plus primaquine. Half of group C receives SMX/TMP placebo, the other half
      receives dapsone placebo plus trimethoprim placebo. Treatment lasts 21 days; dosages will be
      adjusted for patients weighing less than 50 kg and more than 80 kg. Patients with a history
      of intolerance to SMX/TMP for whom rechallenge is considered medically contraindicated may be
      randomized to one of the non-sulfamethoxazole-containing arms.
