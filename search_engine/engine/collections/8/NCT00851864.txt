      molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) for the treatment venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
      pregnancy. The most recent anticoagulation guidelines from American College of Chest
      Physicians (ACCP) suggest that heparin levels (anti-Factor-Xa activity levels) may be done
      periodically through pregnancy to determine the need to adjust the dose of LMWH as pregnancy
      progresses. This monitoring is widely practiced. There is no clear consensus in the
      literature, however, with some experts suggesting that initial and subsequent dosing may be
      done based on weight alone (as is done in the non-pregnant population). Given the multiple
      physiologic changes which occur to drug metabolism during pregnancy, this bears further
      evaluation. To date, there is very limited data on weight-adjusted dosing of LMWH in
      pregnancy. This study is therefore designed to determine if dosing of tinzaparin during
      pregnancy based on weight, with periodic weight-based adjustments, will result in adequate
      therapeutic anticoagulation.
