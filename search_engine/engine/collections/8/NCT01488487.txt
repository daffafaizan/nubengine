      of everolimus and pasireotide in patients with advanced or metastatic hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) and limited prior systemic therapy. Should this regimen demonstrate efficacy,
      this will support a Phase III randomized clinical trial of this combination therapy. At least
      30 patients will be enrolled into this Phase II study. Additionally, given the potential
      importance of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and RAS/pAKT pathways, we propose to correlate outcomes
      with baseline pAKT, p-S6, somatostatin receptor tumor expression, and serum VEGF expression.
      We anticipate these exploratory analyses will increase understanding of the molecular
      pathways and their inhibition in this disease. The study will be performed as a University of
      North Carolina-coordinated, multicenter study.
