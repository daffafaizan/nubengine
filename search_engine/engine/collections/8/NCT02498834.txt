      impact of an adolescent "asthma question prompt list" combined with a supportive educational
      video emphasizing the importance of adolescent involvement and question-asking on
      communication during pediatric visits. This application is based on Social Cognitive Theory.
      Self-confidence or self-efficacy is a central component of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)
      Application of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) in asthma populations has shown that technical
      advice from providers is one external factor that can improve asthma management
      self-efficacy. Additionally, personal beliefs, such as outcome expectations, and family
      factors, such as parent and adolescent responsibility for asthma self-management, have been
      shown to affect adolescent self-efficacy and disease management outcomes. Prior work has
      found that adolescent self-efficacy in asthma management correlates strongly with health
      status, adherence, asthma medication device technique, asthma symptoms, and impact of illness
      on the family.

      All adolescents will have their medical visits audio recorded. The adolescent will be
      interviewed after his/her medical visit while his/her caregiver/parent completes a survey at
      the time of study enrollment. This same procedure will be used when the adolescent and
      caregiver/parents return for the 6- and 12-month follow-up visits.
