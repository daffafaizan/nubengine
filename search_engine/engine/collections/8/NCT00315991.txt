      behavior is guided by feedback about changing blood glucose (BG) levels and decision-making.
      The processes involved in self-regulation have been studied extensively in adults with Type 1
      Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), leading to the development of sophisticated research tools that
      have significantly advanced our understanding and ability to predict clinical outcome.
      Additionally, this research has led to the development of a highly effective, empirically
      based,pyschobehavioral intervention, Blood Glucose Awareness Training (BGAT) that improves
      self-regulation and clinical outcome in adults with T1DM. Unfortunately, the processes
      involved in the self-regulation of pediatric diabetes have received virtually no empirical
      attention. The purpose of this project is to correct the scientific neglect of the
      self-regulation in pediatric diabetes by adapting the conceptual and methodological tools
      used in adult studies to investigate the process of diabetes regulation by school-aged
      children (6-11 years) with T1DM and their parents and to develop and test an intervention to
      enhance the skills critical to this process.
