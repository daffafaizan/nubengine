      documented atrial fibrillation (chronic and paroxysmal), were randomly assigned by a central
      computer system to undergo cardiac surgery with add-on surgery or without. This assignment
      was blinded to patients and all medical personnel except for the surgical team during total
      follow up. Patients completed quality of life questionnaires, comprising the RAND 36-item
      Health Survey 1.0 (SF-36), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20) and EuroQoL (EQ-5D
      and VAS) at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months following operation.
