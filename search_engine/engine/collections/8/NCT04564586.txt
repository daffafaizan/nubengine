      Prevention Program (N-DPP) into a tool for use in a primary care setting. The 16-week
      intervention follows the order of the 16 sessions that make up the core components of the
      traditional DPP. The novelty in this application is the intervention delivery, in addition to
      the use of technology to supplement resource and time intensive DPP behavioral strategies.
      The entire intervention is delivered through automated text messages (SMS/MMS). For any given
      week, the daily text messages for that week reflect the core session of the DPP (i.e DPPFit
      Week 1 texts correspond to DPP Session 1). In addition to the automated daily messages,
      participants are issued a Fitbit and assisted in setting up the Fitbit App on their smart
      phones. The Fitbit App is considered a standalone mHealth App. The fitness tracker and
      companion App allow participants to set goals and track food and physical activity. The
      content of the text messaging is almost entirely from the N-DPP participant notebook (2012).
      Exceptions to this are a series of prompts to cue participant to use the Fitbit and/or Fitbit
      App to support the session. These include topics about setting goals in the Fitbit App, how
      to track food using the App, or how to connect with friends and do challenges on Fitbit.

      To be sustainable and feasible in a primary care setting, remote delivery of intervention
      materials and components is a necessary part of any evidence-based tool to address diabetes
      prevention. This automated, remote dissemination, technology-based application of the N-DPP
      components means that intervention delivery and protocol are feasible methods to address
      diabetes prevention in light of the ongoing Covid-19 health crisis.
