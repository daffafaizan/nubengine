      anesthesia (CSA) in elderly patients undergoing knee arthroplasty.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Adult patients, aged more than 65 years scheduled for elective total knee arthroplasty under
      regional anesthesia.

      Study Design :

      Patients had a transthoracic echocardiography one to three months before the surgical
      procedure, performed by a cardiologist.

      An oral intake of 250 ml of water was taken 2 hours before surgery. In the operating room,
      patients received monitoring with electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry and had their blood
      pressure measured and recorded via an indwelling radial arterial catheter putting under local
      anesthesia.

      This catheter was connected to the FloTrac sensor/Vigileo haemodynamic monitoring systeme to
      track continuously stroke volume and cardiac output.

      All patients were given nasal oxygen during all the procedure to keep oxygen saturation > 95
      %. Fluid therapy was limited to 4 ml/kg/h until tourniquet release.

      Subarachnoid puncture was performed with a 19-Gauge Tuohy needle at the L3-S1 interspace
      using a midline approach. Three cm of a 22-Gauge catheter was introduced through the needle.
      An initial dose of 2,5 mg isobaric 0,5% bupivacaine was injected through the catheter.
      Additional 2,5 mg isobaric 0,5% bupivacaine doses were injected every 10 minutes until
      sensory blockade reached T10.

      Ephedrine 6 to 9 mg was given if systolic arterial pressure < 90 mmHg or < 100 mmHg with
      clinical signs of poor tolerance (dizziness, anxiety, dyspnea, vomiting).

      Sample size We included 20 patients in this observational study.
