      unselected patients who present to hospital with an alternative primary illness likely to
      cause myocardial oxygen supply or demand imbalance. All patients will be assessed by a member
      of the study team during their index admission and will undergo a detailed assessment of
      their coronary anatomy with either computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), CT
      calcium scoring and non-invasive fractional flow reserve assessment (CT-FFR) or invasive
      coronary angiography with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and invasive fractional flow
      reserve (FFR). The pattern of myocardial injury and its functional consequence will be
      evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. The investigators will determine the
      kinetics of cardiac troponin release using serial testing at multiple time points throughout
      admission, and quantify other proteins and the expression of long non-coding RNA and
      associated mRNA to identify differences related to the presence of coronary artery disease,
      which may help to identify new biomarkers.
