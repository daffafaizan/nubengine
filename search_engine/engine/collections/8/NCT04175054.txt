      improve walking and measures of brain plasticity among people with MS related walking
      disability, especially in those who had fatigue and heat sensitivity. As a next step, we will
      compare our novel vigorous intensity cool room treadmill training to low intensity cool room
      treadmill walking and determine whether intensity is important in order to improve brain
      repair and restore walking among people with MS. Our first objective is to compare the
      effects of 12 weeks of vigorous versus low intensity training on walking. Our second
      objective is to determine whether treadmill training alters indicators of brain repair. We
      hypothesize that the cool room vigorous training will result in greater increases in walking
      and less fatigue, which will be sustained at follow-up. We also hypothesize that improvements
      will align with less brain inhibition (shortened CSP measured using Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation) and greater upregulation of the neurotrophin IGF-1.
