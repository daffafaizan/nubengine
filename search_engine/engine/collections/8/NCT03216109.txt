      experience thoracic malignancies express poor symptom management that result in utilization
      of healthcare resources after-hours for symptoms that could have been prevented if assessed
      more proactively and prospectively. Currently, there are limited proactive approaches to
      prospectively identify and intervene on patient-reported symptoms. The purpose of this study
      is to enhance symptom assessment strategies by using a proactive assessment approach to
      improve symptom relief for patients with thoracic malignancies.

      The investigators will test whether a proactive telephone symptom assessment and management
      strategy is feasible and can facilitate early patient report of their symptoms and
      intervention. The knowledge gained from this approach will be used to identify solutions that
      can be scaled nationally to improve patient-reported symptom management and patient
      satisfaction with their clinical care.
