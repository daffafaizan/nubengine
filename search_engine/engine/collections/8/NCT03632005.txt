      infection. Many things have been tried to decrease this risk (more antibiotics, different
      types of stitches, etc) but very few have been shown to be of any significant benefit.

      The use of a special vacuum dressing called the Prevena™ System, which has received approval
      from Health Canada for the management of closed surgical incisions, has been shown to be of
      some benefit in hip surgery where wounds are identified as being "at risk." Vacuum dressings
      have been used with great success in patients with open wounds and have resulted in fewer
      infections and wound related complications. It is thought that if vacuum dressings can be
      used in the treatment of existing wounds, then maybe they can be used preventatively before
      there is a problem with the wound.

      Standard wound care after spine surgery involves a dressing that seals the wound for 72 hours
      after surgery and is then changed on a daily basis until the surgical sutures or staples are
      ready to be removed. This has been routine for many years.

      The purpose of this study is to see if using a vacuum dressing (Prevena™ System) will
      decrease the number of infections and/or clinic and hospital visits for wound related issues
      compared to using a standard dressing on wounds in patients with risk factors for early wound
      infection.
