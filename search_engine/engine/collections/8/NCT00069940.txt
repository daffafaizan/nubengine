        -  Determine the feasibility of treatment with telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine and
           sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with sarcoma or brain tumor.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the frequency of T-cell specific vaccine antigens during and after
           administration of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the clinical response, if any, of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive telomerase: 540-548 peptide vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 3
      and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 23.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients (20 adult and 15 pediatric) will be accrued for
      this study.
