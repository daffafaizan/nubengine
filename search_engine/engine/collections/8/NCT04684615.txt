      research on the mental health impact of environmental stressors imposed by the COVID-19
      pandemic. The study will describe the relationship between stressors related to COVID-19 and
      self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among Amish and Mennonite
      participants in an ongoing study of bipolar disorder (AMBiGen), and their family members.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to describe the relationship between stressors related
      to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among individuals
      with bipolar disorder, related conditions, and their family members. The secondary objectives
      are to determine the roles played by psychiatric diagnosis, genetic risk of various mental
      illnesses, and perceived social support in moderating risk and resilience for mental health
      during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
