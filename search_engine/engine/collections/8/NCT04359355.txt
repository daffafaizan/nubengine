      shown in a recent meta-analysis, miss rates for adenomas can reach up to 26%. In this study,
      it is tested whether an artificial intelligence system that highlights colorectal polyps
      during screening or surveillance colonoscopy in real time can lead to an increased detection
      of colorectal polyps during the examination.
