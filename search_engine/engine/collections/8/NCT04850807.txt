    
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a parallel, pragmatic, cluster randomized control
      trial of personalized music (Music and Memory) for nursing home residents with moderate to
      severe dementia living in 54 nursing homes (27 treatment, 27 control) from 4 nursing home
      corporations. Music and Memory is a personalized music program that uses portable music
      players to deliver individualized music to people with dementia at times when agitated
      behaviors are likely.

      **This funding mechanism sponsored two parallel trials with different implementation
      strategies. In this trial, music is preloaded on personalized music devices to increase
      nursing use of the music with residents. Details of the first parallel trial conducted under
      this funding mechanism are registered under "R33AG057451_part1."**

      The aims of this study are: 1. To use a train-the-trainer model to implement the intervention
      with ongoing monitoring of the program's adoption and acceptance by nursing home residents
      with dementia; 2. To estimate the impact of Music and Memory on agitated and aggressive
      behaviors; and 3. To examine factors associated with variation in providers' adherence to the
      implementation of Music and Memory.
