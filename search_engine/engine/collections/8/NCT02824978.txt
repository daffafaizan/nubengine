      during the construction process of care. So active collaboration based on a shared assessment
      of issues and agreement on possible solutions. Initially described in psychiatry, this
      analytical concept has been extended to several chronic diseases in particular requiring more
      often a strong link between doctor and patient. His measure is important since it has been
      demonstrated by several previous studies that the therapeutic alliance is predictive of the
      therapeutic effects of treatment. This alliance, however, was little studied in juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis, its connection with the observance or the quality of life has never
      been evaluated.

      The chronic nature of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) requires a strong ability of the
      child to follow his treatment, where the role of parents going to be important and where the
      relationship built with the caregiver is also essential.

      Adherence is a complex concept for which there is no ideal measure. Direct evaluation
      criteria such as bioassays prove still incomplete and difficult to implement in observational
      studies. Indirect measures have been developed through self-administered questionnaires and
      literature showed their relatively good correlation with actual catches. The innovative
      hypothesis of this research is that a better therapeutic alliance is associated with better
      adherence child in JIA.
