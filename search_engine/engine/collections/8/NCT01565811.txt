      affects long-term survival, as reported by the tumor staging system of the International
      Union Against Cancer (IUCC), which is the most widespread classification of malignant tumors
      worldwide. Regional lymphadenectomy is already the standard procedure that completes hepatic
      resection in the case of carcinoma arising from the extrahepatic bile duct. However, the
      indication, extent, and role of lymph node excision are still a matter of discussion, and no
      clear guidelines exist in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis.
