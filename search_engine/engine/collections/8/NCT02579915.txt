    
      The primary goals of our 3-year, 2-phase project are to develop AIM for primary care linkage
      and assess its feasibility and acceptability. This protocol description only pertains to
      Phase 2 (Randomized Controlled Trial).

      42 primary care patients with primary Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder,
      and/or Panic Disorder (with or without Agoraphobia) will be randomly assigned to the AIM
      treatment or to a symptom tracking control group. Full assessments will occur pre- and
      post-treatment and 3-months follow-up. A mid-treatment assessment will include measures of
      cognitive biases and the primary outcome. Weekly measures of anxiety and depression will be
      collected, as will feedback from patients and PCPs about the research and delivery
      procedures.
