      myeloma (MM) can strengthen the bones, thus making it resilient to future fractures. Ixazomib
      will be given at a time point when the disease is in a stable phase, decreasing the
      likelihood that the potential bone anabolic effect will be abrogated by catabolic effect of
      active MM. In order to be included in the study, the patient must have treatment demanding
      MM, and the disease must have been brought into at least partial remission with chemotherapy
      before inclusion. Moreover, the patient must have pathological bone structure on low dose CT
      due to the pre-existing disease.
