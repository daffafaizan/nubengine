        -  In order to include the patient to the study, signing of the consent form.

        -  Documentation of patient demographics, medical history, heart failure history,
           co-morbidities and risk factors.

        -  Prospective recording of findings of physical examination.

        -  Retrospective recording of results related to diagnostic methods (biochemistry, blood
           count and others).

        -  Determination of NYHA classification.

        -  Determination of pathophysiology and etiology.
