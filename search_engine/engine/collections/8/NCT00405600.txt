      spinal fusion. The BMP-2 Infuse has been researched in the only completed clinical trial for
      spinal fusions. It has demonstrated equivalence to the iliac crest bone graft with regard to
      both fusion rate and clinical outcome.

      Currently, the acceptable standard of care for spinal fusion surgery requires instrumented or
      non-instrumented procedure with the use of bone graft materials, to facilitate bone growth,
      and a fusion, thus eliminating movement between the inciting vertebrae.

      In this study, the surgical procedure will be BMP-2 Infuse with instrumentation or BMP-2
      Infuse alone.
