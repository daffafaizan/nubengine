    
      Study population: patients with painful spinal metastases from solid tumors without spinal
      cord compression or cord instability.

      Objective: This study will test the hypothesis that stereotactic radiotherapy gives a better
      and longer lasting reduction of pain, local control and therewith a better quality of life.
      This in order to optimize and to individualize the treatment options for the patient.

      Study design: Complaints due to pain will be analysed using the validated Dutch Brief Pain
      Inventory (BPI) and side-effects will be recorded using the Common Toxicity Criteria for
      Adverse Events (CTCAE). In addition to this the quality of life will be analysed using the
      EORTC QOL-C15-PAL and EORTC QLQ-BM22 questionnaires. For analysis of cost-effectiveness the
      EQ-5D will be used.
