      social, and economic consequences, is difficult to treat using traditional psychosocial and
      behavioral therapies. Despite testing of a number of different agents for cocaine dependency,
      there remains no proven pharmacologic treatment for cocaine addiction.

      The addictive properties of cocaine have been associated with its actions on
      mesotelencephalic dopamine reward pathways in the central nervous system (CNS). Cocaine
      administration increases the levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with
      sensations of pleasure and reward. Therefore, blocking cocaine-induced increases in dopamine
      levels represents a valid pharmaceutical approach to the treatment of cocaine addiction.

      Another neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), suppresses striatal dopamine
      release, and attenuates cocaine-induced increases in extracellular and synaptic dopamine
      levels in the striatum and nucleus accumbens in animal models of drug dependence. Significant
      elevation of brain GABA levels may reduce cocaine-stimulated dopamine release and dampen the
      sensations of pleasure and reward. Thus, drugs that potentiate or enhance GABA-ergic
      transmission are candidates for the treatment of cocaine addiction.
