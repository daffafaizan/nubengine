      commercially-available nutritional product, to enhance the efficacy of physical exercise in
      improving physical function among older adults with functional limitations. The overarching
      objective of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention combining
      resveratrol supplementation and physical exercise among sedentary persons aged > 65 years
      objectively-measured functional impairments. A total of 60 participants will be recruited to
      participate in this three month intervention study. All participants will engage in a
      center-based exercise program 3/days per week and will be randomly assigned to consume 1)
      placebo, 2) 250 mg/day resveratrol, or 3) 1000 mg/day resveratrol. This study will provide
      critical information regarding the influence of the combination of resveratrol and exercise
      on objectively-measured and self-assessed indices of physical function. The study will also
      provide novel biologic information regarding the relative effects of the interventions on
      skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.
