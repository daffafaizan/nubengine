      Mellitus, and of these up to 80% suffer from painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Multiple
      medications have been tried for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. These
      medications are directed at symptomatic relief and do not address the underlying cause of
      painful peripheral neuropathy. Thiamine is a water-soluble vitamin that participates in
      carbohydrate metabolism. Deficiency of thiamine causes beriberi, characterized by painful
      peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. Basic research has suggested that thiamine
      deficiency may also be involved in the etiology of diabetic neuropathy by preventing the
      glycation of nerve fibers as well as apoptosis of endothelial cells. A study in the
      developing world found that oral thiamine and pyridoxine were helpful in improving the pain
      experienced in diabetic peripheral neuropathy as well as improving signs of neuropathy seen
      on neurological examination. A screening study of patients with type II diabetes found that
      76% of patients tested had a low serum thiamine level.

      Our study will examine the effect of oral thiamine supplementation on the symptom of pain in
      painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In addition we will follow serum thiamine levels to
      see if clinical change correlates with changes in serum thiamine levels
