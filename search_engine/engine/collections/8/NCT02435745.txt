      connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility,
      and tissue fragility. EDS features such as genetically related cartilage defects,
      craniofacial abnormalities and increased pharyngeal collapsibility have been proposed to
      cause obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). There is evidence from studies based on questionnaires
      that EDS patients might be more frequently affected by OSA and sleep disturbances than the
      general population. However, the actual prevalence of OSA in patients with EDS is unclear.

      Aortic dilation and dissection are complications associated with EDS and little is known
      about the underlying risk factors. Preliminary evidence suggests a link with OSA but this has
      not yet been investigated.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of OSA in EDS-patients
      compared to a matched control group. The secondary objective of the study is to assess
      whether there is a relationship between OSA severity and craniofacial phenotypes / aortic
      diameter in EDS patients.
