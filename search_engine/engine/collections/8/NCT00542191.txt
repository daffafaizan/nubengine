      core biopsy and larger than 2 cm will be treated neoadjuvantly with the Livingston metronomic
      regimen of 12 weeks of weekly doxorubicin 24 mg/m2 and daily oral cyclophosphamide 60 mg/m2
      followed by 12 successive weeks of taxol 80 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 2. Although clinical
      response will be evaluated prior to surgery, the primary end-point is the pathologic
      response. Secondary end-points will be DFS and OS based upon standard of care surveillance. A
      pathologic complete response (pCR) will require no histologic evidence of residual malignant
      cells seen in the primary tumor area specimen or the lymph nodes. Standard of care surgery
      and radiation therapy will be undertaken.
