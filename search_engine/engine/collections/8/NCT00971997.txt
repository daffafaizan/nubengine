    
      A multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, post-marketing clinical study. The target
      population of the study is type 2 diabetic patients who have failed to achieve adequate
      glycemic control on OADs. The study consists of 4 periods: Lead-in Period (2 to 4 weeks),
      Study Period I (16 weeks), Study Period II (16 weeks), and Study Period III (16 weeks). The
      regimen of lispro mix 50/50 injection will be changed every 16 weeks based on the HbA1c
      level. During Study Period I, all the subjects will be given a once daily (QD) injection of
      lispro mix 50/50. During Study Period II, the regimen of lispro mix 50/50 injection will be
      changed to twice daily (BID) if the HbA1c level at Week 16 is 6.5% or above, and QD injection
      will be continued if the value is below 6.5%. During Study Period III, if the HbA1c level at
      Week 32 is 6.5% or above, the subjects on BID treatment during the previous period (Study
      Period II) will receive three times daily (TID) injections of insulin.
