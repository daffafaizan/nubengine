      cardiac function, enhance diaphragm contractility and decrease pulmonary artery through this
      sensitizing effect, and protect ARDS lung function by regulating the release and oxidation of
      inflammatory mediators and nitroso oxidative stress. The hemodynamic and pulmonary protective
      effects of ARDS patients were improved by regulating K-ATP channels, relieving blood vessels
      and bronchospasm and improving ventilation and diffusion function in ARDS patients, so as to
      further improve the survival rate of these patients and shorten the mechanical ventilation
      time and ICU stay time. The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of Levosimendan
      on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function in patients with ARDS, to determine
      whether it can reduce the fatality rate of ARDS and shorten its ICU residence time, and to
      evaluate the evaluation of ARDS with or without right ventricular insufficiency and to
      provide a new idea and method for drug treatment of ARDS.
