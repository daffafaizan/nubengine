      menus that will be administered during the ENERGY I project. During the pilot study,
      palatability ratings were collected for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) from four
      different menus that were served to participants during the main ENERGY I trial. The menus
      consist of three diets that vary in dietary fat and energy density: 1) high fat/high energy
      density, 2) high fat/low energy density, and 3) high carbohydrate/low energy density. In
      addition to these three menus, the menu from the baseline period of the trial will also be
      tested for palatability.
