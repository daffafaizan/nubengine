      some purposes deeper stimulation would be helpful. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether a special coil designed for magnetic stimulation of deep brain regions can affect
      mood and emotion in healthy human volunteers. The special coil was designed to stimulate
      neuronal pathways related to the control of motivation and reward, specifically, fibers
      connecting the cingulated or prefrontal cortex with the nucleus accumbens. Computerized
      theoretical calculations were made in order to optimize the coil design for maximizing the
      percentage of stimulation in depth relative to the cortical regions. The present study will
      look first at the influence of the coil on the response from motor cortex. Should there be
      good evidence the coil can truly be more effective in stimulating deep structures, then we
      will explore whether it can indeed affect mood and emotion when single pulses are applied.
