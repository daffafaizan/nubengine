      die annually from CVDs than from any other cause. The arterial hypertension is one of the
      main predictors of CVDs. The number of adults with high blood pressure increased from 594
      million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015( WHO, 2020).

      Due to the great increase in Hypertension around the world, new technological ways of
      assessing pressure have been discussed in the clinical setting, not only peripheral, but also
      central.

      In this sense, the applanation tonometry of different arteries (carotid and radial), the
      analysis of pulses by various algorithms and the ability to estimate the shape of the pulse
      wave in the descending aorta root has been gaining prominence.

      Flavonoids are a group of polyphenol compounds found in plants. The possible benefits from
      these compounds are related to cardiovascular health through specific actions on the artery
      wall. Prospective studies have shown that flavonoids can improve arterial stiffness, measured
      by Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV).

      Physical exercise can intensifies organic functioning in different systems oh human body,
      including the cardiovascular. Studies has shown that chronic adaptations of pshysical
      exercise can improve arterial stiffness and central blood pressure parameters.
