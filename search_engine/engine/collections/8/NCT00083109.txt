      I. Determine the dose of suramin and fluorouracil that would result in plasma concentrations
      of suramin between 10-50 uM in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer. (Phase I) II.
      Determine the objective response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients
      treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I) II.
      Determine the pharmacokinetics of low-dose suramin in these patients. (Phase I) III.
      Determine the time to tumor progression and progress rate at 3 and 6 months in patients
      treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation phase I study followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive suramin IV over 30 minutes and fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15,
      22, 29, and 36. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses suramin and fluorouracil
      until the dose level allowing 10-50 uM of suramin into the patient's blood is determined
      without 2 or more of 6 patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients receive suramin and fluorouracil (at the dose level determined in phase I)
      as in phase I.

      In both phases, courses repeat every 8 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
