      Nicotinamide Riboside (NR). It has been proven in basic science studies as a highly effective
      NAD booster, but it also works as a vitamin B3 supplement. NAD helps pass energy from glucose
      to other pathways in the cell. Niagen (Nicotinamide Riboside, vitamin B3) is one of the most
      effective NAD+ precursors to support cellular health.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Niagen (nicotinamide riboside,
      vitamin B3), on NAD levels, brain function including cognition and blood flow in people
      diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
