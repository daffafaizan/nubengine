      The Perceived Stress Scale is a 10-item self report questionnaire that measures persons'
      evaluation of the stressfulness of the situations in the past month of their lives. The
      citation for the 10-item scale is Cohen, S., & Williamson, G. (1988). Perceived stress in a
      probability sample of the United States. In S. Spacapan & S. Oskamp (Eds.). The Perceived
      Stress Scale is the only empirically established index of general stress appraisal. "The PSS
      measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful" (Cohen, et
      al., 1983; p. 385).

      PSS-10 scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the four positive items, e.g., 0=4,
      1=3, 2=2, etc. and then summing across all 10 items. Items 4,5, 7, and 8 are the positively
      stated items. Scores can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater stress.

      The PSS is not a diagnostic instrument, so there are no cut-offs. There are only comparisons
      between people in a given sample. There are some normative data on the PSS based on a 1983
      Harris Poll of a representative U.S. sample. These data may be helpful in providing
      comparisons, but they are over 20 years old. See: Cohen, S., & Williamson, G. (1988).
