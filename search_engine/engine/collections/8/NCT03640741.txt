      estimate changes in hemoglobin concentration in a brain during gynecological procedure that
      involves laparoscopy. The optodes were positioned on a forehead on left and right hemisphere.

      The measurements were carried out during whole medical procedure, including anesthesia, start
      and stop of insufflation of abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide (CO2), surgical procedure,
      release of CO2 and waking up a patient. In those studies the special emphasis was put on a
      period of insufflation of abdominal cavity with CO2.
