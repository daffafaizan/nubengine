      management and enhance quality of healthcare. The goal of this study is to evaluate if Spire
      and Muse help individuals self-manage stress. Spire has been designed as a discrete clip-on
      tracker that monitors changes in respiration rate. With the companion app, this device
      displays breathing rates in real time and alerts the user through push notification in times
      of tension. Studies show that controlled breathing reduces stress. On the other hand, Muse is
      a headset device that uses EEG (electroencephalogram) sensors that measures electric brain
      frequencies. Muse guides the user in a form of simplified meditation by giving feedback in
      real time (i.e. calm, neutral, active) and audio clues to improve concentration. Previous
      studies have shown that engaging in meditation has the potential to reduce anxiety and
      stress.
