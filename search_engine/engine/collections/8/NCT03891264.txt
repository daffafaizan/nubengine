      brain and spinal cord) that are active in patients with low back pain can be reduced with
      CBD. Previous studies have showed that patients with chronic low back pain demonstrated
      elevations in brain levels of the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of glial
      activation.

      To test this hypothesis, the study team will image the brains and spinal cords of patients
      suffering from low back pain using integrated magnetic resonance- positron emission
      tomography (MR-PET), and a radiotracer called [11C]PBR28, which tracks levels of glial
      activation.

      The efficacy of CBD as a treatment for chronic low back pain will be evaluated. The study
      team will observe whether 4 weeks of CBD treatment may reduce glial activation along with
      self-reported low back pain symptoms. To this end, patients will be evaluated clinically
      and/or re-scanned after completing the 4-week trial of minocycline.

      This study will be enrolling individuals who have been suffering from chronic low back pain.
