      developed assessment protocol for such patients may support nurses in their discussions with
      the patients about smoking cessation. In a previous qualitative study involving in-depth
      interviews with patients with COPD, the assessment protocol "Trying to quit smoking" (TTQ)
      was developed. The protocol consists of approximately 21 statements that the patient responds
      to on a scale ranging from 1 (agree entirely) to 4 (disagree). The purpose of the protocol is
      to identify areas in which the patient may need extra support in order to quit smoking.

      The aim of this study is to validate the TTQ by testing it in a clinical setting. The study
      will be conducted at approximately 40 primary health care centers in Stockholm County. The
      nurses will identify 5 consecutive patients who have COPD and smoke. All nurses will complete
      a questionnaire for each patient at baseline (after visit 1) and after 3 months describing
      treatment provided. The nurses will ask each patient to fill in the TTQ and will provide
      individual counseling on the basis of the answers. After 3 months, the nurses will ask all
      patients if they still smoke and to fill in the TTQ again. Appropriate statistical methods
      will be used to analyze the questionnaire data.
