      includes educational components, self-monitoring of blood pressure and self-titration of
      antihypertensive medication in the improvement of control of hypertension compared to usual
      care in a poorly controlled population of hypertensive patients.

      Design: Pragmatic, controlled, randomized, non-masked clinical trial with two parallel arms.

      Disease related to the study: Hypertension.

      Main outcome measure: Difference in mean systolic blood pressure, in mmHg. At 12 months of
      follow-up between the intervention and control groups, determined at physicians' practice
      with a validated automatic electronic sphygmomanometer

      Study population: Patients assigned to the Valencia Clinic-La Malvarrosa Health Department.
      Total number of patients to be randomized: 458 (229 per arm).

      Duration of intervention: 12 months (also, a pragmatic extension with passive follow-up is
      planned for 24 months, collecting a reduced set of outcome variables, as secondary variables)

      Calendar and expected completion date: The trial will take place over 3 years (6 months of
      recruitment, 12 months of follow-up for the main analysis of results, 12 months of pragmatic
      follow-up at 24 months, and finally 6 months for reporting results). Estimated Completion
      Date: 2020.
