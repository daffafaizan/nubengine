      necessary for spinal stability, such as transversus abdominis, lumbar multifidus.

      Core stabilization exercises are valuable in motor relearning of coactivation of deep lumbar
      and abdominal muscles and in stabilization of the spine. Hence, they are important in the
      management of chronic low back pain.

      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been used in the training and strengthening
      of skeletal muscles for many years. It is shown that NMES can contract deep lumbar
      stabilization muscles and changes in muscle activation are significantly associated with pain
      reduction in patients with low back pain.
