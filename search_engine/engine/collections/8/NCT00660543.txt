      I. To characterize glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor vascular properties using ferumoxytol
      (ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite) and compare to those obtained using gadolinium
      (Gd) based MRI contrast agent.

      II. To characterize vascular changes in GBM tumors associated with standard
      radio/chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and time-to-peak (TTP) perfusion
      parameters will be measured for each contrast agent and evaluated in post-hoc analysis.

      II. To obtain qualitative assessment of tumor vascularity using time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic
      resonance (MR) angiography techniques.

      III. To characterize changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of tumor water
      associated with standard radio/chemotherapy in GBM.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gadolinium intravenously (IV) on day 1 and ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric
      magnetite IV on day 2 then undergo dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced (DSC) MRI, and
      dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (day 1 only), and TOF
      MR angiography on days 1-3 at 4 time points: before radiation, 3 weeks after initiation of
      radiation plus temozolomide, at the end of radiation (6 weeks post first dose) and 6 weeks
      after radiation (12 weeks post first dose). Ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite
      administration continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive
      temozolomide and undergo radiation therapy per standard of care.

      After completion of ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite administration, patients are
      followed up for 4-6 weeks and then periodically until the resolution or stabilization of
      unacceptable toxicities.
