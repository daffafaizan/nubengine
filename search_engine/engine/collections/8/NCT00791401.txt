      of a pretreatment (screening) period of between 1 and 3 weeks, an open label treatment period
      (single dose of ER OROS paliperidone on Day 1 only, and with end of study procedures and
      discharge ending on Day 6). All patients will be screened between Day 21 and Day 1 for renal
      function. On Day 1, all patients will receive a single oral dose of 3 mg ER OROS paliperidone
      and undergo a 120 hour follow up with serial blood collections for pharmacokinetics, safety
      and tolerability assessments. Patients will be discharged after giving a pharmacokinetic
      blood sample and completing end of study assessments in the morning of Day 6. Group matching
      will be applied to the renal function groups to reduce bias and increase comparability of
      age, weight, gender, and ethnicity. This study is aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics and
      safety profile of ER OROS paliperidone in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment
      with that of normal patients. 3 mg oral ER OROS paliperidone
