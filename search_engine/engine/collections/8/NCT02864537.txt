      program where they learned how to analyse International Normalised Ratio (INR) using the
      point-of-care instrument CoaguChekÂ®XS and dose warfarin. The patients had to display their
      skills through a test before considered self-managing. They continued to measure INR weekly
      for two years. All INR values during the training program and self-control period were
      collected. In addition, the patients were told to notify if they had any complications during
      this period. INR values and complications two years before enrolment was collected from INR
      cards and/or their general practioner. The participant filled in a quality of life-questioner
