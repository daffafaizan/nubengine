    
      It is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial. A total of
      316 subjects from around 20 selected hospitals will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either
      Active transfer of Plaque (ATP) stenting technique or Provisional T stenting technique.

      In the ATP treatment of bifurcation lesions, by the balloon pre-dilation in the target side
      branch, the plaque will be actively transferred from side branch to main vessel.
      Subsequently, the plaque will be fixed by the expansive stent in main vessel.As to the
      provisional T treatment, provisional T stenting is the typic step-T stenting. In brief, two
      wires are advanced to distal MV and SB. Pre dilation is left at operator's discretion,
      however, pre dilating SB is not encouraged. Kissing balloon inflation before stenting MV is
      left at operator's discretion. A stent with stent/artery ratio of 1.1:1 is inflated in MV.
      Rewire to SB is also left at operator's discretion. FKBI is recommended if there is at least
      one of following: residual stenosis>70%, >type B dissection and TIMI flow<3.

      All patients will be followed clinically at 1-, 6- 12- and 24-month after stent implantation.
      Repeat angiography will be performed in all patients at 13 months after the index procedure.

      The primary endpoint of the trial is the rate of TLR at 12-month follow-up.
