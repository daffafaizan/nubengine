      they have pain in the arm. The response are assessed; discomfort, pain, and withdrawal of the
      hand are recorded and graded using a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, or severe). After
      the intubating dose of rocuronium, withdrawal reactions are scored as follows: (a) no pain
      response, (b)pain limited to the wrist, (c) pain limited to the elbow/shoulder, or (d)
      generalized pain response.
