    
      To meet this objective, we propose to describe for the first time in a cohort of newborns,
      the cardiac autonomic maturation profile in the first two years of life and the neurological
      evolution at 2 years.

      Main objective.

        -  Describe the pattern, i.e. the cardiac autonomic maturation during the first two years
           of life in a cohort of newborns.

      Secondary objectives.

        -  Correlate in this cohort, the autonomous status at birth to the neurological psychomotor
           status at 2 years.

        -  Describe the autonomic pattern (evolution profile) during the first two years of life.

        -  According to specific criteria of pregnancy (maternal smoking, maternal hypertension and
           gestational age)

        -  According to data of morphometry (stature and weight development) at birth.

        -  According to the neonatal morbidity criteria: - bronchopulmonary dysplasia i.e. oxygen
           dependence at 36 weeks postnatal age, persistent ductus arterious, intra ventricular
           haemorrhage according to the Papille classification, periventricular leukomalacia,
           enterocolitis, nosocomial sepsis.

        -  According to the incidence of serious faintness and rhythmic disorders the two first
           years of life.
