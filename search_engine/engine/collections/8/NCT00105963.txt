    
      The specific goals of the program are:

        1. To change the understanding (i.e., knowledge and attitudes) and reduce the frustration
           of parents of new infants about the normality of the frustrating properties of crying;

        2. To change the behavior of parents to increase caregiving contact in response to crying
           but to 'walk away' if frustrated;

        3. To provide parents with the ability to communicate to other caregivers (relatives,
           baby-sitters) the knowledge and behavior to reduce frustration induced by inconsolable
           crying;

        4. To provide effective knowledge, skills and teaching materials to health care providers
           in direct contact with parents concerning crying, shaking and abuse;

        5. To reduce the incidence of physical abuse and shaken baby syndrome under one year;

        6. To have the Period of PURPLE Crying program adopted as a nationwide early intervention
           project.
