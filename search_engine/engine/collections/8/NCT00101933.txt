    
      Medtronic, Inc. is sponsoring an investigational study of the Medtronic DBS Therapy for
      epilepsy, the company's deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for patients with refractory
      epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition that affects 2.3 million Americans, and about one-third of
      these patients are refractory, or continue to experience seizures despite a wide range of
      treatment options.

      The prospective, randomized, double-blind trial uses existing technology to test whether
      bilateral stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus can safely and effectively
      reduce seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. It includes enrollment of 157 patients at
      17 sites in the U.S. 110 patients were implanted and monitored for 13 months following
      implant, with long-term follow-up until the device is approved or the study is stopped. 109
      of the 110 implanted subjects were randomized to Active stimulation or Control.

      Patients in the active group, who received neurostimulation, were monitored for a reduction
      in seizure rates compared to the control group, who did not receive neurostimulation during
      the three-month double-blind phase. After the double-blind phase, all patients received
      neurostimulation.

      Candidates for the trial were adults with partial-onset epilepsy for whom at least three
      antiepileptic drugs have proven ineffective. They were to have had an average of six or more
      seizures per month. Candidates continued to receive their epilepsy medications while
      participating in the trial.

      Deep brain stimulation therapy has already received approval in the United States, Europe,
      Canada, and Australia for the treatment of Essential Tremor and Parkinson's disease. Deep
      brain stimulation is not approved in the United States for the treatment of epilepsy.
