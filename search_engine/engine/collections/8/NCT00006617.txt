      weeks. A second, slower phase of viral decay is thought to occur in long-lived macrophages,
      with a minimal contribution from lymphocytes. This study addresses whether there is a third
      reservoir such as the central nervous system. Additionally, the study aims to provide a
      better understanding of the type and length of ART required to suppress HIV-1 replication in
      multiple reservoirs.

      Patients receive treatment with ZDV, 3TC, ABC, and APV daily for 24 weeks. Clinic visits
      occur weekly until Week 4, then every 2 weeks until Week 12, then monthly. Blood and urine
      samples are collected and patients are monitored for clinical or laboratory abnormalities.
      Laboratory tests to assess side effects and virologic and immunologic parameters, including
      viral quantification of CSF on all chronically infected patients and selected consenting
      acutely infected patients, are determined. In a pharmacoeconomic component of this study,
      patients have interviews and complete questionnaires at 5 clinic visits.
