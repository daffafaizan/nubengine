      cardiovascular death. SCD is often caused by ventricular arrhythmias in patients with a known
      history of ischemic heart disease but it may also occurs in healthy persons.

      In the last years has been extensively studied the protective role of long-chain n-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) against SCD both in healthy persons and in patients
      affected by coronary artery disease.

      The hypothesis that these evidences could be ascribed to an antiarrhythmic effect of n-3
      LCPUFA, has been corroborated by the observation of a direct relationship between the dietary
      intake of these nutrients and a better cardiac autonomic control.

      This pathway, in particular, has been confirmed by the analysis of changes in heart rate
      variability.

      Most studies in this field used n-3 LCPUFA derived from fish oil, composed by a combination
      of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). At our knowledge there are few
      studies available evaluating the isolated role of DHA, derived from alternative sources of
      n-3 LCPUFA, as the microalgae, in the prevention of fatal arrhythmias.
