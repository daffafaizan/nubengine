    
      This is a multicenter, open-label study in patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic
      control with GLP-1 receptor agonists for at least 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Week -6).

      Patients on monotherapy with VictozaÂ® or on combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor agonists
      and sulfonylurea (SU) are eligible. Patients on combination therapy with GLP-1 receptor
      agonists and non-SU hypoglycemic agents can also be included; however, these patients must
      undergo washout of the non-SU hypoglycemic agents administered with GLP-1 receptor agonists.
