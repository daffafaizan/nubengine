      cardiovascular disease. Visceral adipose tissue is also increased in HIV-infected people
      compared to uninfected individuals. Animal studies suggest that blockade of the
      mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular and metabolic
      parameters via inhibition of adipocyte differentiation and triglyceride accumulation. We will
      examine the effects of the MR antagonist eplerenone (50 mg daily) on HIV-infected adults with
      abdominal fat accumulation in a 24-week, open-label, proof-of-concept study. Magnetic
      resonance imaging will be conducted at screening and the final study visit to evaluate
      cardiac and hepatic steatosis. We anticipate that blocking the effects of increased
      aldosterone secretion with eplerenone will significantly reduce intramyocardial lipid content
      and hepatic steatosis in this population. These effects may be accompanied by decreases in
      visceral adipose tissue, and improvements in dyslipidemia and inflammation, thereby improving
      cardiovascular health.
