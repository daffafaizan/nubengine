    
      Study ADCT-402-102 is the first clinical study with ADCT-402 in participants with B-cell
      lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

      ADCT-402 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a humanized antibody directed
      against human cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19), stochastically conjugated via a
      valine-alanine cleavable, maleimide linker to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) participants will receive
      an infusion of ADCT-402 either on weekly administration or every 3-week administration.
      participants on weekly administration will receive an infusion of ADCT-402 on Days 1, 8, and
      15 of each 3 week treatment cycle. Participants on 3-week administration will receive an
      infusion of ADCT-402 on Day 1, every 3 weeks. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

      In Part 2 (expansion), all participants will be assigned to the recommended dose and/or
      schedule of ADCT-402 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee.

      For each patient, the study will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment
      period (until withdrawal), and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival
      for up to 12 months after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration will be
      dependent on overall patient tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment. It is
      anticipated that the duration of the entire study (Parts 1 and 2) could be approximately 3
      years from first patient treated to last patient completed.
