      Determine:

        1. The feasibility of the Southern California Healthy Heart and Blood Pressure registry as
           an effective method to recruit African American men to participate in a new research
           program

        2. If participants are willing to comply with the study procedures including wearing an
           activity monitor, sleep study device, and ambulatory blood pressure monitor

        3. The within subject variation for repeated measures of nocturnal blood pressure by
           ambulatory blood pressure and activity monitoring

        4. If nocturnal systolic blood pressure is higher in men with self-reported nocturia â‰¥2
           than in men with 0-1 nocturia

        5. If use of long-acting antihypertensive medication as well as nighttime dosing of
           medication can lower nocturnal systolic blood pressure and reduce nocturia

      Purpose:

      Obtain key pilot data to show feasibility and document the reproducibility of the proposed
      measurements.
