      it will be useful in treating patients with cancer. AT13148 is a type of drug called a
      protein kinase inhibitor. It blocks several different chemical messengers (enzymes) called
      AGC kinase proteins. These chemical messengers are part of the signaling process within cells
      which can make cells produce chemicals that trigger and control cell growth and cell death.
      In some types of cancer these chemical messengers are 'switched on' or 'switched off'
      permanently due to changes in the genes of cells called "gene mutations" leading to
      uncontrolled cancer cell growth. AT13148 targets multiple protein kinases from three families
      of kinases unlike many of the other protein kinase inhibitors currently being tested which
      target just one or two kinases. This may mean that it will work better and in a wider group
      of cancer patients. Patients will not be selected to take part based on having these gene
      mutations for this first trial because we want to learn more about which mutations are most
      important but this would be the hope for future trials. The patient population anticipated to
      benefit from this drug includes certain types of breast, prostate and ovarian cancer which
      more commonly have these gene mutations.
