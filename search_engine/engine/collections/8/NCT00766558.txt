      appointment, which will be used as baseline levels of eating disorder symptoms and
      psychological health. Participants will complete the writing as part of their eating disorder
      therapy. The writing will be completed individually. The writing will consist of continuous
      writing for fifteen minutes on three consecutive days. The experimental group will write
      about traumatic or stressful experiences, while the control group will objectively describe
      events. A post-writing packet of questionnaires will be completed one week after completing
      the writing. A follow-up evaluation will occur four-weeks after completion of the
      post-writing packet and will include completing a packet of questionnaires and debriefing.
