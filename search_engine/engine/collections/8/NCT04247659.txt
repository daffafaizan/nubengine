      the department of neurology of the second hospital of hebei medical university during
      2020.1-2021.6 are collected.Clinical data include gender, age, TOAST classification, history
      of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, head Computerized Tomography (CT), Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging(MRI), Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI),Susceptibility weighted imaging SWI
      within 72 hours after onset, admission National Institute of Health stroke scale ( NIHSS)
      score, admission DWI-aspect score, Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score on day 90 of
      onset.Venous blood will be taken within 72 hours of onset (and before the use of sodium
      aescinate) to detect serum s100-β, serum procalcitonin, plasma fibronectin, serum
      endothelin-1 by ELISA.The cortical vessel signs（CVSs）on SWI in the ischemic territory are
      classified as 'prominent' if there are more veins and/or larger veins with a greater signal
      loss than those in the opposite normal hemisphere, 'equal' if there are no significant
      differences in appearance of veins in the both cerebral hemispheres, and 'less' if the veins
      in the affected area are decreased compared to those in the normal cortex.

      Patients with massive cerebral infarction to be included are randomly divided into
      experimental group and control group by random number table method.The experimental group is
      treated with sodium aescinate for injection on the basis of conventional treatment. The
      control group is not treated with sodium aescinate for injection.

      This study will explore the relationship between asymmetric cortical vessel sign(ACVS) grade
      and baseline clinical data, serum factors associated with brain edema in patients with
      massive cerebral infarction.In addition,after 10 days of sodium aescinate injection, the CVS
      level of the experimental group will be compared with that of the control group.The
      difference of CVS grading before and after injection of sodium aescinate in the experimental
      group will be compared.Finally,the indexes with significance in single factor analysis will
      be screened out, and the factors related to prognosis of massive cerebral infarction will be
      further analyzed by multi-factor logistics regression.
