      clinical situations associated with dysbiosis. Today, this procedure is recommended in
      patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections but beneficial effects of FMT
      have also been described in other diseases associated with intestinal dysbiosis â€¦. A donor
      effect which could be related to the inter-individual variability of microbiota and
      microbiome leading to specific metabolic capacities may influence the efficacy of the
      procedure. The aim of our study is to measure fecal biochemical, microbial and immunological
      parameters that are known to influence gut homeostasis in a group of 40 healthy donors to
      establish a referential profile of human stools to optimize donor profiling, beyond the
      infectious parameters, to increase the success rate of FMT.
