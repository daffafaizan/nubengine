      failure.

      FDG PET/CT, with appropriate suppression protocol including high-fat-low-carbohydrate diet,
      fasting, and IV heparin, can be use to detect myocardial inflammation. It is frequently used
      for the diagnosis of inflammation in cardiac sarcoidosis. After the initial inflammatory
      phase, inflammation resolves and fibrosis can seen. Resting perfusion imaging will allow
      identification of fibrosis. The combination of FDG PET/CT and rest perfusion imaging could
      allow detection of the various phases of myocarditis; inflammation and fibrosis.
