      States. Each year approximately 750,000 individuals suffer a stroke, after which they remain
      at high risk for recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events. Incidence of stroke nearly
      doubles with each successive decade in older adults, with about 90% of strokes occurring in
      individuals over 55 years of age.

      Following stroke, physical inactivity in advancing age increases the incidence of elevated
      insulin levels and the insulin resistance syndrome, which are powerful factors that heighten
      risk for recurrent stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) by impairing fibrinolysis and
      vasomotor reactivity. Currently, prevention of recurrent stroke and MI depends on best
      medical management, including antiplatelet therapy, which has limited efficacy. Though
      aerobic exercise training (AEX) has been shown to improve insulin-glucose metabolism,
      fibrinolysis profiles, and vasomotor reactivity in healthy elderly and type 2 diabetics,
      there are no data on the effects of AEX on insulin sensitivity and related vascular
      endothelial cell function in the chronic hemiparetic stroke population. This trial addresses
      a significant public health gap, in that aerobic exercise rehabilitation therapy has never
      been systematically studied as a means to improve cardiovascular health profiles in this
      population.
