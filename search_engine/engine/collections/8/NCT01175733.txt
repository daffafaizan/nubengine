      Phase I:

      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 per dose level until the MTD of panitumumab has
      been established.

      Phase II:

      Up to approximately 56 patients will be treated at the MTD level of panitumumab as
      established in the phase I part of the study.

      Based on the historic data of patients with pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine based
      chemoradiation, we aim to increase the number of patients who are alive and progression free
      at 7 months from the historical value of 50% to 70% with the combination treatment of
      chemoradiation plus panitumumab.
