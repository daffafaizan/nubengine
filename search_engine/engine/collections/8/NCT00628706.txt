      effects on memory. Further, cannabis has an addictive potential. These effects are mediated
      by an action of THC, the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on cannabinoid CB1
      receptors. These receptors are particularly highly expressed in brain regions involved in
      memory and reward. Therefore, in this study we will investigate the acute effects of THC on
      functional brain systems underlying memory and reward. We will visualize these effects using
      the latest non-invasive imaging technique: pharmacological MRI (phMRI).
