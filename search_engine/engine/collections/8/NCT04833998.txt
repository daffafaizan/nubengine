      needs of patients undergoing cancer treatment and is produced from nine main ingredients with
      natural moisturizing actions based on glycerin, hazelnut extract, shea butter, aloe vera,
      calendula, chamomile and oat extract and 2 antioxidants (vitamin E and Thoitaine),
      dermatologically tested and approved. The choice of the product was based, mainly, due to its
      natural components, whose data from previous studies were extrapolated from radiodermatitis.
