      block(posterior and lateral chord), the investigators found it affecting all shoulder
      relevant nerves , except for the suprascapular and the supraclavicular nerves.

      Accordingly, by combining a superficial cervical plexus block, suprascapular nerve block and
      block of the posterior and lateral chords infraclavicularly, the investigators believe this
      novel combination would provide anesthesia for patients scheduled for shoulder surgery.
