      diet with a 4 week washout between arms. During scan days the hepatic glycogen response to a
      corresponding high versus low glycaemic index test meal will be measured using 13C Magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to explore any acute changes in metabolic response. Baseline
      liver lipid levels will be measured using 1H MRS to explore any long term changes in liver
      lipid levels.

      Blood samples will also be obtained throughout the test day to measure for blood glucose,
      insulin and blood hormone response. Satiety surveys will also be taken throughout the test
      day and during the diet week.

      The main hypothesis is that a one week calorie matched Glycaemic index varied diet will
      result in an altered response of liver glycogen levels acutely following a meal and also
      longer term hepatic liver lipid levels. A secondary hypothesis is that there will also be
      associated changes in blood sugar and hormone levels and that all these changes will have an
      effect on satiety levels in subjects.
