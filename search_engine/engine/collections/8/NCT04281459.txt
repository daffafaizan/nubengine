    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of SCT on the quality of life of HIV infected
      adults by administering HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaires (HIV-TSQs) to patients
      receiving SCT for at least 48 weeks and by comparing their answers to those of patients
      receiving standard 7-days-a-week ART with comparable therapeutic regimens.

      This is an interventional study performed at the HIV outpatients clinics of the Infectious
      and Tropical Diseases department in Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona
      (Italy).

      During standard visits and after collecting their informed consent, the investigators will
      administer HIV-TSQs to 30 patients receiving 4-days-a-week of rilpivirine-containing regimens
      (either rilpivrine/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide or rilpivirine + lamivudine/abacavir)
      and to 30 patients receiving the same regimens but 7-days-a-week.

      For the first group, the investigators will consider patients who have switched to a SCT at
      least 48 weeks before administration of the questionnaire, and data on their
      viro-immunological status (HIV-RNA, CD4+ cells count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio) after the switch to
      SCT will be retrospectively collected as well.
