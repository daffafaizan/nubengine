      7 ascending dose levels) has been initiated with an accelerated dose titration with 1 patient
      per DL until the occurrence of a â‰¥ Grade 2 drug-related AE. Following the occurrence of such
      moderate toxicity, patients have been enrolled in a slower dose escalation design with at
      least 3 patients per DL using a Modified Continual Reassessment Method. Of note, in case no
      toxicity occurs up to the DL4, the classical 3+3 design has been initiated. Cohorts of
      patients with biopsable disease have been added in order to assess the impact of NP137
      treatment on epithelial phenotype signature (assessed by RNAseq and subsequent bioinformatic
      profiling using published E vs M score). Up to 4 additional and independent cohorts of
      patients (n= up to 6 pts/ cohort) with biopsable disease have been enrolled. Starting from
      DL4, the enrolment in such cohort will be allowed at highest DL that has cleared its DLT
      assessment window. Such cohorts will allow to collect pre and on-treatment tumor biopsies in
      order to identify PD biomarkers correlated to NP137 clinical activity.

      In expansion parts, patients are treated at the RP2D defined in Part 1 (14 mg/kg).

      In both parts, NP137 will continue to be administered as long as patient experience clinical
      benefit in the opinion of the investigator or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic
      deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after an
      integrated assessment of radiographic data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent or
      patient willingness to stop the treatment.
