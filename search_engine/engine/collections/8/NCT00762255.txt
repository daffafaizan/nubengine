    
      Drug Administration: (A cycle is 28 days) Irinotecan and bevacizumab are given IV on days 1
      and 15 of each cycle. Vorinostat is given orally on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each cycle.

      Vorinostat (provided in 100mg capsules) begins at a dose of 200mg/day, escalating to
      300mg/day and then to a maximum of 400mg/day. Vorinostat will be taken prior to irinotecan
      and bevacizumab on days 1 and 15. The drug should be administered at the same time every day
      for days 2-7 and 16-21. Patients will be treated prophylactically with compazine 30 minutes
      prior to vorinostat which, in turn, should be taken 30 minutes prior to a meal whenever
      possible.

      Irinotecan is given at a dose of 125mg/mÂ². Bevacizumab is given at a dose of 10mg/kg.

      Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined by toxicities occurring during the first 4 weeks
      of therapy. Three patients will be treated at dose level one and can be enrolled
      simultaneously. They must be observed for dose limiting toxicities (DLT) for at least 4 weeks
      from treatment day 1. Page 15 of the protocol outlines the dose escalation parameters. At
      least 9 patients will be treated at the MTD. If DLT is not achieved in any cohort of up to a
      dose level of 400mg/day of vorinostat, further dose escalations will not be made. This dose
      will then become the recommended dose.

      Patients demonstrating evidence of benefit may be treated up to a maximum of 24 cycles, at
      the investigator's discretion.
