    
      Design :

      A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind clinical trial

      Primary objective :

      To determine whether a non-TNF-targeted biologic (vedolizumab) is superior to infliximab to
      treat patient with UC losing response or with a primary failure to a first subcutaneous
      anti-TNF drug at week 14.

      Secondary objective :

        -  To assess the rate of clinical response and remission at Week 54 in each group of
           treatments and the time to clinical response and remission from baseline ;

        -  To assess the changes in faecal calprotectin levels from baseline to week 14 and 54
           according to treatment ;

        -  To assess the rate of colectomy and hospitalization in each treatment group ;

        -  To assess the rate of mucosal healing at week 14 and 54 in each group of treatments ;

        -  To assess the rate of loss of response in each group of treatments for patients
           responder after induction phase ;

        -  To assess the changes of quality of life indexes and the disability index from baseline
           to week 14 and 54 ;

        -  To determine the safety profile of each group of treatments ;

        -  To characterize the response in each group of treatments according to drug monitoring of
           the first anti-TNF agent ;

        -  To describe the pharmacokinetics of infliximab and vedolizumab as second-line treatment
           of UC and explore the sources of pharmacokinetic inter-individual variability ;

        -  To identify predictive factors of response to the treatment, including pharmacokinetic
           features

      Expected findings and impact:

      The patients include in the clinical will not lose any benefit since both treatments are
      actually indicated and effective in this condition. In both arm of treatment, patients will
      receive an effective treatment.

      The study will optimize physician decision making to decrease the disease activity period in
      UC patients with known consequence such as hospitalisation, surgery, work cessations with
      related cost effects.
