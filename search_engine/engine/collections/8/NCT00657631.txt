      Payne Whitney Clinic (Manhattan Campus), outpatient psychiatric program. Patients were
      randomly assigned to a length of baseline before beginning the 8-week ACT treatment. There
      was be a five-week baseline period for all patients after which two patients will be
      introduced to ACT treatment in weekly increments. All patients received treatment as usual
      throughout baseline and ACT treatment. During baseline, patients were assessed by an
      independent rater every week and during ACT treatment, patients were assessed every other
      week and at a one-month follow-up. Each participant's assessment results were compared over
      time, so that there will be an established baseline level of functioning which will be
      compared to his or her level of functioning during treatment, at the end of treatment, and
      finally at the one-month follow-up. Hypotheses: It was hypothesized that patients' distress,
      anxiety and tension due to delusional thinking would decrease over time when comparing
      baseline to treatment, treatment to outcome, and then outcome to follow-up. Additionally, the
      number of delusional thoughts and the rate of re-hospitalization was hypothesized to decrease
      over time.
