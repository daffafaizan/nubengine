    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, early access treatment protocol of single-agent
      daratumumab in subjects with multiple myeloma who have received at least 3 prior lines of
      therapy including a PI and an IMiD or whose disease is double refractory to both a PI and an
      IMiD, who reside in areas where daratumumab is not commercially available or available
      through another protocol, who have not been enrolled in another daratumumab study, and who
      are not eligible for or who do not have access to enrollment in another ongoing clinical
      study of daratumumab. The study will have three phases: Screening phase (30 days prior to
      first dose of study drug), treatment phase (until documented progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or study end), End of Treatment (30 days after last dose of study drug).
      Participants will receive daratumumab (16 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg]) as intravenous
      infusion. Participants will primarily be assessed for overall response rate. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
