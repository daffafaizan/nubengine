      treating opioid use disorder (OUD). These aims address whether treatment is maintained by
      patients, if patients' opioid use outcomes improve and to determine if adherence to treatment
      for infectious disease results in fewer re-hospitalizations and emergency room visits, as
      well as improved quality of life.

      The specific aims:

      Aim1: The primary outcome will be a binary indicator of whether a patient is enrolled in and
      receiving effective medication treatment for OUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or injection
      naltrexone) at 12 weeks (3 months) after randomization.

      Aim 2: Evidence of improved opioid use outcomes (lower days of using opioids, negative urine
      opioids).

      Aim 3: Have higher rates of completion of the antimicrobial regimen for their infectious
      disease, decreased re-hospitalizations and emergency room presentations related to either
      their infectious disease or OUD over the 12-week follow-up period, and improved measures of
      quality of life.

      The intent of this study is to test the hypothesis:

      Assignment to the ID/LAB arm (OUD managed directly by the infectious disease (ID) specialists
      or hospitalist team with long acting injection buprenorphine (LAB)) will promote greater
      enrollment in effective medication treatment for OUD at 12 weeks after randomization,
      compared to TAU.
