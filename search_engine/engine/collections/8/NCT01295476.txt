        -  To confirm an association between induction failure (IF) status predicted by a
           previously identified 116-member genomic classifier and actual induction therapy outcome
           observed on COG study AALL0434.

        -  To explore whether there is an association between early relapse (as defined by bone
           marrow or extramedullary relapse within 18 months of diagnosis) predicted by previously
           identified 5-member (primary) and 57-member (secondary) genomic classifiers, and actual
           relapse status at 18 months on COG study AALL0434. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: RNA from cryopreserved bone marrow samples are analyzed for gene expression by
      microarray methods. Samples are then compared with the 116-member genomic classifier.
