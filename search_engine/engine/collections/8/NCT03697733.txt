      bleeding. The patient categorize post-operative pain as mild to moderate. Therefore, the
      effective analgesic added on intraoperative and post-operative is the most important factor
      in patient's satisfaction, patient well co-operation, shortness time of operation, decrease
      unpleasant symptoms and rapid recovery. However, there are many anesthetic technique that can
      be used to relive pain in the operation such as local anesthesia, total intravenous
      anesthesia, regional anesthesia or oral analgesic drugs.

      Intravenous Fentanyl is an short acting opioid. It has a fast onset of action within 2
      minutes and short duration of action 30-60 minutes. Respiratory depression, hypotension and
      bradycardia are adverse effects that might delayed discharge especially in one day surgery
      e.g. fractional curettage. Etoricoxib is an oral COX-2 specific inhibitor which can be used
      to relieve the pain. The onset of analgesia can be occurred within 24 minutes which peak
      plasma level within 60 minutes. There are many empirical evidences to support the results of
      post-operative pain after used oral Etoricoxib or intravenous Fentanyl. However, there are
      less evidences to support efficiency of oral Etoricoxib versus intravenous Fentanyl on
      post-operative Pain in fractional curettage under TIVA
