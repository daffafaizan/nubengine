      the fight against both fungal and bacterial infections. If pathogens enter the body, they are
      marked as foreign by antibodies and the complement system. Afterwards receptors on the
      neutrophils recognize and bind on these foreign substances to make them harmless. This
      process is called phagocytosis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and neutrophils are rarely
      associated. The HCV belongs to the Flaviviridae. It is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus
      with a positive polarity, which cause chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in approximately 170 million
      people worldwide. Subsequently, such an infection leads to liver cirrhosis and carcinoma in a
      significant proportion of patients. The virus infects mainly hepatocytes, but extrahepatic
      replication has also been shown. HCV usually enters the cell through receptor-mediated
      endocytosis (claudin-1, cluster of differentiation (CD)81, occludin and scavenger receptor
      1), before it abuses the cell's own infrastructure for the viral protein synthesis.

      The aim of this study is to determine neutrophil function in chronic hepatitis C infected
      patients. Furthermore the investigators want to examine if neutrophils or their precursor
      cells are infected with HCV and if this leads to their dysfunction.
