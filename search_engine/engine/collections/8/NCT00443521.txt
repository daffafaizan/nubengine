      panretinal photocoagulation. Therefore this study is designed using both treatments in the
      same patient: intravitreal triamcinolone plus panretinal photocoagulation in one eye,
      compared to panretinal photocoagulation alone in the contralateral eye. These patients had
      their visual acuity measured and complete ophthalmological examination was performed,
      including macular slit lamp examination, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence
      tomography.

      Patients with symmetric proliferative diabetic retinopathy without high risk characteristics
      receive laser therapy in both eyes and triamcinolone injections in one eye. For the
      triamcinolone injections, numbing drops, antibiotic drops, and drops to dilate the pupil, and
      possibly and anesthetic injection, are put in the eye before the medicine is injected into
      the vitreous. Patients return for follow-up visits 1 day, 1 and 4 weeks after the injection,
      and then 3 and 6 months. Patients whose condition does not improve may undergo new
      evaluation.
