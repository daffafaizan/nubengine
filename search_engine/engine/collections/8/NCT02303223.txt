      anesthesia. So far, the pharmacokinetics of propofol has not been studied in Indian children.
      We believe that this pharmacokinetic characterization of propofol will help in better
      management of these patients undergoing surgery under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) in
      our setup. 12 ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade I patients, 5 to 12 years old
      planned for elective surgery will be included. Premedication will be done with syrup
      midazolam 0.5mg/kg. After shifting the patient to the operation table, routine physiological
      monitoring will be commenced and two intravenous lines will be secured,one in the antecubital
      vein of one arm and the other vein on the dorsum of the contralateral hand. The antecubital
      venous access will be used for blood sampling. Anesthetic technique will consist of fentanyl
      bolus dose of 2ug/kg followed by propofol bolus dose of 2.5 mg/kg. No further propofol will
      be administered. After loss of consciousness , patients will be paralysed with atracurium
      (0.5mg/kg) and endotracheal intubation will be performed. Anesthesia will be maintained with
      isoflurane, oxygen (50%) and nitrous oxide (50%), and intermittent dosages of atracurium. A
      total of twelve samples will be collected from each patient at 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 20, 30, 60,
      90, 120, 240, and 480 min after administration of bolus dose of propofol.The samples will be
      analyzed using a modified High Performance Liquid Chromatography method described by Pavan et
      al. The pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated using three compartment model to develop
      a pharmacokinetic model by using the software WINNONLIN (Windows Non Linear Regression
      Program).
