      II, clinical study to explore the activity of eribulin in a population of patients with
      progressive, advanced (i.e. locally advanced or metastatic), molecularly proven SFT. Patients
      with a documented and centrally reviewed pathological diagnosis of locally advanced or
      metastatic SFT, and with an evidence of progression within the previous 6 months, may enter
      the study.

      Study treatments will be administered till progression or toxicity. The primary end-point of
      the study is overall response rate Secondary end-points are Progression Free Survival (PFS),
      Overall Survival (OS) clinical benefit rate, response rate as by Choi criteria, duration of
      response.

      Subjects already treated with one or two prior medical therapy regimens for the advanced
      phase, whatever agent used in first- or second-line, are eligible for inclusion in the study.
      Investigators will consider eligible for this study even patients na√Øve from chemotherapy,
      considering the limited activity of anthracycline in the disease.
