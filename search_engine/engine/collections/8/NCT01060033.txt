    
      At our institution, all patients receiving external beam and/or brachytherapy as part of the
      treatment of primary cervical cancer receive CT, PET, and MRI simulation scans as standard of
      care. Brachytherapy patients also receive weekly T1/T2 weighted MR simulation scans as part
      of their treatment planning.

      We propose the use of additional MR sequences to the standard T1/T2 weighted MR simulation
      scans. The data obtained from these additional sequences will be used for improving tumor
      delineation and obtaining prognostic information.
