      potential in slowing myopic progression but the efficacy is yet to be confirmed by a
      randomized clinical trial (RCT). The current RCT aims at studying the efficacy of
      orthokeratology in retardation of myopic progression by comparing the eye growth in terms of
      axial length elongation in children wearing orthokeratology lenses (study group) and those
      wearing single-vision spectacles (control group).
