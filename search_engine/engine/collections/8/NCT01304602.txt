      decades, the overwhelming majority of these patients will still succumb from this disease. It
      is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States. We have witnessed
      significant leaps in understanding colorectal cancer carcinogenesis as well as in
      identification of a number of prognostic and predictive factors associated with this
      malignancy. With the use of combination chemotherapy and the addition of targeted agents, the
      median survival of patients with advanced colorectal cancer has improved from 4-6 months with
      supportive care to over 2 years.

      Molecularly directed therapy for cancer holds promise to a more personalized approach to
      treating cancer. Increase understanding of tumorigenesis has resulted in the identification
      of promising targets of therapy for more strategic approach to treatment of this malignancy.
      However, even with the development of molecularly directed treatment, the therapy for
      advanced colorectal cancer remains to be primarily palliative in nature to majority of
      patients. There is definite need for a more effective therapy, agents with more acceptable
      toxicity profiles, and drugs that could be administered without significant demand on time
      and activity for individual patients receiving these drugs.

      This is a phase I trial of the combination of irinotecan and BKM120 in patients with advanced
      colorectal cancer who have failed on or have become intolerant of at least one line of
      therapy for advanced colorectal cancer and who are candidates for irinotecan therapy. This
      study will attempt to estimate the Maximum Tolerated Dose of the combination of irinotecan
      and BKM120.
