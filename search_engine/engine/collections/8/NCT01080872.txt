    
      Objective: The aim of the trial is to assess coronary artery reactivity using
      adenosine-induced coronary flow reserve (CFR) by transthoracic echocardiography in patients
      with Bio-active stent (BAS) and Everolimus-eluting stent (EES) distal to the original culprit
      lesion at 6-8 months.

      Design: BASE-CFR is a substudy of the larger randomized multicenter BASE-ACS trial comparing
      bio-active Titan stent to everolimus-eluting stent in patients with acute coronary syndrome.
      CFR assessment will be performed at 6-8 months after stent implantation at the same time with
      OCT assessment. In-stent restenosis will be ruled out using OCT.

      Primary endpoint: CFR at 6-8 months after stent implantation.

      Secondary endpoint: Coronary flow velocity at baseline and during adenosine-induced hyperemia
      6-8 months after stent implantation..

      Association of CFR to unendotheliazed stent struts and stent malapposition.

      Enrollment: 40 patients (20 receiving BAS and 20 receiving EES).
