      L2-7001 through four dose levels. Ascending dose cohorts of five patients are studied. The
      safety and tolerability of L2-7001 is assessed in preparation for the second phase of the
      study and to estimate an MTD. Phase B involves randomization of 190 patients to (a) one of
      three dose levels of L2-7001 plus ART, (b) one of two dosing levels of Proleukin plus ART, or
      (c) ART alone. L2-7001 and Proleukin are given SC every 12 hours for the first 5 days of an
      8-week cycle for three cycles. Serum IL-2 levels, soluble IL-2 receptor levels, and levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines are evaluated in 8 patients randomized to each treatment cohort of
      Phase B. All patients completing this phase of the protocol are eligible to be screened for
      enrollment in a maintenance use protocol which will allow for access to L2-7001.
