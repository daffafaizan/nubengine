        -  Compare the lean body mass and weight of patients with solid tumors and weight loss who
           are receiving chemotherapy when treated with oxandrolone vs megestrol.

        -  Compare the health-related quality of life of patients treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (I-III vs IV), concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no), and gender. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral oxandrolone twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral megestrol once daily. In both arms, treatment continues
           for 12 weeks in the absence of excessive weight loss or gain or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life, weight, and body composition are assessed at baseline, at 1, 2, and 3 months
      during study therapy, and then at 1 month after study completion.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62-155 patients (31-77 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 2 years.
