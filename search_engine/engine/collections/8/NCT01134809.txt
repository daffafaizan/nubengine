    
      Experimental plan Fifteen adult patients undergoing major open elective abdominal surgery
      will be included in this nonrandomized study.

      Objectives:

        1. To study the expression proteins and metabolites involved in UPP mediated protein
           degradation, in blood and muscle biopsy samples.

        2. To correlate the effects of surgery on the release of bacteria in blood from the bowel.

      The analysis of the samples will include the following techniques, namely, RTPCR, ELISA,
      western blotting and metabolomics.

      Establishing the association between these signaling mechanisms and expression of the
      individual proteins secondary to inflammation following surgery and infection would enable
      application of suitable therapeutic strategies that could reduce the inflammatory response to
      benefit all patients undergoing surgery.
