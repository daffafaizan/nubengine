      randomized in a 1:1 ratio by practice type to receive the intervention or continue with their
      standard practice. All enrolled clinicians (both trained and control providers) patients they
      care for will be screened for inclusion in the trial.

      Additionally, a pre/post intervention will be layered upon the randomized educational
      intervention to evaluate the effects of the information technology decision support tool
      (i.e. eMR) in isolation of the clinician education intervention. The 32-month mTBI patient
      enrollment period will be divided into two 16 months segments. The first 16 months will be
      without the eMR intervention being visible, and the remaining 16 months post eMR screening
      and decision support deployment in the ED and UC. This study design allows us to evaluate the
      independent and interactive effects of the decision support tool and educational
      intervention.

      Enrolled children will be followed for up to three months post injury to ascertain the effect
      of the interventions on the primary aim (reduction of school problems/performance) and
      secondary aims.
