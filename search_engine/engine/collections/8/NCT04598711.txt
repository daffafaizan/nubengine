      local, sublethal ischemia protects from subsequent ischemia. Remote ischemic conditioning is
      another more practical approach where transient ischemia and reperfusion applied to a remote
      organ or tissue, protects other organs or tissues from further episodes of lethal
      ischemia/reperfusion injury. Remote limb ischemic conditioning (RLIC) is a clinically
      feasible way of performing remote ischemic conditioning where alternating, brief ischemia and
      reperfusion is delivered with cyclic inflation and deflation of a blood pressure cuff on the
      arm or leg.

      The overall goal of this research is to use ischemic conditioning to enhance muscle power,
      motor leaning, and mobility in children with CP. Our previous work demonstrated that when
      paired with strength training, RLIC improved muscle strength and activation in healthy, young
      adults and motor learning in healthy older adults. The current study extends that work to
      determine if RLIC enhances muscle power, dynamic balance, and walking performance in children
      with CP. This Phase II study will yield the necessary information to design and execute
      subsequent randomized controlled trials in children with CP as well as other neurological
      conditions.
