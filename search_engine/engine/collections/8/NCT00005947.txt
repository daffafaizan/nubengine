      I. Compare the time to progression, time to development of disease-related pain, and
      incidence of grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events in patients with asymptomatic
      metastatic hormone refractory adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with APC8015 versus
      control infusion. II. Compare response rate and duration of response in these patients.

      Outline: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      Arm I: Autologous dendritic cell precursors (ADCP) are harvested on weeks 0, 2, and 4.
      Patients receive APC8015 comprised of ADCP activated with prostatic acid
      phosphatase-sargramostim (GM-CSF) fusion protein IV over 30 minutes beginning 2 days after
      each harvest for a total of 3 infusions. Arm II: ADCP are harvested as in arm I. Patients
      receive unactivated ADCP IV over 30 minutes beginning 2 days after each harvest for a total
      of 3 infusions. Pain is assessed weekly for up to 3 years or until 4 weeks after objective
      disease progression. Patients are followed monthly for up to 3 years or until disease
      progression. At the time of disease progression, patients treated on arm II may receive
      treatment on Protocol D9903.

      Projected Accrual: A total of 120 patients (80 in arm I and 40 in arm II) will be accrued for
      this study.
