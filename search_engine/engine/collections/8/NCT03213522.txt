      treating bladder dysfunction in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). It will be compared to
      standard care for the treatment of bladder dysfunction, which is Pelvic Floor Physical
      Therapy. Bladder dysfunctions are extremely common in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. One
      of the most common symptoms of bladder dysfunction is called over-active bladder. Over-
      active bladder can be described by increased urges to urinate and frequency of urination,
      especially at night. Other common symptoms are: leakage of urine, with or without activity;
      inability to hold urine; and a decreased ability to empty bladder when urinating.
