    
      This study is designed to test the efficacy and safety of the oral anti factor Xa apixaban
      2.5 mg given twice daily as a prophylaxis of VTE in transplant-eligible patients with
      multiple myeloma during the induction therapy with VTD.

      Induction therapy prior to ASCT will consist in no less than 4 and no more than 6 cycles of
      VTD, depending on treatment response. Duration of each cycle is 4 weeks if there is not any
      disease or treatment-related complication; therefore, treatment duration will be around 4-6
      months. Daily Prophylaxis with apixaban will continue up to a maximum of 14 days after the
      last dose of thalidomide. In addition, there will be an additional observation period of 14
      (Â± 7) days, starting the day after the last dose of study medication (until 28 days after the
      end of the last cycle of VTD).
