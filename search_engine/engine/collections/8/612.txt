verbal effects in the intermediate-size transportation problempreschool children were given an intermediate-size discrimination problem,told before each response that the reward was under the "medium" stimulus:and 1- and 3-step transposition tests.  during training, group i wasgroup ii was told that it was "not under the big or little one"; and groupiii was not told anything.  the verbalizations were not given during thetests.  groups i and ii learned the initial discrimination faster than groupiii, and transposed more than group iii, but there was a distance effectin all three groups.  these results, and other data, suggest that thedeficiency in the verbal control over motor behavior in young children arisesfrom deficiencies in both the decoding and encoding processes.
