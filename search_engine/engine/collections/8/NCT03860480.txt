      called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). VATS has reduced the incision size, the
      postoperative pain and the morbidity associated with thoracic surgery. Optimal postoperative
      analgesia for VATS surgery remains an open issue because although it is a lot less painful
      than a thoracotomy, VATS is a painful procedure with the associated risk of developing
      chronic pain. Adequate relief leads to early mobilization, potentially improves respiratory
      functions, and decreases the global stress response secondary to the surgery.

      Invasive analgesic techniques such as epidural or paravertebral block for VATS surgery are
      frequently being replaced for less invasive plane blocks to provide postoperative analgesia.
      At our center, anesthesiologists tend to perform epidurals only when there is a significant
      risk of transitioning to an open thoracotomy. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA), remains the
      usual analgesic technique for VATS surgery at our institution.

      Erector spinae (ESP) block is a recently described plane block designed to block the dorsal
      and ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves. It is meant to block the ipsilateral trunk.
      The aim of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the ESP block as postoperative
      analgesia for VATS surgery.
