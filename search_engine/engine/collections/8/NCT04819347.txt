    
      This is an open-label, one site study, in which a total of 24 HIV-1 subjects who are
      virologically suppressed and stable on daily oral combination antiretroviral therapy will be
      enrolled.

      All eligible patients will be switched from daily oral combination antiretroviral regimen to
      treatment of ABT and 3BNC117 for 14 weeks. There is a two-week overlap of the baseline oral
      antiretroviral therapy and the ABT-3BNC117 combination regimen at the beginning of the study
      treatment, and then the oral ART will be interrupted.

      The patients will be monitored for viral rebound every two or four weeks following initiation
      of ABT-3BNC117 combination and will re-initiate an oral antiretroviral regimen if virological
      rebound is confirmed with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels above 200 copies/ml on two consecutive
      test.

      Pharmacokinetics of ABT and 3BNC117 will be assessed in this study.
