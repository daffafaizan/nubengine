    
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label trial to investigate the antiviral activity,
      tolerability and safety of TMC114/r) versus lpv/rtv in treatment-naive HIV-1 infected
      patients. Six hundred sixty treatment-na√Øve HIV-1 infected patients will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to either 800/100 mg of TMC114/r once daily, or a total daily dose of 800/200 mg of
      lpv/rtv. All patients will take TMC114/r or lpv/rtv in combination with an NRTI background of
      Truvada (a combination pill of tenofovir and emtricitabine, "TDF/FTC"). The trial will
      consist of a screening period of approximately 14 to 28 days and a 96-week treatment period,
      followed by a 4-week follow-up period. The anti HIV-1 therapy initiated at baseline cannot be
      changed until the end of the treatment period. After the end of the treatment period (maximum
      of 96 weeks), patients will be followed for an additional 4 weeks to follow-up on any adverse
      events or laboratory abnormalities until resolution. Patients who fail either virologically
      or due to intolerance from the TMC114/r or lpv/rtv therapy, as judged by the investigator, or
      who meet one of the withdrawal criteria will be withdrawn from the trial and may have the
      opportunity to participate in the rollover phase of the trial.

      The primary efficacy parameter is virologic response defined as a confirmed viral load < 50
      copies/mL at Week 48 the objective of this study is to establish non-inferiority of TMC114/r
      versus lpv/rtv in terms of virologic response at Week 48 using a non-inferiority margin of
      12%. To test this hypothesis, a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in
      response rate between TMC114/r and lpv/rtv will be derived: If the lower bound of the CI
      exceeds -12%, non-inferiority will be concluded. Patients will take oral doses for up to 96
      weeks of either 800/100mg of TMC114/r 1x/day or 800/200mg of lpv/rtv once daily, each in
      combination with TDF/FTC. (The 400/100 mg 2x/day dose of lpv/rtv will be used where the
      1x/day use of lpv/rtv is not approved).
