      single dose of dexmedetomidine for the prevention of shivering and nausea after cesarean
      delivery. It is hypothesized that patients who receive dexmedetomidine (as compared to
      placebo) will have a reduced severity of postoperative shivering and nausea.

      Study subjects will be have a scheduled cesarean section. They will receive written, informed
      consent obtained before surgery. After enrollment, patients will receive spinal anesthesia
      consisting of 11.25mg bupivacaine, 25 mcg of fentanyl, and 250 mcg of morphine. All IV fluid
      will be warmed.

      After delivery of the neonate, delivery of the placenta, and assurance of adequate uterine
      tone, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive a blinded study syringe
      consisting of either placebo saline, or 10 mcg of dexmedetomidine.

      Study outcomes will be measured on an 11-point Likert scale assessing shivering, nausea,
      pain, pruritus, and sedation. Assessments will be performed on admission to the recovery
      room, and at 30 and 60 minutes.
