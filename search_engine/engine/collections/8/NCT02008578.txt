    
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous
      hyperimmune immunoglobulin (Flu-IVIG) in individuals with influenza A or B is to determine
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Flu-IVIG and assess whether antibody levels observed
      following Flu-IVIG transfusion are similar to those predicted. This pilot study will inform a
      larger study that will be powered to compare Flu-IVIG with placebo for efficacy. In addition
      to informing the Flu-IVIG dosing required for the clinical outcomes trial, the pilot study
      will compare influenza antibody levels and safety for study participants randomly assigned
      Flu-IVIG and those assigned placebo, assess the feasibility of enrollment, evaluate
      randomization and blinding procedures, and possibly obtain some preliminary data on efficacy
      that may be used to inform sample size and study procedures for the clinical outcomes study.
