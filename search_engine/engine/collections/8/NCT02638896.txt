    
      This single-centre, open-labeled randomized study will evaluate the efficacy of safety of
      etanercept dose reduction combined with sulfasalazine in patients who achieved a significant
      clinical response. AS patients who meet the inclusion criteria will take celecoxib (0.4g/d)
      during the whole period of study. In the first period, all patients will be given etanercept
      50 mg subcutaneous injections weekly from baseline to week12. In the second period, patients
      who satisfied the criteria for disease remission will be randomized to one of the following
      three treatment arms: (1) Dose reduction arm: Patients will receive etanercept 50 mg
      subcutaneous injections every other weeks plus sulfasalazine (2g/d) oral administration till
      week24. (2) Dose maintenance arm: Etanercept remains unchange from week12 to week24. (3)
      Etanercept discontinuation arm: Patients will be treated with sulfasalazine (2g/d) oral
      administration till week24. In the third period, all patients will take sulfasalazine (2g/d)
      till week 48. Ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS), erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional
      index (BASFI), Bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI),Spondyloarthritis research
      consortium of Canada(SPARCC) score for the sacroiliac joint and adverse effect will be
      assessed in the study.
