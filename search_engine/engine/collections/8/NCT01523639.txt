    
      This multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled phase II study will enroll 132 first-line
      palliative treated subjects with metastatic KRAS wild type CRC.

      Wild-type KRAS is required for study entry. Further target-related parameters, based on
      current scientific knowledge may be assessed.

      Subjects are randomized to Arm A or Arm B Arm A: FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab and
      metformin Arm B: FOLFIRI in combination with cetuximab and placebo

      A liver biopsy of hepatic metastasis and normal liver tissue is planned before the first
      cycle and at the end of treatment; with regard to the primary study objective, these subjects
      are evaluable.

      Both efficacy and safety data will be collected. The investigators will assess response to
      treatment every 8 weeks based on imaging.

      Following permanent treatment cessation, subjects will be followed-up for survival.

      One interim analysis for futility (54 evaluable patients) and in addition two safety analysis
      for evaluation of reported adverse events between the two treatment groups will be performed
      at two different timepoints (20 evaluable patients/54 evaluable patients).
