      asked questions about your values and feelings about your health status. You will be shown a
      "feeling thermometer" and asked to rate how your health condition makes you feel. You will
      also be asked to rate how some of the risks of treatment of cervix cancer make you feel. You
      will be shown a "chance board" and asked to consider some of the possible outcomes of the
      disease and possible risks associated with the treatment of cervix cancer. You will be asked
      to consider the likelihood of achieving certain outcomes and of developing certain side
      effects due to the disease and/or treatment. The interview will take place in a private room
      in the clinic and should take around 20 minutes to complete.

      This is an investigational study. As many as 96 women will participate in this study. Up to
      48 women who are at high risk of developing cervix cancer and up to 48 women who have been
      diagnosed with cervix cancer will participate. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
