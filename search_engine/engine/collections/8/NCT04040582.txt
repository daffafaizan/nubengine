      captured the collective attention of the medical community and the public at large. Now, at
      the forefront of a renaissance in psychedelic research, this study is investigating the
      interrelationship of psychedelics and mental wellness - a state of well-being in which the
      individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can
      work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.
      This work will be unique in that it will collect both objective and subjective data to assess
      the interrelationship between psychedelic and wellness. It will lend support to the growing
      body of research in the use of psychedelics for both mental health conditions and the pursuit
      of overall mental wellness.
