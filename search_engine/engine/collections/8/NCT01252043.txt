      underwent 64-slice CT or MR examinations between January 2005 and Oct 2010 and had EVs on
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Splenic diameters (mm) and hepatic diameters of all patients were
      measured. Splenic and hepatic volume indices also calculated. The transverse diameters of
      paraesophageal varices (PVs) and perigastric varices (PGVs) were measured adjacent to the
      lower thoracic esophagus and within the lesser sac, respectively.

      We will try to find out the possible splenic, hepatic or vascular predicting factors useful
      to evaluate the risk of clinically evident esophageal varices.
