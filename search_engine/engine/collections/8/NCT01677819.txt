      and impulsivity, is an early onset, highly heritable, clinically heterogeneous, long-term
      impairing disorder with tremendous impact on individuals, families, and societies. It affects
      5-10% of school-aged children worldwide (7.5% in Taiwan). Methylphenidate, a stimulant, is
      effective in treating these patients. Studies in Taiwan show no effect of methylphenidate on
      blood pressure. There are evidences show that the change of blood pressure was associated
      with inhibition of impulsive behaviors. Stop Signal Task(SST) is used to assess the improve
      of inhibition control after methylphenidate response. By using repeated outcome measurements,
      we anticipate that this study will evaluate the improvement of neuropsychological
      performances after medication and determinie the association between medication response and
      neuropsychological functions and vital signs in a Taiwanese sample.
