      chronic complications. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems help patients improve
      glycaemic control by providing real-time glucose levels, glycaemic tendency, glycaemic swing
      rate and by alerting the patient when the glucose value read by the sensor reaches a
      predefined threshold of hyper or hypoglycaemia.

      Several CGM systems are available and they have different characteristics that could
      influence patients' quality of life and glycaemic control.

      In this randomized cross over study investigators will compare 2 different CGM systems:
      Eversense implantable sensor (Senseonics, Germantown, MD, USA) and the standard
      transcutaneous sensor Dexcom G5 (Dexcom, San Diego, CA, USA). Investigators will evaluate
      sensors' accuracy, impact on quality of life and efficacy in optimizing glycaemic control.

      Patients will use Dexcom G5 or Eversense for three months, respectively, in a randomized
      order. Accuracy will be evaluated comparing sensors values with capillary blood glucose at
      home.

      Quality of life will be assessed at the beginning and at the end of each three-month period
      through validated questionnaires to underline differences in different sensors use.

      Time spent in target (70-180 mg/dl), in hypoglycamiea and hyperglycemia will be evaluated
      with both sensors to assess differences in glycaemic control induced by different alarm
      system and by the presence of predictive alarms
