      60 adult patients with amnestic MCI at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia
      University Medical Center. Recruitment will be from clinics and/or advertisements. In the
      protocol, all 60 amnestic MCI patients will receive baseline memory and olfactory assessments
      and begin treatment with donepezil. Patients will be followed for a total of 1 year. During
      this time, patients will be monitored closely by the study physician and will receive memory
      and olfactory assessments at weeks 8, 26, and 52. In addition, an olfactory challenge test
      will be done at baseline.

      This project will be of value in the selection of patients with mild cognitive impairment for
      treatment based on the evaluation of olfaction tests to predict response to donepezil and
      other ACheI. Since mild cognitive impairment is widespread and Alzheimer's disease represents
      a major public health problem, this study has considerable public purpose and significance.
