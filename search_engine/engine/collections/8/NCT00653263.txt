      withdrawal symptoms experienced by methamphetamine abusers who are recently abstinent from
      methamphetamine. The period of drug or substance withdrawal is often cited as the time during
      which risk of relapse use of that substance is very high. Therefore it is highly important to
      characterize specifically the withdrawal syndrome associated with cessation of
      methamphetamine use. This study will demonstrate our ability to recruit and work with this
      methamphetamine dependent population. In addition it will allow for the collection of pilot
      data to assist in selecting appropriate assessment tools in a submission of an RO1 grant for
      well-controlled studies characterizing methamphetamine withdrawal.
