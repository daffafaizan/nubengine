    
      Cystic fibrosis (CyFi) is a progressive hereditary disease with the prevalence of 1 in 2500.
      CyFi is an autosomal recessive disease caused by pathogenic variant/s in the CFTR (Cystic
      Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene encoding Cftr protein.

      CyFi causes chronic respiratory damage. Pulmonary findings occur already in infancy, which
      raises questions whether obstruction might be congenital. Thick, sticky mucus clogs the
      airways, reduces muco-ciliary clearance and leads to problems with breathing and recurrent
      bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) infections, which causes over time the formation of scar
      tissue (fibrosis) and cysts in the lungs.There is no cure for CyFi; however, symptomatic
      treatment can help relieve symptoms.

      The aim of this study is to identify biomarkers for Cystic fibrosis disease and to explore
      their clinical robustness, specificity, and long-term variability. An ideal biomarker plays
      an essential role in the early diagnosis, prediction and therapeutic monitoring of a specific
      disorder.
