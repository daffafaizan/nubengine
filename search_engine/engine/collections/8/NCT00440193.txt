      The treatment period was followed by an observational period of 30 days starting the day
      after the last intake of study medication, regardless of the actual duration of study drug
      administration. Participants who did not complete the treatment period also entered the
      observational period. It was also possible that participants did not enter the observational
      period, e.g. due to withdrawal of consent or termination of study participation. Participants
      who were transferring from study 11702 DVT (NCT00440193) to the extension study 11899
      (NCT00439725) did not enter the observational period.
