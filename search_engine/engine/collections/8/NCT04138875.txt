    
      Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorders (PTLD) are defined by the revised 2017 edition
      of the WHO Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues as "lymphoid or
      plasmacytic proliferations that develop as a consequence of immunosuppression in a recipient
      of a solid organ, bone marrow or stem cell allograft". Within this definition 4 distinct
      categories exist, including: (1) Non-destructive PTLDs (plasmacytic hyperplasia, infectious
      mononucleosis, and florid follicular hyperplasia) (2) Polymorphic PTLD; (3) Monomorphic PTLD
      and (4) Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma type PTLD.

      The incidence of PTLD varies between different transplanted organs. Across all transplants
      monomorphic PTLD is the most common accounting for 75% of all cases. Lymphoma derived of B-
      cell origin account for the majority of cases (70%), while T-cell neoplasms represent a small
      minority (5%). Within monomorphic PTLD 50% of cases demonstrate association with the Epstein
      Barr Virus (EBV). Polymorphic PTLD accounts for 15-20% of all PTLD cases with the majority
      demonstrating EBV involvement. Early lesions account for 5% of PTLD and are all uniformly
      associated with EBV as are all the cases of Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma type PTLD.

      The current understanding of the pathogenesis of PTLD is incomplete. Despite concerted
      efforts, the investigators are unable to predict who will develop PTLD and do not understand
      why only 1 - 2% of all transplant recipients develop these disorders.
