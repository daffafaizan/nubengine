      study with the purpose to develop a motivationally enhanced biomarker feedback counseling
      protocol and all printed materials to be used in Phase 2. After investigators develop a good
      working treatment protocol, an active intervention in smoking homes who live with a child in
      their home will be carried out.

      Those randomized to the Control Group will receive health education in the form of brochures
      detailing the health effects of secondhand smoke and how to make their home smoke free.
      Participants randomized to the Treatment Group will receive tobacco-specific biomarker
      feedback and personalized motivationally enhanced counseling.
