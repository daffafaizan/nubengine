      effect-site concentrations (Ce) of remifentanil by target-controlled infusion (TCI) according
      to their group assignments (R0, remifentanil Ce of 0 ng/ml; R0.5, remifentanil Ce of 0.5
      ng/ml; R1.0, remifentanil Ce of 1.0 ng/ml; R1.5, remifentanil Ce of 1.5 ng/ml) from 10
      minutes before the end of surgery to LMA removal. Airway complications (airway obstruction,
      desaturation, breath holding, and coughing), nausea, and vomiting were assessed during the
      emergence phase.
