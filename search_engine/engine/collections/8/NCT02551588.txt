      controls subjects and patients with AVS in order to :

        1. Analyze myocardial fibrosis markers in MRI, the degree of hypertrophy, remodeling and
           wall shear stress in a control population and in three groups of subjects to RA
           progressively increasing risk: asymptomatic subjects without symptomatic subjects LV
           dysfunction, symptomatic patients with LV dysfunction. The factors favoring the
           appearance of fibrosis observed in MRI will be analyzed on all subjects.

        2. To validate these fibrosis markers estimated by MRI by histological analysis of biopsies
           performed in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.

        3. Monitoring compliance with the distribution of markers of fibrosis and wall stress
           estimated on Initial MRI are factors of aggravation or not improved function and / or
           remodeling remote myocardial. Public hospitals in Paris
