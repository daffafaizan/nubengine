      catheters. Just prior to extubation, their physiological parameters (including work of
      breathing) will be recorded and acoustic reflectometry used to measure the degree of
      secretion accumulation within the endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tubes will then be
      cleaned using the CAM Catheters (Rescue Cath followed by Endotrach Cath) and the
      physiological parameters and endotracheal tube reflectometry measurements repeated for
      comparative analysis.
