      Indian (AI) communities - the evaluation of a culturally-tailored healthy food budgeting,
      purchasing, and cooking intervention to see whether it can improve diet and health among AIs
      with type 2 diabetes.

      This randomized clinical trial will compare the efficacy of a culturally-tailored healthy
      food budgeting, purchasing, and cooking program on: (1) diet quality (i.e., intake of
      sugar-sweetened beverages, processed foods) and (2) healthy food budgeting and cooking
      skills, among AIs with type 2 diabetes who reside in a large AI community in the
      north-central United States. Additionally, the investigators will conduct a mixed methods
      process evaluation to assess intervention reach, fidelity, and participant satisfaction.
      Curriculum will be tailored to an AI population with diabetes, and directly address major
      barriers to healthy eating that were identified by community members and tribal leaders in
      recent focus groups including: (1) difficulty budgeting for food on low-incomes; (2) low
      literacy and numeracy when purchasing food (e.g., inability to use in-store scales to convert
      foods priced "per pound" to dollar values); (3) limited cooking skills. The investigators
      expect that implementation of a culturally-tailored diet intervention will be effective in
      promoting positive diet change, and increase healthy food budgeting and cooking skills.

      Poorly controlled diabetes affects the health/longevity of those afflicted, and has profound
      effects on healthcare costs. Greater efforts are needed to encourage healthy eating in
      underserved communities with a high burden of diabetes. Improving healthy food budgeting,
      purchasing, and cooking skills among AIs with diabetes should improve diet and diabetes
      management. If successful, this program can be extended to other AI communities.
