    
      This is an open-label phase I, dose-escalation safety study in subjects with refractory solid
      tumors. The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of PG-11047. PG-11047 will be administered as a 60-minute intravenous
      infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 day cycle. The planned minimum treatment schedule is
      2 cycles (8 weeks) of PG-11047 treatment. Subjects who tolerate treatment may be eligible to
      receive additional cycles as per investigator's medical judgment. Evaluation of anti-tumor
      response will be performed every 2 cycles.
