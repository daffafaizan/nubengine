    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, multi-national, non-randomized rollover study designed
      to allow continued access to napabucasin for patients who have participated in a Boston
      Biomedical-sponsored study and are being treated with napabucasin (monotherapy or
      combination) and who are deriving continued clinical benefit in the parent study at the time
      of closure. Individual patients will continue to be treated with napabucasin (monotherapy or
      combination) in accordance with the parent study under which they were enrolled. If the dose
      was reduced in the parent protocol, the dose of the last visit of the parent study will be
      used. Patients will be monitored to determine long term safety and tolerability of
      napabucasin.
