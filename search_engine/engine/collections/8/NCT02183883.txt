      when stratifying therapeutics in solid tumours. It is likely that intratumour heterogeneity
      and cancer subclonal diversity may contribute to the high failure rate of oncology drugs
      relative to other medical specialties where drugs are applied to stable somatic genomes
      rather than unstable genomes found in cancer populations. In addition, increasing evidence in
      NSCLC and other solid tumours suggests that the selection of resistant subclones during the
      disease course is responsible for the acquisition of drug resistance and therapeutic failure.
      Finally, spatial separation of cancer subclones within the same tumour is likely to
      contribute to the difficulties associated with cancer biomarker validation.

      "Actionable mutations" may not be optimally actionable if they are present at one site of
      disease or within a minority tumour subclone. Such minority subclones are likely to
      contribute to intratumour heterogeneity and discordant results when interpreting multiple
      biopsies from the same tumour. Our work in NSCLC, renal cancers and glioblastomas is
      demonstrating that such subclones, carrying potentially targetable events, may be spatially
      separated within the same tumour or between primary and metastatic sites. This has been
      demonstrated in the context of EGFR somatic mutations that may be heterogeneous in up to
      25-30% of patients, present at one site of disease but not another. The impact of such
      actionable driver heterogeneity on treatment response, drug resistance and outcome is
      currently unclear and is the subject of investigation within this protocol; DARWIN1 will
      assess the impact of EGFR activating mutation and HER2 mutation heterogeneity on progression
      free survival outcomes in advanced NSCLC treated with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
      afatinib.
