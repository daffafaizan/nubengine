      physical activity on cognitive performance and underlying mechanisms. In particular, the
      investigators are interested in the potentially different effects that might be realized as a
      function of a person's genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the investigators
      extend past work by proposing a randomized clinical trial to: (a) test the causal link
      between physical activity and cognitive performance in middle-aged adults (40-65 years) with
      a family history, and (b) determine if the effect is moderated by apolipoprotein epsilon-4
      (APOE4) carrier status. The investigators will collect neuroimaging measures of cerebral
      structure, white matter integrity, and resting state connectivity; assess putative biological
      markers; and (using moderated mediation analyses) increase understanding of underlying
      mechanisms and of the extent to which effects are moderated by APOE4 carrier status. To test
      hypotheses, the investigators will randomly assign 240 cognitively normal, middle-aged adults
      to a 1-year virtual physical activity program or a usual care control. Those in the
      intervention will participate in a year-long physical activity program including aerobic
      exercise performed on your own and resistance exercises led in virtual exercise sessions with
      an instructor 1 hour/day for 3 days/week for 1 year. Those in the usual care control
      condition will be asked to maintain their normal lifestyle for one year and then will be
      given a short-term YMCA membership (contingent upon completion of testing sessions). The
      investigators will assess cognitive performance at pre-, mid-, and post-test, and obtain MRI
      scans and blood samples at pre-, mid- and post-test. The investigators will examine the
      effects of physical activity on cognitive performance and on neurological and biological
      mechanisms and will explore the moderating role of APOE4.
