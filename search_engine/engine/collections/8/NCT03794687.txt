      artery, data on the use the distal radial access site in the anatomical snuffbox is limited.
      Most of the available literature on the distal radial access comes from case reports and
      small retrospective case series looking primarily at the feasibility and success rates with
      this approach (4-6). Crossover rate from proximal radial to femoral approach in a prior
      randomized controlled trial was reported at 3.7% (2). A similar rate has been reported in
      case series studies of distal radial access, with success rates ranging from 88.6% to 96.3%
      (4-6). No cases of radial artery occlusion, hematoma, or hand paresthesia were reported in
      any of these series. Given the promising results with the distal radial approach, its use has
      expanded to many cardiac catheterization laboratories across the country. However,
      prospective randomized data comparing distal versus the conventional proximal radial arterial
      access sites is warranted.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to compile a prospective observational case series to
      evaluate the safety and feasibility of distal radial artery access in a prospective case
      series. If an acceptable safety profile can be demonstrated, the case series will be followed
      with a randomized controlled trial directly comparing distal to standard proximal radial
      artery approach.

      Specific Aims and study hypothesis:

      The primary aim of the present study is to assess the safety and feasibility of distal radial
      arterial access. The study hypothesis is that distal radial access for coronary angiography
      is associated with similar incidence rates of access site related complications compared to
      complication rates previously reported with the standard proximal radial artery access.
