      cardinal ligaments, adnexal areas and the vaginal edge with 15 ml of either the ropivacaine
      solution or the placebo fluid in each side, then 20 ml will be instilled inside the
      peritoneum. Analgesia will be given on request after operation. Visual analogue score of 0 to
      100 mm will be used to assess the degree of pain, with 0 indicating no pain and 100
      indicating worst pain.
