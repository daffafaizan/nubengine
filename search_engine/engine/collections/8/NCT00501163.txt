      of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. These problems can result in a life span that can be
      up to 25 years shorter than in people without a major mental illness. This study uses
      established medical tests that can predict how you might be affected. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the risk for these disorders in people with schizophrenia with the risk
      for these disorders in other people without schizophrenia.
