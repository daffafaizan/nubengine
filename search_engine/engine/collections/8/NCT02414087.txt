      into two groups, including study group (insoles group) and control group (without insole
      group).

      All participants in the insoles group will be evaluated at baseline, that is before the
      customized full-length shoe insoles are prescribed. All the evaluations, including physical
      functional ability, balance, physical activity, functional performance, and quality of life
      will be re-evaluated up to 12 weeks after shoe insoles wearing in the insoles group.

      The control group will be evaluated at the baseline and up to 12 weeks.
