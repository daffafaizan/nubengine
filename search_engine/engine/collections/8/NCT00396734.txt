        1. To try to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying cocaine dependence and craving in
           co-morbid cocaine-dependent patients. For this purpose we shall trigger craving for
           cocaine by exposure to a videotape showing cocaine use and then measure brain metabolic
           activity using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)

        2. To evaluate dopamine binding in the brain in the early stage, and at the end of
           treatment. For this purpose the patients will undergo brain imaging of the dopamine
           receptor DRD2 by using PET with [11C] raclopride. This is a well established procedure
           for quantifying the effects of drugs such as amphetamine and cocaine on the brain.

        3. To investigate the association between subjective measures of craving for cocaine and
           the level of dopamine DRD2 receptor occupancy in the brain.
