    
      This study tests a tandem transplant approach that starts with transplantation of the
      participant's own hematopoietic (blood) cells, eg, autologous hematopoietic cell transplant
      (auto-HCT) as preparation for an subsequent matched-donor allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT).

      Participants will be have progenitor cells (stem cells) mobilized into the peripheral blood
      with rituximab, chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or etoposide), and filgrastim (G-CSF); undergo
      apheresis to collect autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC, aka hematopoietic cells);
      and be re-infused with ≥ 3 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg (auto-HCT). Subsequently, participants will
      receive therapeutic, non-myeloablative chemotherapy (carmustine + cyclophosphamide +
      etoposide), then transplant conditioning [total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) + anti-thymocyte
      globulin (ATG)] followed by ≥ 2 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg allogeneic PBSC obtained from a human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched or HLA single allele / antigen-mismatched donor (allo-HCT).
      Donors will be mobilized with 16 µg/kg filgrastim. Participant allo-HCT transplant is to
      occur within 150 days of auto-HCT. Post-allo-HCT infusion treatment includes cyclosporine and
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)

      Subject's participation ends if a suitable matched donor is not identified within the 150
      days.

      Pre-medication treatments administered during this study may include acetaminophen;
      diphenhydramine; hydrocortisone; and methylprednisolone.
