      malignancies. II. Determine the toxic effects of SarCNU in these patients. III. Characterize
      the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine any evidence of
      antineoplastic activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral SarCNU on days 1, 5, and 9.
      Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SarCNU until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
