    
      It is a prospective observational multicenter study on 50 newborns with mild neonatal
      encephalopathy and metabolic acidosis at birth not qualified for therapeutic hypothermia
      compared to healthy controls.

      Infants with metabolic acidosis at birth and evidence of mild encephalopathy graded according
      to Sarnat&Sarnat neurological evaluation will be recruited to evaluate plasma concentration
      of melatonin and levels of Autophagy, mitophagy and inflammation.

      Plasmatic changes will be compared to:

        -  healthy control

        -  infants with isolated metabolic acidosis at birth and normal neurological evaluation.
