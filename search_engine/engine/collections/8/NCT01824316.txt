      asthma exacerbations using patient vignettes. Vignettes or case studies have been shown in
      various areas of medicine to be an effective tool for surveying provider's knowledge and
      application of evidence-based guidelines (9,10,11,12). Specifically, we plan on surveying
      physicians-in-training and attending physicians in Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine,
      Internal Medicine, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Pulmonary/Critical Care Medicine at the Ohio
      State University Werner Medical Center via electronic mail. Electronic mail addresses will be
      obtained from each Department or Division's Training Program Director. We have presented
      multiple, fictional, case-based scenarios and short, multiple-choice questions where the
      responder indicates how they would manage the case. No existing patient data will be used in
      the scenarios. In addition, demographic data of the physician including length of time in
      practice, numbers of patients seen with asthma exacerbations per month, and comfort level
      with the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Guidelines (1). The survey is
      attached. Physicians who do not respond to the first electronic mail will be sent one
      follow-up electronic mail with a second request to complete the survey. Results from the
      questionnaires completed by each department/devision of physicians will be compared and
      analyzed for significant differences. The results will then be used to look for educational
      opportunities to improve the care of pregnant patients with asthma exacerbations.
