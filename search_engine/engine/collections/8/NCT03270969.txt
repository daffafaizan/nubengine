      open-label, intensive PK study will inform the pharmacologic impact of combining PrEP and
      concurrent feminizing hormone regimens. The investigators hypothesize transgender women will
      achieve similar PrEP concentrations compared to the historical controls, and that hormone
      concentrations (estrogen and testosterone) will not be affected. The aims of this study are
      to (1) to determine if concurrent use of TDF/FTC as PrEP in combination with feminizing
      hormones alters the PK of tenofovir (TFV) and FTC and (2) to determine if concurrent use of
      PrEP with feminizing hormones alters serum estradiol and testosterone concentrations. To
      achieve these aims, this study will enroll transgender women who are receiving either
      oral/sublingual or transdermal estradiol with spironolactone. Using intensive PK sampling,
      plasma and intracellular TDF/FTC concentrations will be measured after 14 days of oral
      TDF/FTC.
