        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal PV701
           after desensitization in patients with advanced or recurrent malignancy largely confined
           to the peritoneal cavity these patients.

        -  Determine the optimal desensitization dose of intravenous PV701 in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug, in terms of cumulative toxicity, in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the presence and duration of viral shedding, viremia, and immunogenicity of
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study comprising 2 different treatment
      schedules.

        -  Schedule I (optimal desensitization dose): Patients receive PV701 IV over 30 minutes on
           day 1 followed by intraperitoneal (IP) PV701 on days 4, 7, and 9. Courses repeat every
           21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PV701 IV and IP until the optimal
      desensitization dose (ODD) is determined. The ODD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

        -  Schedule II (maximum tolerated dose):Patients receive the same regimen as in schedule I
           using PV701 IV at the ODD.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PV701 IP until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience DLT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-17
      months.
