      Burned hands are usually treated and managed by a multidisciplinary team at a burn center to
      conservatively manage hypertrophic scars. Rehabilitation of the burned hand should be
      initiated in the acute stages to set individualized positioning, splinting and exercise for
      functional activity. Frequent exercises throughout the day are more beneficial than one
      intensive exercise. Repeated range of motion (ROM) exercises are helpful in decreasing edema
      and conditioning the tissue. Despite adequate rehabilitation of the burned hand, hand
      functional disorders may occur. Many interventions have been developed and trialed for
      patients with burns; however, hand rehabilitation tools are limited and remain controversial.

      Recent studies have recommended that for the functional recovery of upper extremity disorder,
      repetitive exercises using VR have been useful. Task-specific training has been shown to be
      more effective when tasks were ordered in a random practice sequence using repetition and
      positive feedback. VR is an interactive and enjoyable intervention. VR creates a virtual
      rehabilitation scene in which the intensity of practice can be systemically manipulated. This
      study aimed to evaluate the effects of VR-based rehabilitation on burned hands, and compare
      the results to those of matched CON rehabilitation in patients with burns.
