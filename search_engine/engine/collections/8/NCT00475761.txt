      women. Although glandular epithelium contributes to mammographic density, non-epithelial
      tissue components represent its major determinants: adipose tissue is radiolucent and fibrous
      tissue is dense. The hypothesis is that epidemiologic factors associated with elevated breast
      density alter the breast microenvironment (ME) (defined as all cells and structures
      surrounding luminal glandular cells including: myoepithelial cells; basement membrane,
      stromal fibroblast and myofibroblasts; endothelial cells and pericytes; inflammatory cells,
      collagens, matrix proteins, growth factors, hormones, and other biochemical components) in a
      manner that enhances dysregulated proliferation of breast epithelium and ultimately cancer.
      Specifically, the Investigators propose that epidemiologic factors that lead to increased
      exposure to hormones and inflammatory mediators alter the ME, leading to both increased
      breast density and cancer. The critical importance of the ME in carcinogenesis is supported
      by experimental and clinical data showing that epithelial abnormalities alone are generally
      insufficient for cancer development without concurrent changes in the ME. The primary aim of
      this pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of collecting the data needed to elucidate
      the biologic mechanisms that mediate the substantial breast cancer risk associated with high
      mammographic density. Specifically, the Investigators will develop, fine tune, and validate a
      complex cross-sectional study protocol to collect risk factor data and biological specimens
      (blood, buccal cells, tissue fluids, and tissue) required to discover mechanisms and
      biomarkers that link high mammographic density (as measured quantitatively using computerized
      methods) to breast cancer risk. They will enroll 250 women between the ages of 40 to 65 years
      undergoing a radiologically guided biopsy at the University of Vermont, the largest center
      within the Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System (VBCSS), to participate in this pilot
      study of mammographic density.
