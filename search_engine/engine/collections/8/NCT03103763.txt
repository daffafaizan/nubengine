    
      This is a prospective registry study with data being collected continuously for 24 months.

      Patients who have electrocardiographically confirmed atrial fibrillation, are being followed
      by the Pen Bay Medical Center Anticoagulation Services and are at least 90 years old will be
      recruited into the study. A matched cohort of patients between the ages of 80 and 89 and
      another matched cohort of patients between the ages of 70 and 79 will also be recruited into
      the study for comparison.

      Data related to adverse events, concomitant medications, living arrangements, mobility and
      alcohol use will be collected every 6 months. In addition the CHA2DS2-VASc (score for atrial
      fibrillation stroke risk), HAS - BLED (major bleeding risk score for patients on
      anticoagulation), frailty and Mini Cog scores will be recalculated at each visit.
