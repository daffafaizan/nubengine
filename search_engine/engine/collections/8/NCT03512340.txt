    
      This first-in-human study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SRF231 as a
      monotherapy via dose escalation (Part A), and to determine the dose(s) of SRF231 to be
      further examined in expansion cohorts as monotherapy. The preliminary clinical activity of
      SRF231 administered as monotherapy will be characterized, along with pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and pharmacodynamics. In Part B, the safety and tolerability of SRF231 as monotherapy will be
      evaluated in select patient cohorts of advanced cancers and evaluate clinical activity. The
      study also is designed to examine the effect of SRF231 monotherapy on peripheral blood immune
      cell subsets, peripheral blood gene expression, and serum biomarkers
