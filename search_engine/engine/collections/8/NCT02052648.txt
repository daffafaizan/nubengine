    
      The aim of this study is to identify the safety profile and the recommended dose for phase 2
      study of the combination of indoximod (portion 1, phase 1b study). Investigators will then
      evaluate the tolerability and the preliminary activity in patients with recurrent GBM in
      three different situations:

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide (bevacizumab-naive patients)

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide in patients currently receiving or having
           received and failed bevacizumab.

        -  Combination of indoximod and temozolomide with stereotactic radiation. Ancillary studies
           will be conducted to assess the correlation between intra-tumoral IDO expression or
           serum biomarkers (immune monitoring) and treatment efficacy.

      If the current study shows an acceptable safety profile and suggests preliminary evidence of
      activity, this will provide the justification for subsequent randomized phase 2 studies in
      refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
