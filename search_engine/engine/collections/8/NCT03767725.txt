      cells in treating patients with BCMA positive multiple myeloma that have not respond to
      chemotherapy and autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (Auto-HSCT). B-cell
      maturation antigen (BCMA), a cell surface protein expressed on mutiple maloma cells , has
      emerged as a very selective antigen to be targeted in novel immunotherpy for MM. Targeting
      postulated CD19+ myeloma stem cells with anti-CD19 CAR-T cells is a novel approach to MM
      therapy.
