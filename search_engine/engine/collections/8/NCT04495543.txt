      delivered widely, remotely, rapidly and with minimal load on the healthcare system in Canada.
      The "Skills for Safer Living" (SfSL) intervention, a transdiagnostic 20-week group therapy
      intervention designed to teach concepts, skills and coping strategies through modules
      targeting common areas of deficits (Personal Safety, Emotional Literacy, Interpersonal
      Relationships and Problem-Solving), will be adapted into a single session "Brief-SfSL" that
      can be delivered in an online format. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of
      Brief-SfSL on reducing suicide risk, as measured by reductions in suicidal ideation after 3
      months, and will provide evidence for a scalable intervention that can broadly reach urban
      and rural communities. Lack of suicide intervention services is an immense unmet need that is
      especially pronounced during this pandemic and is associated with increased burden on
      individuals and on the healthcare system. Considering the long wait times to access
      consistent psychiatric services, this proposed intervention is an essential step in providing
      evidence-based accessible suicide risk services during and even beyond the pandemic.
