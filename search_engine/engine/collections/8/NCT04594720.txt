      diagnosis for malignant diseases. Generally, blood sampling is less invasive and could be
      carried out repeatedly. In addition to protein markers, circulating nucleic acids are
      promising sources of cancer biomarkers , since circulating nucleic acids provide information
      on the genome or gene expression , and harbor wealth of health and disease status
      information. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the transcripts longer than 200
      nucleotides in length and act as prominent regulators of gene expression. Accumulating
      evidence demonstrated the involvement of lncRNA dysregulation in a variety of cancers, and
      their expression is associated with cancer development and metastasis. This study was
      designed to identify the potential protein and RNA biomarkers in the blood for diï¬€erentiating
      a malignant thyroid tumor from a benign thyroid nodule. In this study, only patients with
      papillary thyroid carcinoma, the most common type of thyroid cancer, were chosen for
      comparison with those with benign thyroid tumors to simplify the comparison.
