      trial (RCT). Enrolees are women with singleton pregnancies and previous PB based on CI
      (primary intervention, <16 weeks) or in case of previous PB and a short cervical length in
      current pregnancy â‰¤ 25 mm (secondary intervention, <24 weeks). Women are randomised (1:1)
      either to cervical cerclage or pessary treatment. The primary outcome is the spontaneous
      preterm birth rate before 34 weeks of gestation. The sample size was calculated, as a pilot
      study, based on the estimated population that we will be able to recruit during the duration
      of the trial: 60 women, 30 for each group (cervical cerclage and cervical pessary group) to
      observe, at least a reduction in the PB rate < 34 weeks from 34% to 27% in the pessary group,
      as does cerclage.

      Discussion: The outcome of this study will show the effectiveness of a cervical cerclage and
      of a cervical pessary in this group of patients.
