      Physical exercises that are part of the specific medical program prescribed for each patient.
      The exercise program for each patient will depend of the haemophilic arthropathy, the level
      of physical condition and the preferences of the patient.

      Monitoring of physical activity will be made by means of accelerometers. Its use does not
      alter the daily activities and does not require any change of the patients' individual
      habits. The assessment of the patients' cardiovascular condition will be made using pulse
      monitors. Normal examinations in clinical practice will be revised as well as those specific
      to each patient reference health centre, muscle strength and joint use testing which will be
      validated with force measurement devices. Assess by means of an ultrasound system the
      baseline situation of the joints used for daily activities for injury control. Determine the
      likelihood of fracture and assess the bone quality by means of densitometry. Thermal cameras
      will allow to analyse the characteristics of Joint inflammation. It may be suitable for
      bleeding evolution control. Measurements given by densitometers will allows to determine the
      state of bones of the participants in the study (osteoporosis measurement). Number of
      bleeding events/hemarthrosis during the period of study. Determine the activity of
      hemarthros/synovitis using thermal images.
