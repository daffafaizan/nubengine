      project aiming to improve appropriateness of prescribing in long-term care facilities (aka
      nursing homes) through integrated educational supports for nursing home prescribers,
      inter-professional care teams, as well as residents and family members. The first focus of
      the project is appropriate prescribing of antipsychotic medications. Working with Health
      Quality Ontario, the policy makers have determined that all prescribers will have the
      opportunity to review practice reports detailing their prescribing performance for this class
      of medication (aka audit and feedback).

      The primary question of this pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial is: What is the effect of
      adding educational outreach compared to the 'usual' quality improvement supports (i.e. audit
      and feedback) on prescribing of antipsychotic medications in long-term care?

      Secondary questions include the following:

      i. What is the effect of the intervention on acute care utilization (e.g., emergency room)
      rates? ii. What is the effect of the intervention on incidence of patient clinical outcomes
      and/or adverse effects associated with antipsychotic medications (e.g., falls, aggressive
      behaviours)? iii. What is the effect of the interventions on medications that might be used
      as alternatives to antipsychotic medications (e.g., benzodiazepines)? iv. What is the
      cost-benefit, focusing on prescribing outcomes?

      Process evaluation questions include the following:

        1. How and why do the interventions work as observed?

        2. Was the intervention implemented as desired in nursing homes?

        3. What were the contextual factors associated with implementation?

        4. Do the interventions affect precursors of behaviour (e.g., motivation, capability)?
