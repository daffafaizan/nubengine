        -  Determine the response/remission rate, survival, and degree of local control from
           interstitial colloidal phosphorus P32 followed by external beam radiotherapy and
           chemotherapy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior therapy (yes vs no).

      Patients receive dexamethasone intratumorally, then macroaggregated albumin and interstitial
      phosphorus P32 intratumorally. Most patients receive a second course of this brachytherapy.

      Patients then proceed to chemoradiotherapy beginning 7-14 days after brachytherapy.
      Radiotherapy is administered 5 days a week for 6.4 weeks. Fluorouracil IV is administered
      every other day for 4 doses during weeks 1 and 2.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
