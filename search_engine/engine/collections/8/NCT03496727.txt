      procedures were carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. A retrospective
      examination was made of the anesthesia forms of patients underwent VATS May 2016 and June
      2017. Due to incomplete data of 1 of these 35 patients, that case was excluded from the
      study. The patients were divided into two groups. 24 patients were performed SAPB and iv PCA
      (intravenous patient controlled analgesia) and 10 patient's pain management were provided
      with only PCA. No block was administered to 10 patients because of anticoagulant therapy and
      patient refused block application. The demographic data of the patients (age, gender,
      operation type, and duration) were obtained from the anesthesia forms. The postoperative pain
      scores of the patients, evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours
      postoperatively and the postoperative doses of analgesia used were taken from the block pain
