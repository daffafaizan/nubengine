      I. To improve the quality of spiritual care provided by palliative care teams. II. To measure
      the effectiveness of integrating spiritual care recommendations in palliative care at City of
      Hope (COH) and the impact it has on cancer patients, families, and hospital staff.

      OUTLINE:

      The expanded psychosocial/spiritual assessment administered by social workers includes a
      spiritual history and a spiritual needs screening. Social worker knowledge and competence is
      surveyed at baseline, immediately after the course, and after a bedside chaplain-mentoring
      process. Inpatient cancer patients' and their caregivers' perceptions about spiritual care is
      surveyed at baseline prior to the social work curriculum and after the course has been
      completed and the new psychosocial/spiritual assessment has been implemented. Data collected
      from patients, family members, and staff includes number of unduplicated palliative care
      patients screened for spiritual concerns, spiritual history, number and type of spiritual
      issues, number of referrals to the chaplain, number seen by the chaplain, number of
      unduplicated palliative care patients with documented spiritual care plan, number of staff
      development sessions offered and topics, attendance per topic, advance directives, and
      referrals to hospice.
