    
      We Walk Plus study consists of: (1) a user friendly physical activity tracker (i.e., Fitbit
      Charge HR ); (2) user-centered social networking (e.g., Fitbit community); and (3) the
      iCardia platform for monitoring daily Fitbit physical activity and wear time and sending
      personalized text-messages targeting physical activity and self-efficacy. The specific aims
      of this two-arm RCT pilot are to: 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the We Walk
      Plus intervention and 2) explore the preliminary efficacy of We Walk Plus on physical
      activity and well-being.
