    
      To investigate the effects of a stretching program for the muscles of the rib cage or control
      in patients with COPD during exercise and / or the immediate post-exercise, using the
      following parameters:

        -  Tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (RR), minute volume (MV), inspiratory time (Tins)
           and expiratory (T exp).

        -  Change in volumes of total and regional chest magazines (pulmonary rib cage, abdominal
           rib cage and abdomen).

        -  Diaphragmatic mobility.

        -  electrical muscle activity

        -  endurance time.

        -  Dyspnea sensation.
