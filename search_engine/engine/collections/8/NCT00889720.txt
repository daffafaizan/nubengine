      planned because recruitment was much slower than expected and therefore the study has already
      achieved its main objective of assessing the feasibility of conducting a larger study of
      similar design to investigate the efficacy of smoking cessation therapy in a pre-surgical
      setting. The decision to end recruitment to the trial was not based on any safety concerns.
