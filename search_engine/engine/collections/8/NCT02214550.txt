      and cytokines producing moderate to severe pelvic pain in more than 20% of reproductive-age
      women. One out of every five of those women in turn will develop chronic pelvic pain (CPP),
      yet women without dysmenorrhea rarely report CPP. CPP disorders such as irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS) and painful bladder syndrome (PBS) can cause severe, unrelenting pain due to a
      lack of effective treatments.

      This study consists of 2 aims.

      Aim #1: To determine if dysmenorrhea with concomitant bladder pain sensitivity exhibits
      neurophysiological features consistent with established CPP. Women with chronic pain or
      dysmenorrhea without COS will be used as controls. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) and a
      noninvasive bladder pain test that investigators validated previously be used to determine
      whether impairments in descending inhibition and pelvic sensitivity are responsible for
      vulnerability to COS in women with dysmenorrhea. EEG will be recorded to look for differences
      in brain activity in response to sensory stimulation between participants cohorts.

      Aim #2: To differentiate the individual contributions of circulating sex hormones and
      repeated sensitizing events (painful menses) on descending and peripheral mechanisms of
      bladder pain. The same QST/bladder pain measures studied in Aim #1 will be retested within
      the dysmenorrhea+COS group following a one-year randomized trial of cyclical OCs vs.
      continuous OCs vs. no treatment. An observational arm of PBS participants will receive
      continuous OCs and serve as controls.
