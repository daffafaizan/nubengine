    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the safety of losartan potassium (losartan) in combination with hypofractionated
      radiation treatment for patients with stable or locally progressive pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) after induction chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of losartan in combination with HRT for patients with stable or
      locally progressive PDAC after induction chemotherapy.

      II. To assess the efficacy of losartan in combination with HRT for patients with stable or
      locally progressive PDAC after induction chemotherapy.

      III. To assess the rate of hypotensive adverse events grade >= 3.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess patient reported quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning day 1, patients receive losartan potassium orally (PO) once daily (QD). Beginning
      day 14, patients also undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy over 15 fractions 5 days a
      week for up to 3 weeks. Patients continue to receive losartan potassium PO QD during
      radiation therapy and for 28 days after completion of radiation therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 and 84 days, every 3
      months for 12 months, and then every 6 months for up to 36 months.
