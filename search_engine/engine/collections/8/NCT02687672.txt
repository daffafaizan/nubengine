      in demyelination and neuronal degeneration. This degeneration causes severe functional
      sensory and motor mutilations that remain an immense challenge to physicians and in which
      stem cell (SC) transplantation represents a viable alternative. This study is a phase I/II
      trial aimed at describing a method for treating patients with chronic complete spinal cord
      injuries (SCI) by utilizing autologous, purified CD34+ and CD133+ stem cells (SCs). The study
      focuses on the safety and efficacy of transplanting un-manipulated, autologous, purified stem
      cells in treated patients during a 5-year follow-up period.
