    
      CTEPH-SOLUTION is a multicenter observational cross-sectional and prospective study in
      patients with a prior and new diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

      Patients with prior pulmonary embolism will be screened at baseline with doppler
      echocardiography: an estimated sPAP â‰¥ 40 mmHg will be the indication for pulmonary
      hypertension detection. After 24 months from baseline, patients will be followed-up for CTEPH
      detection. CTEPH diagnosis will be carried out according to the current ESC/ERS guidelines.

      Incident (pulmonary embolism episode at least three months before the baseline) and prevalent
      (pulmonary embolism episode) patients will be enrolled.
