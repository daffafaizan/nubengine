      clarified, why some individuals develop severely disabling low back pain while others never
      experience noteworthy back pain. There is no evidence that numbers of chronically affected
      individuals have diminished; rather, the incidence of LBP has increased continuously over the
      last 20 years which is also reflected in rising numbers of lumbar surgical treatments. The
      prevalence and burden increase with age and prevention of LBP in an aging population seems
      more urgent than ever. As LBP is undoubtedly a multifaceted disorder that tends to fluctuate
      throughout life, there is a need for longitudinal research, exploring the effect of both life
      style and psychosocial factors on the development of chronic low back pain.

      The aim of this study is to identify whether a history of low back pain during adolescence
      represents an increased risk of experiencing low back pain later in life.
