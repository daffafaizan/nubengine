      I. To measure the response conversion (progressive disease [PD]/stable disease [SD] to
      partial response [PR] and complete response [CR]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the time to engraftment/chimerism. II. To assess the rate of acute and chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). III. To assess toxicity. IV. To determine the overall
      survival. V. To investigate immune functional and phenotypic analysis. VI. To measure two
      year event free survival (EFS).

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days -21 and 14,
      ibritumomab tiuxetan IV on day -14, TLI on days -11 to -7 and -4 to -1, and antithymocyte
      globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -11 to -7. Patients also undergo TLI on days -11 to -7 and
      -4 to -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) on day
      0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or IV on days
      -3 to 56 with taper to 6 months and mycophenolate mofetil PO BID or IV on days 0-28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
