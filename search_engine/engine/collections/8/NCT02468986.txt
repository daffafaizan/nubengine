      rheumatoid arthritis patients who have controlled or uncontrolled disease and healthy
      controls. We will collect venous endothelial cells by placing an IV in antegrade position in
      the forearm and a thin wire will be inserted to collect the cells from the inner lining of
      the vein. The cells will processed and stained for markers of endothelial function and
      oxidative stress including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phospho-eNOS, nuclear
      factor kappa B (NFÎºB), and nitrotyrosine using immunofluorescence technique. Flow mediated
      dilation (FMD) by ultrasound of the brachial artery on the contralateral arm will be used as
      an additional marker of endothelial function. A blood sample will be taken for analysis of
      inflammatory markers (sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) and cytokine analysis (IL-1,
      IL-6, TNFa) by cytokine bead array and flow cytometry.
