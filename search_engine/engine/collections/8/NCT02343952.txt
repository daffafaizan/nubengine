    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Eligible patients must have completed concurrent chemoradiation with a standard chemotherapy
      regimen (either cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/paclitaxel) and a dose of radiation
      ranging from 59.4-66.6Gy, with restaging completed 28 days to 56 days post-chemoradiation.
      Patients with progressive disease will not be eligible for investigational treatment.
      Patients with stable disease/response will be eligible to register for investigational
      treatment of consolidation therapy to begin a minimum of 28 days and a maximum of 56 days
      from completion of chemoradiotherapy.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Pembrolizumab, 200 mg IV every 3 weeks (until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable
      toxicity, or after 12 months (52 weeks) of therapy with pembrolizumab.

      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500/mcL

        -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL

        -  Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL or ≥5.6 mmol/L

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine OR measured or calculated creatinine clearance ≤1.5 X institutional
           upper limit of normal (ULN) OR ≥60 mL/min for subject with creatinine levels > 1.5 X
           institutional ULN (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can also be used in place of
           creatinine or CrCl)

      Hepatic:

        -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects
           with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 institutional ULN

        -  Aspartate transaminase (AST), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), alanine
           transaminase (ALT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional ULN

      Coagulation:

        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X institutional ULN
           unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT/INR/PTT is within
           therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.
