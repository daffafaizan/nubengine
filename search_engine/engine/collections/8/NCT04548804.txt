      CT-scan obtaining the anatomy of the heart and torso, hereby able to reconstruct local
      electrograms, activation and recovery times. In recent research, ECGI provided numerous extra
      insights into normal cardiac electrophysiology, but also electrophysiological disorders and
      disease. The results strongly suggest that ECGI can play a pivotal role in further
      characterizing arrhythmia mechanisms, therefore could do so for VTAs, leading to diagnosis
      and treatment improvement. Moreover, ECGI seems to have the potential to detect
      arrhythmogenic substrate in individuals before their first event, offering the possibility to
      diagnose and treat patients before sudden cardiac arrest occurs.

      In the BREACH-ECGI study:

      ECGI will be used to noninvasively characterize the epicardial electrophysiological substrate
      and triggers of:

        -  Patients with (increased risk of) VTAs

        -  A control cohort. Results will be evaluated for increased mechanistic understanding and
           risk stratification.

      Moreover, clinical data of subjects will be gathered. These data will be analyzed to
      determine their prognostic value in terms of arrhythmia risk
