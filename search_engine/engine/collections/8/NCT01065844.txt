      inhibit adenoid cystic carcinoid growth. These cancers are heavily dependent on these
      signalling pathways.

      Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) are rare and account for about 1% of all head and neck
      cancers. They stem from salivary glands and are known for their tendency to spread along
      nerve sheaths (perineural spread). ACC is known for its prolonged clinical course, multiple
      recurrence and the delayed onset of distant metastases. The median/mean age at presentation
      is 47-56. Although 5 year disease free survivals (DFS) are 65-70%, the 15 year DFS drops to
      30-40%. If followed long enough, 35% of patients will eventually develop metastatic disease.

      The most common treatment of ACC is surgery followed by post-operative radiotherapy. When ACC
      recurs, management options are often limited both by the morbidity and low efficacy of
      re-irradiation and repeated surgical resection. Reported response rates to chemotherapy are
      low and when it occurs, the duration of the response is short lived.

      In an effort to explore possible targeted therapies for patients with recurrent ACC, Dr.
      Gupta's lab examined the activation of 3 signaling proteins (EGFR, Akt, and MAPK) in 9
      different paraffinized tissue blocks. Initial indications from in vitro studies demonstrates
      NFV is tumoricidal at clinically achievable concentrations. To explore the clinical benefit
      of this FDA-approved medication, we seek to implement its off label use in patients who have
      failed all other therapies and have no other therapeutic options left.
