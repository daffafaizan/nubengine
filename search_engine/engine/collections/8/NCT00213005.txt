      cohorts in Durban, South Africa: sexually abstinent HIV-positive women, sexually abstinent
      HIV-positive men, and sexually active HIV-positive women. Sexually active women must be in an
      HIV-positive seroconcordant relationship (confirmed by HIV testing of the woman and her male
      partner) and written informed consent was obtained from the male partners. Women and men in
      each cohort were randomized to one of three study groups: Carraguard® gel, its matching
      placebo methyl-cellulose gel, or no product.

      The main objectives of this study were to investigate changes in the vulvar, vaginal, and
      cervical epithelia, the vaginal flora, and HIV-1 shedding in the genital tract of female
      participants, and changes of the penile skin and epithelia of male participants. We also
      evaluated symptoms reported by participants, and several dimensions of the acceptability of
      and compliance with the study or placebo gel. Reactions to a non-contraceptive microbicide
      were assessed, as well as reasons for voluntary discontinuation and non-use of Carraguard® or
      the placebo (determined by review of daily diary) was recorded. Exit focus group discussions
      were held with male and female participants to discuss aspects of acceptability and
      compliance. Self-reported symptoms were also investigated by clinical examination as needed
      and study endpoints included genital itching or burning, frequent urination, burning while
      urinating, genital pain, pain during sex, and abnormal vaginal or penile discharge.
