      people who have select advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will include a dose
      escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

      The study will enroll approximately 101 patients, approximately 32 participants in the dose
      escalation phase and approximately 9 to 23 participants in each of the 3 cohorts of dose
      expansion phase. Participants will receive escalating doses of TAK-981 and fixed dose of
      pembrolizumab until RP2D is determined:

      â€¢ Dose Escalation: TAK-981 + Pembrolizumab (fixed dose)

      Once RP2D is determined, participants of select advanced or metastatic solid tumors will
      receive TAK-981 in below defined cohorts in the expansion phase:

        -  Expansion Phase: Non-squamous NSCLC

        -  Expansion Phase: Cervical Cancer

        -  Expansion Phase: Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC)

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 48 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
      progression-free survival follow-up for maximum up to 12 months after last dose of study
      drug.
