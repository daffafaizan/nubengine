      treated with preoperative chemotherapy (PCHT) underwent surgical resection. Each patient was
      matched with the closest two patients with pancreatic cancer ( control group ) selected from
      our prospective electronic database who met the following match criteria: age (+/- 3 years),
      gender, ASA score, type of resection, pancreatic duct diameter (+/- 1 mm), and tumour size
      (+/- 5 mm).
