      reason, human milk becomes unavailable.

      New-generation infant formulae contain functional ingredients able to mimic some benefits of
      human milk.

      The study formula is supplemented with galacto-oligosaccharides, which favor intestinal
      positive microflora growth, beta-palmitate, enhancing fat and calcium absorption and softer
      stool formation, and acidified milk which contributes to immune system maturation.

      The aim of this study is to verify the safety of the study formula in healthy term infants
      and to deepen the efficacy of the functional ingredient blend in term of prebiotic effect,
      gastrointestinal tolerance and immune response improvement.
