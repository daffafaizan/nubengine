      appendicitis in 3-years period at our referral hospital were evaluated to pick up the
      Enterobius vermicularis infestation of the appendix. These cases were evaluated for
      clinico-laboratory characterization to define the incidence in our country and the
      relationship between the E.v and initiation of the the inflammatory process to study the
      possibility of limitation of surgical intervention in acute abdomen conditions.
