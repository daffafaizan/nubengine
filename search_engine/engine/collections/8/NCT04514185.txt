      perform two identical experimental tests: one test without an exoskeleton and another one
      using the exoskeleton. To avoid sequence bias, the test order will be randomized (balanced).
      The labor operation will be simulated. This operation's cycle will consist of lifting the
      load, which is 5-10 kg off the table, holding it over head and touching 4 points in order on
      a horizontal plate for 2 min. After this volunteer is resting for 1 min. The work will be
      performed for 105 minutes, then a break of 15 minutes, then 105 minutes of work. Heart rate
      (Polar) will be monitored. An ergospirometric device (Metamax) will be used to collect muscle
      activity data (Trust-M, Myoton), inertial sensors (Trust-M) will be used to evaluate the
      biomechanics of movements. In addition, questionnaires will be filled out for a subjective
      assessment of the use of exoskeleton prototypes (local discomfort scale, exoskeleton
      properties assessment questionnaire).
