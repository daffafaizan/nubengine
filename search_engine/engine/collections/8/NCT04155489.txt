      diagnosed 7 days after surgery between two groups.

      K-MOCA (Korean-Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is used to evaluate cognitive dysfunction. In
      addition, plasma inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6) and GFAP reflecting brain damage were
      measured before and after surgery to determine whether brain injury caused by systemic
      inflammatory response is associated with cognitive dysfunction
