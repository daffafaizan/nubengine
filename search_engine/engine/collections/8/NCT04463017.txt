    
      This is a single ascending dose trial in healthy volunteers. The study will be conducted in
      up to 7 cohorts. Upon review of the safety and PK data, it may be decided to expand the
      current cohort versus dose escalate to the next cohort. In addition, the sponsor may elect
      not to enroll all 7 cohorts based on safety and/or PK and/or PD data.

      Up to 74 subjects will be enrolled to allow for replacement subjects, if deemed necessary.
      Fewer subjects may be enrolled if not all cohorts are utilized due to identification of the
      MTD in an earlier cohort.

      Double-blind dosing will occur in cohorts 1 through 7. In these cohorts, 6 subjects will
      receive HU6 and 2 will receive matching placebo.
