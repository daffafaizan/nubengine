      observational cohort of investigation. Whole blood samples will be separated immediately into
      plasma for storage. The participants will have their 2nd and 3rd samples obtained at 24-48
      hours and 48-72 hours respectively. The schedule of most of sampling schedule is designed in
      concordance with the ICU routines to avoid extra burdens on patients. The plasma samples will
      be used as prognostic markers in prognostic and predictive values in identifying patients at
      high risk for mortality and multiple organ failure. Patients who are discharged will be
      tracked for any clinical recurrence of the diseases every 28 days to assess the diagnostic
      accuracy of the miRNA biomarkers that are measured.

      The 2nd objective will be assessed by measuring the concentration of miRNAs in normal
      patients without multiple organ failure.

      The circulating miRNAs will be detected directly from 1 - 5 ul of plasma samples with the
      miRFLP assay. This capillary electrophoresis-based miRNA quantification method detects
      multiple miRNAs in absolute copy number in smaller sample signature with negligible batch to
      batch variation, thus providing a standard miRNA detection method.
