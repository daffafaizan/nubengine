      studies suggest that the severity of AS is also influenced by genetic factors. The goal of
      this study is to identify genes that influence the severity of AS. We hypothesize that
      genetic markers of susceptibility, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms, and
      genes that regulate inflammation and bone formation, influence the severity of AS.

      In this prospective longitudinal study, we will test the association of several genetic
      markers with the severity of AS. Approximately 700 patients will be included. Measures of AS
      severity will be patient-reported pain and stiffness, functional disability, patient and
      physician global assessments, joint counts, number of tender entheses, spinal mobility, and
      laboratory measures of inflammation. These measures will be assessed every 6 months for 5
      years. We will also evaluate new laboratory tests as measures of the activity of AS.

      Identifying genetic markers that are associated with differences in the severity of active
      inflammation in AS will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease by
      suggesting mechanisms and pathways involved in the development of long-term damage.
