      60-70 %). Therefore, multidisciplinary treatment of these patients is frequently used in
      order to achieve a beneficial impact regarding progression-free and overall survival. The
      point in time of treatment, pre- and/or postoperative, is still a matter of debate. In the
      EORTC 40983 trial, perioperative chemotherapy with 5-Fluorouracil and oxaliplatin
      (FOLFOX-Regimen) displayed a non-significant benefit in 3 year disease free survival in the
      intent to treat population (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.02) (Nordlinger, Sorbye et al. 2008).
      The combined analysis of two adjuvant trials, with a (non-contemporary) 5-FU Bolus regimen,
      showed a non-significant prolongation of median disease free survival (DFS) from 18.8 to 27.9
      months (p=0.058) and OS from 47.3 to 62.2 months (p=0.095) (Mitry, Fields et al. 2008).
      However, postoperative treatment with 6 months of FOLFOX is often used in daily practise.
      Thus, further investigation is urgently warranted.

      This phase II trial evaluates two strategies with intensified perioperative or postoperative
      treatment regimens. Current studies established the role of the FOLFOXIRI regimen in the
      metastatic setting (Falcone, Ricci et al. 2007). A further intensification of a three drug
      regimen with bevacizumab seem to be feasible yielding response rates up to 84% and a disease
      control rate up to 100% (Falcone 2008; Bruera, Santomaggio et al. 2010; Masi, Loupakis et al.
      2010). Regarding the efficacy, evaluation of FOLFOXIRI and bevacizumab in preoperative
      treatment for resectable CLM seems to be promising. Postoperative treatment with FOLFOX for 6
      months was chosen for arm A.
