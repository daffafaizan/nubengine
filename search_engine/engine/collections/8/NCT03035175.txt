      neonate's airway via video laryngoscopy will have a higher rate of successful neonatal
      intubations than residents receiving guidance using traditional direct laryngoscopy.

      The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 48 first and second year
      pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents who received either video-facilitated (VDL) or
      traditional (TDL) supervisor guidance during direct laryngoscopy. Residents attempted
      intubations in the neonatal intensive care unit according to their randomization group. The
      primary outcome was a successful intubation that occurred within two attempts.
