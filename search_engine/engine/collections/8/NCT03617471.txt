      paracetamol in older patients and the specific PK variables associated with plasma exposure
      in this population. The primary endpoint is the identification of the pharmacokinetic
      parameters: area under the curve (AUC), peak plasma concentration after administration of
      paracetamol (Cmax) and the time at which the Cmax is observed (Tmax) of paracetamol. The
      secondary endpoint consists of 3 sub-endpoints:

        1. The variability in plasma exposure: volume of distribution (Vd), clearance (Cl) and
           elimination half-life (t1/2)

        2. The association between the PK parameters and pathophysiological factors

        3. The correlation between PK parameters and clinical parameters.
