      preservation of the affected tooth. If contraindications are present and / or a patient
      refuse endodontic treatment, the extraction of the affected tooth is often necessary. The
      resulting tooth gap might be closed by inserting a dental implant or by placing a fixed
      dental prosthesis.

      Prior studies have shown that patients' decisions in alternative treatment options depend on
      a variety of factors. Studies on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) are used to compare the
      monetary value of different therapy procedures.
