      rehabilitation; one that harnesses recent discoveries in neuroscience to facilitate
      long-term, experience-dependent adaptations within the brain's sensory and motor systems. The
      current approach to rehabilitation of function in allogeneic hand transplant recipients is
      largely the same as standard-of-care following hand replantation (re-attachment) and
      peripheral nerve repairs. This involves an eclectic combination of traditional therapies. In
      seeking to improve on this approach, there is potentially much to be gained by considering
      evidence that limb amputation not only impacts the peripheral nervous system but also the
      brain, and tailoring interventions accordingly.
