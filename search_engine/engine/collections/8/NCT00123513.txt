      Broad, population-based approaches are needed to stop or reverse the rise in obesity
      prevalence. According to the World Health Organization, obesity prevention can be achieved by
      promoting a healthy diet and a physically active lifestyle. A partnership with the Eastman
      Kodak Company has been developed to test a worksite intervention for obesity prevention in
      Rochester, New York.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The overall goal of this study is to design a comprehensive nutrition and physical activity
      strategy based on participatory research to promote a healthy lifestyle and to stop the shift
      of the population body mass index (BMI) curve to the right. Six pairs of worksites will be
      randomized to either an intervention or control group. Two cross-sectional samples of
      employees within each worksite will be measured at baseline and at the end of the
      intervention.
