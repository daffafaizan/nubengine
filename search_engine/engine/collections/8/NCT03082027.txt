      ultrasonography in assessment of the median nerve in CTS.

      Methods: The study was conducted on thirty patients with CTS with electrophysiological
      confirmation; twelve males and eighteen females with mean age 43.93±4.51 (range 35-52y), and
      another thirty normal subjects; fifteen males and fifteen females, with their mean age
      36.7±4.86 (range 29-45y). The cross sectional area (CSA) and flattening ratio (FR) at
      different levels were measured on both groups. Data from the study and control groups were
      compared. The accuracy of the ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria for CTS was evaluated
      using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. All the patients had surgical carpal
      tunnel release and the operative details were correlated with the ultrasonographic data.
