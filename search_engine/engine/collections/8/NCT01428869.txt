      study participants will be performed. Data required for the analysis includes: ethnicity,
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, prostate volumes, presence of diabetes, concomitant
      medication use (for statin and ASA), prostate biopsy results at 2 and 4 years, body mass
      index (BMI), digital rectal exam (DRE) results, family history of Prostate Cancer and benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) outcomes: urinary retention, international prostate symptom score
      (IPSS), urinary tract infections (UTI)s.

      The association of drug interactions with prostate cancer will be explored by using a
      multivariate logistic regression model including all possible interaction terms between
      dutasteride, ASA and statins (i.e. statin+ASA+dutasteride, statin+ASA, dutasteride+statin,
      dutasteride+ASA). Any interaction term found to be insignificant ( i.e. p>0.05) will be
      removed from the model. If a statistically significant interaction term is identified, the
      study cohort will be stratified by drug use, and the relative risk (RR)of prostate cancer
      among the different drug users will be reported. To control for potential confounders, a
      multivariate regression model will be constructed adjusting for age, family history of
      prostate cancer, DRE results and BMI.
