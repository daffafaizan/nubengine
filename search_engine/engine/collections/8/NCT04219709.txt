      brain function and cognitive performance during hypoglycemia, the researchers propose a
      randomized mechanistic study using insulin infusions and neuroimaging. The study will
      leverage an existing randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 32 young adults with T1D who will
      receive a ketogenic vs a standard carbohydrate diet for 12 weeks. Researchers will conduct a
      euglycemic-hypoglycemic insulin clamp using a continuous infusion of insulin, along with a
      glucose infusion that is adjusted to keep blood glucose levels normal (90 mg/dL), followed by
      a slow drop to hypoglycemia (50 mg/dL). Researchers will assess activation and connectivity
      of relevant brain areas by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using continuous imaging during
      the gradual glycemic descent from 90 mg/dL to 50 mg/dL, the researchers will establish the
      glycemic threshold at which the hypothalamus becomes activated. Using a combination of MRI
      modalities, they will assess brain activation and connectivity changes during hypoglycemia
      versus euglycemia, both during rest and in relation to a cognitive task. Brain findings will
      be integrated with physiologic (blood levels of glucose, ketones, free fatty acids,
      counter-regulatory hormones) and behavioral (reaction time, cognitive task performance,
      hypoglycemia symptoms scale) parameters. In additional studies, researchers will give an oral
      ketone drink to raise blood ketone levels in participants in the standard carbohydrate diet
      arm. They will perform the same insulin infusion and MRI investigations to clarify the
      mechanistic role of ketones in mediating brain activation patterns. Comparison will be
      between nutritional vs no ketosis, exogenous vs no ketosis, and nutritional vs exogenous
      ketosis.
