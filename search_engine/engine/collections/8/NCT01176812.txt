      dermal filler injection between 01/01/1998 through 12/31/2008 and then following up with one
      (1) patient satisfaction survey. The first part of the study, which is retrospective, may
      involve approximately 500 subjects. The data collected from the retrospective review will be
      the subject's name, medical record number, and address for contact information. Any other
      data collected will come from the answers on the questionnaire.

      The second part of this study will be a prospective study involving 100 subjects who are
      scheduled to have a dermal filler injection. These subjects will be asked to complete one (1)
      patient satisfaction survey two weeks after injection. Facial photos will be taken before the
      injection and then two weeks after injection at the follow up visit. This will complete the
      subject's participation in this study.
