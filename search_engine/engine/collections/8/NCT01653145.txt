      energy balance induced by adding food to the usual level of activity. During this study, we
      will induce a positive energy balance for two days by increasing food intake to 140% of
      baseline energy requirements and keeping energy expenditure constant. The following three
      diets, which vary in dietary fat and energy density (kcal/g), will be used to induce the
      positive energy balance in a within subjects or cross over design: 1) high fat/high energy
      density, 2) high fat/low energy density, and 3) high carbohydrate/low energy density. Food
      intake and activity will be measured for 4 days after each diet to quantify the response to
      positive energy balance and manipulation of dietary fat and energy density.
