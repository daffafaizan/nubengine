      focus on their strengths and values, can offset self-threats and promote healthier behaviors,
      such as smoking cessation. A commonly used self-affirmation intervention is known as the
      "kindness quiz." The original kindness questionnaire (Reed & Aspinwall, 1998) consists of 10
      yes/no questions, and participants are asked to think about and write down an example of
      each. For example, one item is "Have you ever been considerate of another person's feelings?
      ____ YES ____NO; IF YES, WRITE ABOUT A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE." The items were written so that all
      participants should be able to say "yes" in response to each question, which will affirm a
      positive view of themselves.

      The purpose of these studies are to test shorter and simpler versions of this kindness
      questionnaire so that it can be implemented on mobile phones. In Study 1, we will test
      whether written examples are necessary for the effectiveness of the self-affirmation
      intervention (compared to no examples or imagined examples) compared to a control. In Study
      2, we will again test whether written examples are necessary, as well as whether shorter
      questionnaires (i.e., 5 items or 3 items) are as effective as the original 10 item
      questionnaire.
