      will be wheeled into the patient room. The patient bed will be moved directly into the scan
      position and a PET scan will be acquired in list-mode for 15 to 20 minutes followed by a CT
      scan for ~5 minutes. After undergoing their first PET scan, participants will have the option
      to undergo 1-2 additional scans throughout radiation treatment in the same manner as the
      first scan.
