    
      Patients with ovarian cancer receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy were recruited and
      randomly allocated in a "1:1" to "Standard group" (6mg PEG-rhG-CSF was administrated
      subcutaneously in 24h after chemotherapy) and "Adjusted group" (6mg PEG-rhG-CSF was
      administrated subcutaneously when ANC < 1000/mm3 after chemotherapy). Eligible patients
      enrolled in this study need to receive 6 cycles of docetaxel or paclitaxel (including
      liposome paclitaxel) and carboplatin on day 1, every 3 weeks. All patients need to receive at
      least 2 cycles of PEG-rhG-CSF administration. The primary outcome is the incidence of grade
      3/4 neutropenia, and the duration of grade 3/4 neutropenia, the second outcomes are the
      incidence of FN, neutropenia-related hospitalization, incidence of reduction and delay of
      chemotherapy dose and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF.
