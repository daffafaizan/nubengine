      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response and partial response rates in patients with recurrent or
           progressive colon cancer treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall and failure-free survival of patients treated with the
           chemotherapy regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response (complete or partial) in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients who experience a 50% fall of serum carcinoembryonic
           antigen levels with a baseline elevation of > 5 U/mL after receiving this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity associated with the administration of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on day 1 and oxaliplatin IV
      over 2 hours on day 2. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
