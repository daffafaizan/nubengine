      (NHI) data will evaluate whether the risk of serious infections (SIs) in rheumatoid arthritis
      patients treated with tocilizumab is higher than in those with tumor necrosis factor
      inhibitors. We will compare incidence rates between two groups and estimate relative risks of
      SIs in tocilizumab users using the time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression. Various
      covariates potentially related to RA severity and occurrence of infection will be assessed
      and used for adjustment.
