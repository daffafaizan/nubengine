      consequences of obesity on long-term health of individuals is now well documented. While
      lifestyle changes in diet and activity level are the key instruments to arresting or
      reversing this condition, conventional medically supervised programs have proven only
      marginally effective. Bariatric surgery has shown to be a reliable long-term treatment for
      reducing excess body weight. Though surgical techniques have evolved and complication rates
      have been reduced, surgery on these patients still carries significant mortality and
      morbidity.

      Techniques and instruments are now being developed to allow for Endoscopic approaches to
      these procedures that will aim to reduce the complications associated with open or
      laparoscopic technique for these procedures.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the Trans-oral Endoscopic
      Restrictive Implant System (TERIS) procedure for the treatment of obesity over a six month
      follow-up period.

      A secondary objective is to perform a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the TERIS
      procedure in order to guide the design of future studies, including a pivotal trial.

      This is a prospective feasibility study at up to 3 investigational sites of up to 40 subjects
      who are obese and have failed standard obesity therapy of diet, exercise, behavior
      modification, and pharmacologic agents either alone, or in combination. Up to 60 subjects may
      be enrolled, and undergo baseline evaluation in order to obtain a final total of up to 40
      subjects appropriate for trans-oral implant. Barosense intends to use data from this study in
      support of subsequent investigational studies, including a pivotal trial
