      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses. Nivolumab is an antibody inhibitor of the
      programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway. By blocking PD-1, this medication may allow the immune
      system to recognize and fight cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are investigating whether nivolumab has any
      activity in patients who have a rising PSA (prostate specific antigen) after previously
      undergoing surgery or radiation for prostate cancer. Although nivolumab was previously not
      found to have significant effect in advanced prostate cancer after all other therapies had
      failed, based on new research, the investigators are testing whether nivolumab could have a
      greater effect earlier in the disease course and before patients receive hormone therapies.
