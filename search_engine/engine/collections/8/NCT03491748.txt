    
      This Phase 1, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will be
      conducted to:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of oral ETX0282 when administered as a SAD and MAD
           to healthy participants;

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of oral ETX0282 when administered as a single oral
           dose in combination with cefpodoxime proxetil to healthy participants;

        -  Characterize the PK in plasma and in urine of ETX0282 and ETX1317 following
           administration of single and multiple oral doses of ETX0282 in healthy participants; and

        -  Determine the PK profile in plasma and in urine of ETX0282 and ETX1317 and of
           cefpodoxime proxetil and cefpodoxime following administration of single oral doses of
           ETX0282 and cefpodoxime proxetil alone and when ETX0282 is co-administered with
           cefpodoxime proxetil at the same time as single oral doses in healthy participants.
