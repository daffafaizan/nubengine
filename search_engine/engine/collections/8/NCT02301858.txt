      RNA, DNA methylation, for example in cancer cells. This will provide information regarding
      somatic changes in cancer cells, such as mutations. All of the investigators analysis will be
      cancer-focused, with the goal of increasing understanding of the heterogeneity.

      The investigators will therefore perform analysis of blood samples if possible, to identify
      predictive markers in blood samples. This will then be the miRNA, RNA expression or protein
      expression in blood samples.
