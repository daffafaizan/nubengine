      overexpressed in some breast tumours. It is not known whether lapatinib passes through the
      blood-brain barrier, and, therefore, whether it can target secondary tumours in the brain.
      This study will investigate whether lapatinib does indeed enter the brain.

      Subjects with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, with and without brain metastases, will
      receive lapatinib tablets daily for 8 days. The subjects will also receive lapatinib with a
      small amount of radioactivity attached on the first and last days of dosing to investigate
      whether it is taken up by the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
