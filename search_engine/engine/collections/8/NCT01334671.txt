      1:received atorvastatin 80-mg loading dose before PCI then followed by 40-mg daily for one
      month and a maintenance dose of 20-mg qd thereafter(n=50); Group 2:received atorvastatin
      40-mg qd after PCI for one month and a maintenance dose of 20-mg qd thereafter(n=50); Group
      3: received atorvastatin 20-mg qd after PCI (n=50).Before PCI,all subjects received oral
      administration of aspirin 300mg and clopidogrel 300mg.Levels of creatine
      kinase,CK-MB(creatine kinase-MB),were measured to estimate myocardial damage
      degree.HS-CRP(high sensitivity C -reactive protein),NO(NO synthase),SAA(Serum amyloid A) were
      measured at preoperation 1 hour,postoperative 24 and 72 hours,7days after PCI. To compare
      echocardiography changes among three groups.Patients enrolled in the study need to receive
      follow-up survey which was carried out by clinical doctors.Hence,MACEs were analyzed during
      6-month follow-up.So, the aim of our study is to evaluate the clinical significance of
      loading dosage of atorvastatin therapy and analyze the mechanism underlying it.
