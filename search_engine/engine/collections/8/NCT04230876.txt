      hearing aid and to maximize the benefits they receive from wearing one. In turn, by wearing
      hearing aids, they experience easier and more successful communication patterns. They enhance
      their ability to engage in everyday conversations and will be able to become more socially
      involved with their family and friends. In this study we will try to determine the extent to
      which web-based clEAR auditory brain training, with concomitant support from a clEAR in-house
      audiologist, affects satisfaction with new hearing aids and increases daily use time. The
      study will include thirty adults over the age of 60 years who have received hearing aids for
      the first time. After an adjustment period, half will complete clEAR's auditory brain
      training program right away and the other half will complete it after a delay period, and
      both will complete a control condition. To establish the level of feasibility and clinical
      utility. We will measure hearing aid satisfaction, benefit ratings, and hearing aid use time.
