      disease (AD). Slowing down effect of dementia by enhancing brain plasticity represents one of
      the most prominent challenges. Neurofeedback is one of the promising techniques that showed
      therapeutic efficacy and cognitive improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,
      epilepsy, stroke. We aim to study the effects of two neurofeedback training protocols,
      SMR/delta ratio and beta1/theta ratio, on cognitive performances in older adults with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment and to assess whether MCI patients change in brain electrical activity
      in a resting state after training.
