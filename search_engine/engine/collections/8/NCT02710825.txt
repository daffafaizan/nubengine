      comfort and fast home return.

      Aside drugs and psychology or physical therapy, no other alternative is proposed in the
      medico-surgical unit of pediatric cardiology at the Necker hospital.

      Following a feasibility study within the department, osteopathic care showed significant pain
      reduction in postoperative surgery assessed through the EVENDOL scale.

      The goal was mainly to improve mobility restricted areas due to the operation, and so help to
      reduce post-operative pain.

      Investigators propose to continue the assessment of the overall osteopathic taking care of
      the child after heart surgery while retaining EVENDOL scale as primary endpoint. Population
      will include children from the age of 5 days to less than 7 years old.
