      inhibition in the motor cortex in dystonia. Surround inhibition is a cortical phenomenon, the
      function of which may be to suppress unwanted movements in surrounding muscles during
      voluntary actions. In support of this, a recent study showed that motor output to the little
      finger was reduced during self-paced, voluntary movements of the index finger, despite an
      increase in spinal excitability. Work has also shown that in relaxed muscles, homotopic and
      heterotopic peripheral stimulation results in time dependent modulation of motor cortical
      excitability. However, no studies have examined the relationship between volitional movement
      and sensory input on cortical surround inhibition, the phenomenon which we hypothesize to be
      defective in dystonia. The aim of this study then is to examine the changes in surround
      inhibition when electrical stimulation is applied to the finger being actively moved, leading
      to an inhibition of a surrounding finger (heterotopic inhibition), at different time
      intervals prior to the initiation of movement, to assess the effect of heterotopic peripheral
      stimulation on surround inhibition in dystonia patients compared to normal subjects.
