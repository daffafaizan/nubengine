    
      This is a correlative study of personalized medicine with retrospective and prospective
      components. Patient medical records will be examined for results of molecular profiling
      obtained through standard of care testing to help understand, in a descriptive fashion, how
      well molecular testing might predict response to therapy. Patient outcome parameters
      including, but not limited to, tumor response, time to treatment failure, patient survival,
      and toxicity will be analyzed, as well as pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) data
      when available. This study will also include optional research-related testing of tissue,
      blood, or urine specimens via a variety of simple or advanced techniques such as molecular,
      proteomic, and metabolic analyses for biomarker discovery or for PK and PD parameters. These
      specimens will be obtained from clinical specimens archived by UCSD Health System Pathology
      or from specimens collected via an existing IRB-approved protocol, discarded specimens, or
      from specimens collected for this protocol.
