      intervention on the psychological and physical well-being of 18 to 25 year-old individuals
      with Type 1 diabetes who are at an age of established risk. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to either an immediate intervention group or wait-list control group. All
      participants will be tested before and after the intervention on a battery of self-report
      measures designed to assess various aspects of self-care and psychological functioning. Blood
      samples will also be taken before and after the intervention to determine HbA1C levels.
      Participants will also receive a followup assessment three-months post-intervention to assess
      the durability of the effects. We expect MSC training to induce positive change in
      participants' diabetes management and personal well-being.
