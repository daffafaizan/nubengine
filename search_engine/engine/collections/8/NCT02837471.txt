      standard of care for those who have coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions; the
      aim of CVD prevention and rehabilitation program is to minimize disease progression and
      prevent future cardiovascular events. Behaviour change interventions targeting exercise are
      effective for improving physical activity levels, but can be intensive and costly. Activity
      monitors with accompanying web applications may provide a practical compliment to behaviour
      change interventions as an affordable way to promote and sustain increased physical activity
      levels, as measured by steps and physical activity levels. To date, no studies have examined
      the role of a pedometer with accompanying web application on steps and physical activity
      levels in French-speaking Canadians attending the FrancoFormeÂ® cardiac prevention and
      rehabilitation program at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. It is also unknown the
      average daily steps of Canadian Francophone patients. Identifying successful interventions
      that promote physical activity among CVD prevention and rehabilitation program patients will
      help to improve their health as well as decrease the risk of first or subsequent
      cardiovascular events.
