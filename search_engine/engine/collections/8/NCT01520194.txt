      that cervical cancer will be the second most incident among women, with 18.430 new cases in
      2010. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is related to cervical cancer and is also responsible for
      benign lesions, such as genital warts.The Brazilian Ministry of Health estimates the
      prevalence of genital warts to be 5,7% among pregnant women and 21,5% among women attending
      sexually transmitted infections treatment clinics.The study will measure the psychosocial
      burden of genital warts using HPV Impact Profile questionnaire and the economic burden of
      genital warts among women attending its six reproductive health clinics.

      There are two study objectives:

      1 - to measure the psychosocial burden of genital warts in women attending six reproductive
      health clinics in Brazil. 2- to measure the economic burden of genital warts treatment for
      women attending six reproductive health clinics in Brazil.

      Hypothesis testing:

      For objective 1, the experiment compare differences on psychosocial burden of Genital Warts
      among subgroups and therefore does not include any formal hypothesis testing about the
      psychosocial burden of the disease in agreement with the extant literature on the subject
      (Xingshu Zhu et al., 2009).

      Objective 2 aims to measure differentials in the economic burden of the disease among
      subgroups with different type of genital warts (newly diagnosed, recurrent and resistant),
      site of the lesion, age, duration of treatment, number of medical visits, type and number of
      medical procedures. No formal hypothesis will be tested.
