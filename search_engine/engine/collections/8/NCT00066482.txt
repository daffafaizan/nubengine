        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of cyclophosphamide in
           combination with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin in pediatric patients with newly
           diagnosed high-risk extracranial, extragonadal malignant germ cell tumors.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter, dose-escalation study of cyclophosphamide.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive bleomycin IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1, etoposide
           IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-5, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1
           hour on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily
           beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21
           days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of cyclophosphamide until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are evaluated after 4 courses of therapy. Patients with partial response or stable
      disease undergo second-look surgery, receive 2 more courses of induction therapy, and are
      then re-evaluated. Patients who do not achieve complete response (CR) after a total of 6
      courses may undergo a third surgery. Patients who still have tumor that cannot be removed are
      removed from study therapy. Patients who achieve a CR at anytime are followed.

      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.3 years.
