      many barriers to implementation of long-term reversible contraception in the immediate
      postpartum period. In our indigent population, a survey of patients showed that nearly 60% of
      patients who chose an IUD while admitted postpartum never returned for placement, placing
      them at risk for early repeat pregnancy.

      The intrauterine device is a safe and effective form of long-term reversible contraception
      when placed at 6 weeks postpartum or later with pregnancy rates of only 0.1%. The
      commercially available Mirena IUD contains levonorgestrel which is released slowly over five
      years, providing safe, reversible contraception and making menstrual flow much lighter.

      This randomized controlled trial will compare traditional placement at 6 weeks or more
      postpartum versus immediate post-placental placement.

      The investigators hypothesize that the expulsion rate of IUDs placed immediately postpartum
      will be acceptably low in an indigent population to still be cost effective. Studies from the
      world literature in Egypt and Mexico where IUDs are routinely placed immediately following
      placental delivery.support this hypothesis. A recent study published in 2010 by Chen et al.
      showed an approximately 24% expulsion rate.

      Six week postpartum IUD placement for contraception will be compared to immediate
      post-placental IUD placement, to determine whether immediate IUD insertion after delivery has
      an acceptably low rate of expulsion, infection, perforation and unintended pregnancy, and a
      high rate of retention, patient satisfaction, and maintenance of contraception.
