      semi-rigid and flexible materials:

        1. axial elongation through a close fit of the brace supported with textile composites on
           the lateral sides of the trunk,

        2. 3-point pressure with push and counter-pushes through semi-rigid pads inserted inside
           the pocket lining,

        3. pulling or compression to correct kyphosis or lordosis in the sagittal plane with
           elastic bands,

        4. derotation between the pelvis and shoulders with uneven straps, and

        5. an active mechanism with sensors added to the brace to maintain correct posture.
