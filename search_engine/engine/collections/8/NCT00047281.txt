        -  Determine the efficacy of thalidomide, celecoxib, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide, in
           terms of 6-month progression-free survival, in patients with relapsed or refractory
           malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the radiographic response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily on days 1-42,
      oral etoposide once daily on days 1-21, and oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 22-42.
      Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients (32 with glioblastoma multiforme and 16 with
      anaplastic glioma) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
