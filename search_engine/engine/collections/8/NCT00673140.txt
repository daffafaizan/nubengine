      the upper and lower motor neurons degenerate, ceasing to send messages to muscles. Unable to
      function, the muscles gradually weaken, develop fasciculations (twitches) because of
      denervation, and eventually atrophy due to that denervation. The patient may ultimately lose
      the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement except of the eyes.

      Observations from our research studies indicate that, far infrared rays provide energy to the
      body, improve the autonomic functions of the nervous system, restore the functions of the
      endocrine system, strengthen the immune system, improve blood circulation and increase the
      level of oxygen in the cells and promote the regeneration of muscle cells, nerves and brain
      cells.

      It is hereby postulated that irradiation using far infrared, with wavelength between 5 to 20
      microns, of the central nervous system, the endocrine system and the whole body could
      prevent, control, manage or possibly lead to complete rehabilitation of people who have ALS.
