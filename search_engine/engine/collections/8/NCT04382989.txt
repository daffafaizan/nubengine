      milk macronutrient composition depending on the time after delivery and pregnancy duration.

      In the second part the investigators aim to evaluate the circadian variation of human milk
      macronutrient and energy content depending on pregnancy duration.

      In the third part the investigators aim to evaluate the influence of Holder pasteurisation on
      human milk macronutrient, metabolome and bioactive protein (lysozyme and lactoferrin)
      content.
