    
      To accomplish our Specific Aims the study team proposes a prospective, observational pilot
      study of four rapid risk stratification tools, the HEART Pathway Score, EDACS score, revised
      Geneva score, and PERC score, among 250 chest pain patients within two large EMS systems. The
      proposed pilot study has broad-based support from local and state EMS agencies, including
      Cumberland and New Hanover County EMS agencies. Each tool will be pilot tested and compared
      in the prehospital setting for feasibility and accuracy. Paramedics will be trained in risk
      stratification tool use and then will prospectively collect the clinical data needed to
      calculate each risk stratification score when caring for adults with chest pain. Completed
      paramedic risk assessments will be used to determine feasibility. Patients will be followed
      for 30 days to determine occurrence of ACS and PE events and the sensitivity of each risk
      stratification decision aid will be determined.
