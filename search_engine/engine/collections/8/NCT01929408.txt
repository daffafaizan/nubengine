    
      This is a prospective multicenter observational study in a Consortium of collaborating
      institutions investigating how often older and medically infirm patients who are diagnosed
      with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and treated
      with induction chemotherapy undergo allogeneic HCT. Investigators will look at the rate of
      undergoing allogeneic HCT among older and medically infirm AML and high-risk MDS patients
      compared to younger and relatively healthier patients. Investigators will also compare the
      characteristics and outcomes of patients who did versus did not proceed to allogeneic HCT. A
      number of outcomes will be assessed including mortality, morbidity, and quality of life
      (QOL). Baseline information will be collected on different domains of QOL, geriatric
      assessment, health status measures, AML features, and socioeconomic status. Information will
      help physicians and patients to decide on best treatment choices for AML and high-risk MDS in
      older and medically infirm patients.
