the applicability of individualized programed instructionin the education of deaf children.verbal behavior is learned behavior and assuch is guided by the same principlesas any other learned behavior.  the parents'role is mainly to help the young deafchild conceive of language as a socializingprocess and to help shape language behaviortoward the use of verbal symbols.the teacher's role in the deaf child'sprogress as a language user includes (1) helpingthe child discover how the structureof his language operates and (2) guidinghim in the process of acquiring clearconcepts.  the learning of a language is a highlyindividualized process and requiresthousands of hours of practice.  efficiencyin language teaching to the deafhas not been generally achieved by traditionalmethods.  the teacher of the deafneeds extra help in order to provide the individualistickind of teaching to insureverbal over-learning by the child.  self-tutoringprogramed materials offer thishelp.  programs are so constructed that a childproceeds through the program stepby step with a probability of maximum successbecause of constant feedback as tocorrectness of his responses.  for youngerchildren the use of a machine seemsdesirable while for older children the programmay appear in book form, on filmstrip, and any other visual medium.  well constructedprograms should be correlatedwith classroom instruction.
