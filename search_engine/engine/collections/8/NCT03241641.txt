      tolerability (including bone and renal outcomes) were non-inferior in patients switched to a
      tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), compared with patients who remained on tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF).

      Study procedures This is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter study to
      evaluate safety and non-inferior efficacy of switching from TDF 300 mg QD to TAF 25 mg QD for
      48 weeks in chronic hepatitis B patients who have genotypic resistance to Adefovir/Entecavir.

      174 subjects who complete the previous IN-US-174-0202/0205 studies will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio (A:B) to receive either TAF 25 mg QD or TDF 300 mg QD Case group: approximately 87
      subjects administered TAF 25 mg QD Control group: approximately 87 subjects administered TDF
      300 mg QD

      The primary analysis will occur at Week 48 with the primary efficacy endpoint being newly
      achievement and maintenance of virologic response (HBV DNA <60 IU/mL at Week 48).

      The duration of maintaining both arms is 48 weeks. All subjects who complete 48 weeks of
      treatment are eligible for participation in the open label TAF 25 mg extension period for an
      additional 48 weeks (through Week 96)
