      participants with COVID-19 at the first follow-up. All participants will be followed up for 1
      year. During follow-up, International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), Quality
      Evaluation Questionnaire (QEQ), symptom list chart-90 (SCL-90) questionnaire evaluation and
      sexual function related examinations (including nocturnal penile tumescence, color duplex
      ultrasonography, etc. ) and fertility-related examinations (including sex hormones, semen
      routine examinations, etc.) will be performed to assess the changes in male sexual function,
      reproductive function and mental health of male patients discharged with COVID-19, and the
      impact of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive and mental health. In addition, collect male semen
      examination reports from April to December in 2017-2020 to evaluate the impact of new
