      and 25% fat to 30% carbohydrate and 45% fat is responsible by itself for suppression of
      hunger and increased secretory response of glucose-dependent insulinotropic hormone (GIP) and
      glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), or whether these changes depend on preceding exercise. We
      will measure (a) concentrations of plasma GIP and GLP-1 by chemiluminescent multiplex assay,
      (b) concentrations of plasma ancetaminophen to assess the gastric emptying rate, (c)
      concentrations of plasma insulin, and glucagon by radioimmunoassay, and glucose, ketone
      bodies, and free fatty acids with appropriate spectrophotometric methods, (d) hourly appetite
      responses with visual analog scale under two conditions: sedentary (SED) and exercise (EX).

      Hypothesis: Hunger suppression and secretion of GIP and GLP-1 after the morning meal will be
      greater with slower gastric emptying rate when a meal consisting of 45% fat and 30%
      carbohydrate follows three hours after a 2-hour bout of moderate-intensity exercise than in
      the absence of exercise.
