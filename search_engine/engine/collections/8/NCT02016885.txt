    
      This is a randomized, vehicle controlled, dose-ranging study enrolling subjects with axillary
      hyperhidrosis and designed to assess the safety and efficacy of four doses of glycopyrrolate
      compared to vehicle. There are 5 arms in this study.

      Efficacy will be assessed through the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS),
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and a gravimetric assessment of sweat production.

      Safety will be assessed, at specified times during the study, through adverse events, local
      skin responses, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, ECGs, physical examination
      and vital signs.

      PK samples will be taken from 20 to 30 subjects participating in the study.
