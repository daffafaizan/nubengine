      real-life measurement data using the TENA Urine Sensor. The collected data will be used to
      assess the device related algorithms. These algorithms have been established and verified in
      a laboratory environment. However, due to possible differences in parameters, real-life
      measurement data are to be collected to aid in further product development.
