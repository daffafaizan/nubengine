      control arm is conducted during school years 2016/17 and 2017/18. 42 volunteering schools
      were matched to pairs. One school in each pair was randomly selected to receive the PAX GBG
      or continue their normal activities without intervention. After a post-test assessment in
      spring 2018 the control group teachers are trained and supported to implement PAX GBG.
