      study in patients with mild to moderate ParkinsonÂ´s disease. It is planned to enrol up to 5
      cohorts of 8 subjects; Cohorts D and E are optional. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive multiple ascending oral doses of anle138b or matching placebo (6 active
      investigational medicinal product [IMP], 2 placebo per cohort) for 7 days in a sequential
      escalating manner. Subjects in Cohorts A and B will also receive an additional single oral
      dose of active IMP or matching placebo on Day 9 of the study for an assessment of the effect
      of food on the PK of anle138b in PD patients.
