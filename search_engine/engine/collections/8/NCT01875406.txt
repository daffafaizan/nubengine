    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the predictive value of a composite of 3 simple,
      clinically practical, diagnostic tests (Mekhail, Patrick's and Thigh thrust) combined with a
      pain referral diagram in predicting response to a single diagnostic SIJ injection. The goal
      is to test these 3 tests and compare their predictive value to the 6 tests commonly reported
      in the literature in order to provide a clinician with clinically practical special tests to
      aide in the diagnosis and treatment of SIJ mediated pain. . Specifically, we seek to evaluate
      the prognostic capacity for a series of three clinical tests (Mekhail's Test, thigh thrust
      and Patrick's Test) combined with a pain referral diagram to accurately predict the response
      (change in VAS) of a single diagnostic Sacroiliac joint and extra-capsular joint injection.
