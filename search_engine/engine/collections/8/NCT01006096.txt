    
      Psoriasis vulgaris is a disease that affects 25 million people in North America and Europe.
      It often presents in late adolescence and usually persists for life. Current therapies target
      specific immune molecules that are implicated in the cause of this disease. For example,
      biologic agents that are used in severe psoriasis are aimed at inflammatory mediators. These
      therapies have been proven to be effective but also have their limitations.
