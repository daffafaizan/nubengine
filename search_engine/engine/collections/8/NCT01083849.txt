    
      According to protocol amendment of 16 October 2010 Austria is participating in this study.

      Paricalcitol injection (intravenous (IV) therapy) was approved in Germany in December 2004
      and in Austria in June 2003 for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism
      in participants needing dialysis. In April 2008 in Germany and in January 2008 in Austria,
      paricalcitol capsules (for oral use (p.o.)) were launched for the prevention and treatment of
      secondary hyperparathyroidism in individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease stage 3 - 5 (i.e.,
      predialysis and dialysis), thus enabling early treatment of participants with chronic kidney
      disease before they reach the stage of requiring dialysis.

      Postmarketing observational studies with a well-planned study design, defined study protocol
      and biometrical estimates are necessary for a more profound understanding of the
      effectiveness and adverse drug reactions, especially those that are unknown or rare.

      Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to obtain data on the safety and effectiveness of
      paricalcitol injection and capsules in real-life clinical practice. In this study,
      paricalcitol will be prescribed on an on-label basis in an everyday setting. A period of 12
      months has been consciously chosen in order to also obtain experience on the maintenance dose
      and treatment optimization with paricalcitol injection and paricalcitol capsules in long-term
      use.
