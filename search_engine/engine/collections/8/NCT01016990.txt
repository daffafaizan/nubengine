        -  To determine if valproic acid has a response rate of â‰¥ 20% in patients with previously
           treated relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  To determine if treatment with valproic acid leads to measurable levels of histone
           acetylation in peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease diagnosis (indolent non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma [NHL] vs. aggressive NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma). Valproic acid doses are adjusted
      until therapeutic level is achieved.

      Patients receive oral valproic acid daily for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at
      least 2 courses and up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically. Samples are analyzed for valproic acid levels; and
      hyperacetylation (caused by the valproic acid N-terminals of the histones H3 and H4) via
      western blot.
