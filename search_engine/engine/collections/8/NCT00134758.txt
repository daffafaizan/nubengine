      treatment of duodenal adenomas. One hundred patients are planned to be included. Fifty will
      receive UDCA and fifty a placebo. Three duodenoscopies are planned: one before inclusion, one
      at the end of the first year of follow-up and one after two years of follow-up at the end of
      the protocol. These duodenoscopies are associated to endoscopies of the ileal reservoir
      performed at the time of restorative proctocolectomy and are recorded numerically. Severity
      of the duodenal adenomas are evaluated according to the SPIGELMAN score. Patients are seen
      every 6 months. Before each endoscopy, blood samples are collected for biliary acid profile
      analysis. Moreover, during endoscopies, duodenal fluid and ileal fluid are collected for
      biliary acid profile analysis, also.

      At the end of the follow-up of the last patients included (nov 2008), biliary acid profile
      analysis will be performed and statistical analysis of the results will be performed.
