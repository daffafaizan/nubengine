      Acinetobacter as urgent threats and multidrug resistant Pseudomonas, and extended spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae as serious threats [CDC, 2019]. Consistent
      with the global nature of these resistant bacteria, the World Health Organization (WHO) has
      designated carbapenem-resistant, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant
      Acinetobacter baumannii, and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa as pathogens for
      which new agents are critically needed [WHO, 2017].

      Qpex Biopharma is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of QPX2014 plus an ultra-broad
      spectrum beta-lactamase inhibitor, QPX7728.
