    
      This is a feasibility study to determine the utility of two new standardized psychometric
      tools for paediatricians to assess and manage feeding difficulties in formula fed infants.
      Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (BEBQ) and Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale
      (MCH-Feeding Scale) will be used in this study.

      The secondary objectives are to determine if these tools can then measure the changes in
      behaviour after introducing two formula that differ in the sources of protein, ie formula
      made from whole goat milk compared to a conventional formula made from cow milk proteins. The
      quality of life and general health outcomes of these infants will also be monitored.
