      and general public. With recent recognition of resistant starch (RS), an indigestible
      fraction which has postprandial glucose lowering effects, the addition of resistant starch in
      bread may alter its glycemic effects and thus glycemic index. Therefore, the objectives of
      this study were to investigate the glycemic index, glycemic reponse of Taiwan local food and
      effects of resistant starch in bread formulation.
