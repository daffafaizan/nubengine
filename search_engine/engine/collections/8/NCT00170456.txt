      forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax occurs in humans when they are exposed to
      infected animals, tissue from infected animals or when they are directly exposed to B.
      anthracis or its spores. In the USA, the annual incidence of human anthrax has declined.
      However, in the USA, shortly after September 11th 2001, there were 22 cases (18 confirmed) of
      inhaled and cutaneous anthrax infections that were related to contaminated mail. This is a
      double blind, parallel-group, dose ranging study of rPA anthrax vaccine. The subjects will be
      blinded as to which dose of rPA vaccine is administered. The primary objectives of this
      clinical trial are 1.) To evaluate the safety and tolerability associated with different
      primary immunization doses and schedules of rPA vaccine to enable determination of the
      optimum dose for future clinical trials and 2.) To evaluate the immunogenicity of different
      primary immunization doses and schedules of rPA vaccine to enable determination of the
      optimum schedule for future clinical trials.
