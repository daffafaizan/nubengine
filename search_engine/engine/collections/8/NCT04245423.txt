      opioid use disorder (OUD) and depression, anxiety disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) in primary care. The investigators will also examine clinician and practice
      characteristics associated with successful implementation and the cost effectiveness of
      different care models. The primary aims of this proposal are: (1) Rapidly prototype and test
      our collaborative care models to optimize them for implementation at the University of
      Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) primary care clinics for the treatment of individuals with
      co-occurring mental health problems and opioid use disorder (OUD); (2) Conduct a randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) among 1,185 primary care patients aged 18 years and older with OUD and
      depression, anxiety or PTSD. Patients will be randomized to one of three conditions:

      a) Augmented Usual Care (AUC), which consists of a primary care physician (PCP) waivered to
      prescribe buprenorphine, a mental health care manager, and an addiction psychiatrist to
      consult on Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT); b) Collaborative Care (CC), which consists of
      a waivered PCP, a mental health care manager who receives OUD training, and a psychiatrist
      who provides telephonic consultation for OUD and mental health; or c) Collaborative Care Plus
      (CC+), which consists of all the elements of CC, plus a Certified Recovery Specialist (CRS)
      to help with patient engagement in treatment and retention in care;

      (3) Measure clinician- level factors associated with implementation of each component and
      metrics of fidelity and reach, our primary implementation outcomes of interest; and (4)
      Assess the costs to primary care practices of implementing and delivering AUC, CC and CC+ and
      the change in total healthcare costs associated with the implementation. Successful
      completion of the proposed study will provide definitive evidence regarding the most
      parsimonious set of elements of integrated collaborative care required to maximize outcomes
      for individuals with OUD and psychiatric disorders.
