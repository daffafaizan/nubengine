      disease, and is frequently complicated by Pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pulmonary hypertension
      influences symptomatology and long-term prognosis. Percutaneous Mitral Commissurotomy (PMC),
      was first described in 1984, has good results and is performed by antegrade access to the
      mitral valve through trans-septal puncture by one of various techniques (e.g. Inuoe, and
      multitrack system). Pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) decrease following PMC. The improvement
      in pulmonary hypertension after PMC is explained by the improvement in the mitral valve area
      and subsequent decompression of left atrium (LA) and pulmonary venous beds. Even though there
      have been studies showing excellent results following PMC in all grades of PH, nonregression
      of PH following PMC is not uncommon. The component of PAP contributed by the passive
      transmission of the elevated LA pressure regresses immediately after a successful PMC
      proportional to the reduction in transmitral gradient. The PH contributed by pulmonary
      arteriolar constriction slowly comes down over weeks or a few months, But a "fixed" component
      due to pulmonary vascular disease usually persists.
