      subjects who are eligible and willing to volunteer to have a research MRI performed. These
      studies may involve the administration of commercially available MR contrast media. Some
      scans may require inhaled carbogen (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide) and hyperoxia (100%
      oxygen) as a contrast media. The results will be used to evaluate the performance of various
      pulse sequences, gradient coils, and rf coils on human subjects and will provide essential
      ground work for specific patient protocols.
