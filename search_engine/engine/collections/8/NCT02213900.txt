      dysfunction or delirium postoperatively. Delirium is a state of brain failure characterized
      by disturbance of consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention
      that occurs over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate over the course of the day.
      Presence of delirium in the post-operative phase is associated with a longer length of both
      intensive care unit and hospital stay, increased health-care costs, long-term functional and
      cognitive decline, and an increased risk of in-hospital and post-discharge mortality.

      Haloperidol primarily acts by blocking dopamine (D2) receptors. This dopamine blockade in the
      cerebral cortex improves cognition and reduces delirium. Along with the dopamine blockade,
      haloperidol has anti-inflammatory properties. It inhibits production of lipopolysaccharide
      induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-Î±). Haloperidol also increases levels of Interleukin -1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), an
      anti-inflammatory cytokine that blocks the action of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. If
      unchecked, the inflammatory cytokines cause impaired concentration, sleep disturbances, and
      agitation the cardinal symptoms of delirium; and induce a reduction in cholinergic activity.
      Given the inhibitory effect of acetylcholine on certain cytokines such as interleukin-6, a
      repetitive cycle of inadequate regulation of inflammation due to cholinergic depletion
      ensues. Haloperidol with its anti-inflammatory properties seeks to mitigate this repetitive
      vicious cycle.
