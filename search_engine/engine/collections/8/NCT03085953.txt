      improve health and well-being of current and former service members employed in participating
      Oregon organizations. The SERVe Study seeks to do this by training supervisors to support
      veteran employees by focusing on a reduction in work-life stress while increasing supportive
      supervisor behavior.

      The SERVe Study proposes that supervisor supportiveness can influence workplace experience,
      health, and well-being of service members, as well as of their families.

      The investigators of the SERVe Study expect positive results for study participants,
      including reduced stress and increased social support, reduction in negative workplace
      experiences, and improvement in family well-being outcomes. Longer term, these effects are
      expected to create a more supportive work environment, which has positive effects on safety,
      health, well-being, family, and organizational outcomes.

      Veteran participants are measured at baseline, three months, and nine months. Veteran spouses
      are invited to participate as well. Married and cohabitating veterans and their partners are
      invited to participate in the Daily Family Study (DFS), a 32-day daily diary survey after
      baseline and at six months.
