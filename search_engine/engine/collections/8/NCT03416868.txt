      biofeedback to conventional voice therapy can result in faster carryover (compliance) of new
      vocal behaviors established during voice therapy to daily life. Here, ambulatory voice
      biofeedback will be based on glottal aerodynamic measures that have subject-specific
      sensitivity to vocal hyperfunction. Hypothesis: The first ambulatory voice biofeedback week
      will result in higher compliance percentages when compared to baseline and the week prior to
      the initiation of biofeedback (when there was voice therapy alone). Days/weeks post-AVB will
      be significantly different than baseline (successful carryover).
