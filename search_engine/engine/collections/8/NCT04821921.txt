      physicians. In order to protect people from SARS-COV-2 infections, social contacts were
      reduced by restrictions on many areas of social life. As a side effect, these measures could
      have also led to changes in the self-management of patients with diabetes mellitus, such as
      lack of physical exercise, less healthy dietary behavior, and a reduced intensity of medical
      care. These possible changes may be associated with poorer control of blood glucose,
      cholesterol, and blood pressure. Therefore, the CoDiaM study will investigate how management
      and outcomes of diabetes are changing during the pandemic and identify associated factors.

      The study is based on data of patients treated in three GP practices specialized on diabetes
      treatment in Hamburg, Germany. Data collection will include a written patient survey and
      extraction of clinical data from patient records. The patient's survey includes
      sociodemographic data and validated instruments to assess diabetes self-management (DSMQ),
      health literacy (HLS-EU-Q16), self-efficacy (General Self-efficacy scale) and perceived
      social support (F-SozU K14). Data will be analyzed by descriptive statistics and
      multivariable, multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for possible
      confounders and random effects on the practice level.
