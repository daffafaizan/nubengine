      pharmacokinetics of TAS-102 in patients with advanced solid tumors with varying degrees of
      renal impairment. The study is conducted in 2 parts: the Pharmacokinetic Part (Cycle 1) and
      the Extension Part (Cycles 2 and beyond). Patients may continue to receive treatment with
      TAS-102 during the study extension part only after completion of the Pharmacokinetic Part.
