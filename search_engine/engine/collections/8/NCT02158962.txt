    
      I. Background and Significance: Several exploratory and major controlled studies conducted on
      the mainland US have shown intimate partner violence (IPV) or intimate partner abuse (IPA) to
      be risk factors for a variety of physical, reproductive and mental health problems, including
      HIV/AIDS, many of which are areas of known health disparity for African American and Latina
      women.

      The current investigators recently completed the first in-depth prevalence study of violence
      and abuse of women in the US Virgin islands (USVI) and associated health consequences. This
      seminal study showed 1) Lifetime prevalence of IPV of 32.8% in the USVI and past two year
      prevalence of 37.2%%.in a sample of 1059 women aged 18-55 who self-identified as African
      Caribbean or from African descent and who had an intimate partner during the past two years
      2) Past two year physical and/or sexual abuse ranged from 4 % on the island of St Croix to 9%
      on St Thomas 3) Abused women had significantly more risk factors for Sexually Transmitted
      Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS than did women not abused, and 4) Risk factors for STIs and
      HIV/AIDS included being forced into vaginal or anal sex, women having concurrent partners or
      their partners having multiple partners, having a STI, lack of consistent condom use, and
      exchange sex (trading sex for material goods) This study also found women amenable to being
      asked about IPV in health care settings where a brief intervention could be feasibly
      implemented. Preliminary qualitative work illuminated women's perceptions of community and
      cultural perspectives on IPV in the USVI. The proposed randomized clinical trial (RCT) builds
      on findings from the prior study.

      II. Research Strategy: A RCT will provide a preliminary test of an intervention designed to
      reduce IPV and IPA and the concurrent risk of STIs and HIV in abused USVI women by empowering
      their use of safety behaviors and increasing their use of resources... IPV and IPA have been
      linked to high-risk sexual behaviors, the inability to negotiate safer sex behaviors, and
      negative sexual health outcomes. The research plan is to deliver a structured intervention to
      reduce the devastating impact of IPV and IPA for abused women in the USVI.

      Time I: Women will respond to baseline data measures using computer assisted self-reports.
      Data collected include socio-demographic and cultural characteristics of women and their
      partners, past and recent intimate partner physical, sexual and emotional abuse (SVAWS),
      Danger Assessment (DA), baseline HIV/STD status and risks for infection, including condom
      use. To minimize attrition contact information for each participant and for three contact
      persons (family, friends, and neighbors) will also be collected. Abused women will be
      randomized by the computer to either the Healthy Relationships Risk Reduction experimental
      intervention group or the Healthy Lifestyles comparison control group A. Session 1- Risk
      Reduction Intervention Group. Women in the Experimental Intervention will complete this
      session following initial assessment and group assignment. The ESP-DOVE IPV Empowerment
      Intervention is an individualized (60 minute) protocol following the initial enrollment
      session. Abused women will view a video developed in the US Virgin Islands, using local
      actors, depicting various experiences of abused Virgin Island. The abused women will
      participate in a one on one structured, brochure-based intervention with a trained
      interventionist that addresses information about the cycle of violence, risk factors that may
      increase a woman's danger of homicide (the Danger Assessment), choices or options (leaving,
      using local shelter resources, accessing resources in the criminal justice system), safety
      planning, and specific local and national phone numbers for IPV resources. The intervention
      provides the woman with information, emphasizing that she has options or The structured ESP-
      DOVE intervention is interactive and encourages the woman to describe her experiences and
      choose her options as they proceed. The intervention has been modified to be culturally
      appropriate for abused women of African Caribbean or African American background living in
      the US Virgin Islands. Since the context of IPV varies considerably, this approach allows
      individualization, client input and choice, all thought to enhance intervention success with
      battered women and other "hard to reach" populations At the same time, the brochure gives the
      nurse and other interventionists a script to increase uniformity of the intervention across
      women and interventionists. Four major intervention components: a) IPV information, b) Danger
      Assessment, c) Safety Planning, and d) Resources are explored. At the end of Session I, the
      woman in the risk reduction intervention group will provide contact information for Session 2
      which will be scheduled one week later.

      Time 2: Session 2- Women will assess their needs associated with IPV, safety behaviors and
      feelings about how their situation is evolving. The need for resources and services will be
      explored. The session will also focus on helping the women learn how to reduce their risk for
      HIV/STD infections. This one-on-one behavioral intervention has been found to reduce HIV/STD
      risk behaviors and STD morbidity among inner-city African American women in primary care
      settings in a NINR funded randomized controlled trial. The intervention has been modified and
      culturally tailored for abused women in the US Virgin Islands and involves a skill-building
      one-on-one session that the facilitator tailors to the specific needs of each participant
      after conducting an HIV/STD risk assessment interview. It involves STD prevention behavioral
      skills, video clips, condom demonstration, practice with an anatomical model, and
      role-playing. Curriculum activities are also designed to help women recognize that faulty
      reasoning and decision-making can increase their risk of HIV infection. The activities help
      the women understand the adverse consequences of participating in unsafe sexual activity and
      the positive consequences of safer sexual practices. Contact information for Session 3 will
      be validated and a follow up group session scheduled.

      Time 3: Session 3: The third session will consist of small groups (8-10) of women in a
      supportive/educational session led by an interventionist and investigator. Sessions held in
      each district in the USVI and will be scheduled two weeks following Session 2. Women in the
      experimental intervention group will have another opportunity to integrate issues related to
      their IPV experiences. . They will interact with other abused women in a setting conducive to
      sharing attitudes and beliefs about IPV prevention, cultural beliefs about IPV, the need for
      support, assertiveness training, stress and affect management, safety enhancement strategies
      and effective behaviors to reduce the risk of HIV and sexually transmitted disease and
      personal vulnerability. Session three will be offered twice each week in each district until
      all participants have had an opportunity to complete the intervention. At the end of session
      3, the women will be scheduled for a three month follow-up to assess outcomes. Contact
      information will be reconfirmed.

      B. Healthy Living Comparison Control Group Session 1: Women in the Healthy Living comparison
      control group will complete the baseline assessment using the computer assisted tablets for
      self-report. Women who report a history of intimate partner abuse will be will be yoked on
      age (>25 or <below 25) and ethnicity (Hispanic or Non-Hispanic and education (HS grad vs <
      high school graduation). During Session one, if randomly assigned to the Healthy Living
      Comparison Control intervention group, they will be focus on Breast Health Education and how
      to develop a breast health care plan aimed at reducing the risk of breast cancer in women of
      African heritage. Obesity as a risk factor for breast cancer will be introduced. Booklets on
      breast health and developing a breast health plan will be provided as well as general
      resource information on women and child health services. Contact information for the one week
      follow up will be obtained and the woman given an appointment for Session II.

      Session 2: At time two women in the comparison control health promotion group will be
      involved in a session on Healthy Lifestyles for African Caribbean Women: Reducing Obesity
      Risks. The one on one interactive session will discuss the association between breast cancer
      and obesity as well as other major health problems associated with obesity. They learn how to
      assess their Body Mass Index and measure waist conference to determine whether or not they
      are at risk for obesity related health problems. The session will last approximately one
      hour. They will also be briefly reassessed for abuse to determine if abuse is escalating and
      the need for a referral. Participant contact information will be confirmed and Session 3
      scheduled two weeks later.

      Session 3: At time three participants in the comparison control health promotion group
      control will engage in a follow up group session of 6-8 women that will include sharing
      progress made on developing breast health plans as well as planned choices to reduce obesity
      and promote healthy lifestyles including diet and exercise. The group discussion will be
      facilitated by the original facilitator as well as one of the study investigators. Contact
      information for the final follow up will be will be validated. Participants will complete a
      post interview on the computer and a 3 month follow-up outcome assessment will be scheduled.

      C. Outcome Measures Time 4: Intervention outcomes will be measured at three months to assess
      effectiveness and safety of the Integrated Risk Reduction Intervention for Women Experiencing
      IPA. Participants will include women who completed all three sessions of the Risk Reduction
      intervention or three sessions of the Health Education Comparison Control group. The outcome
      measures will be completed on computer tablets and will include the same measures that were
      used at the initial assessment in addition to an assessment of changes in safety and
      prevention behaviors. Participants will be scheduled for a six month follow-up for final
      outcome measures.

      Time 5: Final post intervention outcome measures will be obtained six months after the
      participant completes the 3 month outcome measures. The women will again be contacted at
      least two weeks prior to the scheduled outcomes measures by Caribbean Exploratory NIMHD
      Research Center Staff to re-confirm the scheduled follow-up and will repeat the same process
      on computer tablets including outcome measures used at the three month assessment.

      D. Data management

        1. Preliminary Analyses: Microsoft Access and Excel will be used for record keeping,
           tracking, and initial data processing. The latest versions of SAS and SPSS computer
           programs will be used for data management and analysis. Access to the computers and data
           CDs will be limited both physically and electronically. Computers and data will be
           stored in an office that is locked when not in use. Access to databases will be
           restricted with read and write protection. Data analysis will begin with preparatory
           activities such as the treatment of missing data, identification of outliers and other
           such data cleaning tasks. A detailed descriptive analysis of all quantitative data will
           be performed, involving the summarization of data and the use of inferential and
           graphical exploratory data analytic techniques.

        2. Analysis: To conduct a preliminary test of the integrated intervention as described in
           the brief description, analysis of covariance, frequency and logistic regression will be
           used to explore potential differences in predictor variables between the two groups.
