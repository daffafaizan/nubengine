      staff practices on the postpartum floor and intervening with parents before hospital
      discharge to help them quit smoking. Over 14 months, we assessed the smoking status of both
      parents of all newborns delivered at 1 hospital. Moms and dads who were current smokers (1
      cigarette, even a puff, in past 30 days) or recent quitters (smoked since one month prior to
      conception) were eligible for the study. Enrolled parents were randomly assigned to the
      control or intervention group. The intervention included a brief motivational interview (MI),
      enrollment in the proactive state quitline, and follow-up faxes to the pediatric, OB, and PCP
      providers with tailored treatment messages.
