      patients with B cell leukemia. The investigators constructed a 2nd CAR, using CD19 as target,
      using 4-1BB as co-stimulator, and optimized the spatial conformation by a suitable hinge and
      transmembrane domain sequences. The source of T cells used to prepare CAR-T could be either
      autologous, or donor-derived (only suitable for patients received HSCT before and relapsed).
      The infusion dose is (1-5)Ã—106 CAR positive T cells/kg, and the specific cells numbers
      depends on the situation of individual CAR-T cells preparation.
