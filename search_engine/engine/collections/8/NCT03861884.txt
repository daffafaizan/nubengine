        1. to demonstrate differences in brain iron levels between different dementia syndromes and
           healthy volunteers using ultra high-field MRI, quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)
           at 7T.

        2. to demonstrate variations in the resting oxygen usage as an important biomarker to
           discriminate between different dementia syndromes.

        3. to demonstrate cerebral blood flow changes in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus
           region, and its correlation with different dementia syndromes using Arterial Spin
           Labelling MRI technique.

        4. to demonstrate increased blood brain barrier leakage in the brain, particularly in the
           hippocampus region, and its correlation with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Vascular
           Cognitive Impairment (VCI) using a new dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI)
           technique.
