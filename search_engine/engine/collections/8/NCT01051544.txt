      and makes treatment of bleeding episodes very difficult. Having an inhibitor is a serious and
      life-threatening complication in patients with Hemophilia. The usual treatment of patients
      with FVIII inhibitors involves "immune tolerance induction" (ITI). Immune Tolerance means
      that the body can accept infused FVIII and that FVIII is again effective in controlling
      bleeds. ITI involves giving high doses of FVIII regularly until the inhibitor disappears.
      This treatment is not always effective. The inhibitor persists in about 1 in 5 patients who
      undergo ITI.

      There are 2 types of FVIII concentrates: FVIII concentrates derived from human plasma, which
      contain the von Willebrand factor, and concentrates of FVIII without VWF (recombinant or
      plasma derived). Both types of concentrates are commonly used to induce immune tolerance in
      patients with Hemophilia A. Retrospective studies in subjects with hemophilia and inhibitors
      at risk for failing ITI, have indicated a higher rate of success if patients were treated
      with von Willebrand containing factor VIII concentrates. It is not known whether the addition
      of Von Willebrand factor offers an advantage to achieving immune tolerance.
