      patients will undergo transarterial embolization of the prostatic vasculature. Each patient
      will undergo a single embolization procedure.

      After completion of treatment in the first 2 patients and a review of follow-up assessments
      after 7 days, subsequent patients will be enrolled if no safety concerns have arisen in the
      first 2 patients. Patients will be enrolled until 15 patients have undergone treatment. The
      patients will undergo MRI, contrast enhanced ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT)
      angiograpy/intra-procedural cone beam CT as required.

      Ekobi Embolization MIcrospheres is administered via selective angiography and Prostatic
      Artery Embolization (PAE), a minimally invasive technique for reducing symptoms from Benign
      Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) to achieve near stasis in the target vasculature. Contrast
      Enhanced Ultrasound (CEU) and angiographic runs will be used to confirm anatomy at the time
      of embolization.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CEUS is used to assess changes in prostate volume and in
      central gland enhancement characteristics using 3D volume assessment software.
