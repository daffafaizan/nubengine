    
      This is a monocentric study with a recruitment period comprised between October 2012 and
      April 2016. The recruitment occurs during the consultations in the service of neurology. If
      the subjects are eligible, the study is proposed to them, and an evaluation is fixed in the
      next days. This evaluation consists in an individual face-to-face interview based on
      standardized and semi-structured questionnaires, during approximately one and a half hour.
      It's focused on the different characteristics of Parkinson's disease, and on psychiatric and
      addictive co morbidities. The evaluation is completed by a set of self-administered
      questionnaires focused on impulsivity and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

      For the 80 patients participated to the ancillary study only, a blood sample will be realized
      when the patient will arrived, just before the intake of his treatment (to obtain the
      residual plasmatic concentration). A second sample will be realized at a different time for
      each patient, to cover the entirety of the kinetic between 2 intakes of pramipexole
      (immediate release form) via the entire sample. The second blood sample will be realized four
      hours after the first one at the most. After this second sample, the patient will have
      completed his participation to the study.

      Secondly, monitoring including a self-questionnaire booklet and a saliva sample will be
      offered to all patients who completed the initial visit.
