      utilization. This study will look at the relationship that geographic proximity and local
      population factors have on patient use of emergency departments. Geographic proximity of
      alternative hospitals and elicit other patient and hospital specific factors, such as
      demographic, insurance type, diagnosis, and socioeconomic factors that lead patients to
      choose specific hospitals for emergency care or generally lead to patients accessing
      emergency care will be compared.

      Patterns of emergency department utilization by patients will be identified in specific
      geographies such as Census tracts to determine clusters of high and low emergency department
      use. We also analyze the patterns of emergency care use based on specific disease
      conditions.Investigators will analyze the rate of emergency department use for patients with
      diabetes to determine population prevalence of diseases using emergency department data.
      Studying the pattern of use by specific geographies or disease conditions will also allow us
      to understand how emergency department use varies among populations by geographies and the
      socioeconomic and health care factors local to those regions.
