      or mutation of wild type p53 (wtp53). In addition to playing a crucial role in cell cycle
      control, the p53 gene is a critical component in two of the pathways involved in regulating
      tumor cell growth: cell death (apoptosis) and the regulation of angiogenesis. The loss of
      such critical tumor suppressor activity is believed to be responsible for p53's involvement
      in such a broad array of human tumors and resistance to chemo/radiotherapy. SGT-53 is a
      complex composed of a wild type p53 gene (plasmid DNA) encapsulated in a liposome that is
      targeted to tumor cells by means of an anti-transferrin receptor single-chain antibody
      fragment (TfRscFv) attached to the outside of the liposome. Pre-clinical studies have
      indicated that SGT-53 could sensitize tumors to the effects of radiation/chemotherapy.

      The Phase 1a portion of this clinical study was designed to evaluate the safety and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of SGT-53. In addition, pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of SGT-53
      will be measured and correlated with tumor response and toxicity.

      The Phase Ib portion of this clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety of SGT-53 in
      combination with docetaxel, determine the recommended Phase II doses of these two agents, and
      evaluate the effect of the combination of SGT-53 and docetaxel on tumor size or progression.
