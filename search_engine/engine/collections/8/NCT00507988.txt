      This observation has led to the development of cognitive training packages aiming a improving
      these deficits. However, it is far from clear which level of cognitive functioning provides
      the best target for cognitive interventions. Traditionally, training has aimed a basic
      cognitive functions like attention and memory. In the present study we aim at a higher-level
      of function, namely planning and problem-solving skills, which are trained using the software
      package Plan-A-Day. The primary hypothesis is that complex problem solving training improved
      functional capacity more than traditional training programs addressing basic cognitive
      function.
