      deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (Gpi) or subthalamic nucleus
      (STN) can provide significant symptom improvement, but it is not known which site provides
      maximum benefit or the physiologic mechanisms by which these improvements may occur. The
      study goals are to determine if DBS of Gpi or STN provides significant clinical improvement
      in patients with primary cervical dystonia, whether the anatomic DBS site (if either)
      provides optimal improvement, and to gain deeper insight into the underlying pathophysiology
      of this disorder.

      Study population: Adult patients with medically refractory primary cervical dystonia will
      make-up the study population. Patients with primary cervical dystonia suffer a wide range of
      symptoms including physical deformity, speech difficulties, swallowing dysfunction, visual
      problems, and intractable pain, which can result in an inability to care for themselves.

      Design: We propose placing DBS electrodes (using microelectrode guidance) bilaterally into
      either the Gpi or STN of medically refractory cervical dystonia patients. Physiological
      studies will be performed and compared with clinical changes to understand the mechanism of
      action of DBS and underlying pathophysiology of cervical dystonia.

      Outcome measures: Clinical effectiveness of DBS of the Gpi or STN will be measured by the
      Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale and monitored over time to determine the
      effectiveness of DBS and if there is an ideal anatomic stimulation site. Electrophysiologic
      outcome measures will be obtained to determine the underlying pathophysiology of cervical
      dystonia, and the mechanism of action of DBS.
