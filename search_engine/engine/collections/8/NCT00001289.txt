      with neuronopathic Gaucher's disease and to investigate the pathogenesis of their
      neurological signs and symptoms. Macrophage-targeted glucocerebrosidase will be administered
      by intravenous infusion under the supervision of the patient's private physician at an
      initial dosage of 60 to 120 IU per kg of body weight weekly or every other week. Patients
      will be categorized as treatment responders if they display a clinically significant increase
      in hemoglobin concentration and a reduction in hepatic or splenic volume. Improvement in
      these parameters over time will be correlated with measurements for metabolic encephalopathy
      and radiologic, electrophysiologic and psychometric measurements of neurological involvement.
