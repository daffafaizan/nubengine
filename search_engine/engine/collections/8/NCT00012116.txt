      or refused standard therapy when treated with temozolomide. II. Assess the safety and
      tolerability of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the quality of life of patients
      treated with this drug. IV. Determine the response rate of systemic disease outside the
      central nervous system in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide daily for 6 weeks. Treatment repeats every 10
      weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Quality of life is assessed on day 1 of each 10-week course. Patients are followed for 30
      days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
