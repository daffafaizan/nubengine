      negatively altered in young, healthy individuals. Participants (age 18-30, healthy lipid
      profile) will undergo a 2-week washout period followed by daily intake of 1, 2, and 3 eggs
      per day for 4 weeks each. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and following each
      4-week dietary period. Samples will be analyzed to determine the impact of daily intake of
      increasing numbers of eggs on blood lipids, TMAO, biomarkers of oxidative stress and
      inflammation, and expression of cholesterol-related genes.
