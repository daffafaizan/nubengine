      participation in the study. You are free to skip any questions that you prefer not to answer.
      We will only use the information you provide in this survey to determine if you qualify for
      the EMA-Defined Tinnitus Subgroups study.

      To be in this study, you will be required to have a smart phone that can receive text
      messages, is connected to the internet, and will allow you to connect via the internet to a
      Washington University secure server. It is necessary to connect to the Washington University
      server in order to complete a short survey four times a day for two separate two-week
      periods.

      The study involves us sending you text messages at 4 random times during the day, between the
      hours of 8: 00 am - 9: 00 pm. The texts prompt you to click on a link and respond to a short
      EMA survey regarding what you are doing, what your environment is, and how your tinnitus is
      at that moment. These text messages will be sent daily for two weeks. Then you will have two
      weeks off. Finally you will again receive the text messages asking for you to respond to the
      survey for two more weeks. You will receive a total of 112 text messages over four weeks. In
      addition we will send you four emails or texts asking you to complete a survey at the
      following times: before you complete your first set of EMA surveys, at the end of the first
      set EMA surveys, prior to starting the second set of EMA surveys, and a final time after you
      have completed the final EMA survey. This study requires no visits to Washington University.

      In order to participate you must complete this short prescreening survey to see if you
      qualify.
