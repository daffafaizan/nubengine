      I. Determine the objective response rate in patients with refractory metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma treated with AZD2171.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of AZD2171 in these patients. II. Determine the
      feasibility of performing standardized delayed contrast-enhancement-MRI correlative studies
      across different institutions and platforms with data-sharing capability in patients with
      metastatic renal cell cancer.

      III. Generate preliminary data regarding potential utility of pharmacogenomic and
      plasma/serum biomarkers of angiogenesis as predictive or prognostic markers for future
      investigations of AZD2171 and renal cell carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 6 weeks.
