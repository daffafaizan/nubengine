    
      Insomnia is a common complaint or disorder throughout the

      world. About one third of the population in the industrial

      countries reports difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep,

      resulting in a non-refreshing or non-restorative sleep. The

      majority of the insomniacs suffer chronically from their

      complaints.

      The maleic acid salt of Org 4420, code name Org 50081, known as Esmirtazapine, was

      selected for development in the treatment of insomnia. The

      first clinical trial with Esmirtazapine was a proof-of-concept trial

      with a four-way cross-over design. All 3 Esmirtazapine dose

      groups showed a statistically significant positive effect on

      TST (objective and subjective) and WASO, as compared to

      placebo.

      The current study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety

      of Esmirtazapine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel,

      randomized trial in elderly participants suffering from chronic

      primary insomnia.
