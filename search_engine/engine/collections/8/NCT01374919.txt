      without free iron release, was approved for a 510 mg injection to be administered in not less
      than 17 seconds. Although this represents a felicitous treatment for patients who come
      frequently, such as dialysis and chemotherapy patients, multiple publications suggest that
      full dose replacement is usually at the 1000 mg level. No studies extant are available with
      this dosing schedule for ferumoxytol. In this trial, iron deficient patients with hemoglobin
      levels of <11.0 grams per deciliter will be consented to received 1020 mg (two 510 mg vials)
      of ferumoxytol in 15 minutes. Vital signs will be performed at 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.
      Followup phone calls for any clinical adverse events will be made at 24-48 hours and one week
      after administration. At four weeks follow-up hematologic and serologic (iron parameters)
      will be made along with a physician visit.
