      maxillary sinus, which last longer than 12 weeks. Those whose the origin is dental, are well
      described, and yet under-diagnosed most of the time due to a lack of well-defined diagnostic
      criteria and literature. There is controversy in the various studies about their prevalence.
      Their management and in particular the therapeutic sequence, is not the subject of any
      recommendation and involves only a few clinical studies. Their consequences on the patient's
      general health and quality of life are important. The lack of knowledge about them often
      leads to diagnostic errors and therefore to a persistence of symptomatology. Moreover, their
      complications when they are not or incorrectly treated, although rare, can be dramatic
      (occulo-orbital or endo-cranial complications for example).

      Preliminary work in the form of a retrospective study was carried out within of the Centre
      Hospitalier intercommunal de Cr√©teil in 2015. In view of the results the investigators wanted
      to set up a clinical trial with the following objectives measure the prevalence of chronic
      maxillary sinusitis of dental origin and measure the effectiveness of exclusive dental and
      medical treatment, which could avoid surgical intervention under general anaesthesia, at the
      higher morbidity.
