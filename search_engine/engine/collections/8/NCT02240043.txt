    
      subjects over 65 years old were recruited from the geriatric ambulatory unit of our hospital
      to voluntarily participate in a research study concerning the GH and ACTH axis in the
      elderly, which included the realization of the glucagon stimulation test as the first phase
      of the study.

      The GST (GlucagenÂ® Hypokit, Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark) was the chosen test to assess both
      ACTH and GH release because of its few known contraindications and mild side effects. It is a
      provocative test to evaluate GH and ACTH axis, i.e, a diagnostic test, without therapeutic
      effects.
