      of care (SoC) medication to treat their migraine attacks, according to their individual
      prescriptions.

      Period 2: 4-week randomized/controlled period. After the run-in period, subjects are
      randomized (1:1) to receive either an nVNS device or a sham device to treat up to 5 migraine
      attacks.

      Period 3: 4-week open-label (active treatment) period. After the randomized period, subjects
      continue to the open-label period where all subjects receive an active gammaCore device to
      treat up to 5 migraine attacks.
