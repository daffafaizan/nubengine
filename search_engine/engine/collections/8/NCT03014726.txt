      (DCB).

      Up to 50 subjects is planned to be enrolled and treated with the study device at up to 5
      clinical sites outside of US. Due to significantly higher prevalence of strictures in men vs.
      women and the etiology of those strictures being different, the study will focus on male
      subjects with single anterior urethral stricture. Subjects will be followed up post-treatment
      to one year and then annually for up to 5 years. The annual follow up after the first year is
      optional.
