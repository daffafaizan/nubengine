      Definition:

      A MRSA infection was considered to be HA-MRSA by the CDC epidemiologic definitions if, in the
      year prior to culture, the subject had surgery, hospitalization, hemodialysis or a stay in a
      long-term care facility, if an indwelling vascular catheter was in place at the time of
      culture, or if the subject was an inpatient hospitalized for 2 days at the time of culture.
      Otherwise, the subject was considered to have a CA-MRSA infection.
