      diabetic nephropathy and for cardiovascular mortality. Intervention trials have demonstrated
      that drugs that blockade the renin-angiotensin system can reduce microalbuminuria in
      Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria, regardless of blood
      pressure level. However, it remains uncertain whether angiotensin receptor blockers or
      calcium channel blockers give a greater reduction of microalbuminuria. The Shiga
      Microalbuminuria Reduction Trial (SMART) is a prospective, multicentre, randomized,
      active-controlled, two-arm parallel treatment group comparison study aimed at evaluating
      reduction of microalbuminuria in 160 Japanese hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus and microalbuminuria. The trial consists of an 8-week observation period for
      screening and washout, and a 24-week intervention period. After the observation period,
      patients are randomized to either amlodipine 5 mg once daily or valsartan 80 mg once daily as
      an initial dose. After four weeks, if patients cannot achieve the target blood pressure
      (<130/80 mmHg) with the initial dose of a study drug, doses are titrated up to amlodipine 10
      mg once daily or valsartan 160 mg once daily. The primary endpoints are a change in the rate
      of urinary albumin excretion from baseline, a normalization of microalbuminuria, and a 50%
      reduction in urinary albumin excretion from baseline, which are compared between treatment
      groups. This study will provide additional data for the treatment of hypertension and
      microalbuminuria and has important health care implications for Japanese patients with type 2
      diabetes.
