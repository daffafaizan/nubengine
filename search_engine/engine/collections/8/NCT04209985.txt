      receive health coaching or usual care. Participants are English- and Spanish-speaking
      patients from a county-based public health system who have received a positive airway
      pressure device for the treatment of sleep apnea. An unlicensed, trained health coach will
      call patients three times to resolve barriers to adherence. Primary outcomes include both
      adherence measures collected by the device modem at baseline and 4 months, and
      patient-reported outcomes such as daytime sleepiness.
