    
      This Phase 2 study is a 3 arm, open-label pilot study to evaluate:

        -  the analgesic efficacy of a flexible ascending regimen of Q8003 compared to a low dose
           regimen of Q8003 (3 mg/2 mg and potentially up to 6 mg/ 4mg) and to 1-2 PercocetÂ® 5
           mg/325 mg tablets. Study drug will be administered every 4-6 hours over a 48-hour
           Treatment Period to inpatients with moderate to severe postoperative pain who have
           undergone primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty.

        -  for the flexible ascending regimen of Q8003 treatment group, to evaluate the adequacy of
           the algorithm for conversion of IV PCA morphine to oral morphine equivalent doses of
           Q8003.

        -  the safety of the flexible ascending regimen of Q8003 administered over a 48-hour
           Treatment Period.
