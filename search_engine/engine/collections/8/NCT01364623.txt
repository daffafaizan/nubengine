    
      This is a 2 Period study that requires overnight stays in clinic. Blood samples are required
      at all visits including sampling at predefined time periods during the overnight stays.

      Period I

      Subjects were checked-in on Day 1 Period I to start their baseline testosterone measurement
      (dependant on menstrual cycle, preferably within 48hr of start of the menstrual cycle). They
      remained institutionalized until Day 4 morning, and were checked out after the 48 hour blood
      draw and study close-out for those that did not continue with Period II.

      Period II (Multi-Dose)

      At the end of Period 1, a total of 8 subjects sampled from these 3 cohorts, who were willing
      and able to continue with the multiple-dose portion of the study were selected to participate
      in Period 2. Subjects were institutionalized starting on Day 1 of Visit 3 until Day 5 morning
      of Visit 3, and were checked out after the 48 hour blood draw and study close-out.
