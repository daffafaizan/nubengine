      The objective of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between genetic
      mutations, beginning with an analysis of ABCA4, and Plaquenil -induced retinal toxicity and
      to describe the phenotype of Plaquenil -induced retinal toxicity.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      The study will enroll 100 patients, 18 years of age or older, found to have Plaquenil
      -induced retinal toxicity. 200 volunteers with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA), or Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and history of Plaquenil use, but
      without evidence of retinal toxicity, will also be recruited.

      DESIGN:

      The study is an observational study with 1-2 outpatient visits to the NEI clinic or review of
      medical records for off-site participants. All participants will provide a blood sample for
      genetic analysis.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Clinical examination and blood samples will be used for genetic testing and mutation
      identification. The primary outcome of this study is to identify genetic mutations, starting
      with those in ABCA4 gene, associated with retinal toxicity in participants with a history of
      Plaquenil use. Secondary objectives i clude determining the utility of testing metrics in
      evaluating the presence of retinal toxicity.
