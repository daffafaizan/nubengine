      a full procoagulant and anticoagulant profile preoperatively and, at first, second and sixth
      day after surgery. We also measure indocyanine green (ICG) clearance preoperatively and in
      the first two postoperative days. We are also recording clinical data, focusing on medical
      and surgical complications. We aim to establish the potential value of ICG clearance and or
      coagulation profile to predict clinical complications
