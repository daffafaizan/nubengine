      hypertension related variceal bleeding. The precise planning of TIPS, especially individual
      selection of stent diameter, is a hot and difficult topic in the field. A stent with smaller
      diameter cannot effectively reduce portal pressure, and a stent with larger diameter might
      cause hepatic encephalopathy resulted from excessive blood shunt. Therefore, individualized
      selection of TIPS stent diameter closely correlates with intervention effect and clinical
      outcomes. In our previous study, we have successfully developed a non-invasive technology to
      evaluate hepatic venous pressure gradient and portal pressure gradient based on
      three-dimensional modeling and fluid dynamics simulation. In this project, we propose the
      concept of virtual stent-based portal pressure gradient for the first time. Accurate
      three-dimensional models of hepatic-portal vein system with stents of different diameters
      will be reconstructed using imaging control and modeling software. In addition, a standard
      procedure of fluid dynamics simulation will be fixed with the platform of finite element
      calculation. With invasive pressure as reference, the accuracy of virtual stent-based portal
      pressure gradient will be evaluated in levels of animal experiments and clinical trials.
      Lastly, the predictive value of virtual stent-based portal pressure gradient for
      individualized selection of TIPS stent diameter will be further assessed.
