      intraoperatively with 40Âµg alprostadil, a prostaglandin E1 agonist intracorporal injection
      (ICI). The procedure will begin as soon as maximal tumescence is attained.

      In the cavernous sparing group, corporal dilation will be done solely with a size 8 dilator.
      The insertion of the dilator will be carefully inserted in what we call the path of least
      resistance. To determine the path of least resistance, the corporotomy is spread apart by
      pulling on previously set stay sutures. The path of least resistance is the plane with
      maximum outflow of blood from the intraoperatively pharmaceutically dilated and blood filled
      corpora cavernosa. This plane can also be anticipated with a preoperative penile duplex.
