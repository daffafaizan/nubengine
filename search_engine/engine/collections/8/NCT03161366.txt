      contagious, requiring strict isolation measures and with only supportive therapy available
      that has limited impact on case-fatality which remains high (30 -80%).1 Among vaccines in
      development, the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine has given the most promising results in terms of
      efficacy and safety having been evaluated now in more than 10,000 individuals.

      Ring vaccination is a known strategy to control epidemics with specific transmission chains
      and has been successfully implemented to eradicate smallpox. Ring vaccination enhances
      standard public health measures of contact tracing, isolation, and community engagement and
      could be effective when such measures are in place. Building on the interim results of the
      Ebola ça Suffit trial, there is a need for continued access to a vaccine of which available
      results suggest that it is safe and likely efficacious against EVD. Although only isolated
      cases have been reported in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in 2016, 10 the risk of
      resurgence or of continued isolated cases in West Africa remains. Moreover, a new outbreak
      with Ebola Zaïre could start any moment in any of the countries where previous outbreaks
      occurred as in for example Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda.

      However, the unusual design of the ring trial and the decision to abandon the control group
      because of strong evidence that the vaccine prevented disease means there may not be enough
      data to ensure approval from regulatory agencies. Therefore, additional information is still
      required to consolidate knowledge on the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine to support regulatory
      approval and licensure for future access. Additional information is also needed on ring
      vaccination and contextual adaptations to this approach to ensure its feasibility and
      effectiveness in the control of Ebola outbreaks in potentially diverse contexts.
