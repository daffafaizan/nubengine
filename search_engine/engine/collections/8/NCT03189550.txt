      (ERAS). ERAS pathways improve the quality of patient care, reduce morbidity, and shorten
      length of stay. This large quality improvement project will compare outcomes after standard
      perioperative practice with those after the implementation of a multi-modal evidence based
      care pathway, including standardized preoperative preparation, perioperative goal-directed
      fluid therapy (GFDT), multi-modal perioperative pain management, post operative nausea and
      vomiting prevention, surgical care and bowel isolation, and surgical site infection
      prevention. This project will test the hypothesis that implementation of a multi-modal ERAS
      perioperative care protocol in colorectal surgical patients will result in significantly
      reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality.
