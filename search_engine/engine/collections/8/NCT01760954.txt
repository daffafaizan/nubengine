    
      This is a Phase 3 multicenter, double blind randomized study to assess the continued safety
      and efficacy of the 150 mg once daily (QD) and 200 mg twice daily (BID) doses of elagolix in
      premenopausal women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain who completed the 6
      month treatment period in the pivotal study M12-665 (NCT01620528). The study consists of 2
      periods: a 6 month Treatment Period and a post treatment follow-up period of up to 12 months.

      Participants who received elagolix in the pivotal study who met all entry criteria continued
      to receive the same dose, either elagolix 150 mg QD or elagolix 200 mg BID for up to an
      additional 6 months in this extension study; participants who received placebo in the pivotal
      study were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either elagolix 150 mg QD or elagolix 200 mg
      BID for up to 6 months.

      An electronic diary will be used to collect endometriosis-associated pain, uterine bleeding,
      and analgesic medication use for endometriosis associated pain on a daily basis.

      All participants who prematurely discontinued treatment (unless pregnant or elected surgery
      for endometriosis) or completed the 6-month Treatment Period in this extension study were to
      enter the Post-treatment Follow-up (PTFU) Period within this study for up to 12 months.
