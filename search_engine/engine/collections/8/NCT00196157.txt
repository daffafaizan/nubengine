      atrial fibrillation: a more anatomically guided linear ablation scheme with encircling of the
      ipsilateral pulmonary veins (PV), a left atrial roof line and an anterior line bridging the
      anterior mitral anulus to the ostium of the left superior PV versus an electrophysiological
      guided focal ablation strategy aiming at isolating, electrically, the PV and ablating areas
      of fragmented intracardiac electrograms thought to maintain atrial fibrillation.

      Both ablation approaches contain isolation of the most common source of triggering foci,
      i.e., the pulmonary veins and additional modification of the substrate maintaining atrial
      fibrillation.

      The study endpoint is a combined efficacy/safety analysis. Extensive follow-up with
      three-monthly 7 days holter ECG is provided.
