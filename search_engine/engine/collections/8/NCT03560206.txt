      reached epidemic proportions. Despite advances in the medical treatment of HF, patients with
      HF face frequent hospitalizations for acute exacerbations. Inadequate self-care strategies,
      in particular non-adherence to a sodium restricted diet (SRD), is a main cause of these
      rehospitalizations. Prior interventions to increase adherence have focused on increasing
      knowledge about restricting sodium in the diet have met with limited success. Unaddressed by
      these interventions are the major barriers of measuring and tracking daily sodium intake,
      family members who continue to eat high sodium diets, and a preference for salty
      foods-particularly in the elderly who have a decreased sense of taste. It is possible to
      retrain the taste buds to enjoy low salt foods by gradually reducing the amount of sodium in
      foods over the course of 16 weeks. This retraining works best with direct involvement and
      support from family members. The Family Sodium Watcher Program (Family SWaP) proposed in this
      study incorporates the use of a unique electronic salt monitoring device that easily measures
      salt content in food-the major source of sodium. The intervention is designed to improve
      adherence to a SRD by both patients and family caregivers through education and strategies
      for gradual taste adaptation to low salt foods.
