      months and in immunocompromised patients. However, Nitazoxanide, the only drug approved for
      treatment of Cryptosporidiosis, showed little-to-no efficacy in HIV positive patients and low
      efficacy in malnourished children.

      Recently, Love MS et al reported that Clofazimine inhibited proliferation of both
      Cryptosporidium parvum and C. hominis in vitro and reduced shedding in a mouse model of acute
      C. parvum infection. Clofazimine has been approved for treatment of leprosy for decades and
      more recently for the treatment of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Safety and
      pharmacokinetics of Clofazimine are well documented for a variety of patient populations, but
      not for HIV positive patients or patients with diarrhea. Thus, this clinical trial seeks to
      determine the efficacy of 50 or 100 mg of Clofazimine administered 3 times daily for 5 days
      on fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium oocysts in HIV positive patients, as well as safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in this patient population.
