      neoformans. In high-income countries, the use of amphotericin B in combination with a more
      expensive drug, flucytosine, is most effective for the management of cryptococcal meningitis;
      but access to flucytosine is severely limited in middle and low-income countries. In Myanmar,
      currently recommended regimen for cryptococcal meningitis are combination of amphotericin B
      with fluconazole. Although amphotericin plus flucytosine followed by fluconazole therapy is
      the currently preferred regimen in WHO treatment guidelines, it is not still commonly used in
      Myanmar clinical practice because of its limited availability. Therefore, the data regarding
      tolerability and clinical effectiveness of flucytosine are unavailable for Myanmar patients.

      Although trials were carried out for investigating the effectiveness of flucytosine in the
      HIV population of Africa, the variability in drug response can occur in Myanmar patients due
      to the racial and genetic differences and whether it is effective and safe for Myanmar people
      is a great curiosity question for clinicians and healthcare workers. In Myanmar, amphotericin
      plus flucytosine followed by fluconazole regimen will be supplied by National AIDS Program
      (NAP) and indicated in 2020. Thus, the documents for effectiveness and safety profile need to
      be established. This is the reason that the effectiveness and safety of amphotericin B with
      flucytosine and fluconazole combination therapy should be studied. From this study, it can
      provide information to physicians regarding the effectiveness as well as safety of those
      drugs in the management of cryptococcal meningitis in HIV patients.
