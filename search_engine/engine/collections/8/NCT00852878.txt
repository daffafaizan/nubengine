      of children in the United States. This population tends to be heavy medical users in a search
      of a treatment for the chronic pain, but at this time there is no standard treatment
      protocol. The literature proposes that there are two effective treatments for RAP, a
      relaxation protocol by Sanders et al. (1994) and a biofeedback protocol currently in use at
      Kaiser, but neither treatment has been widely accepted as standard treatment. A purpose of
      this study is to gather more data on both treatments to help move one or both treatments into
      the standard of care for RAP. The hypothesis of this study is that the biofeedback and the
      relaxation protocols will have equivalent treatment outcomes.
