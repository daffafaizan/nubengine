      suggests that African-American women have worse cosmetic outcomes with hypofractionated
      irradiation than with conventional breast conservation. A growing body of data also suggests
      that African-American women have diminished oncologic outcomes when compared to Caucasian
      women in the United States. Further evaluation is needed to better understand the reason for
      these discrepancies.
