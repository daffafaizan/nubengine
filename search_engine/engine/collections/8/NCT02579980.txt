      approaches that are being utilized in preclinical evaluation as well as clinical trials.
      DW-MRI is a technique for quantifying the increase in water diffusion caused by cellular
      necrosis or apoptosis in tumors within days of therapy. DCE-MRI is frequently used in
      preclinical and early clinical trial assessment of anti-angiogenic and vascular disrupting
      compounds, also within hours of therapeutic intervention. Evidence of drug efficacy and
      dose-dependent response has been demonstrated with certain angiogenesis inhibitors. It may
      also provide useful information for identifying early disease progression, independent of the
      treatment modality. While these approaches provide additional functional information, they
      have yet to be validated in sarcoma patients. This study seeks to develop a standardized
      protocol for performing DCE-MRI and DW-MRI and implement this in a clinical trial of patients
      with sarcomas who will have surgical resection as part of their standard care. This will
      allow the accuracy of in vivo MRI measurements to be directly compared to histology as ground
      truth. The study will also determine the reproducibility of these techniques using repeat
      baseline imaging as well as evaluate the quantitative changes in these parameters before and
      after therapy and correlate with histopathology. The collaboration between Columbia
      University and the University of Utah for this project will allow the existing quantitative
      MRI approaches to be expanded to a multi-center setting, and will establish a paradigm
      infrastructure for future expansion to larger scale multi-center therapeutic trials in
      sarcoma.
