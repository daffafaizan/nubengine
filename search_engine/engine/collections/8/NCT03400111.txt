      orthodontic treatment is probably unique in the literature.

      The study will cover the different stages of orthodontic treatment from A to Z. In other
      words, patients will be followed up till the end of treatment at which fixed appliances are
      removed. Pain control will be accomplished in one arm using LLLT and in another arm by
      prescribing Panadol ExtraÂ®. A third group will be left without any medication or laser
      irradiation to serve as a control group.
