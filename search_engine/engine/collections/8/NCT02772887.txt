      morbidity and mortality. The underlying cause of preeclampsia is unknown, however several
      pre-existing maternal conditions are associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia
      including: diabetes, hypertension, renal dysfunction, obesity and history of preeclampsia.
      Specifically, the risk of preeclampsia is five times greater in women with diabetes.

      Several lines of evidence indicate that endothelial dysfunction is a central feature of the
      pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a methylated
      metabolite of the amino acid L-arginine and an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase
      (NOS). High concentrations of ADMA contribute to endothelial dysfunction and ADMA inhibits
      angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, activities important in pregnancy and deficient in
      preeclampsia. ADMA concentrations are higher early in pregnancy among women who later develop
      preeclampsia. This protocol describes a randomized placebo-controlled trial of L-citrulline
      in 40 pregnant women with type 2 diabetes from approximately sixteen to nineteen weeks
      gestation, to determine whether L-citrulline supplementation increases the plasma
      L-arginine/ADMA ratio, lowers maternal blood pressure and increases a circulating marker of
      placental function (placental growth factor PLGF).
