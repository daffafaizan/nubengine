      osteoarthritis (OA). Pain management has been one of the main focuses of postoperative care.
      Most surgeons prefer a comprehensive multimodal approach including preoperative
      pharmacological treatment, intraoperative infiltration with complex drug mixes and
      postoperative peripheral nerve block.

      The most common postoperative nerve block alternative is the proximal femoral nerve block
      (FNB) which has shown improvements on postoperative pain measured by reduced opioid
      consumption and decreased pain at rest. Its main detractors argue that the motor nerve block
      effect is deleterious to early ambulation and have promoted adductor canal nerve blocks
      (ACB). Described by Lund et al in 2011, ACB block main femoral pain sensory contributors to
      the knee (articular branches of obturator nerve, vastus medialis branch and saphenous nerve)
      but is more distal to most motor branches to the quadriceps allowing near to normal
      quadriceps strength.

      Standard ACB block is performed under ultrasound guidance after surgery completion, still in
      the operating room (OR). Recent literature has shown the anatomic feasibility of
      intraoperative ACB via blunt suprapatellar dissection in standard medial parapatellar TKA
      approaches. The study seeks to determine the effectiveness of standard ultrasound guidance
      ACB compared with intraoperative ACB.
