      predominantly African-American community via a partnership with the Detroit Area Agency on
      Aging (DAAA), the Detroit Medical Center (DMC), and University of Michigan School of Public
      Health's Center for Managing Chronic Disease (CMCD). The specific aims of the research are
      to: (1) adapt existing program materials to be appropriate for the new target population,
      getting feedback from various sources including focus group interviews; (2) conduct a pilot
      study of the adapted "Take Heart" program; (3) refine the intervention and conduct a
      randomized trial with 376 participants age 50 years and over, to assess health outcomes; (4)
      assess the translation and implementation of the intervention in the target setting and
      identify factors that help and hinder the process; (5) assess cost savings associated with
      the intervention; and (6) develop guidelines for "scaling up", that is, for replicating the
      program in other low-income areas through the national network of Area Agencies on Aging.
