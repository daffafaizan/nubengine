      The objectives of the present pilot study are to assess 1) the benefits and safety of
      abciximab i.c. or i.v. compared to placebo in rescue PCI and trans-radial approach, 2) the
      relationship between platelet aggregation inhibition and perfusion scores and to demonstrate
      3) better perfusion scores with i.c. abciximab as compared to i.v. abciximab or placebo.

      The Primary ANGIOGRAPHIC end-point will be the TIMI score and myocardial blush grade after
      rescue-PCI at baseline and at 6-months follow-up.

      The Secondary CLINICAL end-point will be:

        -  the composite of death, stroke, repeat-myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel
           revascularization and major bleedings at 30 days after rescue PCI.

        -  composite of death, repeat-myocardial infarction, repeat target vessel revascularization
           at 6 months following rescue PCI.

      The Secondary PLATELETS end-point will be the proportion of patients with platelet
      aggregation inhibition ≥ 95% and mean platelet aggregation inhibition 10 minutes post-bolus
      administration.

      The Secondary ANGIOGRAPHIC end-points will be the angiographic late loss and the restenosis
      rate (Diameter stenosis ≥ 50%) in the culprit artery.

      Other exploratory end-points include the feasibility and safety of early transfer to the
      referring hospital after uncomplicated primary PCI, cardiac MRI measurements and PAI 6 hr
      after bolus administration.
