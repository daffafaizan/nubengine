      women will be recruited based primarily on blood pressure criteria in the Quebec City
      metropolitan area through the media (newspaper, radio) and mailing lists (n=60).

      Participants will be randomized to 3 experimental diets of 6 weeks each: 1- CONTROL
      dairy-free diet, 2- low fat dairy (MILK, 1% fat, 3 servings/d), 3- high-fat dairy (GABA-rich
      cheddar cheese, approximately 32% fat, 1 serving (50g)/d). Usual energy intake will be
      estimated at the beginning of the study using validated tools. Experimental diets will be
      provided as part of a full feeding protocol under carefully controlled isocaloric conditions
      to maintain body weight constant. All meals and foods will be provided to participants so
      that control for energy and macronutrient intake will be optimized. The breakfast meal will
      represent approximately 30% of the daily energy intake whereas the lunch and dinner meals
      each will provide 35% of daily energy intake. Participants will be instructed to consume
      their entire meals. A seven-day cyclic menu will be used. We have opted to test the impact of
      dairy intake over a 6-week period (as opposed to 4 or 5 weeks) to maximize the chance to
      observe clinically meaningful changes in blood pressure. Diets will be separated by a 4 to 8
      week washout period. Randomization will be stratified by sex. Blood samples will be collected
      the day before each dietary phase and on 2 consecutive days after each dietary phase. The
      mean of the 2 consecutive measurements will be used in the analyses.
