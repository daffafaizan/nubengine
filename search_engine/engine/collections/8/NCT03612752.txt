      screening, 8 weeks-blinded supplementation period and 2 weeks post-supplementation period.
      During the 8 weeks period, subjects will take either 2 study tablets of CMI-168 or 2 tablets
      of matching placebo once daily in the morning. Supplementation will be stopped after 56 days
      and after another 14 days, subjects will be re-assessed.

      Key assessment of the screening period will be the cognitive testing using the Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) to ensure that the subjects fall within
      the normal cognitive range for their ages. The study aims to only include subjects with
      normal cognition and showing no perceptible signs of cognitive impairment at screening (Visit
      1). Subjects showing cognition abnormal cognition scores during the screening stage by the
      CANTAB assessment will not be included in the next stages of the study. After a screening
      period of 3 to 28 days, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 ratio to two treatment arms.

        -  CMI-168 (2 tablet, once daily, 56 days).

        -  Placebo (2 tablets once daily, 56 days)

      Following randomisation,the various assessments including cognitive tests, questionnaires,
      event related potential and blood samples will be administered or taken at Visit 2 (Baseline,
      start of supplementation), Visit 3 (Day 28 supplementation) and Visit 4 (Day 56
      supplementation) and Visit 5 (Day 70-2 weeks after termination of supplementation). Subject
      completion of the study will be defined as completing the assessments at Visit 5. The
      different tests will be administered according to the schedule of assessments below.
