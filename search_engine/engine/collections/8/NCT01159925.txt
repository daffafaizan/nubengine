      Panama. Hospitals are selected based on population density or hepatitis A disease burden.

      The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) definition for a possible case of acute hepatitis
      A are used for subjects aged between >1 month and <15 years.

      Data regarding clinical and epidemiologic information are collected and serum samples are
      collected to test hepatitis A markers and determine if infection with hepatitis A virus has
      recently occurred.

      Surveillance will be for a period of approximately 2.5 years from the date of study
      initiation.
