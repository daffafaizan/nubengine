      who suffer from a fall that leads to a trauma and fracture often loose functional capacity.
      They may have prolonged mobility problems and are at risk for long-term care or nursing home
      institutionalization. To date, measures to prevent such negative outcomes are early
      mobilization and functional physical or occupational therapy immediately following orthopedic
      surgery. In addition, patients usually are asked to train at home after hospital discharge.
      This can be achieved by a home training program or by ambulatory physical therapy. Recent
      technological development has introduced computerized training and gaming platforms into
      geriatric rehabilitation settings and home exercise training. Games that have been developed
      for a younger population have now been adapted to the needs of older persons. A recent
      systematic review has demonstrated that such platforms. for example Wii significantly improve
      balance and therefore have the potential to prevent falls]. However to date such platforms
      have not been evaluated in a defined geriatric hospital patient population (e.g. after a hip
      fracture) as an adjunct to in-hospital physical therapy. Thus, such platforms could be
      offered as an additional training opportunity.
