      We propose to investigate the correlation between the traditional TST-based method of
      screening for latent tuberculosis infection in specific immunocompromised populations as
      recommended by Canadian and American standards: the T-SPOT TB ELISPOT test: and an expert
      tuberculosis physician panel incorporating the Mantoux test, a risk factor survey, and a
      chest radiograph.

      Secondary Study Question:

      In a subset of patients who have tested positive on both the Mantoux and T-SPOT ELISPOT tests
      prior to undergoing additional immune suppression i.e., patients pre-bone marrow transplant
      and rheumatology patients pre-receipt of anti-TNF alpha therapy or high dose corticosteroids,
      we propose to repeat the T-SPOT ELISPOT and Mantoux after immune suppression to assess the
      development of cutaneous anergy.
