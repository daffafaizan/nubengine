      Headache (CH) seizures. Patients will be offered Holter ECG to study the temporal
      relationships between changes in Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity during Headache (CH)
      seizures and changes in Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity before and after seizure
      treatment, using heart rate variability measurement.

      The hypothesis is that there would be an initial temporary sympathetic activation, followed
      quickly by parasympathetic hyperactivation and a return to a state of equilibrium.
