3176. studies of trace metal metabolism  electron paramagnetic resonance ofmanganese in ribonucleic acidsthe electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum pattern of manganese wasreadily detected in all of the samples of rna.  the resonance patternsindicate that manganese is present in rna in a divalent state and suggestthat manganese is located at the center of a distorted octahedron of oxygenatoms.  from the intensity of nominally forbidden resonances, the crystalfield splitting parameter d was estimated to be 0.02 cm -1.
