    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, designed to assess the therapeutic
      efficacy and toxicity of the combination chemotherapy with pembrolizumab in recurrent,
      platinum resistant OC patients. The main objective is to test whether the therapeutic
      intervention benefits the patients evaluating the increase in overall survival with respect
      to chemotherapy alone.

      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive:

      ARM A:

      Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq iv q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq d 1,8,15 q 28
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq d 1,8 q 21 At physician' discretion or

      ARM B:

      Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq iv q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq d 1,8,15 q 28
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq d 1,8 q 21 plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg d1 q 21 iv infusion in 30 minutes
      In both arms patients will receive treatments until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity of patient's refusal. Patients will receive at least 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy
      at physician's discretion. In the experimental arm patients who stop chemotherapy for
      toxicity reasons and whose disease is at least in stabilization, may continue treatment with
      Pembrolizumab as single agent.

      Patients will be stratified according to the number of previous chemotherapy lines (1 vs >1)
      and measurable/evaluable disease.
