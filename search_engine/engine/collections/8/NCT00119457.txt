      determine the safety and antithrombotic efficacy of TTP889 in patients at risk for venous
      thromboembolism (VTE). The study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group
      evaluation of 300 mg TTP889 or placebo, administered orally once daily for three weeks, in
      patients who have undergone surgery to repair unilateral fracture of the upper third of
      either femur and who have completed 5 to 9 days of postoperative prophylactic treatment for
      VTE.
