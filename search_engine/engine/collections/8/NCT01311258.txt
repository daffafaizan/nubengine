      a remission that is defined by the lack of any evidence of the disease when viewing bone
      marrow samples under a microscope. Despite the absence of disease by this method, many
      patients in remission will still have what is referred to as Minimal Residual Disease when
      more sensitive methods are applied. The presence of Minimal Residual Disease following
      therapy does not guarantee that the patient will experience a relapse. This is likely a
      result of the failure of these techniques to examine those cells that are responsible for
      disease relapse. Recent data suggests that in the majority of patients with AML or MDS only a
      minor population of the malignant cells are capable of maintaining the disease and are likely
      responsible for relapse following therapy. This minor population of cells can be identified
      by the proteins they have on their surface. This study tests the ability to identify Minimal
      Residual Disease following therapy by performing special assays that specifically target this
      minor population of malignant cells.
