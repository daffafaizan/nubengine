    
      Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is a novel, high resolution intravascular imaging
      modality. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a widely used conventional imaging modality for
      achieving optimal stent deployment.

      This study is the sub-study of OPINION Trial. (UMIN000010580) The aim of this study is to
      evaluate how OFDI or IVUS imaging technology influence to the Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention (PCI) strategy.

      We will enroll the first 100 patients who have enrolled in the main-study of OPINION
      trial.(UMIN000010580). We will assess lesions by the other device in addition to the assigned
      device in the main study at the time of post-PCI.

      We will then assess lesions by OFDI at a 8-month follo-up.
