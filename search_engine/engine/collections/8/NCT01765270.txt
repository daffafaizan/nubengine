    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the
      effect of saxagliptin on cardiac biomarkers of myocardial necrosis, cardiac function,
      inflammation, and apoptosis in subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing CABG
      surgery (on pump, via a median sternotomy approach) as an integrated measure of the potential
      mechanistic effects of saxagliptin on prevention of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes.
      Approximately 74 subjects will be randomized and complete the study.
