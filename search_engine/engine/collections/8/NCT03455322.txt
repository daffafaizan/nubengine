    
      Both sexes aged 18 years or older having cirrhosis, ascites, and a diagnosis of HRS-AKI based
      on the 2015 International Club of Ascites (ICA) diagnostic criteria [2] were eligible for
      participation.

      Screening and eligibility criteria were verified upon admission to the ICU. A diagnosis of
      AKI was established through comparing sCr value at time of ICU admission to that recorded in
      the patient's file. Patients who meet all other diagnostic criteria of HRS-AKI provided by
      the previous definition [2] were enrolled in the study. Qualified patients were subjected to
      baseline assessments after informed consent signature. It included vital sign measurements,
      presence of comorbidities, height and weight, Child-Pugh score and Sequential Organ Failure
      Assessment (SOFA) score. Vital signs, Blood urea nitrogen, sCr, serum sodium, serum albumin,
      total bilirubin, and complete blood count with differential were measured at baseline and at
      daily basis throughout the study period. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either continuous infusion of norepinephrine in an initial dose of 0.5mg/h (Maximum 3 mg/h or
      oral midodrine 5mg three times/day (Maximum 12.5mg three times/day) plus octreotide 100μg/6h
      as subcutaneous injection (Maximum 200 μg/6h). Duration of treatment was allowed to extend to
      a maximum of 10 days. Administration of albumin at doses of 20 to 40 gm/day was recommended,
      as clinically indicated, for all patients in both study arms as per current ICA guidelines.
