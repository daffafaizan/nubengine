      treatment outcomes, increased treatment-related complications and altered quality of life.
      Epoetin alfa administered on a weekly dosing schedule of 40,000 Units subcutaneously ([SC],
      under the skin) with dose adjustments based on hematologic response produces significant
      improvement in hemoglobin levels, decreased transfusion frequency and improved quality of
      life. It is unknown if the recently developed agent, darbepoetin alfa, administered on an
      every other week fixed dose will produce similar improvements in hematologic and quality of
      life outcomes. Thus, further randomization studies are warranted utilizing once weekly dosing
      (QW) of Epoetin alfa compared to once every other week (Q2W) darbepoetin alfa. Patients will
      receive study medications for up to 16 weeks.Safety & efficacy evaluations will be performed
      at specified intervals throughout the study.The study hypothesis is that the Week 5
      hemoglobin response rate in the Epoetin alfa group is better than that in the Darbepoetin
      alfa group. The starting dose for study drug is either Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT) 40,000 Units SC
      QW or Darbepoetin alfa (ARANESP) 200 mcg SC Q2W. Doses may be adjusted depending on the
      patient's hemoglobin levels up a maximum of 60,000 IU SC QW Epoetin alfa or 300 mcg SC Q2W
      Darbepoetin alfa.
