2933. the essential fatty acid requirement of infants and theassessment of their dietary intake of linoleate by serumfatty acid analysisthe content of polyunsaturated fatty acidsin serum total fatty acids was relatedto the dietary intake of linoleate in 243 infantstwo to four months of age and in 197infants eleven to twelve months of age.  thecurves relating triene tetraene ratioto dietary linoleate indicated approximately1 per cent of total calories as minimallinoleate requirement.  the exponentialequations relating dienoic, trienoic andtetraenoic acids to dietary linoleate werederived by computer methods.  theseyielded constants from which the minimalnutrient requirement could be calculated.the best estimates were obtained from thetriene and tetraene data for two to fourmonths' old infants and were found to beapproximately 1.4 per cent of the caloricintake.  the nutritive status with respect tolinoleate may be estimated by meansof logarithmic regression equations.  theequation for two to four months' old infantsis  log 10 dietary linoleate = -1.087 + 0.0432(di - tri + tetra).  the data for eleven totwelve months' old infants were found to havegreater scatter and give lower trienetetraene ratios at comparable linoleate intakes.the scatter and displacement areconsidered to be due to supplements of solid foodto the basic diet not considered inthe calculated dietary linoleate.
