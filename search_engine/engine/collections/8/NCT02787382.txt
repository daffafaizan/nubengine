      Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions of the heart commonly due to viral
      or autoimmune etiologies. Human CMV represents one of the leading causes of congenital
      infections worldwide. There is limited data regarding the cardiac function of fetuses and
      infants with CMV.

      OBJECTIVE

      To provide insight regarding the presence of myocardial involvement in fetuses and infants
      with CMV infection.

      PATIENTS & METHODS

      Up to 100 fetuses with suspected CMV infection will be enrolled during a 3 years period.
      Patients will undergo detailed US examinations including dedicated neurosonography and
      echocardiography starting at the time of the first referral and every 3-4 weeks until
      delivery and at the 2-7th day birth. Cardiac scans of fifty pregnant women and the healthy
      women from the group will serve as controls

      EXPECTED RESULTS

      Subtle myocardial deformation abnormalities are expected to be commonly found in fetuses and
      infants with CMV infection.

      CONCLUSIONS

      The findings of this present study will underscore the need for cardiac screening of fetuses
      and infants with congenital CMV infection, with long-term follow-up to document the natural
      history and disease burden of CMV in this population.
