      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) according to existing guidelines. However,
      thrombosis and restenosis are still the main limitations of current permanent metallic
      stents. In contrast to Bare Metal Stents (BMSs), Drug Eluting Stents (DESs) have a reduced
      restenosis rate due to the presence of antiproliferative agents in the coating layer of the
      stent surface and reduced rate of repeat revascularisation. However, late and very late stent
      thrombosis remains the limitation of DES in spite of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy.
      Bioabsorbable scaffolds have been introduced to overcome limitations of permanent metallic
      stents.

      The aim of this observational prospective study is to investigate the clinical performance
      and long-term safety of scaffold in a real world regional setting.

      The investigators agreed in the following preferential/optimal indications:

        -  complete revascularization in patients with age <65 years

        -  revascularization of long lesions (>24 mm), especially located in left anterior
           descending

        -  spontaneous coronary dissection

      The investigators agreed in the following strategy implantation:

        -  mandatory predilatation

        -  sizing 1:1

        -  to avoid vessel with reference vessel diameter <2.8 mm and >3.8 mm

        -  to avoid vessel with severe calcifications

        -  mandatory postdilation with non compliant balloon â‰¥0.5 the scaffold diameter

      The study organization is based on:

      DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB) All adverse events will be reported to the DSMB and
      reviewed on an on-going basis throughout the subject enrolment and follow-up period to ensure
      the safety of subjects enrolled in this study. The DSMB may request additional information as
      needed.

      CORE LABORATORY ANALYSIS All coronary artery angiographies and percutaneous coronary
      interventions will be reviewed by an indipendent core-lab. The core-lab will perform
      quantitative coronary analysis and assessment of the agreement between implantation technique
      in each case and established criteria
