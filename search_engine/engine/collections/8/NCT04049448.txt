    
      This Phase 2a open-label study aims at investigating the long-term safety and efficacy of an
      oral dose of ABX464 in patients who have been previously enrolled in the ABX464-301 clinical
      study and who are willing to continue their treatment.

      All patients will receive ABX464 given at 50mg o.d. irrespectively of their previous
      treatment received in the ABX464-301 study (i.e. ABX464 or Placebo).

      The enrolment in this follow-up study will be based on the willingness of the subject to
      carry on his/her participation and also based on investigator's judgement.

      Patients will be treated with ABX464 for a period of 52 weeks. If they achieve a clinical
      response on Week 52 (defined as DAS28-CRP ≤ 2,6 for anti-TNFα naïve patients or DAS-28-CRP ≤
      3,2 for patients previously treated by anti-TNFα), they will be eligible to continue
      treatment for up to 104 weeks.Patients will be followed up at week , week 2 and then, on a
      monthly basis the first year (up to W52), and quaterly the second year (up to W104).
