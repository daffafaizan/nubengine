      removal of blood samples at designated time points(total blood removed 48 cc per patient).
      Hemodynamic, fluid infusion and agitation/pain data (RAMSEY Score) will prospectively be
      collected for research purposes. We will collect data from a convenience sample of patients
      (when research staff is available) over a one year period.
