      the study is data collection for index development. This will be done in two phases: the
      first phase allows for determination of predictor variables that establish the COVID-19
      Decompensation Index (CDI) and the second phase establishes performance of the CDI. A
      participant is considered to have completed the study if he or she completes all phases of
      the study including the last day of monitoring (day 28).
