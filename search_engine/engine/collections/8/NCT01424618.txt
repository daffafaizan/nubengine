      for implantation in egg donor cycles. The protocol used most commonly is as follows:
      Initially the individual's own pituitary-ovarian system is suppressed using a GnRH agonist so
      there are not conflicting signals sent to the uterus. This is followed by hormonal medication
      identical to what is secreted by the ovaries to prepare the uterine lining for subsequent
      embryo transfer in donor egg cycles.This preparation typically takes a minimum of four weeks.

      This study will compare a different medication, a GnRh antagonist (which is commonly used in
      IVF) to suppress an individual's system during the preparation of the uterine lining. This
      protocol would generally take only two weeks to prepare the uterine lining.
