      patients with locally advanced squamous cancer of the head and neck. CF chemotherapy has been
      reported to increase survival and disease free survival in patients with unresectable disease
      when given before definitive radiotherapy, showing overall response rate as 75-85% including
      of CR rate of 25-35%. To improvement of treatment, docetaxel was incorporated into CF as
      induction treatment and it showed the prolongation of progression free survival and overall
      survival in large scale of randomized phase III trials, therefore triple combination
      induction regimen would be standard treatment in advanced head and neck cancer. Recently, the
      introduction of oral fluoropyrimidine showed similar or enhanced response rate, also
      favorable safety and convenience than intravenous fluoropyrimidine in advanced gastric
      cancer. Of the oral fluoropyrimidines, S-1 showed promising preliminary result in combination
      chemotherapy with cisplatin in head and neck cancer. In patients with advanced gastric
      cancer, phase I study of S-1, docetaxel and cisplatin combination chemotherapy was reported
      and the recommended doses were 40mg/m2 bid, 60mg/m2 (D1) and 60mg/m2 (D1), respectively.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel,
      cisplatin and S-1 combination chemotherapy according to above dosage.
