      recommendations. Patient will be included in the study as soon as the diagnosis of TMA is
      performed.

      From day 1 to day 3, specific blood tests will be performed (serum troponin Ic and brain
      natriuretic peptide [BNP]). A cardiac ultrasonography within the 4 first days and a cerebral
      MRI within the first 7 days after TMA diagnosis will be performed.

      Our hypothesis is that an increased serum troponin Ic level on diagnosis (> 0.2 ng/ml) is a
      predictive feature of cardiac events or worsening at the acute phase.

      At 6 months, a control cardiac ultrasonography and cerebral MRI will be performed in patients
      with cardiac and/or cerebral involvement on diagnosis.

      122 patients are expected to be included among 30 recruiting centres in France. The total
      duration of inclusions is 2.5 years, and the total duration of the study is of 3 years.
