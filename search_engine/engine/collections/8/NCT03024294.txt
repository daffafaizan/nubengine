      post-operative care for patients who undergo a VATS lobectomy or segmentectomy performed by
      one of the surgeons in The Division of Thoracic Surgery. This study will be conducted in two
      phases. Phase 1 will be focused on early feasibility of the SOP and this will be done by
      enrolling 50 participants among the subgroup of Thoracic VATS Surgeons who participate. An
      analysis will take place upon the completion of the phase 1 to look at the percentage of
      participants who were able to be discharged on or prior to POD 3. Upon this analysis,
      modifications across all areas of the care pathway will be evaluated and altered if deemed
      necessary by the PI and other members of the study team. This analysis will drive any
      modifications needed that will be incorporated into the phase II design prior to its
      implementation. The treating Thoracic Surgeon for each patient will follow the SOP as it is
      outlined and the steps the post-operative team will follow will be dependent on which phase
      the participant is enrolled too. Data will be collected for each participant starting just
      prior to the VATS operation and continue through the discharge and conclude once the
      participants have reached their 90-day post-discharge date. Upon discharge from the hospital
      the participant will enter the follow-up period of the study.
