      and a range of problems that impair functioning and reduce mission readiness. However, nearly
      all current military suicide prevention programming focuses on a narrow range of approaches
      for individuals already at high-risk (e.g., training to detect warning signs and refer for
      treatment services). This project addresses the need for universal prevention approaches to
      proactively strengthen protective factors across military populations, including
      strengthening social connectedness and skills to grow and sustain relationships across
      service.

      The aims of this project are to (a) develop an intervention for early-career, enlisted United
      States Air Force personnel using an active training approach to strengthening social bonds,
      and (b) test the intervention (i.e., Wingman-Connect) using a randomized controlled trial
      design.

      Wingman-Connect focuses on Airman-in-Training to build protective factors in: Kinship
      (healthy bonds); Guidance (support from mentors and mental health); Purpose (goals, sense of
      being valued and valuable); and Balance (self-care and support). Half of the training is
      focused on the class as a group to build belonging and shared purpose.
