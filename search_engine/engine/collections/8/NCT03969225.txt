    
      Haemodialysis is the most common treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease
      worldwide and can only be provided via a functional vascular access. Patients, caregivers and
      health professionals consider vascular access function one of the most critically important
      outcomes in haemodialysis but trial-based evidence to improve vascular access function is
      limited by the inconsistent and selective reporting of this outcome. Reporting of a
      standardised outcome measure for vascular access function across all trials in haemodialysis
      will enhance the consistency and relevance of trial evidence to guide patient-centred care.
      Based on international contribution of all relevant stakeholders including patients, the need
      of interventions to enable and maintain the use of a vascular access for haemodialysis was
      considered a simple, pragmatic, and meaningful measure of vascular access function. To ensure
      global implementation across all trial in haemodialysis, it needs to be feasible to
      accurately collect this outcome measure as part of routine clinical practice without
      requiring additional resources or expertise in vascular access.

      VALID is a prospective, multi-centre, multinational validation study to assess the accuracy
      and feasibility of measuring vascular access function, defined by the need for interventions
      to enable and maintain the use of a vascular access for haemodialysis by clinical staff as
      part of their routing clinical practice and across different clinical settings.

      The primary objective of the VALID study is to determine whether vascular access function can
      be measured accurately by clinical staff as part of routine clinical practice compared to the
      reference standard of a research team with expertise in vascular access during a 6-month
      follow-up period.

      An estimated 612 participants will be recruited from approximately 10 dialysis units of
      difference size, type (home-, in-centre and satellite), governance (private versus public),
      and location (rural versus urban) across Australia, Canada, China, France, United Kingdom,
      Netherlands, Malaysia and the United States of America (USA).

      Implementation of a validated outcome measure for vascular access function across clinical
      trials will improve the reliability, comparability and relevance of future research in
      haemodialysis to inform patient-centred care.
