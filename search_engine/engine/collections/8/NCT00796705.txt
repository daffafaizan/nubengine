      Arthritis (RA) therapeutics with biologically-derived immunomodulating compounds. Tumor
      Necrosis Factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors constitute the largest class of these new biologic
      therapies. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of switching to an
      alternative TNF-alpha inhibitor in comparison to continuing treatment with an existing
      TNF-alpha inhibitor in adults suffering from RA who have had inadequate clinical response to
      the study drugs etanercept and adalimumab.

      This study will last approximately 16 weeks. Participants will be randomized into two arms
      and receive injections once per week for 12 weeks. Participants in the adalimumab arm will
      receive alternating subcutaneous adalimumab and adalimumab placebo injections. Participants
      in the etanercept arm will receive subcutaneous etanercept injections.

      This study consists of thirteen study visits after randomization. Study visits will occur on
      a weekly basis for 12 weeks prior to a follow-up visit at Week 16. A vital signs measurement
      and adverse event assessment will occur at each visit. A physical exam, assessment of tender
      and swollen joints, medication assessment, and blood collection will occur at Weeks 4, 8, 12,
      and 16.
