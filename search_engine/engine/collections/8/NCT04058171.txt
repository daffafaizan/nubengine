      of intermittent claudication is that pathologies associated with vascular or neurogenic
      claudication can coexist in the same patient. Differentiation between both origins can be
      difficult due to variable signs and symptoms which can be atypical.

      The first aim of this study was to elaborate and validate a treadmill walking test that would
      help discriminate between neurogenic claudication from vascular claudication. The second
      objective of this study is to determine if the treadmill walking test can discriminate spinal
      stenosis from low back pain with radiating pain in lower limb. 60 participants (20 with
      spinal stenosis, 20 with peripheral artery disease and 20 with non-specific low back pain)
      will be recruited. Participants will be invited to walk on a treadmill at a speed of 1,2 mph
      for a maximum of five minutes for both tasks (straight walking posture and inclined walking
      posture). Each walking task will be followed by a rest time of five minutes in sitting
      position. It is hypothesized that walking time difference for the occurrence of pain and for
      pain relief will be sensitive and specific to pathologies and help to discriminate lumbar
      spinal stenosis.
