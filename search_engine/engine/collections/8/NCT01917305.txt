      subjects. After three months of submerged healing, single-tooth crowns were randomly placed,
      either with (3.3mm platform, test) or without platform-switching (4mm platform, control).
      Patients were followed up at short intervals for monitoring of healing an oral hygiene.
      Statistical analysis for the influence of time and platform-type on bone levels employed the
      Brunner-Langer Model.
