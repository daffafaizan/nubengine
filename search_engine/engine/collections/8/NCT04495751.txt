    
      Primary Objective: To evaluate whether administration of MGE supplementation decreases PROMIS
      Fatigue score from baseline to 12 weeks compared to placebo.

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To evaluate whether administration of muscadine grape extract supplementation (4 tablets
           twice daily) causes changes in physical function (Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability
           [PAT-D], Short Physical Performance Battery), physical fitness (6-minute walk), physical
           activity (Minnesota Leisure Questionnaire), sedentary behavior (Sedentary Behavior
           Questionnaire) from baseline to 12 weeks compared to placebo.

        -  To compare changes in health related quality of life (PROMIS Global Health) at 12 weeks
           in participants randomized to muscadine grape extract group vs. placebo.

        -  To compare changes in the Fried frailty index at 12 weeks in participants randomized to
           muscadine grape extract vs. placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive muscadine grape extract orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days after the last dose of the
      study drug.
