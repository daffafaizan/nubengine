      intramuscular applied progesterone and topical progesterone on uterine electromyographic
      activity (EMG)in patients in preterm labor. Electrodes will be placed on the abdominal
      surface of pregnant patients in preterm labor and the EMG activity recorded for 30 minutes
      before and following treatments for up to 48 hours. In addition data on delivery times will
      be recorded when patients delivery vaginally or by Cesarian section. Eligibility criteria:
      Healthy patients without infection or rupture of membranes with gestational ages between 24
      to 34 weeks. Outcome measures: Comparisons of uterine EMG activity (EMG amplitude, frequency,
      and specific information on EMG bursts) from measurements before treatment to following
      treatments with progesterone preparations at various times (at 2,4,8, 12,24 and to 48 hours
      following treatment) and delivery times of patients on various treatments (hours or days
      following treatments, average delivery times in patients treated by various formulations).
      Comparisons of mean values in uterine EMG activity (EMG amplitude, burst frequency and
      frequency of signals in a burst, power spectrum analysis of the bursts and peak power density
      spectrum of bursts) from before treatment to following treatments at 2 to 24 hours will be
      compared. Also the time of delivery following treatments will be obtained and the average
      time of delivery following the various treatments compared.
