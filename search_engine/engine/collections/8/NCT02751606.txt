      forming an adequate treatment plan. Determining lymph node status, however, is a challenge.
      Ferumoxtran-10, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle has proven to be
      a valuable contrast agent for detecting lymph node metastases using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) in various types of cancer (also called nano-MRI). For small lymph node
      metastases (<5mm) the diagnostic accuracy of this technique does, however, drop
      substantially. Most of the studies that have been performed with these particles used a 1.5
      Tesla or 3 Tesla MRI scanner. The investigators would like to increase the resolution of
      nano-MRI by using a 7 Tesla scanner, such that the investigators can increase the sensitivity
      of this technique for small lymph nodes. With this study the investigators would like to
      validate the results of this technique with pathology in rectal and breast cancer. In these
      cancer types many patients undergo a surgical lymph node dissection by bulk excision of
      tissue including the nodes, enabling a node-to-node comparison between MRI and pathology to
      validate our nano-MRI results . If successful this technique would form a non-invasive
      alternative to the current lymph node staging techniques such as surgery. Additionally (if
      metastatic nodes are present), it could complement image guided focal therapies on lymph node
      metastases such as radiotherapy.
