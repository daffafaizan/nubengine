    
      The new diagnosed multiple myeloma patients are randomized to receive bortezomib by standard
      intravenous bolus (n=10) or subcutaneous injection (n=10) at the recommended dose and
      schedule (1.3 mg/m2), days 1, 4, 8, 11;eight 21-day cycles).

      Patients discontinued treatment due to progressive disease, insufficient efficacy,
      unacceptable toxicity, or serious protocol violation. Dose modifications are specified for
      unexpected pharmacokinetic observations or toxicity. Bortezomib-related neuropathic pain
      and/or peripheral sensory neuropathy were managed using established dose-modification
      guidelines.

      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis are collected on days 1 and 11,
      cycle 1:before bortezomib administration, and at 2, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min, and 2, 4, 6, 10,
      24, 32, 48, and 72 hours post-dosing. Pharmacodynamic analyses were performed using a
      whole-blood 20S proteasome specific activity inhibition assay.
