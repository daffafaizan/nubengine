    
      LANDMARK Trial is a prospective, randomized, multinational, multicentric, open-label
      non-inferiority trial of approximately 768 subjects (384:384, Myval THV Series vs.
      Contemporary Valves) with severe symptomatic native aortic valve stenosis via transfemoral
      approach.

        -  Device sizes applicable for the Myval THV Series: 20 mm, 21.5 mm, 23 mm, 24.5 mm, 26 mm,
           27.5 mm, and 29 mm diameter.

        -  Device sizes applicable for the Sapien 3 THV Series: 20 mm, 23 mm, 26 mm, and 29 mm
           diameter.

        -  Device sizes applicable for the Evolut THV Series: 23 mm, 26 mm, 29 mm, and 34 mm
           diameter.

      The randomization will be carried out with an allocation ratio of 1:1 between Myval THV
      Series vs. Contemporary Valves (Sapien THV Series and Evolut THV Series) (Stratification and
      equal allocation will be done for each valve within contemporary valves, i.e., 50% Sapien THV
      Series and 50% Evolut THV Series)
