      mortality. Given the significant medical need to develop treatments in children with PAH,
      further clinical studies in the pediatric population are therefore needed to provide more
      data for the management of PAH in children. Selexipag (JNJ-67896049) is an orally available,
      selective, and long-acting non-prostanoid agonist of the prostacyclin receptor approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of adult participants with PAH. Selexipag and its
      metabolite possess anti-fibrotic, anti-proliferative, and anti-thrombotic properties.
      Currently, no medicines targeting prostacyclin pathway are approved for pediatric use in PAH.
      An effective and orally available therapy acting on the prostacyclin receptor such as
      selexipag introduced at medically appropriate stage of PAH disease, and primarily in
      combination with current first-line oral PAH-specific medicines in participants in need of
      additional therapy because of insufficient disease control would represents a major advance
      to the therapeutic management of PAH pediatric participants. This study consists of a
      screening period of up to 6 weeks and a double-blind treatment period, including up-titration
      and maintenance periods, followed by a 3-year open-label extension period (OLEP) and a 30-day
      safety follow-up period that occurs after the last dose of study intervention (either
      double-blind or open-label). Safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy assessments will be
      performed during the study. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be
      established to monitor data on an ongoing basis, to review interim data, and to ensure the
      continuing safety of the participants enrolled in this study. The approximate duration of the
      study is 8.3 years.
