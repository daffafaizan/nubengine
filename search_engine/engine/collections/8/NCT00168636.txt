      uncertainty about the best dose of VAS, we examined whether the half dose compared with the
      full dose currently recommended by WHO gave an equally good protection against childhood
      morbidity and mortality. Mortality after supplementation was lower, though not significantly
      so, for children who had received the half dose. However, there was a highly significant
      inversion of the effect for boys and girls; while the low dose was clearly better for girls,
      the full dose might have been slightly better for boys. The girls' responses to the high
      versus the low dose of vitamin A might have depended on the last vaccine received before the
      OPV and VAS campaign.

      We believe that these findings call for confirmation. In connection with the OPV and VAS
      campaign in November 2004 in Guinea-Bissau, we intend to examined whether half the dose of
      the dose currently recommended by WHO as compared to the full dose has a more beneficial
      effect on mortality and morbidity in girls, and furthermore address the potential effect
      modification by the last vaccine received before the supplementation.
