    
      This is a prospective observational trial enrolling healthy postpartum women, ages 20 years
      and older with the intent to breast-feed from the UNC outpatient obstetrical clinics and the
      UVA outpatient obstetrical clinics. These women were studied at 3-5 visits in the year
      following their delivery to assess bone density, nutritional intake, exercise, and
      breast-feeding choices. The number of study visits depended on the timing of return of menses
      and interest in participating in the follow-up study (timepoints are: immediate postpartum, 3
      months postpartum, return of menses, 6 months after return of menses and follow-up visit 6
      months after final visit). Blood was taken for analysis of bone-related hormones, bone
      turnover and calcium homeostasis markers. The study focuses on women with extended lactation
      (at least 5 months of lactation) whereas women who cease lactation prior to 3 months will be
      the primary comparison group.
