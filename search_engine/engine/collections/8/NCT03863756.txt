      joints, the spine and / or the peripheral joints. It is characterized by a progressive and
      slow evolution over several years with a risk of ankylosis of the spine. It requires
      long-term follow-up of patients with repeated x-rays to assess structural damage. This
      repeated and cumulative exposure to radiation ionization puts at risk the radiosensitive
      organs that are in the field of irradiation.

      EOS is a new low dose X-ray system that significantly reduces X-ray doses compared to
      conventional radiography. This system allows the global assessment of the entire skeleton
      from head to toe, static spine and lower limbs with the obtaining of two-dimensional images
      of high quality with the possibility of a three-dimensional reconstruction. Although the
      benefits of the EOS system are promising with regard to radiation dose reduction, few studies
      have investigated its use in SpA and little evidence has supported its reliability in
      assessing the structural damage caused by the disease.
