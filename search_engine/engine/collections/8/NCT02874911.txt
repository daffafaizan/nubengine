      recently been shown that intensive coordinative training based on either physiotherapy or
      exergames (= whole-body controlled videogames; might improve degenerative ataxia, but its
      effectiveness is still disputed. This situation is even more complicated for degenerative
      ataxia subjects in advanced disease stages and with high multisystemic disease load. Here,
      underlying neurodegeneration has progressed to many irreversible states and includes many
      additional extra-cerebellar systems, making functional plasticity and therapeutic success
      much less likely. Moreover, intervention outcome assessment in subjects unable to walk freely
      is more delicate. Correspondingly, nonambulatory ataxia subjects in advanced disease stages
      are currently often excluded from treatment trials, thus leaving them without prospects of
      access to novel treatments.

      The investigators here hypothesized that exergame training might offer a novel treatment
      approach even in largely nonambulatory subjects with multisystemic degenerative
      spinocerebellar ataxia. Using a rater-blinded, intraindividual control study design, the
      investigators show that an individualized exergame training strategy, tailored to
      individuals' disease stage, improves postural control and ataxia-specific control functions
      even in advanced disease.
