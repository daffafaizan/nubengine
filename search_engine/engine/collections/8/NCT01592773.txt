      pediatric outpatients with autism, Asperger's Disorder, or PDD-NOS conducted at 106 study
      centers. Patients were eligible for this long-term extension study if they had:

        -  completed the open-label Study MEM MD 67,or

        -  completed the open-label Study MEM-MD-91, or

        -  completed the double-blind Study MEM-MD-68, or

        -  discontinued study MEM-MD-68 by meeting requirements for loss of therapeutic response

      The weight-based dose limits in this study were as follows:

      Group A: â‰¥ 60 kg; maximum 15 mg/day Group B: 40-59 kg; maximum 9 mg/day Group C: 20-39 kg;
      maximum 6 mg/day Group D: < 20 kg; maximum 3 mg/day

      The decision to close the study early was based on data from 2 double-blind
      placebo-controlled studies (MEM-MD-57A and MEM-MD-68) that failed to demonstrate a
      statistically significant difference between memantine and placebo in the primary efficacy
      parameter based on Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total raw score.
